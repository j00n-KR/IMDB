0,TheLittleSongbird,"So far, the best of the Harry Potter films!",9,16 July 2009,"I think people are forgetting that the book is a very complicated one to transcribe to screen, but the film, bearing in mind that it changed the overall structure of the book, missed some very dramatic scenes out, and characters like Rufus Scrimgeur and Rosmerta were left out entirely is definitely the best of the Harry Potter films. The climax was good, but compared to the book's climax, which was much more intense, I felt it could have had more action, and perhaps more explanation. Visually, it is a marvel to look at, especially with the Cave Scene with the dark brooding cinematography and the splendid special effects. But somehow Steve Kloves managed to not only make some genuine scares, namely when the arm of one of those grey creatures comes out the water and grabs Harry, (this made me jump violently) but there were some really funny bits. Like when a student is sick in front of Snape, Snape says ""you have just earned yourself a month's worth of detentions"", and Ron and Lavender's romance. My favourite has to be Harry and Ron's hilarious conversation about girls' skin, and when Dumbledore is seen holding a Woman's Own magazine! Not to mention, Luna's dress in one scene, what was she wearing? I am just wondering though, whether I was the only one who wept buckets at the end, sorry, seeing Harry crying over Dumbledore's body and everyone staring on helplessly, just started me off on an emotional drainage. Back to the film, the music was beautiful and very haunting as well as noticeably darker in tone to the scores by John Williams and Patrick Doyle, and there was some splendid looking scenery. The acting was excellent, Daniel Radcliffe is likable as Harry, Rupert Grint hilarious as Ron and Emma Watson giving her best performance as the character. Robbie Coltrane was good, but it is a shame he didn't get that much screen time. I never cared much for Michael Gambon as Dumbledore, Richard Harris was more my idea of the character, but Gambon like Watson gives his best performance (as the character that is). Alan Rickman and Maggie Smith were solid as rocks in their roles as Snape and McGonagall, and Tom Felton was remarkably good as Malfoy. Helena Bonham Carter was brilliant as Bellatrix, nobody could play her better. But for me, the scene stealer was Jim Broadbent as Slughorn, maybe not what Rowling intended in terms of figure, but the the performance is wonderfully electric. The direction was competent, overall, the film is no masterpiece, but it is the best of the series, so I thoroughly recommend it. 9/10 Bethany Cox",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
1,bkoganbing,It's Love Potions That Are Most In Demand,7,29 August 2011,"Harry Potter And The Half Blood Prince sets a couple of milestones in the film series. Harry and sidekicks Hermione and Ron are coming a bit late into puberty which is understandable considering all the adventures they've had. But they're now starting to see what the opposite sex is all about.Helping them along is an old colleague that Dumbledore has brought back to the Hogwarts one Professor Slughorn, a new character into the Potter saga played by Jim Broadbent. Slughorn (how I do love J.K. Rowling's use of Dickensian names in the Harry Potter series) is a master of potions and of course when you talk potions, it's love potions that are most in demand. But they do have only a short term effectiveness and at least one of the trio gets overdosed on it. And the cure almost kills as well.The Half Blood Prince also provides us with some insight into the life of the younger Lord Voldemort back when he was a Hogwarts student named Tom Riddle. Broadbent and he bonded back in the day and that's why Dumbledore wants him back.The Half Blood Prince keeps up the high standard of film making that the Harry Potter series is known for. It even got a nomination for Cinematography from the Academy. Broadbent is a nice addition to the Hogwarts stock company even if only for the two remaining films in the series. No sense telling you to see it, you probably have and enjoyed same.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
2,Leofwine_draca,Bad adaptation of a bad book,3,27 February 2011,"By now, my interest in the Harry Potter films is virtually nil, given the rather dull, uneventful, uninspiring nature of the last two entries (Alfonso Cuaron's PRISONER OF AZKABAN being a high point of the series for me). Sadly, when I saw journeyman director David Yates was back for this sixth outing, I expected the worse...and I got it. HALF-BLOOD PRINCE is another messy, pointless entry and a bad adaptation of a book that was already pretty poor in itself. This overlong outing is packed with superfluous stuff, trying to mix world-changing danger and events with typical teenage romance and laughs. The two elements never gel, and you have to wonder why we spend so long dwelling on Ron's romance with an infatuated student when his house has just been burned to the ground and his whole family put into peril.The film is full of plot holes (why didn't the bad guys blow up the Burrows at the beginning, with Harry and everyone else inside?) and suffers from real pacing problems. The beginning and middle sections are long and lifeless, and the book's dramatic climax (one of the few good points of it) is excised completely in favour of a rushed, unsatisfying conclusion. Along the way, the acting seems sketchy (Watson has long ago lost the charisma that made her Hermione so lovable, while Radcliffe seems desperate to do something elseonly Grint provides the old magic), the adult cast are once again bypassed (including Alan Rickman, still the best thing in the movies), the emphasis throughout is on grand but soulless special effects, and there are only one or two genuinely good moments – like the bit at the end with the zombies, even if they do look rather too much like Gollum. Perhaps the adaptation of the final book in the series might breathe some life into this stultifying franchise, but given that they've split it into two parts, I'm not entirely hopeful...",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
3,SnoopyStyle,Darker and Better,8,23 December 2013,"Darker than ever, Lord Voldemort has been revealed in the 'Order of the Phoenix'. The forces of darkness are gathering strength. Fear has spread throughout the wizard world. Harry Potter is now investigating Voldemort's plans through his old teacher Professor Horace Slughorn (Jim Broadbent).Director David Yates returns and will for the remainder of the series. It has a more serious tone. The teenage love drama is heating up especially for Hermione and Ron. It comes to a head in this one in a satisfying melodrama.The reveal of Voldemort's plan is a bit confusing. More effort is needed to explain what a Horcrux is. A scene with Voldemort creating one of the Hocrux would solve the problem. For the big death climax, the action is rather lacking. It needs more drama. I'm reminded of 'Empire Strikes Back'. In that movie, the big scene gets the most iconic treatment. Something like that is needed here. But it still works while following the book. That's probably more important.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
4,Horst_In_Translation,Who is the Half-Blood Prince?,6,19 February 2015,"Half-Blood Prince is the sixth out of eight Harry Potter movies. The tension rises and the final battle between Potter and he who must not be named moves closer. A central character is killed by another major character and you will have a great time if you watched and enjoyed the previous Potter films. Just like films 5, 7 and 8, this movie is directed by David Yates again and the screenplay, as usual, comes from Steve Kloves based on Rowling's novels. The film scored an Academy Award nomination for its cinematography, but lost as all other Potter Oscar nominations did, this time to ""Avatar"". ""Avatar"" is also one of the two films that were even more successful at the box office than Half-Blood Prince in 2009. The other would be a Transformers movie.This film is maybe the one which explores the most on the romantic relationships of the central characters. Ron has another girl than Hermione and the whole film pretty much includes references about these two and their banter. It's almost a bit too much. Ginny has another boyfriend and not Harry. Unfortunately, Harry cannot make the most of the situation and get together with the exceptional Luna Lovegood. Anyway, she is too good for him anyway. Meanwhile, Draco clearly has grown up and becomes a bully to Harry physically as well when he gives him quite a beating. The mysterious Severus Snape gets lots of screen time and an interesting storyline as he finally seems to have switched to the evil side. There's quite an irony that he is also the Defense against the Dark Arts teacher in this movie. The new teacher is played by Academy Award winner Jim Broadbent this time. It's basically the prospect of having the prodigious Potter as his student that gets Broadbent's character out of retirement back into teaching. However, I did not find him as memorable as Staunton's character for example. And Hermione is not too amused either as she is no longer the teacher's darling, but Potter is.Another crucial plot involves Slughorn's (Broadbent's) past with Tom Riddle. All in all, it's a worthy addition to the Potter franchise. Not my favorite film from the franchise, probably not even top3, but a decent work and I recommend watching it.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
5,claudio_carvalho,The Worst Harry Potter Film,5,20 November 2009,"Professor Albus Dumbledore (Michael Gambon) summons Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) in his vacation and they visit Professor Horace Slughorn (Jim Broadbent) to convince him to return from his retirement to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft to give Potions Classes. Dumbledore is teaching Harry Potter about Tom Riddle a.k.a. Voldemort, and he uses the memories of Slughorn to understand the evil Voldemort. Meanwhile, Harry Potter finds a book that belonged to a mysterious Half-Blood Prince that he uses in Slughorn's classes. Professor Severus Snape (Alan Rickman) protects the evil Draco Malfoy (Tom Felton) due to an oath while Draco releases the Death Eaters to bring chaos and destruction to the world.""Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"" is certainly the worst Harry Potter film. The boring story is supported by CGI only, with an uninteresting romance and other minor subplots. The grown-up Daniel Radcliffe is very weak for the lead role and will be certainly doomed to this character along his career. My vote is five.Title (Brazil): ""Harry Potter e o Enigma do Príncipe"" (""Harry Potter and the Enigma of the Prince"")",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
6,kosmasp,Love and other wars,8,21 September 2009,"If you don't know the book (like me), but watched the trailer before you watched the movie, you could be excused for feeling a bit cheated. The trailer actually promises something that doesn't really happen (real world). But try to free your mind of that. I was a bit confused, but it didn't really throw me off the movie.Of course, it goes without saying that you should watch the other Harry Potter movies before you watch this. While there is pretty light humor to be found here (and some love stories), it all gets spiced up, by some really dark undertones and some things that happen. I wouldn't say that Harry Potter is getting into an adult phase, but he definitely gets wiser with every movie. Which can't be said, for all his friends. But then again, some are there for comedic relieve, which is pretty obvious. And not a bad thing at all. The effects are great (not that you should have expected less) and the story moves along ""fast"" (the running time doesn't seem to be a problem or a drag). Of course some might say that he is still too childish (or the whole feeling is childish), but that would be beside the point. The movie does not hide what it's intentions are ...",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
7,gavin6942,A Return to Form,7,4 May 2011,"As Harry Potter begins his 6th year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, he discovers an old book marked mysteriously ""This book is the property of the Half-Blood Prince"" and begins to learn more about Lord Voldemort's dark past.After David Yates' last Harry Potter film (the worst in the series), the series gets back on track and Yates redeems himself. The story here is epic, with the old mystery I love. This puts a more human face on Draco Malfoy, too, which is a nice touch.I am sad that directors Guillermo del Toro and Terry Gilliam did not direct or that actress Naomi Watts did not make it in. Helena Bonham Carter proves herself, though, and while I am not a fan of hers, I have to admit she is a good actress and plays her part well.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
8,lee_eisenberg,one more step to go,8,28 July 2009,"Continuing the series' darker slant as it progresses, the current movie does a good job revealing more about the characters. The new character is Prof. Horace Slughorn (Jim Broadbent), who knows a secret about Tom Riddle, before the latter became Lord Voldemort.While the last movie allegorically focused on fascism (remember Dolores Umbridge?), I didn't see that in ""Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"". But certainly the Death Eaters look like the average anti-democratic entity. As for the characters, Harry (Daniel Radcliffe), Ron (Rupert Grint) and Hermione (Emma Watson) are all maturing, especially in terms of relationships.Having read the book, I could certainly see what they changed - namely the Death Eaters' rampage - although I think that David Yates has done a fine job adapting J.K. Rowling's novel to the screen. I look forward to the final movie.Also starring Michael Gambon, Alan Rickman, Maggie Smith, Julie Walters, Timothy Spall, Helena Bonham Carter, Robbie Coltrane, Tom Felton and Hero Fiennes-Tiffin.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
9,jboothmillard,Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,8,14 August 2009,"It is fair to say that these family films started lightly and went slowly darker and becoming a little scary for young children, but you can't imagine it being any other way, and this sixth film in the series is a good mixture of both feels. Basically Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) is still traumatised after the events in the Ministry of Magic, witnessing Bellatrix Lestrange (Helena Bonham Carter) killing godfather Sirius Snape, but with encouragement from Professor Albus Dumbledore (Sir Michael Gambon) he is determined to return to Hogwarts, returning with former professor Horace Slughorn (Jim Broadbent). Meanwhile the Death Eaters are causing havoc in the Muggle world destroying the Millennium Bridge, and in the wizard world destroying shops in Diagon Alley, and Professor Severus Snape (Alan Rickman) is with them, including Narcissa Malfoy (Helen McCrory), Draco's mother, making the Unbreakable Vow that he will see Draco (Tom Felton) protected and kill Dumbledore. Harry, with Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint) and Hermione Granger (Emma Watson) return to Hogwarts which is under tight security, Slughorn doing potions, and Snape doing Defence Against the Dark Arts, and taking one lesson of potions Harry finds a textbook for it which used to belong to the ""Half-Blood Prince"". Ron meanwhile has become successful as Gryffindor's Quidditch goalie, gaining a crush and possible girlfriend in Lavender Brown (Jessie Cave), it is possible that Hermoine may be jealous, despite not showing to Ron himself, while Harry is jealous Ginny Weasley (Bonnie Wright) is hanging around with Dean Thomas (Alfred Enoch). After surviving an attack from the Death Eaters and watching the Weasley family home burnt down, Harry is told be Dumbledore to stay close to Slughorn, he was brought back for a specific reason, he holds a memory that could be the key to why Lord Voldermort, or Tom Riddle, has immortality. Eventually after some time, and using a Luck potion he won Harry is able to extract the memory from Slughorn for the Pensieve stone basin to see the completed memory, Tom Riddle discovered immortality through the power of Horcruxes, devices to store parts of his soul. After Ron recovers from poisoning, having a love potion go away from his system, and speaking unknowingly speaking Hermoine's name in front Lavender, Harry has a quick fight with Malfoy who he has been suspecting of bad things. After getting out of this, and Snape healing Draco's injuries, he and Ginny hide the book he found so he can't be tempted to use it anymore, and they have a kiss, and next Dumbledore wants him to join him in a mission to find one of the seven Horcruxes. One has already been destroyed, Tom Riddle's diary, and in the seaside cliff cave Dumbledore tells Harry to obey his orders to make him drink a mind-altering and deadly liquid to leave a small pendant, and they get away after a near attack from the creatures in the cave. When they return to Hogwarts, Harry goes to get Snape for help, but then Malfoy comes to fulfil his mission to kill the Professor, but he is weak, and Snape turns up and casts the Killing Spell pushing Dumbledore off the tower and making him fall to his death, with Harry watching and unable to help. The end of the film sees all the students and teachers of Hogwarts gathering around to mourn the death of the Heammaster, the Horcrux pendant is revealed to be fake, and Harry, Ron and Hermoine are bound with each other to find the real ones and destroy them to kill Voldermort once and for all. Also starring Geraldine Somerville as Lily Potter, Julie Walters as Molly Weasley, Timothy Spall as Wormtail, Oliver Phelps as George Weasley, James Phelps as Fred Weasley, Evanna Lynch as Luna Lovegood, Jamie Waylett as Vincent Crabbe, Josh Herdman as Gregory Goyle, Robbie Coltrane as Rubeus Hagrid, Warwick Davis as Professor Filius Flitwick, David Bradley as Argus Filch, Matthew Lewis as Neville Longbottom, David Thewlis as Remus Lupin, Mark Williams as Arthur Weasley, Gemma Jones as Madam Pomfrey, Katie Leung as Cho Chang and Ben Shephard as Diagon Alley Father. The acting is still on top form from all the cast, the story is easy enough to follow and understand, just don't expect to see Voldermort and only mentioned, and of course the magic created by the brilliant special effects and make up are great viewing, a terrific fantasy adventure. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Cinematography, it was nominated the BAFTAs for Best Production Design and Best Special Visual Effects. Harry Potter was number 45 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons, but he was also number 35 on The 100 Worst Britons (the only fictional person, why?).

10,Quinoa1984,"a summer blockbuster with comedy, horror, dread, romance... just not in a varied order",7,15 July 2009,"I confess, I'm still one of those who hasn't read the Harry Potter series. My exposure is simply that I've seen the movies, with the exceptions of Azkaban and Goblet, only once a piece (and for those two only in little pieces on TV), and that I enjoy them, more or less, as pieces of big, bright, horror-and-magic filled spectacles with more British actors than can possibly be cast. Yet from what I've heard book six in the series, the Half-Blood Prince, is more than just a transitional book on the way to the conclusion in book seven: it's a book filled with insidious dread and psychological mind-games and depth that can be comparable to the best in mature literature as opposed to just simple 'kiddie' fare, and even features some moments of extreme violence and horror that, according to one close source, could have potentially given the film adaptation an R rating.Turns out this last part is most certainly not the case. Aside from Harry Potter being one of the biggest cash-cows Warner brothers has ever had, and that David Yates, the now capable helmer of the series here on out, is more of a slight visualizer of wondrous lighting and effects and scenery, doesn't have the imagination of say, for example, original director Guillermo del-Toro, it's just not a great adaptation. I can't speak for people (i.e. my own wife, some critics, my goldfish) who read the book and see the movie and come out with mixed reactions - VERY mixed reactions - but as a movie, in and of itself, it's just... good. It's an entertaining story but not one that is always tonally set in sync.Take, for example, all of those teenage-romance scenes, specifically that plot with Rupert Grint and the love potion that makes him a love magnet with another girl which creates a drama around Hermony (sic) who really pines for him. This isn't treated so bad that it would make me want to curl up in a fetus position from its cringe-worthiness, and it is indeed funny in some of its awkward teenage-romance dimensions. But it's meant for its 'target' audience in this case of the movie, of teenagers who have grown up with Harry Potter and are now moving along with the flow of high school times and raging hormones. I felt it kind of weird that there is supposed to be all of this heavy drama bubbling underneath, with the character Malfoy and what he may or may not be up to with Snape and his co-horts, and we're put into this other plot that, frankly, isn't very interesting after a while.Oh, sure, the movie has some real delights. Jim Broadbent, for one thing, gives a well calibrated, charming but subtle performance as the new professor at Hogwarts (nowhere near the amazement of Stauton in Order of the Phoenix, but what can you do). And are one or two scenes where we feel both the joy and the dread of what's happening at the school succinctly and with that feel that comes more from literature than cinema. But Yates also allows for some slack pacing, and by the time it comes to that last half-hour, it's just a total plunge into dark territory. It is a powerful climax, though there's a lack of real ""oomph"" with the reveal of who the half-blood prince really is. Or, for that matter, a real significance around the book itself that Harry carries around with him. When the reveal comes, and even for that matter the *big* tragedy that comes near the end, it's nowhere near as moving as it should be, not with the kind of BOOM that one might expect a series that is, perhaps, trying to be a Star Wars for its time.Perhaps a final title card should have been put at the end of this movie, much like Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai, saying ""find out the thrilling conclusion, and much-MUCH more, in Deathly Hallows!"" But then again, where's the class in that? Or in simple love-potion plot lines, for that matter? Half-Blood Prince ultimately makes for a fun night out, but not something you may feel the need to rush out and see many times over, unless you're gaga for the cinematography (which can be breathtaking such as in the cavern Dumbledore takes Harry to), or are such a Potter nut that this review is moot to start with and you may even be a wizard yourself... Poof.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
11,sunwarrior13,One Of The Best Harry Potter Films,10,22 October 2012,"Adolescent wizard-in-training Harry Potter returns to Hogwarts for another year of schooling and learns more about the dark past of the boy who grew up to become Lord Voldemort in this, the sixth installment of the film series that originated from the writings of author J.K. Rowling entitled,Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince.This fantasy film is the sixth installment in the Harry Potter film series, written by Steve Kloves and produced by David Heyman and David Barron.The film stars Daniel Radcliffe as Harry Potter, alongside Rupert Grint and Emma Watson as Harry's best friends Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger respectively. The story follows Harry Potter's sixth year at Hogwarts as he becomes obsessed with a mysterious textbook, falls in love, and attempts to retrieve a memory that holds the key to Lord Voldemort's downfall. There was a time when Hogwarts was thought of as a safe haven, but thanks to Voldemort's tightening grip on both the Muggle and wizard worlds, that simply isn't the case anymore. Suspecting that the castle may even harbor an outright threat, Harry finds his investigation into the matter sidelined by Dumbledore's attempts to prepare him for the monumental battle looming ever closer on the horizon. In order to discover the key to Voldemort's defenses, Dumbledore enlists the aid of resourceful yet unsuspecting bon vivant Professor Horace Slughorn, who may have a clue as to their enemy's Achilles' heel. Meanwhile, teenage hormones cause the students at Hogwarts to lose focus on their true mission. As Harry and Dean Thomas clash for the affections of the lovely Ginny, Romilda Vane attempts to woo Ron away from Lavender Brown with some particularly tasty chocolates. Even Hermione isn't immune from the love bug, though she tries her hardest to suppress her growing jealousy and keep her emotions bottled up. But there is one student who remains completely aloof from the romance blossoming all around, and he intends to leave a dark impression on his classmates. With tragedy looming ever closer, it begins to appear as if peace will prove elusive in Hogwarts for some time to come. Dark, thrilling, and occasionally quite funny, Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince is also visually stunning and emotionally satisfying.Director David Yates presides over some gorgeous CGI set pieces, but all the real magic comes from the scrum of ace British character actors.I think it's one of the best of the series, fairly easily, and a testament to why occasionally throwing a massive budget at an endeavor of this scope can be considered a reasonable decision.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
12,studioAT,My favourite Potter film,7,4 July 2010,"This film is a marked improvement on the last one and is actually one of my favourite of the film saga. At it's centre is the relationship between the three main characters and seeing as the chemistry between Radcliffe, Grint and Watson is so strong it makes for a lovely film.However despite it's long running time The Half Blood Prince element feels rushed and the Harry and Ginny relationship forced. Even the wonderful ending of the original book is underplayed.Yates manages to bring a lightness of touch to quite a dark installment but stays true to what will come in the future films. I didn't initially like this film but now, seeing it as part of the overall saga am convinced it is one of the strongest.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince

14,hitchcockthelegend,Hormones over excitement as part six is merely an appetiser to the double billed closure to come.,6,19 September 2010,"Death Eaters are running amok as Dumbledore has an important task for Harry and Voldermort has one for Draco; all set to the backdrop of raging adolescent hormones. While Harry also acquires a rather helpful book written by the mysterious Half-Blood Prince.Potter 6 is not as dark as the pre-release chattings suggested it would be. Yes there's the usual dark moments, including a shattering turn of events that sets it up nicely for the finale, but this instalment is mostly fun, gentle and even sexy. Harry, Ron & Hermione are more under threat from their own adolescent urges than they are from the swirl of a Death Eater or the appearance of one young & creepy Tom Riddle. This of course makes for good viewing to most of us who have grown with the characters, with the principal young actors having nicely grown into said characters. But can it sustain a two and half hour running time? No it can't is the ass numbingly honest answer. There's some quality set-pieces including Quiddich (for a change) and a swamp attack by the Death Eaters, but by and large it's talky and breezy in equal measure.A filler Potter movie then, one that is far breezier than expected. Good but not great, but as a set up for the epic conclusion it hits all the right buttons. 6/10",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
15,Doylenf,"Dumbledore: ""We're dealing with very dark stuff here...""",6,20 July 2009,"And that quote very neatly sums up the entire movie, HARRY POTTER AND THE HALF-BLOOD PRINCE. And it's not the boy Wizard and his friends who carry the film on their shoulders. It's three great British actors who do more with their roles than the script ever manages to suggest: namely--JIM BROADBENT, with his hilarious quizzical expression as Professor Slughorn, ALAN RICKMAN as Snapes, seething with intensity no matter how trite his lines are, and MICHAEL GAMBON as Dumbledore, urging Harry to fight the evil forces engulfing Hogwarts.On a much more superficial level, we have the three young stars giving their usual bland performances as students dealing with raging hormones as well as wizardry--DANIEL RADCLIFFE in his most colorless Potter role to date, EMMA WATSON and RUPERT GRINT. They do furnish the only lighter moments in a film dedicated to the dark side, complete with low-key lighting for all the interior shots and murky skies full of Death Eaters and such.Technically, all the usual care has gone into creating the dark fantasy world of J.K. Rowling and the background score by Nicholas Hooper adds dimension to the film's many dark moods and action moments.My impression was that very little seemed to be happening in the way of story development for the first hour-and-a-half with attention drawn more to the love potion moods of the youngsters distracted from their studies by puppy love. RUPERT GRINT, in particular, had some very amusing moments in this vein.But the overall feeling is that this is simply going over ground already covered in previous Potter outings without any really significant new developments or feats of wizardry we expect in these sort of stories. Not having read the book, I can only say that there was a certain lack of focus on story ingredients that made me think I was missing something.Nor was it helpful that Radcliffe, Grint and Watson did not have the clear enunciation of the above-mentioned trio of British gentlemen who really carried the film. Their diction was impeccable compared to the young stars who made their lines indistinct at times.For Potter fans, I'd rate it watchable but not compelling enough to merit such huge box-office grosses.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
16,dbborroughs,Too much talk and not enough action makes for the weakest of the Potter films. Its all set up for the final battle and best seen on cable TV,4,3 August 2009,"I'm rapid becoming less of a fan of the HArry Potter series. The first film was the book on screen much to the detriment of the film. The second one improved on the first but could have used some chopping. The third film is one of the best fantasies ever put on screen. The fourth film suffers because it too compressed the book. While the last one collapsed into nonsense.Which brings us to the current film. Mostly concerned with setting up the sides for the coming final battle as well as filling in the back story of Tom Riddle aka Lord Valdemort aka the most over rated villain in film history, this film is a great deal of talk and very little action. Possibly the best looking of the Potter films, its filled with a dark brooding atmosphere that ultimately amounts to very little. Sure we get the sides lined up and sure we get told a lot of things, but thats the point we're told things. We're shown past events about what happened long ago, but it seemed to me that not much happened here with the majority of the action coming from Quiddich games. Before an hour had passed I was nodding off, struggling to stay awake as words and very serious looks overwhelmed any sort of real forward plot motion. I'm told that a great deal has been cut from the book and to be perfectly honest I can believe it since so many people seem to be milling around for no real reason and conversations seem to be about things we don't know or didn't see. While I haven't read the entire book I did read most of the second half when it first came out and what I remember if the book played out so much better in the book then the film.I wanted to hang up and walk out on the film but I stayed to the bitter end because I want to see how the film sets the board for the endgame. Frankly I should have waited for cable TV.Probably the least of all the films.I'd wait until its not 12 bucks a ahead to see it.(It doesn't help that I'm constantly pondering why Valdemort is so scary when he's barely in any of the films and the fact that the more we see him the less scary he is, especially when we have to see the unscary people how are following him. They look like rejects from the evil side kicks union. As for Valedmort himself what has he really done in any of the films thats so terrible as to warrant fear? Other than manifest himself there has been nothing, which is why the longer the over all story goes on the less scary he is since he seems more and more impotent)",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
17,neil-476,Lots of not very much happens in drab colours,8,22 July 2009,"This movie was, I think, one for those who are in for the long haul. As a stand-alone movie it would make little sense to anyone not familiar with the story so far. It does not move the main narrative on very much. In fact, its two and a half hours are devoted to three things - one, developing the increasing romantic interactions among the teenage principals, two, setting up the mechanism which carries the bulk of the final book ie. Voldemort's potential downfall, and three, its shock denouement.Some might say that this isn't really good enough.I saw it in a crowded cinema, and the audience was attentive all the way through and responded the right way in all the right places, so they were clearly the audience at which it is aimed.And so am I. I enjoyed the relationships finally falling into place and, despite the fact that Jim Broadbent's Horace Slughorn was essentially a red herring, he was still a diverting and entertaining red herring. For a film which amounted to little more than treading water before the serious business of bringing the saga to a close begins, it kept me - and others - perfectly happy.But why was the colour desaturated all the way through? Most of the movie is in sepia, blues and greys. Some orange, yellow and green would have been nice.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
18,evanston_dad,"""Half-Blood Prince"" Is a Half-Assed Movie",6,19 October 2010,"I've enjoyed watching the Harry Potter films (I've not read the books), but this is the first one that began to try my patience.""Half-Blood Prince"" doesn't make sense if you've not read the book it's based on, a crime for which I cannot forgive movie adaptations. The first half of the film deals with the adolescent romances of the Hogwarts students, treated as an aside by the entire film series but somewhat of a welcome relief from the dark brooding of Harry and his battle with Voldemort. However, the last half of the film lurches into action and seems completely disconnected with everything that came before it. By the time Dumbledore and Harry were off to find another piece of Voldemort's soul, I was lost and didn't much care about being found.Grade: B-",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
19,anaconda-40658,Half-Wit Prince.,6,21 July 2015,"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (2009): Dir: David Yates / Cast: Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, Rupert Grint, Michael Gambon, Jim Broadbent: Sixth installment regards the straddling of good and evil as wizard Dumbledore sets forth preparing Harry for his future showdown with the evil lord Voldemont. Directed by David Yates who returns after directing the impressive Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix. Some viewers may not care for the cliffhanger ending but special effects are inventive and imaginative as expected. Daniel Radcliffe as Harry is being schooled for an independent showdown with evil. Rupert Grint as Ron and Emma Watson as Hermione battle emotional feelings although their romantic subplot seems flimsy and unfocused here particularly when a love potion comes into play. Michael Gambon returns as the wise wizard Dumbledore who prepares Harry for the showdown that has been nearing ever closer. Jim Broadbent makes a nifty introduction as a new recruit sought after by Dumbledore. It may disappoint some viewers that one major character will be dismissed through tragedy and it may seem too cliché for those not familiar with the J.K. Rowling books. At any rate this is still pointless fun but not for young children. Parental discernment advised before children view any of these films otherwise Potter fans will get lost in its glorious images.

20,HotToastyRag,"Very dark, but very good",8,17 June 2019,"It's a wonderful experience to grow up alongside the child actors of the films, and even though I know I still would have enjoyed them had I been born earlier or later, I'm always glad I was the perfect age to watch each movie when it came out in the theaters. It was always a Thanksgiving tradition in my family, preceded by a month or two of my dad reading the corresponding book aloud to us, no matter how old we grew. So, even though this volume is quite violent, and there are a couple of scenes during which I have to look away, there's still a lot to love about the very dark sixth film.It's almost impossible to praise Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince because of the ending, but if you turned it off five minutes early, or were forced to write a review without giving away spoilers, you'd find there's quite a bit of quality to the sixth installment of the beloved series.Tom Felton is the star of this movie. Yes, Daniel Radcliffe is still the title character, but as far as acting demands and emotional character growth, Tom truly shines. We've seen him grow up rather spoiled and immature, and at the start of this movie, he's tasked with something dangerous and upsetting. Throughout the rest of the movie, he's enormously conflicted about whether or not to go through with it. J.K. Rowling never really wrote about peer pressure in the earlier books, so if that's a pet issue of yours, this volume might be your favorite. There are some truly heartbreaking scenes as we see a character we were trained to dislike break down in tears and admit he's frightened. Younger kids probably won't understand what's going on, but I hope they were put to bed early and told to wait a few years before joining you for movie night.In addition to Tom Felton's solid and unexpected performance, audiences are treated with Jim Broadbent as the ""guest teacher"" of the year. His character is layered and interesting, and he treats his scenes with care. Michael Gambon is also put to good use and given some meaty, upsetting scenes to deliver. They're very tough to watch, and I can only imagine how much more upsetting they would have been if the frail Richard Harris had made it this far into the franchise. Trust me, you're going to need to put the kids to bed early; no one wants to see Dumbledore screaming and crying.Helena Bonham Carter returns and has a pretty prominent part in this movie, and while she does play her role as wild and as crazy as was written in the book, she adds a layer of seduction that feels out of place and uncomfortable both for young audience members and the young actors. There's no reason for her to press herself against Tom Felton's back and whisper her lines with a gaping mouth, unless she thought the teenage boys in the audience would get a thrill out of it. I recently watched these movies with my young nieces, and the older one grimaced as she asked, ""Why is she flirting with Malfoy?"" The younger one just rolled her eyes and answered, ""She's weird."" The older one might have been feeling a little protective, as she was at the age when she started noticing which of the cast members she found attractive; throughout the movie she found several compliments for Tom Felton, which was very cute.With beautiful scenery and stunning special effects, it's easy to get completely wrapped up in this movie and forget that it started out as a children's franchise. There's violence and drama galore, as well as romantic heartbreak and interesting flashbacks that show how the villain came to be a villain. Unlike the previous movie, there's hardly any comic relief, but those few scenes are very precious. Daniel Radcliffe gets to show off his comic timing after taking a good luck potion, Rupert Grint accidentally eats a love potion disguised in a box of chocolates, and Emma Watson tries to dodge her date by eating odorous food. This is a very good movie, but it's just tough to watch over and over again.Kiddy Warning: Obviously, you have control over your own children. However, this one's pretty violent and upsetting for kids, so I'd wait until my kids were pre-teens or older before letting them watch it.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
21,DICK STEEL,A Nutshell Review: Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,10,18 July 2009,"Love is in the air. While the muggle world and the world of magic are under siege from the forces of evil, I guess there's always time for our growing teenagers to be frustrated more by the affairs of the heart, rather than be troubled with whether the fate of the world is within your control to steer from collapse, unless of course you're Harry Potter, the Chosen One.The sixth movie and installment of the lucrative J. K. Rowling brainchild, I initially had my reservations about the last film being split into two just because it directly translates, going by the immense box office response, into billions, but the story has now matured immensely into something darker and more sinister. Gone are the more innocent childhood days of matriculation into Hogwarts, looking forward to school to learn new skills and somehow being caught up with the looming of Voldermort's resurrection of sorts, but now as seniors, that premise becomes closer and all the more life threatening as events in the last few films had demonstrated.The film leapt directly into the thick of things, so for those like me who are not too familiar with the books, then you may find yourself lost from the start. But I guess that'll leave you engaged up front in guessing, being part of the tension building and fun, so fret not, as everything will be unravelled in good time thanks to the excellent narrative presentation by director David Yates, and of course, the strength of J.K. Rowling's source material. As with the past films, a little bit about Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) and the earlier generation of magicians get slowly peeled away as the film progressed, and continues to bait you hook line and sinker as you immerse yourself thoroughly in wanting to find out more.As already mentioned, since the first Harry Potter movie we've literally accompanied our child wizards from their younger days, through to puberty and now into teenagers with raging hormones, and this particular installment had a good bulk of it dealing with boy-girl relationship pangs, with love triangles such as the Ron Weasley-Hermione Granger-Lavender Brown (Rupert Grint, Emma Watson and Jessie Cave respectively), or a developing one between Harry and Ron's sister Ginny (Bonnie Wright). Needless to say there are countless of other supporting characters all eager to snag a date with some of the characters mentioned, or have desires to do so through love potions even! It's a whole range of emotions on display here, where infatuations, unrequited love, betrayal, envy and jealousy all rolled in at certain points, and truly the actors here deserve full credit for their very matured performances, especially in a heartbreaking one where Harry and Hermione find themselves in the same boat, and then realizing that affairs of the heart aren't always that easy to learn nor to master like their classroom lessons and practical tests.On the larger scale of things, we see less cutesy elements that were the hallmark of the first few films, as this episode sets the gears of Voldermort's sinister plan into motion. Everything in this film is draped in perpetual black or darkened greys, with less than a handful of daylight scenes in it. Besides dabbling with various romances, there's this sense of urgency raging throughout the pacey narrative, which has tension, action, romance, adventure and comedy effectively fused to entertain an audience.New characters get introduced such as new Potions Professor Horace Slughorn (Jim Broadbent) who has a hidden and mysterious link to the young Voldermort, and so do the old ones like the various school going children, and villains from fellow peer Draco Malfoy (Tom Felton) who's planning something as instructed for the dark lord, to the Death Eaters like Fenir Greyback (Dave Legeno) and Bellatrix Lestrange (Helena Bonham Carter) whom Harry has a personal vendetta against. Events such as Quiddich too return to the big screen after a long awaited hiatus, although this time round it was certainly a Ron Weasley show.The special effects again prove to be a wow-factor. Some set action sequences were crafted independently from the book to provide a more menacing edge to the story and to allow the characters to engage in more magical fights, but also served to up the excitement when it mattered. For the last hour it became more like a Harry Potter and Dumbledore (Michael Gambon) partnership as they embark on a quest which resembled very much like Dragonball's, so much so that his best friends Ron and Hermione get sidelined and parked aside for quite a fair bit (the former didn't even have a speaking line at the ending scene of the film even!) but again Dumbledore demonstrated his prowess, just like he did in The Order of the Phoenix, and the visuals were nothing less than stellar and so beautiful to look at - an impressive rage of an all-round fire which also nodded in the direction of The Ten Commandments, rumoured to have taken about 8 months to render.Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince joins Star Trek as my choice of bona-fide blockbusters this Summer season. If anyone had doubted whether David Yates is the right choice for helming the franchise until its two-parter movies adapted from the final book, then his second foray here would leave you quite impressed. I'm already stoked about the things to come, so much so that, haven't not read the books proper, I had went to spoil myself silly. And yes, with so much happening in time to come, from where this film ended and trailed off, 2 films would hopefully do justice to the seeds of development already sown here.Bring them on!",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
22,siderite,Good movie from the most annoying of the Potter books,8,18 October 2009,"I always had something about the passivity that was glorified in the Harry Potter books. The boy would have his heart and courage and goodness, but at every single important point of his life, the outcome would be determined by others or by pure luck. This before last part of the Harry Potter story is the most annoying of all for this very reason. At no point in this part did Harry Potter do anything of consequence, all his choices were bad, if any, and in the end the story is left hanging in expectation of the grand finale of the series.The film itself was well done, for once. No useless special effects, just the bare minimum to convey the story. The plot was a bit rushed, as it is difficult to both remind people what the story was in the previous movies and also capture an entire book in so little time. The first part they didn't even try, so if you don't remember the previous books/movies, you'd better read/watch them again before watching this one. The second part, the capturing of the book in the plot, is almost successful, but the story moves from scene to scene at such great speed that it is difficult to emotionally relate to it.Bottom line: if you are a Potter fan, you probably have waited a long time to see this movie. However, my advice is to wait until the last movie is released and watch both of them one after the other.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
23,JamesHitchcock,The Series is Back on Track,7,14 August 2009,"Perhaps I should begin by pointing out that, unlike many reviewers, I have not read J. K. Rowling's original novel. I am, therefore, unable to comment on assertions that the film is not true to the spirit of the book or that it omits many of its best episodes.""Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"" is the sixth film in the Harry Potter film series. It is directed by David Yates, who also made the fifth film, Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix. I must admit that I was disappointed with ""Order of the Phoenix"", which I found dull and the weakest of the series so far, confirming my suspicions that the series was declining from its early excellence.""Half-Blood Prince"" gets off to a good start with that exhilarating sequence depicting the destruction of the Millennium Bridge by the Death Eaters, the followers of Lord Voldemort. Much of the early part of the film, however, is disappointing. Too much time is taken up with tedious details of teenage romances featuring Harry, Ron, Hermione and their friends. It began to seem less like a Harry Potter film than like some dreary high school rom-com. And then, about halfway through, the film began to improve. As with most of the Potter films the plot is a complicated one, dealing with the efforts of Harry and his headmaster Dumbledore to thwart the evil machinations of Voldemort and his accomplices. This one revolves around the efforts of the Death Eaters to assassinate Dumbledore and the attempts of Harry and Dumbledore to track down and destroy the ""horcruxes"", magical artifacts in which Voldemort has hidden parts of his soul in the hope of making himself immortal.Despite all those teenage crushes, the Harry/Dumbledore relationship is the most important one in the series, a type of relationship with many literary and mythological parallels, the one between the wise old mentor and his eager young protégé. This relationship becomes all the more important in this film; in earlier films other characters, notably Ron and Hermione, played their part in combating the forces of evil, but here Harry and Dumbledore largely work alone. Michael Gambon has succeeded brilliantly in that very difficult task, taking on a character originally created by another actor. (Despite the best efforts of Roger Moore, Pierce Brosnan and Daniel Craig, most James Bond aficionados still insist that no-one can compare with Sean Connery). Here, however, Gambon has made the role so much his own that one almost forgets that his fellow-Irishman Richard Harris played the part in the first two films (although Harris was in fact very good). This is certainly Gambon's best and most affecting performance in the role, an old man, and conscious of his declining powers, but still determined to continue the fight against evil and to pass the torch to the younger generation.Of the other parts Alan Rickman was again excellent as the strange, mournful, morally ambiguous figure of Professor Severus Snape, although there is a development at the end which may resolve the question of which side Snape is really on. (Although, again, it may not). I also liked Jim Broadbent as Horace Slughorn, the comical new Potions Master and Helena Bonham Carter as the evil Bellatrix Lestrange. It is strange how Bonham Carter's screen image has changed so completely; up until about 1997, the year of ""Keep the Aspidistra Flying"" and ""Wings of the Dove"" she was regarded as the cinema's Official English Rose, most at home in period dramas. (Keira Knightley now seems to have taken over that position). More recently, however, she seems to have become associated with all things strange, supernatural and Gothic, as in the Potter films and also the likes of ""Big Fish"" and ""Sweeney Todd"". I blame that Tim Burton.As regards the younger generation, the standard trinity of Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson are all very reliable, although that it is noticeable that they, and some of the other young actors, are now starting to look older than the characters they portray, (This is particularly so in the case of Tom Felton as Draco Malfoy). The reason seems to be that it was originally intended to produce one film every year, with the characters ageing along with the actors who play them. This schedule, however, which envisaged seven films all being completed by 2007, proved too ambitious, and two years after that date only six have been made, with the seventh novel ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows"" scheduled to be adapted as two separate films.It has become a commonplace to say that the Potter films, like the novels on which they are based, become progressively ""darker"". This is normally a figure of speech to mean that they are getting more serious in theme, but in the case of ""Half-Blood Prince"" the word ""dark"" can be used in a perfectly literal sense. Yates clearly designed the look of the film to correspond to its serious theme; it is sombre in tone with a palette dominated by dull colours- black, white, grey and brown with dark blues and greens. Many scenes take place against a backdrop of snow, rain or mist. Bright colours and sunshine are (unlike some of the earlier episodes) largely absent.After ""Order of the Phoenix"" I felt that the series was losing its way. Having seen ""Half-Blood Prince"" it now seems to be back on track. I look forward with interest to the two episodes of ""Deathly Hallows"". 7/10",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
24,Smells_Like_Cheese,The Half-Blood Prince,7,25 July 2009,"Ah, the sixth installment into the Harry Potter franchise, the Harry Potter series has sort of become the new contender for the biggest geek following since Star Wars, although Lord of the Rings is pretty darn close as well, lol. But honestly, even though I haven't read the books, I do enjoy the movies, they're pretty fun. So when I saw the trailer for The Half Blood Prince, I was really excited because this looked so much more darker than the previous movies. As we grow up, so does Harry, he's going through major changes in his life and most of his readers/audience are experiencing similar things with him when it comes to love and confusion on what their lives are about. But is the series getting a little too dark? It seemed like this was the story that focused more on the romance of the students vs. the magic and the dark world they are facing. Speaking of which, there is blood in this movie, not to mention some pretty frightening moments that may have made this Harry Potter movie a bit more hard to accept.Ron scans the obituary pages of the Daily Prophet, looking for familiar names. Dumbledore is absent from Hogwarts for long stretches of time, and the Order of the Phoenix has already suffered losses. As in all wars, life goes on. Sixth-year students learn to Apparate - and lose a few eyebrows in the process. The Weasley twins expand their business. As the magical hormone crazed teenagers flirt and fight and fall in love. Classes are never straightforward, though Harry receives some extraordinary help from the mysterious Half-Blood Prince. So it's the home front that takes center stage in the multi layered sixth installment of the story of Harry Potter. Here at Hogwarts, Harry will search for the full and complex story of the boy who became Lord Voldemort - and thereby find what may be his only vulnerability.I would say that over all The Half Blood Prince is worth the watch in the theater, since the effects are always incredible, to say the least with what's been released this year in theater, Harry Potter was a fresh breath of air. The effects, the acting, the direction, everything like that was perfectly fine, but for some odd reason, this Harry Potter seemed a little off. I think the reason being is that this was more talk vs. action. The more boring side of Potter if you will without sounding too harsh. I think it's also a little weird to accept these young actors growing up and it seems like they are doing it right before our eyes. But it's all part of life; from what I hear this was a disappointment if you read the book, which I'm sure you've already seen this movie if you read the book, but I was still pretty disappointed over all. I think it could've been a little bit better, but I'm sure the last two sequels will be the best seeing how they are saved for the last.7/10",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
25,Rainey-Dawn,Felt Like Harry Potter Again,9,24 May 2020,"This one felt more like one of the first Harry Potter films but much darker to me.
We have plentiful of classroom scenes going on in between all the action and adventure. There is a surprise twist ending.Who is the half-blooded prince? What does he have to do with Harry Potter? What is the surprise in the end? You'll have to watch to find out - I don't like giving away details of good movie.9.5/10",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
26,KineticSeoul,"Decent adaptation, but missing just too much. People who hasn't read the book might like it more",7,20 July 2011,"This is a very well made condensed adaptation of the book. It seems they know how to make the adaptation better with each installment. Sure it's missing few good parts from the book, but overall it's a job well done. But still audiences that haven't read the novel will probably impressed by this movie, but it is still missing some key parts from the book. I also found it odd how it cut some good action parts from the book while adding stuff in that isn't in the book. I have said this before, but since this is a real build up for the plot for the last movie. It should have had more input with the actual book because of this and cause of other aspects as well. But overall this is a well made movie and a movie those that didn't read the book will probably enjoy. It's just very well directed but could have been better if certain aspects of the book was added in as well. I also liked how the characters almost seemed fully developed and overall I can see why so many people enjoyed this movie.7.6/10",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
27,OllieSuave-007,Darkness comes full force.,8,9 July 2014,"Based on the book Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, this is the sixth film in the Harry Potter film trilogy, a story where Harry beings his sixth year at Hogswarts and finds a book belonging to the Half Blood Prince. The book helps Harry excel in his potions class and, while learning new dangerous tricks, he takes private lessons with Professor Dumbledore to dig into Lord Voldemort's past and attempt to discover his weakness. From the heals of the previous two films, this story continues the darker tone and tense drama, albeit more, as we see Lord Voldemort and his Death Eaters cohorts wreck havoc in the Muggles and Wizards worlds. This gives the plot suspenseful excitement as we see the once prosperous, spirited and fun-filled Hogswarts fall victim to the powerful dark magic of Voldemort. Viewers will be intrigued to see how Harry and Professor Dumbledore will take on the evilness and see who is revealed as the Half-Blood Prince. I think most of actors did a believable and realistic performance. The special effects were pretty good and scenes showing Dumbledore's powers were choreographed and executed well. The plot flows at a very steady pace at times, dragged on a little by the Ron and Lavender relationship scenes. But, for the most part, this movie is one of the more suspenseful Potter films and brings the good vs. evil element to full force.Grade B",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
28,thesar-2,Do We Half to Watch This?,2,3 March 2013,"""Are we back?"" Marty asks. ""We're back."" Doc Brown confirms.Harry Potter and the Fall from Grace. Now why couldn't the author, the appropriately named ""J.K."", come up with that title?In what appears to be the Alien³ of the series, Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince is probably the most wasted of all the series. It completely, utterly, regrettably and irresponsibly forgets all that made the previous and great installment, well, great. And it clearly makes the idea of a 7-year school, 3-years (or movies) too much.I would be completely dishonest if I didn't report that this CW-series episode is quite frankly chalk-full of 20 minutes of useful information out of a bloated 153 minutes. And as much as I admire them keeping the films shorter and tighter, I would've preferred those 20 minutes simply added to the previous film.Even outside the Harry Potter franchise, it has been a long, long time since I've wanted to fast forward through a movie I've never seen before. The pacing was awful, the dialogue mediocre, the teen-love-triangles awkward, boring and muddled and the suspense and mystery were completely gone.It might sound like I'm venting frustration, but let me say, it's more like: disappointment. After an exciting and uplifting complete story of good vs. evil in Harry Potter #5 whereas the teens band together, learn, exercise (inside and out) and fear the futurewe now have a school full of kids with amnesia. NO ONE SEEMS TO REMEMBER A DAMN THING from what they were taught, yearned for or prepared for.Instead, we have just another dull year at Hogwarts, yet another new teacher and the background of the baddie that could be written in its entirety on a fortune cookie's slip of paper.So, what the hell happened? Seriously, think about it. In #5, the threat of ""V"" is REAL and scary. The threat of the Ministry lives amongst the students. The Rebels unite and include Harry. The band of brothers and sisters is alive and the depth of Harry is revealed.Jump to #6 and I can barely describe what I just saw. Well, the students no longer seem to fear ""V"" or even remember he's lurking. The Ministry seems to have either dismantled or are on holiday for this year. The Rebels say ""we're afraid"" but only because the script tells them to say that. And the group previously fighting for their lives don't even acknowledge their training/skills, nor the secret room and would rather be taught the game of Quidditch without ever actually playing it. Oh, lest I forget, the depth of Harry, or any character has vanished.I hate to downgrade a movie with decent cinematography – one of my favorite qualities in film, but this movie, an obvious bridge movie from the exciting #5 to the finale, was a complete misuse of time. As I stated before, there are 20 minutes of helpful scenes, including a significant one in the finale.BUTto get there, you'll need a magic wand of awakening or a Red Bull, because the series sincerely backtracked from its suspenseful and exciting previous chapter to the jumbled chapter before: the futile Goblet of Fire.Well, here's to Parts 7a and 7blet's either get back on track or put the series to bed, because I am not sure how much more either Harry or *I* can endure.(Editor's Note: I decided to listen to the masses for this Harry POTter phenomena and revisit the series. I've only seen the first two, both once and in first run theatres. Since it's been around a decade since the initial releases, I've started over with #1 and will get to what everyone calls: the better years. Cheerio!)",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
29,Robert_duder,The series takes its final turns with pure greatness,9,25 August 2009,"The Harry Potter series has always been on shaky ground and yet after four installments the series only got better and better. All the things you were concerned about...the children aging, keeping the quality from the books (I have never read ANY of the books)...and the series was just mind blowing. Then there was a stumble, a hiccup so to speak. Order of The Phoenix was still brilliant but there was something there that made me think maybe the series was on it's way down in quality. Instead they return guns blazing (metaphorically) with The Half Blood Prince. This installment could be considered completely different than any other before it. There is far more drama, romance, friendship, mystery and suspense and the usual action, Quidditch, and intensity is perhaps toned down to make this bridge between the previous film and the epic upcoming two part finale which I am on the edge of my seat waiting for. Director David Yates obviously has a passion for these characters and more than any other previous director he manages to really put heart and soul into our familiar Hogwart's family. He uses the brilliant characters to bring them to life from the novels.Of course the old faithful original cast returns. I'm not going to run them all down because the world knows who they are. Every single film that is released in this series reminds us that this casting is perhaps one of the greatest in film history. They all literally become the characters and bring them to life. They will forever be tied to these characters, both the children (who are less children now and more adults) and the teachers. I was quite saddened to see depleted rolls for both the amazing Hagrid (Robbie Coltrane) and the wonderful Minerva McGonagall (Maggie Smith.) Perhaps that is just the way the story goes but I missed them. I also must mention that Alan Rickman is still amazing and STILL darkly mysterious as Professor Snape. His character is really getting darkly interesting and I can't wait to see where the story goes with him. Bonnie Wright really breaks out in the cast as Ginny Weasley. She has been in every film I believe but this is the first time we really get to see her break out. Aren't they lucky she grew up to be pretty and charismatic opposite Daniel Radcliffe.Despite the action being toned down the visuals are no less stunning. Some of the beautifully created cinematography. I would have loved to have seen this on IMAX as I did with some of the others. Hogwarts is no less stunningly beautiful as it has always been, perhaps moreso. Author J.K. Rowling HAS to be blown away and amazed by what Yates and the film makers has done to bring this world to life. Amazingly seeing some of the familiar locations and characters and monsters (like the incredibly eerie death eaters) never get old and never lose their fascination and that alone is an impressive part of the Harry Potter series. If you haven't seen this series don't see this movie because you need to go back and start right from the beginning and when you get to this one SEE IT because it's integral to the series, bridges a gap and brings out a whole new level of emotion to the series. Perhaps the greatest fantasy film series ever made period. 9/10",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
30,Lejink,Harry Ponderous,5,4 January 2012,"I'm a little behind with the film series having finished reading the Potter novels a couple of years ago so that the narrative wasn't as fresh in my mind as when I viewed the earlier instalments. This is a good thing as it meant I wasn't so critical about how closely the film adhered to the book and could give the film a chance to stand on its own merits. Oddly, while remember enjoying the book a lot, I found the movie somewhat slow and devoid of action.Even the big shoot-out finale seems to be over quickly leading me to the conclusion that this film was probably one for the die-hards, ironically in light of my introductory comments, who watch the films to visualise the books. Certainly there's a slowness about the narrative, with lots of talking and little in the way of drama or until the search for the horcrux, any real sense of spectacle either to fire up the imagination.Instead we get some very awkward acting from the young adults as their hormones kick in and they discover the opposite sex, so it's quite unconvincing and naturally slows down the action. Moreover some of the actors just look too old to be still playing schoolchildren, Draco Malfoy and Ron Weasley in particular. I also got the impression too that there was little depth in much of the playing, with the honourable exception of Michael Gambon, otherwise familiarity seems to be starting to breed contempt, no-one reaching into their characters although that was very possibly because the characters are now devoid of any more layers for an actor to explore.Yes, the visuals are frequently superb, especially the secret lake which Dumbledore and Harry have to negotiate and some of the closing images of desolation at Hogworts after the downbeat ending, but you'd expect nothing less with the budget here and yes, now I come to think of it, the Quidditch match where Ron performs outstandingly in the novel, is too quickly got over.I would therefore rate this as one of the inferior instalments in the franchise and while acknowledging the cliché as I write it, do think the book is a more exciting and interesting way to absorb the story here.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
31,ElMaruecan82,"""I'm just beginning to realize how beautiful this place is""",8,26 November 2018,"That line is delivered by Harry Potter himself while admiring the beautiful view offering itself in one of Hogwarts' highest turrets. I liked that little touch.And I suspected a meta-referential mood in Potter's contemplation, as if he was echoing the emotion of J.K. Rowling or all the crew members who got involved in one of the greatest franchises of the past twenty years and only realized at that moment how high they climbed their way up to cinematic greatness. Did they have time to step back and consider their achievements over the span of eight years?Probably not. It's possible that this was just the quiet before the storm, one in two parts named ""The Deathly Gallows"" and whose book was published a few days after the sixth movie adaptation's release. 2009 must have been quite a year for Harry Potter fans. To think that I've discovered the series three weeks ago and here I am, reviewing ""The Half-Blood Prince"".And misreading can be quite misleading, focusing on the second part of the title, I totally overlooked the ""and"" and thought that film would reveal that Harry Potter is the Prince. Maybe I went too far in my speculations but now that we're getting close to the 'real deal' and far from the times of cute wizardry and enchantment, anything is possible and even worse: anyone can die. Many deaths have been quite heartbreaking over the course of Harry's journey, none was pointless though.It's been established, ever since the death of Bambi's mom and Mufasa in ""The Lion King"", that the death of a parent or a mentor figure is integral to the coming-of-age story. Harry Potter is no exception and he's perhaps the strongest codifier of that trope outside the realms of Disney. His very life is owed to the sacrifice of his parents and his magical power crystallizes the wrath of the hideous Voldemort. The opening with the destruction of the Millennium Bridge proves that no one is immune to his actions anymore and that the overarching scope of Potter's adventures reached its limit.But for all its ominousness, the film finds a strange way to make us lower our guards and enjoy the novelties it has to offer especially the introduction of Horace Slughorn, an old comrade of Dumbledore reassigned as a Potions teacher. Jim Broadbent gives such a natural performance as the bumbling old professor that he seems to have been part of the series from the beginning. The man is hired in Hogwarts because he hides a crucial memory involving young Voldemort -Tom Riddle- that could help to defeat him.There are many flashbacks providing new insights on Voldemort's backstory but interestingly, there aren't many new players and the film has a strange focus on Snape (Alan Rickman) assigned as the New Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher. Somewhat I wasn't surprised by that new turn of events. Ever since the series started, he was a living enigma, I could never tell whether he was acting ""good"" to hide his vileness or the exact opposite, as any of these two assumptions could be validated at least once. This film finally reveals the depths of his persona. And it was about time.Another character who gets a similar upgrading in vileness is Drago Malefoy (Tom Felton) whom Harry Potter suspects to have turned into a Death Eater working for Voldemort after his father's disgrace and imprisonment in Azkaban. Snape becomes the protector of Malefoy and seals an unbreakable vow with his mother and Bellatrix Lesstrange. Obviously, only the worse could come from such a pact and I should have suspected something wrong seeing how Dumbledore -who was so close to Merlin- turned into Gandalf the Grey all of a sudden, he leaves the show in a blaze of glory... but he leaves it nonetheless.I guess the series called for such a dramatic death and from my modest viewer's seat, I knew I was witnessing something as significant as the death of Bambi's mom. But I wasn't as overflowed by emotions as I thought I would be. As saddened as I was, I took it as a natural step in Potter's quest. The whole irony of ""Half-Blood"" is that the middle section of the film is perhaps one of the most lighthearted of the whole series if you except the first film. But it just doesn't prepare you for how dark it gets.I've never enjoyed the interactions within the Potter gang as much as I did in that episode especially the flirtatious jokes and the way many cute and comedic moments ensued with the help of the love elixir. I also loved the growing chemistry between Harry and Ginny Weasley (Bonnie Wright) who's finally given a substantial role. And boy, I loved that that segment in the Weasley Twins' shop, if anything that moment of pure recreation and fun reminded me of the values wizardry should also stand for ... once the baddies are defeated (or away).Overall, the film felt like a giant cinematic mood whiplash whose most pivotal moment is when Dumbledore and Harry extract the secret from Slughorn's memory about the Horcrux, the object that establishes ""killing"" as a key to immortality and reveals how Voldemort used seven murders to separate his souls into artefacts (tying many previous plot points together). Unfortunately, whatever thrills are provided by the last escapade between Harry and Dumbledore in that dark cavern are easily overshadowed by the headmaster's demise, caused not by Malefoy, but Snape, aka the man in the title.So doubt isn't permitted anymore about Snape and that last revelation prompts Harry to abandon Hogwarts and go for the climactic fight against Voldemort. And I guess now I'm ready for the final two-parter, I don't know what to expect, I only wish they won't kill many characters who're so dear to me. But ""Deathly Gallows"" sure isn't a reassuring title!",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
32,Pjtaylor-96-138044,"Perhaps the most unconventional 'Potter', it places almost all the emphasis on school-life espionage and is entertaining because of it.",8,30 April 2018,"'Harry Potter And The Half-Blood Prince (2009)' manages to keep the focus mostly on Hogwarts, giving Harry a mission to accomplish whilst also dedicating significant time to his friends and their teenage troubles. It also always delivers on the promise of an unseen threat looming close by. Indeed, it's perhaps the darkest in the series so far. This bleak tone is bolstered by a ballsy ending that provides little in the way of levity or triumph. The film balances this darkness with some lighter moments peppered throughout, which satisfy without overdoing it. The flick is perhaps the most unconventional of the bunch, taking things back to basics with school-life front and centre. It also has distinct, vaguely dream-like cinematography. Its somewhat left-field approach certainly pays off, though. The end result is a unique, wistful and entertaining experience that acts as a nice counter-point to the two films that follow. 8/10",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
33,ThomasDrufke,Doesn't Get the Credit it Deserves,9,13 November 2016,"Half-Blood Prince is perhaps the most plotting of the 8 films, taking its time with the ongoing Voldemort conflict, but the pay-off is about as satisfying as anything the franchise had presented to that point.Voldemort sets Draco Malfoy out on a secret but important mission inside Hogwarts, while Harry finds and becomes obsessed with a book belonged to ""The Half-Blood Prince"" amidst his ongoing battle with Voldemort. While the latter doesn't appear in the film in a physical sense, his presence is felt throughout. And that's one of the brilliant things about this 6th film, it keeps the tone in line with the somber end of Order of the Phoenix and mixes in nicely timed humor and light energy. Knowing that the fight against Voldemort is coming, it's difficult to see this for more than just a filler in between, but it's far from that notion.I love that each Potter story changes up the formula in terms of Harry's missions. Whether it's as a team in Order of the Phoenix, with Hermione in Prisoner of Azkaban, or Ron in Chamber of Secrets, the films always manage to feel different even if the plot veers into familiar territory. Half-Blood Prince brings us the beloved duo of Harry and Dumbledore, in what is definitely the latter's meatiest role. After all, besides the ending fight with Voldemort in Order of the Phoenix, the series hadn't given us a ton of Dumbledore in action. And considering the end result of this film, it's about dang time.The new (ish) teacher at Hogwarts this year is Professor Slughorn, someone who has had some experience teaching Tom Riddle back in the day. His presence provides most of Harry's missions in the film, as he's forced to uncover some of Riddle and Slughorn's memories together. These memories prove to be the key in taking the next step in taking down the dark lord.After the missing plot point from Order of Phoenix, Ron takes his chances at Quidditch and catches the eye of a strangely obsessed student, Lavender Brown. Keeping the romance theme going, Harry and Ginny finally show their true feelings. All of this, makes Hermione uneasy. I can't say I'm the biggest fan of when the series takes chances in the rom-com territory, but it's all done in good fun. Watching these characters grow and go through things that teenagers go through (like love), is always a good time. After all, we need some comedic relief from all the serious stuff going on with Voldemort.After having a few films in the background, Draco and Snape have a more involved presence here as Snape made an unbreakable vow with the Death Eaters to protect Draco. Draco's mysterious scenes are nicely sprinkled in to the ongoing conflict and come to a head in the third act, in which this unbreakable vow makes for devastating consequences. This film ends in a dark place, but the film as a whole has no shortage of classic Potter, with plenty of strange potions to keep the fun along the way.+Harry & Dumbledore+Draco & Snape are back in the forefront+Dark tone, with fun moments mixed in+Romances is both funny & heartwarming+Enter Horcruxes9.2/10",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
34,MLDinTN,one of the better Harry Potter films,7,21 June 2010,"I thought this movie was OK, certainly better than some of the other Potter films. As usually, lots was left out of the book. I almost think these films would be better if it was just a series on TV and 6 hours was devoted to each book. From what I remember from reading the book, I think the movie left out a lot of the memories Harry views about Voldermart and his background. Also, I think the ending had a big fight scene between death eaters and the students at Hogwarts. That wasn't in the film. My favorite part from the film was Harry and Dumbledore retrieving the horcrux in the middle of the lake.

35,g-bodyl,A Great HP Movie!,9,13 June 2010,"This Harry Potter movie is really well done. Instead of action, this movie focuses more on the drama and romance, definitely the romance. Because there is limited action, the filmmakers had to add additional scenes which everyone say it didn't happen in the novel(True, it didn't). Also, the movie tended to be a little on the boring side.This time around, the gang enters the sixth year at Hogwarts with dark times lurking. Basically this year, Harry learns the secrets of Voldemort's past with Dumbledore. Also romance begins to bloom between Harry, Ron, Hermione, and Ginny.This is probably the darkest Harry Potter movie yet. Obviously, the final two are going to be darker. I thought the score by Hooper is much better here. Even though I really liked this film, I thought this may be the weakest of all of the HP movies.

The filmmakers are so concentrated on showing off their special effects, getting cool shots or displaying the sets that they forget to actually tie scenes together, tell the story and, at times, make sense. Plus, they cut out important elements of the book so they can make more room for the never-ending romantic subplot and they even add in pointless scenes that were never in the book!

It may not be as good as some previous instalments, but it continues to build, as well as develop it's many characters and its very enticing story, this one is consistently intense, I was at the edge of my seat at many stages. However there was one issue I had, I understand that he wasn't in the book either, but I feel like this film is really lacking energy without a single appearance from Voldermort, he is the franchise's main villain and after letting us see him in the previous two films made it feel very anti-climatic to not have him make an appearance here, as the main antagonist is absent. The performances are consistently improving as the films continue, here everyone is really in top form as it is, for the majority, their sixth or fifth time playing these characters, making their acting feel very natural, as if the character is just another version of them now, Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, Alan Rickman and Michael Gambon particularly stand out. Intense with a magical, whimsical atmosphere, Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince may not be the series finest, but it's a very fun ride.

40,tabuno,Not A Stand Alone Movie,6,20 January 2019,"15 July 2009. It's fascinating to come across a sequel that in part depends on the original movies from which to came to provide sufficient context from which to enjoy the movie. This is definitely not a stand alone movie and it can't carry itself without the preceding plot stories that came before it. Unlike the LORD OF THE RING SERIES, this latest Harry Potter movie appears to presume one has either read the books or have a decent grasp or recollection of previous Potter movies. The color tone through the movie was tinged orange, a typical technique for contemporary period films portraying the turn of the Century films which didn't really seem to match the set design or story well, and instead appeared to distance the audience from the more clear and sharp, bright colors that would have made this movie more immediate and personal. The beginning sequences seem more haphazard along with the requisite special effects intended to impress and dazzle, but much of it seemed more workmanlike than natural, except for the fun magic shop.Overall this movie didn't seem to have a clear plot outline, much of the charm seems to have been lost while periodically engaging the audience with its quiditch matches and a series of scary scenes that seemed to be dropped into the plot. The relational difficulties were also a bit confusing and it seemed that even at the prolonged length this movie was stretched a bit having to both continue developing character archs as well as the primary storyline. The comic scenes while funny, they also seemed to be strategically inserted into the, yet there is now an uneasy balance between the dramatic and comedic flow of the movie. As really a two-part movie, it doesn't seem to have the same sharp interdependent ability to stand of its own and even the supposedly climax didn't seem to have the fireworks and nice interlude of say KILL BILL No. 1 and 2 movies.

43,tomgillespie2002,Narratively flawed adaptation of the best book of the series,5,24 July 2014,"Defiantly avoiding the familiar sign-posts of the early Harry Potter movies (Harry's troubles with the Dursley's, the journey to Hogwarts, meeting the new Defence Against the Dark Arts), returning director David Yates and the franchise in general has firmly settled into it's dark, brooding persona. The trouble is, Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) and his ever- present shadows Ron (Rupert Grint) and Hermione (Emma Watson) have developed into one-dimensional bores. Thankfully, The Half-Blood Prince is rich in snivelling villains and wise old wizards and witches, all portrayed by an embarrassingly rich line-up of British thesps, who liven up the proceedings somewhat and add that much-needed gravitas.It's a cast so crammed with talent that the likes of two-time Oscar- winner Maggie Smith is reduced to a walk-on part. But the film is plagued by a lack of proper pacing, and Yates has trouble keeping a grip on the mixture of drama, comedy and action. Certain scenes that were utterly gripping in J.K. Rowling's novel whizz by without you realising what just happened, confusing the thick plot to the point that any audience members unfamiliar to the books, and have waited two years between the movie instalments, might be left scratching their heads at the mention of Horcruxes and Vanishing Cabinets. This time around, Harry and Dumbledore (Michael Gambon) partner up to gain information from new teacher Horace Slughorn (Jim Broadbent).Seeking to destroy Lord Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes) once and for all, Dumbledore's biggest clue lies in a memory tampered with by it's owner, Slughorn. It's a conversation between him and a young Voldemort, Tom Riddle (Frank Dillane - son of Stephen), discussing a dark magic that Dumbledore believes to be the key to Voldemort's immortality. Harry is given the task to appeal to Slughorn's love of celebrity and reveal his secrets, and impresses the bumbling teacher in his Potions class after discovering a textbook marked with alterations by the mysterious 'half- blood prince'. But Harry also believes nemesis Draco Malfoy (Tom Felton) has been made a Death Eater and is up to no good, much to the scepticism of Ron and Hermione.It's the best book of the series, in my opinion, and it's a shame that screenwriter Steve Kloves, who has written every Potter apart from Order of the Phoenix and has always done an excellent adapting the hefty books, can't quite get this one right. The moments in which Harry delves inside the Pensive, an apparatus that allows one to physically enter a memory, are impressive. We finally get some insight into the past, and the two young actors playing Tom Riddle (as well as Dillane, Hero Fiennes-Tiffin, nephew of Ralph, plays an 11 year-old incarnation) are excellent, showing us a younger, curious dark lord. But it isn't enough to stop the film feeling like it's dragging out the franchise that made many people millions of dollars, or allowing me to forgive the many narrative flaws and many moments of plain rushed storytelling.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince

45,zkonedog,"Despite Excises, Manages To Capture Essence Of Novel",7,6 March 2017,"With the possible exception of the first book/movie combination in the Harry Potter series, each film adaption has done its share of cutting/editing from J.K. Rowling's original work. Luckily, this film version of ""Half-Blood Prince"" (other than its predecessor ""Order of the Phoenix"") manages to maintain its soul despite the inevitable cuts. For a basic plot summary, ""Prince"" sees Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) taking private lessons from Professor Dumbledore (Michael Gambon), where they examine certain memories of a young Tom Riddle in order to be better prepared for his adult Lord Voldemort identity. At the same time, the trio of Harry, Ron (Rupert Grint), and Hermoine (Emma Watson) take the next crucial steps in their wizarding education by learning more advanced potion-making (under new Professor Slughorn(Jim Broadbent)) and even taking the first steps toward apparating. Ginny Weasley (Bonnie Wright) and Draco Malfoy (Tom Felton) take on larger roles in this installment, while Professor Snape (Alan Rickman) constantly lurks in the background. Like the novel, ""Prince"" is a great piece of fiction primarily because of all the Harry/Dumbledore interactions and their trips into the past of Voldemort. Despite one key ""flashback"" being completely cut out, the movie does a good job of showing those younger Riddle years. Essentially, the heart of the writing remains (unlike how it was completely cut out in ""Phoenix""). The acting also continues to improve, what with Radcliffe, Grint, and Watson probably turning in their best performances to date. Felton as Malfoy also grows quite a bit in this one, and the Weasley characters are always fun to get back to. Almost completely stealing the show is a wonderful performance from Broadbent as Slughorn. Overall, ""Half-Blood Prince"" is a fine book-to-film adaption that will satisfy both the Potter-heads and the more casual fans of the series. Though I won't give any specific spoilers here, the end of the film very strongly hints that the action of the final movie(s) will largely take place outside of Hogwarts.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince

Rowling isn't Charles Dickens",7,30 July 2009,"""Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"" (2009), directed by David Yates, is this Summer's blockbuster movie. I think that this means that the series has taken on a life of its own, and that people who've seen the earlier films will go to the next ones whatever the film quality may be.In my opinion, this movie isn't great, but it isn't bad either. Unless you've been living in a cave, or stranded on a desert island, you know the characters and the plot already. The bad news is that you know about all the scenes that didn't make it into the movie. (Mostly important plot elements.) The good news is that you know all these scenes and their characters, so can fill in the missing blanks, and enjoy a film that's primarily about teenage romance, with some scary stuff thrown in.As usual, the acting is excellent. We've see Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, and Emma Watson grow up on screen, and we know they're good actors and getting better. Alan Rickman continues to be outstanding as Professor Severus Snape, the man you love to hate. Tom Felton comes into his own as Draco Malfoy, who starts the movie by breaking Harry's nose, and just keeps getting even meaner and darker as the film goes along. Helena Bonham Carter is extraordinary as the witch Bellatrix Lestrange. It's interesting the the Harry Potter films abound in evil characters, but she's the one who appears to get the most enjoyment out of being evil. I felt that Bonnie Wright as Ginny Weasley was the one main character who didn't fit her image in the book. She lacks any sparkle, and we have to assume that Harry is not thinking about her intelligence, charm, or ready wit when he's attracted to her.Other reviewers has already noted that this is Harry Potter with the romantic plots turned up, and everything else turned down. It's as if someone made a film of ""David Copperfield,"" and called it, ""David and Dora, Steerforth and Emily."" Yes, those plot lines exist in the Dickens novel, but there's so much more in the book.The good news is that J.K Rowling isn't Charles Dickens and Harry Potter isn't David Copperfield. If you're a Harry Potter fanatic, you can start a thread at IMDb entitled, ""What happened to . . .?"" and ask about all the scenes that Yates omitted. Or, you can just leave your wand and cape at home, and enjoy the movie for what it is.Incidentally, a great ""David Copperfield"" movie does, indeed, exist. Filmed in 1999, it stars Maggie Smith as Aunt Betsey Trotwood, and Daniel Radcliffe (yes, the very same) as the young David Copperfield.

Always betting on the continuity of its main cast, as well as in the ability of its studios when it comes to special effects and computerization, Yates manages to make a great movie. The script also becomes increasingly complex and dense. The loves and crossed romances will increasingly join the central plot, and that will help to thickens it and make the film more and more adult and mature, deeper and psychologically challenging. The actors will also gaining more and more experience and maturity and will raise their performance to ever higher levels.This film is one of the first where the audience gets to see the other side of some characters. So far, everything was very black and white, there were good guys and bad guys. Now it will no longer be so, with some of the characters to show gray sides of their personalities.

As i have previously watched only 3 movies, I have 5 other to review and this one is the first.At first, the magic was on because there were great shots (as in the burrows or at London) and the heart of HP was there, this is to say a school friendship with a lot of fantasy and British flavor. But after one hour, the magic was gone. This time as i don't read the book along, i don't have the imprint of the text before my eyes to consider the sets empty. In fact, the problems are the same in the last two and i think that the director must take the blame. First, the score is weak, very weak and can't help the visual. Next, the cinematography is disastrous: i don't like the filtering and seeing everything in blue/green just because it's bleak times is stupid. Worst, as it's really strong here, all the night scenes are very difficult to follow! But, fundamentally, the scene never give me emotion: even if the cast is good, their lines are flat and the choice of action is not very bright: a good choir at the end: cut, no burial for Dumbledore (when are we supposed to mourn?) and exit the story of Voldemort (for those who wonder how he became evil, read it!). Fortunately, there's a extra DVD and here at last I have emotion: the inside view about the making of the movie is great to see how those young lads bound together to live a fabulous childhood and how the entire production was dedicated to give their best. It seems that the backstage was a perfect world for everyone. Then, they put a documentary about the JKR and it was very moving to see that she lived a very heavy life before HP comes. What happens next to her and the millions of lives she touched is indeed magic. The tearing heart moment was to see her coming back to the flat where she wrote the first book and see her cry. Stardom doesn't kill her roots and simplicity and in a twisting way, her books were actually in the child's actual bedroom! (nb: and Dumbledore is indeed a gay because she told this here!). Finally, the DVD offers a one-minute drill to the trio to explain what happens before movie 6 and the production should have been creative and intelligent to offer it in theaters because as always, there is never an introduction for newcomers!

50,Movie_Muse_Reviews,The best visual craftsmanship of a Potter installment yet,9,15 July 2009,"Like every movie thus far in the Harry Potter series based on J.K Rowling's novels, ""Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"" (book no. 6) cuts a lot of corners. Those who regard Rowling's tome as a bible are sure to have complaints at scenes added (the attack on the Weasley's burrow) and scenes taken away (the battle in Hogwarts), but as a film -- not a book -- second-time director David Yates and longtime Potter adapter Steve Kloves have made the most visually purposeful, emotional and character-driven Potter movie so far.The previous film ""Order of the Phonenix"" (Yates' first) introduced the inevitable dark direction of the series and therefore movies, as Harry (Radcliffe) embraces that he alone can defeat the evil Lord Voldemort (Fiennes, who's absent from this movie), who has come back to power and is now an immediate and dangerous threat. In order for Harry to succeed, he must learn a crucial piece of information, one that belongs in the memory of retired professor Horace Slughorn, played brilliantly by Jim Broadbent, who Harry and his mentor Albus Dumbledore (Gambon) have convinced to come back to Hogwarts.Meanwhile, Harry has a suspicion that his long-time schoolyard nemesis Draco Malfoy (Tom Felton) is up to something evil, possibly in service of Voldemort, and we frequently see him spending time alone in the castle. In addition to that, Harry also has to juggle his own new feelings for his best friend Ron's (Grint) sister Ginny (Bonnie Wright) and the rocky relationship between Ron and their other friend Hermione (Watson) who clearly has some feelings of her own.If you think Harry has a lot to juggle, imagine the responsibility of screenwriter Kloves. Like a surgeon with only a scalpel, Kloves takes carefully to Rowling's novel, omitting scenes but sneaking them into brilliant visual details, adding new parts where necessary and sewing up the most important plot lines into a narrative thread that remains coherent. He also weaves in graceful transitions that Yates can execute beautifully with his dark and mysterious vision for the film. And to top that, he adds an endearing sense of humor that the series has never seen before, and it brings a deeper love for the characters. Broadbent and Gambon, quirky as they are, add nicely here too.And despite what you might think, Kloves' greatest sins to the Potter fundamentalists out there aren't solely his fault. The greatest blemish on this otherwise beautiful adaptation can be blamed on one thing: a PG rating. Intending to be PG, whereas the last two films were PG-13, strips the film of delivering all the weight of the best climax Rowling wrote in the Harry Potter series. The inability to show some sort of violence rips the battle at Hogwarts out of the film and deprives it of some much needed adrenaline; all for a measly PG rating. It's a mistake that deprives this movie of a tenth star out of ten. To compensate, Kloves adds the attack on the Burrow halfway through, but it stands out as the most frivolous in the film.As these films come to an end, they are clearly in the right hands with Yates. ""Half-Blood Prince"" is wildly imaginative, edgy and suspenseful, with terrific foreshadow technique and chilling transitions. With these last few books being on such a grand scale in the Harry Potter universe, it's key that someone be in charge who has a specific vision. Yates (with Kloves) has that vision and that's what makes this a great film and not a flat one that's too complex and overloaded with details from the book. If you want the latter, read the book again. Choices were made, and despite a less climactic ending, they were brilliant ones. ~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.blogspot.com/",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince

Rowling's succession of thunderously well-liked stories smacks of a less ostentatious, far more worthwhile approach than the typical annual bigger-is-better summer blockbuster: What we need aren't larger effects but more moving ones, which requires a tale worth telling. Half-Blood Prince's effects are placed so nonchalantly in their invented world that we effortlessly buy into their realism. The brass owl adorning the podium in Hogwarts' dining hall trims until Dumbledore steps forth, when it respectfully strikes a pose and freezes. When Hermione restocks books in the library, they leap out of her hands and locate their proper slots on even the highest shelves. A more-interesting-than-usual quidditch game is set during a convincing, silky snowfall. Magic occurs here as the characters are occupied with love and brokenheartedness. This is a fantasy film, but the subtle idea huddled within is that there's unexplainable fascination adjoining the everyday.There's also chance, angst, malice, and Half-Blood Prince doesn't withhold any of it. Director David Yates returns, having helmed Order of the Phoenix. And as with that particularly well-pitched film, Yates artfully connects Half-Blood Prince's momentously dramatic sequences. He's as dexterous as ever at sculpting the story's more understated moments into poignant snatches. Half-Blood Prince---lensed with vigilant dignity, unsurprisingly elegant in Stuart Craig's signature design of Rowling's world---is a superbly measured accomplishment, one that pilots what for countless directors could've easily been uneven swings in mood and magnitude with signature British poise and simplicity.There are unmistakable villains, ambiguous ones and mixed bags, like Jim Broadbent's name-dropping potions professor. It begins right when Death Eaters drop in on the Muggle world in London, plunging down to obliterate the Millennium Bridge on the order of Lord Voldemort. Harry's flirting with an exceptionally attractive girl at a humble diner when Dumbledore inconveniently beckons. As usual, it's grown ever clearer that something exceedingly dreadful is nigh on Hogwarts, and naturally, it's Harry's job to prevent it. Then there's that other concern of becoming a young adult, burdened with its own treacherous interruptions. Harry again has the support of sounding boards Hermione and Weasley, but they have quandaries of their own: Hermione is smitten with an oblivious Weasley, who has, unexpectedly to me (as I enjoyed him as 3P0 to Harry's R2), become a quidditch star and engrossed the sycophantic interest of scatterbrained classmates.The series has categorically gone from light, prissy and wholesome to glum, tragic and angry. One of the most unsettling sequences involves imagery on loan unequivocally from contemporary Japanese horror cinema. But Yates is accustomed to all sorts of grief, and his young cast, which has become more compelling and natural with each succeeding film, are keeping seamless pace with him. In one scene, Hermione suffers owing to her feelings for Weasley. She's summoned a ring of whirling birds, the upshot of a charm spell she's rehearsing. When Weasley awkwardly fails to understand that he's wounded her, she sends the birds dashing toward him, dispersing in a haze of feathers behind him, suspended residue of her anger and sorrow. Yates also steers his teens through a scene of surprising erotic splendor walking that notorious tightrope between loving and sexualized. It happens surrounded by ancient, supernatural relics: Idealistic love may be a very old notion, but it's the young who perpetuate it by continually rejuvenating it.Yates carries the most overwhelming scene, a sudden but immeasurable loss, so precisely that you practically cannot accept that the unimaginable is indeed happening. Half-Blood Prince is about the old relinquishing the world to the young, even before either are equipped for it. When Dumbledore calls Harry into his chambers, initially needing to talk about a very grave concern, he carefully cites that he's observed how much time Harry exhausts with Hermione. Dumbledore doesn't even have to complete the question. Gambon plays the moment with a veteran's sensitivity.Yates grasps the relationship that's so vital between old and young. Broadbent's professor describes an astonishing, graceful exploit so vibrantly that he's more useful than visuals. And, indeed, this trace of magic had been done by Harry's late mother. It was, Broadbent says, gazing at him as if through fog, ""the most beautiful magic."" That's a gauge of how shrewd a display Yates gives here. His most striking magic is left hidden, yet it materializes with total lucidity.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince

54,FiendishDramaturgy,"Good, But SOOOooo Not the Book",7,14 March 2010,"I know these movies cannot incorporate every little scrap of nuance from the books. I know that screen time is prohibitive of including all aspects of the story lines. I understand that comparing the blow-by-blow to the literary work is not productive, as there are two prevalent franchises here; the books and the films.Having said that, there are far too many endearing elements omitted from this particular installment for it to be as enjoyable as possible for most fans of the book. I won't list them here, but the single element I missed most was Fawkes' lament. It's not here. I waited, expecting it as a more poignant element from the novel, but like the sphinx and other monsters in Goblet of Fire, I was left with a serious feeling of the work having been incomplete.Many other elements were omitted, some as big, others bigger (the twins' bright moment is severely dimmed, herein), making this yet another installment in the Harry Potter franchise to lack enough of the original source material to make book fans happy, as well as enough of the rich story to give movie fans the best experience with the franchise.Otherwise the performances are awesome, the production style is slick, and the overall effect is enjoyable.It rates a 6.6/10 from...the Fiend :.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
55,elshikh4,"This Movie Isn't Sleepy, It's Very Sleepy !",5,15 August 2009,"Being in the theater with this movie was a disastrous experience. I wanted to leave at least 6 times. It was nearly unwatchable and totally uninteresting!Overall, this is a defensive movie, which's familiar at specific cinematic series; for instance, part 2 at certain trilogies. Since (The Empire Strikes Back - 1980) to (Pirates of the Caribbean - Dead Man's Chest - 2006), it's common that the whole thing is about defending more than attacking, the heroes lose more than win, and the end is always about forfeiting something or someone or both. Sure it's not a happy victorious case, but why to make it with a sad inefficacious style?!In this kind of movies, there are many events and a lot of action, even in bad example as (Star Wars Episode II - Attack of the Clones - 2002). But here I was astonished. This is the closest you can ever get to a sleeping pill, being one of the worst Harry Potter's movies ever!First of all, I hated such a script. It feels perfectly like Harry Potter: The Boring Episode. While my faith that these movies are great entertainment, I couldn't believe how I sat for hour and a half to not witness one event at all. More than the first half is nothing but pure tedium with nothing to present or to dazzle. Originally, the main conflict is really feeble this round; we all know that it'd take no time nor effort to bring the truth out of this drunken professor, played by (Jim Broadbent), and the effect of the real evil ones was absent for almost all the drama. It's wholly tame or rather indolent compared to the antecedents, whereas there is no action, no suspense, or one master scene. The only surprises that this movie got were the climactic one about the prince, and the dumbness of this script. It's just sluggish dry time, which's worse than the worst James Bond movies; at least there is assured action there!!Moreover: The storyline of Hermione being jealous of Weasley's sudden love, or Weasley's sudden love to Hermione herself, both looked far fabricated and, I couldn't buy them utterly. How Harry knew that Draco was the one who cursed the girl with the necklace? That was abrupt, unexplainable and too late by the way. From where did come the blind assurance about (Broadbent)'s character as someone who'd give away a gift that was given to him (the poisoned wine) and to Dumbledore in particular? That was the stupidest plan to kill someone ever written! I couldn't understand also what exactly Dumbledore and Harry were going to do at the cave?! Actually the information seemed being delivered hardly on foolish purpose!There are what I see as unnecessary scenes; like the elegy of the huge spider, the glee of Harry and friend to an extent that made (Maggie Smith)'s character mad; that wasn't cute or slightly laughable. Speaking of which, the supposedly ""funny"" lines aren't funny a bit (or this is the British wittiness anyway!). At one moment, a geek girl tells Harry about his looks: ""It's extraordinarily ordinary""! What in God's name was that?! Is it funny? I know that I didn't smile! Well, the whole dialogue was so weak. And, frankly, the movie's big calamity is its fact as the most windbag Harry Potter movie yet. Yes, in movies concerning magic and wizardry, this was sorrowfully the one where the talking was more present than the image!The teenager (Daniel Radcliffe) lacks the charisma, and the talent, especially in front of someone who has the 2 cleverly: (Rupert Grint). The music executed what's needed without much distinction.I liked only the directing. (David Yeats) did it so fine, like a classic movie from the 1950s or 1960s. Everything seemed aesthetically calculated to a holy position. The sense of plastic arts wasn't visible or high in Harry Potter movies like this before. Though it was divine frame for trivial story, and not even lovely nonsense! Let alone that the entire image was drowned in long grief. The colors didn't break away the distance between the dusky blue and the sick yellow passing through the bright brown, being shot in all cloudy atmosphere. Is it a reference to the ominous future about the father mentor's murder? Or is it an embodiment of this dark and painful phase of Harry' adolescence? Well, both ways I didn't completely admire it. I wasn't impressed by that formula of family movie / dusky film!Still (Emma Watson) is a persuasive motive to watch the movie, but not re-watching it. Sorry dear (Emma). She's so good as Hermione. However, like the good directing, she looked misplaced.Here's what I wrote on the back of the cinema ticket of this movie: ""Bore, Silliness, No Action, Thrill, Comedy, Events, No Nothing, A Complete Waste of Time!"". Just being the defensive sequel doesn't mean necessarily being a sleepy ride. And making a movie end with a defeat mustn't deny the presence of a hot battle first!I take Dirty Harry, Harry and the Hendersons or even Who's Harry Crumb over THIS Harry, anytime. Simply, they all got motion or emotion that I didn't find here.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
56,freemantle_uk,More wizarding fun from Harry Potter,8,2 August 2009,"Over the years the Harry Potter series has become a powerhouse, making billions for the publishers and film studios, making J.K. Rowling the richest woman in Britain and becoming one of the biggest film series ever. With Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince director David Yates offers Harry Potter fans a fine addition to the series (but not as strong as his previous attempt Order of the Phoenix).After the events of Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix the wizardry world has to face the fact that Lord Voldemort has returned after Harry fought him in the Ministry of Magic. After the events Harry lost his only link to his family, godfather Sirius Black. The film starts with Professor Dumbledore asking Harry to help him recruit Horace Slughorn (Jim Broadband), who knows an important secret about Voldemort's past. Dumbledore asks Harry to get close to Slughorn who likes recruit favourites who he believes will become successful. Dumbledore himself is on the hunt for Voldemort. Within the Death Eater camp, Voldemort has ordered Draco Malfoy to kill Dumbledore. If he fails Voldemort will kill him. Out of love for her son, Narcissa Malfoy (Helen McCrory), asks Snape to help him. He makes an unbreakable vow to ensure it. At Hogworts there are a number of sub-plots. There is a love triangle between Ron, Hermione and Lavender Brown (Jessie Cave). Harry himself has fallen for Ron's younger sister Ginny (personally I think he should have stuck with Cho Chang). As well Quidditch also makes a return in the film universe.Within the Harry Potter film series this is mid-ranking. Prisoner of Azkaban and Order of the Phoenix are better. There are problems, it's has a weaker plot to most of the books, too long, has too many sub-plots and lacks action. At times it is slow a little boring. But there are a number of strong points to the film. There is excellent acting. Daniel Radcliff and Rupert Grint have both improved a lot since the first two films. Radcliff is good on the serious front and Grint is excellent in the comedy area. Michael Gambon offers a subtle performance as Dumbledore, much like he has done in the previous films. Tom Felton comes into his own as Malfoy, giving the character more depth and power then he has in the previous films. Alan Rickman is good as always. Helena Bonham Carter was also perfect casting as the villainous Bellatrix Lestrange, and I wish she had more to do. She is a great actress. The only weak link is Emma Watson who is a pretty wooden actress. There are great visuals in film and the actions scenes that are in the film are very well done. The film is dark and is almost like a horror films, offer a couple of scares. But film does lack some depth on some characters like Fenrir Greyback who had a much bigger role in the book. There are questions about free will, right and wrong and how far someone should respect someone orders.It a solid film, one of the better blockbusters of 2009 (but 2009 is a weak year). Hopefully the Deathly Hallows will be better.7.5 out of 10",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
57,dfranzen70,Something awesome this way comes!,9,18 July 2009,"The Harry Potter franchise, like its youthful cast, continues to get darker, seriouser, and more mature. In this sixth entry, Harry has to deal not only with Death Eaters and He Who Shall Not Be Named (coughVoldemortcough) but also teenage hormones, which seem banal to us old folks but rather consume the entirety of the demographic audience's existence.But it's a testament to director Peter Yates and writer Steve Kloves that the so-called down-time scenes aren't dull; in fact, they're invigorating, sweet, sincere looks at teenage life, which is sort of difficult to do when you're middle aged.To be sure, the movie is darker than any of its predecessors, just as with the books. As the stories have progressed, the issues Harry faces increase in intensity and maturity - as his beloved Professor Dumbledore says, he must once again ask too much of his young charge. But for a change, the adults in Harry's world are beginning to treat him more like an adult and less like a pestering child. They share secrets with him, seek his counsel, and trust him to do heavy lifting - that is, they don't shunt him off to the corner while they fight bad guys themselves. (Of course, this is partly out of necessity, as so many of the good guys are being picked off.) But the frivolity and child-like wonder of the earlier films is now long gone, as the filmmakers (correctly, really) assume that the audience is well familiar with the characters and the story lines. Less time is spent on exposition and introducing us to strange new creatures (mermaids, dragons, etc.).The plot: Voldemort, freed at the end of the fifth film, is assembling his Death Eaters, who attack London. Meanwhile, Dumbledore has asked Horace Slughorn (Jim Broadbent) to return to the school as the Potions teacher. Dumbledore wants to gain access to an old memory of Slughorn that may hold the key to Voldemort's plans, and Harry (naturally) is asked to get that memory from the reluctant teacher. Meanwhile, Hermione likes Ron but doesn't want to admit it. Ron falls for a clingy Lavender Brown, and Harry has eyes for Ron's sister, Ginny. The kids are at that age - in the fifth film, we saw hormonal hints, but more from the girls' side of things, and here the score is evened up a tad. The thing is, though, as much as those of us far removed from our teen years are not interested in teen issues, Yates and Kloves make the relationships and interactions so spot-on honest that we can't help but get swept away in the sentiments.The entire cast is outstanding, giving us a sort of old-shoe comfortability with their work here, but I wanted to point out the crazed, perfectly over-the-top work of Helena Bonham Carter as Bellatrix Lestrange, the most insane of all the Death Eaters, the witch who killed Harry's godfather, Sirius. Bonham Carter is devilish, part Bride of Frankenstein and part, I dunno, Aileen Wuornos. Broadbent is also a welcome addition as Slughorn, vulnerable, pompous, a bit grandstanding, a gadfly of students (he likes to ""collect"" portraits of the best ones). A students' groupie, really. Slughorn is pivotal in unlocking Voldemort's secret. Alan Rickman, again back as the nebulously moral Severus Snape, offers a delicious, multilayered performance that keeps you guessing throughout the entire movie.The movie features some of the best cinematography and sets in the series, too. Hogwarts is shown at times, as is The Three Broomsticks at Hogsmeade, but Harry and Dumbledore also travel to a distant cave, and there's a Quidditch match (hooray!), and the Weasley twins have now - having left Hogwarts in a blaze of glory at the end of the fifth film - opened their own shop at the now-dilapidated Diagon Alley.You cannot be bored with this film. Yates' pacing is top notch, as he slows the movie down only when necessary - i.e., to build drama or inject humor. Things move at a breakneck speed, just as in the book, and everything is so perfectly laid out that you don't even realize they've slowed down. If you're a guy you'll assume the romance will be pointless and dumb and just filler, but I assure you it's none of those. Despite all your efforts, your heart will break a couple of times in this movie, once for those in and out of love, and once for the big secret near the end of the movie.A final word about the adaptation itself. It has been a little while since I read the book, but I don't think they took out too much that should have remained, if any. The movie is two and a half hours long, after all, and the books got progressively longer. There are a couple of extended scenes that are missing from the movie, but there's good reason: One is a battle scene from the end of the book; this was cut because the next book also contains a huge battle scene, and the producers wanted to avoid having the two films look too similar. The other scene, rumor has it, will appear at the beginning of the next film.All in all, Harry Potter's sixth adventure is possibly the best of them all. Stunning sets are complemented by achingly real acting by not only Britain's most decorated but also by the youthful main cast. I saw this in a theater full of teenagers whom, I had feared, wouldn't keep quiet for the movie. They did keep quiet except when the script told them to cheer and gasp and jump in fright. (This is an intense PG-rated film.) The movie was so well received that people cheered when the credits came up, which is not something you see often nowadays. The ending - not in the book - is sweet, portentous, bittersweet, and elegant.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
58,ackstasis,"""Times like these, dark times; they do funny things to people""",8,28 July 2009,"One of the most intriguing elements of the Harry Potter series thus far has been the distinct artistic styles of each of the four participating directors – Chris Colombus, Alfonso Cuarón, Mike Newell, and David Yates. Though I had misgivings about Yates, who fumbled awkwardly with the pacing and tone of 'Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (2007),' he seems to have made good on his second chance. 'Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (2009)' sees Yates finding his stylistic niche in the franchise, adapting to the ever-darkening scope of the novels with a visual mood that can only be described as pre-apocalyptic. Like ominous storm clouds enveloping the sky, the film draws dark curtains over its characters' world, signalling a Judgement Day that is impending and inevitable. Regrettably missing is the sheer ""magic"" of the earliest instalments, replaced with a foreboding spectre of doom; older children will no doubt embrace this tonal shift with the utmost enthusiasm, but their younger siblings would be well-advised to wait for a few more years.Coming into this film, I was in the fortunate position of having little recollection of J.K. Rowling's source novel, aside from the critical plot points. Essentially, Steve Kloves' screenplay can be separated into two narrative threads: firstly, that of Lord Voldemort's ever-widening pervasion of the wizarding world, even the previously-impenetrable fortress of Hogwarts; and, secondly, the various romantic hijinks of the students, aptly described by Dumbledore as ""love's keen sting."" The latter sequences lend some relief to Yates' otherwise jet-black vision, but his approach is too heavy-handed. Even from the opening moments of the film, his camera focuses laboriously on the besotted characters' awkward interactions: Harry's every glance towards Ginny is one of deep meaningfulness; Hermione's every glance at Ron is likewise one of longing, and so on, and so forth. The major benefit of these scenes is that they bring supporting players Rupert Grint and Emma Watson back into the limelight, strengthening the bonds of friendship that will no doubt prove crucial in the final installment(s).The Harry Potter series has always boasted an impressive cast of acting veterans, but by now its accumulated too many to reasonably feature. Timothy Spall, Maggie Smith, David Thewlis and Robbie Coltrane are ushered on and off with the utmost haste, leaving most of the burden on Michael Gambon, Alan Rickman and newcomer Jim Broadbent, who are all excellent. The younger actors, as always, show further improvement in their confidence and abilities, and – not for the first time – I was most impressed with the generally-underused Tom Felton, who portrays Draco Malfoy with such anguished intensity that I genuinely felt for the character's predicament. Finally, though I might have preferred the contribution of a fresh director, Yates is now set to adapt the final novel in the series. For the record, I can't imagine why ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows"" requires two installments, as I felt it possessed less interesting content than any of its predecessors, but hopefully Yates will work some magic. And, please, do something about that epilogue.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
59,JoBloTheMovieCritic,Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,10,20 July 2019,10/10 - yet another delightful year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry,Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
60,drqshadow-reviews,"Life Keeps Getting Darker, and Tougher, as Harry and Friends Enter Adolescence",7,10 June 2020,"The maturation of the Harry Potter franchise is finally complete in this, the sixth go-round for Harry, Ron, Hermione and friends. Gone (or greatly reduced) are the Hogwarts Academy's whimsical little accents - jovial ghosts, talking paintings, animated plants, hidden chambers - replaced by a quivering mass of moody sentiment, rampaging emotions and stormy romances. It's sensible. The colorful decor we see in kindergarten doesn't usually match what's on the walls in high school.That's been helped along by progressively better filmmaking, as we've slowly shed the flimsy special effects and inconsistent tones first introduced by Chris Columbus back in The Sorcerer's Stone. The series has struggled with long growing pains ever since, trying to bridge that tricky gap between childish wonder and adolescent gloom, and it's a relief to see the metamorphosis finally come to fruition. The Half-Blood Prince is a genuinely slick, professional presentation, well-realized as a fitting companion to the equally dark, funereal source material. It doesn't really stand alone, though, leaning on an expectant knowledge of novel-only details and events to fill in the plot's many, sizeable gaps. Too much going on in the printed page, I expect, as many well-remembered scenes and important bits of lore hit the cutting room floor. At least quidditch games are back on the agenda this time around; a much-needed (and exceptionally well-realized) break from all the death and doom that's been gathering.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
61,alindsay-al,An above average but disappointing film,6,15 September 2016,"Following the excellent order of the Phoenix I was really excited to see the half blood prince but I think even though this isn't a bad film it is pretty disappointing. The premise sees harry return to hogwarts to try and find out more about voldermort and his plans. Daniel radcliffe has really matured into the role and he gives a good performance in this film. He is a conflicted character who has darkness about him but also in this film he actually brings allot of humour to the character in this film. Rupert grint and emma watson really bring depth to ron and Hermione and in this film the three of these characters have great chemistry and there interactions are really the best part of the film. Michael gambon probably gives his best performance as Dumbledore in this film and it makes you believe in his character and the relationship that he and harry has. Alan Rickman's role as snape is expanded in this film and his character finally starts to show the depth that he has. The story has some interesting developments involving voldermorts origins that I wanted further expanded. But this film has way too many sub plots in it just to pad out a long run time and it really bogs down the film. The script has some more funny dialogue in it that really humanizes the main characters. But also the drama doesn't completely hit home and apart from towards the end it just doesn't really hit home. The style is poor in this film, the pacing is just all over the place, it really drags and feels slow. Also the action scenes are a step down on the previous films. Overall I still liked this film but it is definitely the weakest in the series so far.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
62,MaxBorg89,Harry Potter and the Half-Hearted Effort,7,14 September 2009,"The main problem with the Harry Potter franchise is that it has always been aimed at a specific demographic: fans of the original novels. The first two film adaptations, while well executed and visually spellbinding, were criticized because of director Chris Columbus' decision to keep every major detail from the books (minus the occasional irrelevant side character) in the movies, so that the series' young admirers - including Columbus' own daughter - wouldn't be disappointed. With the exception of Goblet of Fire, the subsequent pictures have, to different degrees, suffered from the opposite problem, namely omissions that cause some scenes to make very little sense unless one has read the books (case in point: the character Kreacher was added at the last minute in the fifth film at the request of J.K. Rowling herself, due to his role in the seventh book, but didn't do anything significant in the one scene featuring him). As such, it is hard for the casual viewer to enjoy the latest entry, Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, as anything more than an average blockbuster, especially in light of Warner Bros.' decision to release the film eight months later than originally planned, hoping the extra hype will lead to Dark Knight-style box office success (not that any of the Potter films have failed to make loads of money thus far).Picking up from the end of Order of the Phoenix (quite literally), Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince shows the wizard world in utter chaos: Voldemort's return is officially confirmed, his minions cause death and destruction in the human - or Muggle - world as well, and Harry is getting ready for the inevitable final battle with his nemesis, working closely with Professor Dumbledore (Michael Gambon). Meanwhile, things are getting complicated at Hogwarts: Ron falls in love with the wrong girl, Harry realizes he has feelings for the most unexpected person, and an old friend of Dumbledore's, Horace Slughorn (Jim Broadbent), is appointed as the new Potions teacher, while Snape (Alan Rickman) finally gets the Defense against the Drak Arts job. Additionally, he has been asked to protect Draco Malfoy (Tom Felton), now a full-blown Death-Eater with a dangerous mission to pull off.If that doesn't sound like a lot, it's because Half-Blood Prince, whilst being a slight improvement on the fifth chapter, retains its predecessor's main characteristic: it's essentially an extended trailer for the seventh installment. Whereas the first four books (and films) could be enjoyed as separate stories, parts five and six hint at bigger events to come, without doing much else. The trailers promised major action set-pieces, but only one (Dumbledore and Harry on a mission in a mysterious cave) lives up to the hype: the rest (the destruction of the Millennium Bridge and the hugely anticipated Harry/Malfoy showdown) is over far too quickly for anyone to really care.Story-wise, the film focuses less on teenage romance (although that section is still handled quite clumsily) and more on what is to come, with a terrific series of flashbacks regarding Voldemort's past (just the child and student versions, though; Ralp Fiennes is nowhere to be seen) which are directly linked to the main plot and offer rare insight into the personality of the franchise's key villain. Other aspects aren't dealt with quite as thoroughly: references to Dumbledore's sexuality (which isn't a major issue in the books anyway) make for a cheap throwaway gag for the adult percentage of the audience (who will most likely also laugh at the introduction of Felix Felicis, a potion that sort of comes off as the HP equivalent of certain illicit substances), and a mid-film bit that was specifically added for the movie doesn't add very much in terms of drama. Anf then, of course, there's the titular Prince: in the book, the character's identity is a major event, complete with back-story and new implications; in the film, it boils down to someone saying ""Oh yes, I am that guy"" and that's it.And yet even the weakest entries in the series have their moments. In this case, lots of visual delights, solid acting (Rickman, Gambon and Broadbent especially) and the franchise's most shocking finale to date. Maybe that's why Warner asked David Yates to return as a director for the remainder of the saga: given his background in television, delivering cliffhangers and bringing all the threads together in the final episode are tricks he masters perfectly. If paired with a good script (and the next one should be, since the seventh book has been split in two films so that nothing of value is left out), his work on The Deathly Hallows has the chance to be a truly epic and compelling piece of work.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
63,3xHCCH,Letdown by the Disappointing 3D IMaxVersion,6,16 July 2009,"Truth to tell, I had very high expectations of this film because of the sheer awesomeness of the last Harry Potter movie (HP and the Order of the Phoenix), particularly the 3D I-Max version. However, this installment is just alright with me. I think my very high expectations got the better of me, and that affected my overall appreciation of the movie.I think maybe I would have liked the movie more if I just watched it in an ordinary movie theater. The 3D in this movie was only applied in the first 20 minutes or so. Nothing really fantastic happened that required 3D effects. Even the destruction of the bridge by the Dementors did not really need the 3D to look good. And then, here we were waiting for the 3D to appear during the Quidditch match, during the attack on the Weasley house, or during Dumbledore's search for the Horcrux with Harry. But no, there were no more 3D scenes for the rest of the movie. What a disappointment! Now the style of the story-telling was more shallow this time when compared to the HP5 movie as well. My perceived ""shallowness"" also reflected in the acting of the leads. Daniel Radcliffe's Harry was more intense in the last movie than in this one. Emma Watson's Hermione seemed more immature. Rupert Grint's Ron was, well, Ron. Haha! Most unfortunately though, Michael Gambon's deficiency as Prof. Albus Dumbledore (compared to the late Richard Harris of the first two films) was certainly very evident in this one. I really feel Gambon lacks the regal dignity and nobility I expected from the Dumbledore in the books, and that is a shame.In HP5, I hated the book but the movie was more than fantastic in its script and execution. However, this time in HP6, the book was very well written, especially the very dramatic ending. But this movie version for me lacked maturity and depth in the cinematic depiction of the events in the book. I felt an inordinate amount of time was spent on minor subplots and characters like Lavender Brown's obsession with Ron Weasley or Luna Lovegood's weirdness. Director David Yates' treatment of the various teenage love affairs are cute but were too repetitive for my taste.Don't get me wrong though. This is not a bad movie by any means. The photography and set design are very good. But I just got carried away with my wild expectations, resulting in a major disappointing letdown. I will probably watch this again to appreciate the story, and not to over-eagerly expect non-existent 3D special effects.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince

65,MrFilmAndTelevisionShow,Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,9,8 August 2021,"Many reviewers are always upset by what the films leave out. Naturally, and even the harshest of critics would agree that when adapting a book for the big screen some thing must be cut. People simply do not have time (and studios wouldn't want to pay) for films that are twenty four hours long. Now there are always going to be things the book fans, such as myself, think the film should have included, but I believe you should view these films not as a book fan, but as a fan of Harry Potter, it's the same story told in a different way. Adaptation is the key word. I enjoy this film, very much so, Jim Broadbent as Horace Slughorn is absolutely brilliant.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince

The production is of course first rate.Daniel Radcliff as Harry is in every scene & is excellent Micheal Gambon as the Headmaster is also superb.

67,aharmas,The Look of Love,6,15 July 2009,"Let's get it out, it's hard to compete with #3 and #5. Those two films set the standard for what one expects from adaptations of the novel, and ever since it was announced that #7 would be split in two... To be fair, this film isn't bad, but it's not what the book was, and I do understand what ""adapted or based on"" means. It's just that I expect at least the basic storyline to remain in place.It's wonderful to see how the main characters have all grown up, and how eventually they will work out the main conflicts in the Harry Potter saga in the coming installment, but I always thought that if ""Half-Blood"" could be properly adapted, it would be a masterpiece because of its complex storyline, the source of us understanding what Snape and Voldemort truly are.It's always been a mystery how Snape somehow has been one of the essential pieces of the puzzle, and it's fun to see him as just that, a magnetic and at the same time, intimidating evil character that would demand at least some respect because of his imposing presence. In this movie, he appears less strong, and I know what this foreshadows, but I always thought that the book had it right, the way it developed his youth as well as Voldemort's.Voldemort himself is a fascinating character, mostly a presence that is barely seen, but much felt, and this was the opportunity to develop the parallels between him and Harry: two sides of the same coin, two young boys shaped by similar forces, with special demands, goals and expectations from early in their lives. Casting in the series has been flawless, and this film proves no exception, the few scenes where we see the young Tom (Voldemort) are haunting and very emotional. We see the potential evil being developed, and as we see Harry study the mysterious textbook, we can't help but wonder.I admire the way the love relationships were introduced in this film, where souls are bared, first steps are taking, and true to the characters' natures, mistakes and misunderstandings are made, but I never thought they should overpower the core of the story, which is Harry growing up and learning what was coming his way by his first true exposure to the origins of the evil magician he has to eventually fight.Much of the disappointment is focused in its ending, probably the biggest deviation from what is in the original text, where the big conflict in the story is downplayed to almost sketchy levels, and one of the most beautiful pieces of literature is totally ignored when the tribute to Dumbledore becomes a weak imitation of a rock concert.However, it wasn't a wasted two-plus hours because as the film moves, at a very interesting pace for a summer film, we are exposed to some of the most fantastic cinematography ever put on this type of movies, with some very subtle and gorgeous score, a perfect antidote for a couple of films with mutating characters.The world of Harry is a world of fantasy, of what it means to be young, vulnerable, and suddenly aware of how one world ends and another much more complex begins. I can't quite understand the reference by one of the characters in the closing scene because it seems a bit inappropriate and almost redundant. Yes, we know it's a beautiful place, but isn't that what is truly in danger now? The peace, the sense of stability that Hogwarts gives them and us, as we see the growing forces truly shift from goodness to...I can't help but think of another glorious and more effective ending, as the camera pulls back and we see our battered hero look from a window and probably look inside his soul and out into space how in the world he's going to be able to conquer the evil that lurks around him and inside of him.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
68,Enchorde,Just average for a non-fan like me...,6,24 September 2010,"Recap: Life and school continues at Hogswarth. And in some cases Hogswarth could be any highschool, with its young students going about their business. So Harry, Ron and Hermione soon is deep in everyday trouble as crushes, unanswered feelings and jealousy. But in other regards it is most definitely not as any other school. A book is found, one with recipes for magical potions, once owned by one called the Halfblood prince. But it also got ominous clues about Voldemort, and evil seems to gather strength. It may just be that Harry and Dumbledore is the only ones that can stop them.Comments: To me, who is not a hardcore fan of the Potter series, this seem mostly like any other of the Potter-movies, albeit a little more dark than the earliest ones. We start with the everyday life of Hogswarth, with the seemingly obligatory game of quidditch, later to slide into the real conflict between Potter and Voldemort, good and evil.It is a good enough movie, entertaining at most of times, but it fails to really engage me fully. For the really Potter-bitten, I believe this is a really good movie, but for me it was just average. It was not good, or strong enough to lure me in to become more interested, to watch more of the series. I was happy with what I saw, but I will not become a follower because of the Halfblood Prince.I must say though that the series has grown more mature with its use of effects, especially the magical spells. A few of them was really impressive and well balanced, either by the massive light and fire, or by finely tuned details in dark smoke and darkness.6/10",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince

So much of this is focused on the dating life of our intrepid trio. Again, I don't think that's bad, I just don't think it belongs at this stage in the series. Lord V is out there doing stuff, people are dying, war is coming and I frankly could not care any less about Ron thinking it's weird that Harry is dating his sister.

70,ShootingShark,How Grand It Must Be To Be The Chosen One,6,1 January 2010,"Harry, Ron and Hermione return to Hogwarts School amid speculation that something terrible is being planned. Dumbledore believes a reclusive former teacher holds the key to the secret, whilst Harry suspects Severus Snape of being in league with the dark forces. Can Hogwarts survive the evil tide amassing against it ?The sixth Harry Potter movie maintains the high entertainment standards of the previous two, if not quite capturing the magical atmosphere of the first three. The central plot line is kept ticking away nicely despite Big Bad Voldemort not appearing, and the teenage romance comic relief scenes are handled with surprising charm and subtlety. Radcliffe is now so familiar an icon that he simply is Harry Potter, and it's easy to forget he's carrying an enormous weight as the eponymous hero, both within the story and as a young actor. The Special Guest Star for this one is Broadbent as the tweedy potion master Professor Slughorn, and although he has some nice moments he's a bit one-note (he seems to start every scene with the same exclamation of surprise). His contemporaries, Gambon and Rickman, fare much better, and Bonham Carter is clearing having a lot of fun as a crazed witch with a deliciously mean streak. There are some enjoyable references to the earlier stories (notably a eulogy for Aragog, the giant spider from The Chamber Of Secrets), but as with the other films the abridging for screen results in some puzzling gaps and hastily introduced characters (Malfoy's mother, Lupin's wife). My favourite aspect of this movie I think though is the delightful music by Nicholas Hooper, which is beautiful, rich, scored wall-to-wall orchestral, and enriches all the scares, wonderment, tragedy and comedy ten-fold; the film is as much as delight for the ears as it is for the eyes. Yates contributes fine touches throughout, particularly the clever use of digital colourisation - yellows, browns and greys frequently filtered up in certain scenes to great visual/emotional impact. A high level of CGI work is par for the course in such movies, but here it's being used not just to tell the story but to contribute to how it is told. The film's weakness of course is that it's episodic, with no beginning or end, but it's still a fine movie overall, albeit not a patch on the original Chris Columbus film. As ever, based on the humongously popular series of books by J.K. Rowling.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
71,adamjohns-42575,"No Spoilers, I've made an unbreakable vow!",9,7 December 2020,"Although this one still has far too much missing from the original source, it is definitely my third favourite of the franchise.
We're really getting down to the nitty gritty of the septet/octet here, as we finally start to see some movement on how they will actually defeat Voldemort, before they are all struck by a crushing blow to their cause. We also get a glimpse of the Muggle world and their reactions to what's happening.I think a large part of it's success is down to the story itself as it doesn't shelter the audience too much and yet manages to keep them entertained and not too horrified or upset, remembering that it is aimed at 16 year olds or thereabouts.The characters are all comfortable in their roles now and it shows through their acting and the direction is very good if a little heavy handed with the editing. I wonder if the screenplay writer could have got a bit more out of the book though?There is a good balance in this one with the comedic and tragic moments and having known them all for so long, you feel what they are feeling as you would a best friend.This is the perfect set up for the finale, but I do think it could have been made in to two films as I do with ""Goblet Of Fire"". The book contains so much information that helps us understand a lot more in ""The Deathly Hallows"" that it would be nice to have seen all the leg work that Harry and Dumbledore actually get up to.I do still wonder what I would think of it and how confused I would be if I hadn't read the books, especially when both of my nephew's are constantly asking questions throughout watching them.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince

74,RainDogJr,Mostly an unexciting summer at the movies!,4,18 July 2009,"This is the very first time I write a comment of a Harry Potter film so I will start saying that of the books I have read just few pages of the first one (Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone) and of the films well I have seen now after seeing on the big screen yesterday's night this one, Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, four and a half of the six. I remember seeing the first one on VHS, the second and third on the big screen and just parts of the fourth one. I'm just not a fan and frankly there's no chance to consider Harry Potter as one of the great movie series. But still I can say that the third one is probably the one I like the most (yet I haven't felt the need to see it for the second time), and this one? Well it was just a big, overlong reminder of why I simply not cared about the fourth one and slept in the theater and of why I simply avoided the fifth one. Will I be watching the up-coming two and last ones of the series? Certainly I don't care how the Harry Potter story ends but maybe if I'm invited like I was yesterday, you know.Anyway, here we have 153 minutes for the dead of Dumbledore, certainly that's the big thing here. Potter will continue the stuff that Dumbledore was doing since in this film it was practically very little their progress. Totally unexciting climax, the rest is practically teenage ""love"" and it delivers very few laughs but really nothing more. Stay away, and yes is an unexciting summer at the movie plus here in Mexico we won't see in theaters two of my most anticipated films (Tarantino's Inglourious Basterds and Brüno) until September and October! But well, in August we will have here films I want to see (Funny People, Drag Me to Hell, The Hangover, Shorts) so I hope I can add some other titles to my list of good 2009 summer films that right now has only Star Trek, Up and Public Enemies.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
75,Matt_Layden,"Pacing issues aside, this is an improvement.",6,3 July 2010,"Harry is in his sixth year at Hogwarts and discovers a book that belongs to someone who called themselves the Half Blood Prince. Dumbledore asks Harry to get closer to the new potions teacher, Slughorn, in order to unlock new mysteries about Voldemort. To me it seems that the films that have come after The Goblet of Fire are just build up to the finale. The theme, story structure and style are all different and neither film (Order of the Phoenix or Half Blood Prince) seem to have a main antagonist or mission for the kids to do. Instead they are a build up of events that will lead to a destructive and emotional ending for our characters that hit the screen in 2001. Each film prior, in some way, can stand on their own. These films cannot. They rely on the previous material so heavily that people who watch it without prior knowledge of events will most certainly be lost in the vast amount of detail that goes on.Half Blood Prince is the better film, compared to the boring and uninteresting Order of the Phoenix. This one gives us a little bit more mystery and one of the biggest 'oh my god' moments of the books. The film doesn't have as much emotional weight as the book does, this is due to a lot of the material missing. Specifically the big battle that was suppose to take place at the end. The filmmakers said they left it out because they didn't want to take away from the battle at the end of the next film. I call B.S. The Two Towers had an important battle that was grand, only to be outdone by the next film. Why can't this series do the same? The film clocks in around 2 and a half hours. It's pretty long and a lot of the scenes drag on. We stay too long on the uninteresting moments and too few minutes are given to the ones that we care about. The filmmakers have a lot to juggle with this series and the decisions made earlier to exclude material might hurt them in the long run. The changes made to the films don't hurt it, only if you are a die hard fan that wants every word translated to the screen. Since the day of adaptations we've seen countless films leave material out. It's expected, so people need to get over it. It's one thing to leave out little details, but for me, it's another to totally ignore the battle sequence. Harry and the other kids are getting better with every film. I absolutely hated both Harry and Ron in the earlier films. While they can still be irritating, they have improved greatly over the course of the films. The same cannot be said for another book to film adaptation that have teenage girls moist thinking about Vampires and Werewolves. The improvement comes from people who really care about the craft of film-making. Every cast member is British and when you are surrounded by people like Alan Rickman, Robbie Coltrane, Maggie Smith, to name a few, the pressure to do well is more apparent. As the series goes on, regulars like Hagrid are dumbed down to cameo roles, unfortunate. The film looks great and the special effects are still strong as is the ability to adapt such a large book. I would personally add more stuff and take away others. The importance of the Half Blood Prince and why/who he is, is left alone. The reveal is there but again, no reason for a why. Each additional character is great, last year we were given the love to hate Dolores Umbridge, this time we get the lovable Horace Slughorn. He has a few comedic scenes and a key moment in the film that helps Harry and Dumbledore with their cause. The Half Blood Prince seems like a more put together film than Order of the Phoenix. The complaints I've heard are all regarding the material that is missing. Yes, while some of it was indeed needed in the film, it doesn't make it bad. I could do with less Quidditch after seeing it for 9 years, focus more on the emotions of the characters and the weight of their actions and less on the stuff we've seen before a hundred times. If you are going by the movies only, this one is one of the better ones. Despite the film's missed opportunity at the ending, it stands as one of the better additions to the series. Prisoner of Azkaban is still my favourite though.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
76,lewiskendell,Another strong entry in the series.,8,13 April 2010,"I look forward to seeing new Harry Potter movies more than nearly any other titles. Whether the images on the screen coincides exactly with the images I imagine when reading the books, or not, it's always fun to see this world come to life again and again. The Half-Blood Prince is one of the better books, in my opinion, so I was especially eager to experience the film version. It certainly wasn't a disappointment. Yes, once again changes had to be made to the original story, and substantial plot-points had to be left out, but Yates did a fairly good job of managing what was cut, while being sure to include the most important bits. I wouldn't mind a 3-hour Harry Potter movie, but 153 minutes was adequate to keep the pacing at reasonable speed, while still doing justice to the plot. Only the most hardcore and puritanical of Potter fans, will be truly dismayed by the changes. Well...a little more Luna would have been nice, but I can deal with that. It's sad that the series is almost finished, but I'm really grateful that great adaptations of the books like these, have been made for the fans to enjoy. Harry Potter and the Half- Blood Prince is comfortably in the top half of the series, in terms of quality. It's just a fun and well-constructed movie.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
77,moviewizguy,"Once again I must ask too much of you, Harry",9,18 July 2009,"Voldemort is tightening his grip on both the Muggle and wizarding worlds and Hogwarts is no longer the safe haven it once was. Harry suspects that dangers may even lie within the castle, but Dumbledore is more intent upon preparing him for the final battle that he knows is fast approaching. Together they work to find the key to unlock Voldemort's defenses and, to this end, Dumbledore recruits his old friend and colleague, Professor Horace Slughorn, whom he believes holds crucial information. Meanwhile, the students are under attack from a very different adversary as teenage hormones rage across the ramparts. Love is in the air, but tragedy lies ahead and Hogwarts may never be the same again.""Happiness can be found even in the darkest of times."" - Albus Dumbledore (Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban)The above quote describes HBP perfectly. There will be no doubt that some will question why this film seems happy and light when dark and evil things are happening outside the castle of Hogwarts. In fact, HBP is the funniest of all in the series so far. I assume the film tries to be optimistic to set up against the dark and depressing last chapter, which will be split into two films, of course. As a fan of Harry Potter, I'm not bothered by this. I'll admit it, I was apprehensive at first when I learned the movie would focus a bit too much on the romantic elements from the book instead of the dark elements. However, I enjoyed the romantic and comedic aspects of the film a lot, and so were the people in the theater. Believe me, you will never see a broomstick the same way ever again.If this information bums a few people out, don't worry. The film is also the darkest of them all. It's a paradox, of course, but getting back on the topic, I'm surprised that the film received a PG rating. Silly MPAA. There are several moments in the film that pushed the action and violence (and hormones - teehee). Along with that, it felt that almost anyone could die in this film. It actually felt dangerous and people are at risk. Some of the Death Eaters certainly do help the case because one of them looks like an escaped prisoner. He was scary. The action scenes are few here, although well executed. I'm not complaining about it because the film didn't feel the need to have as much action scenes as TRANSFORMERS 2 (thank God).I don't remember much of the sixth book so what I saw in the movie is much of a surprise to me as to those who have not read the book, although I do get a vague idea of what's going to happen. I won't really complain about the millions of things are were cut out like I did in the previous film. I try to not complain about the changes from the film from the novel because they are two different entities. David Yates returns as the director. It's obvious he's much more comfortable with the job, seeing how improved this film is over his previous one. He has a great eye given that the film is the most distinct, which is one of the reasons why I liked the movie so much. The tone is so different and the cinematography and lighting is gorgeous.The real magic here, like the previous Harry Potter films and books, are not those of the dazzling action sequences and visual effects, but of us, the audience, seeing the actors themselves grow through the series - tiny human moments that evoke strong emotions. Indeed, this Harry Potter film is the most emotionally satisfying of them all. The three leads are the same as they are, perfect for their roles although nothing Oscar-worthy. Both Michael Gambon and Alan Rickman are given much more screen time, which is a really great thing.Remember the scary-looking Death Eater I was talking about earlier? Well, he is played by Dave Legeno, who certainly did his job well done. Helena Bonham Carter returns as the devilish yet delightful Bellatrix Lestrange. I would give a praise to Tom Felton, because his character is fleshed out in this film. His performance was great. The newcomer here is Jim Broadbent, playing the new Potions teacher Horace Slughorn. He was quite fantastic and memorable in this role. Oscar nomination, perhaps?I wouldn't call this the best, per se. I still think the third and fourth films are the best in the series, but this one is behind those two. I liked the oncoming jokes this movie throws on the screen as well as the dark aspects. And yes, the movie was emotionally satisfying. Although being 153 minutes long, the movie felt like a breeze, unlike TRANSFORMERS 2. If you're a Potter fan, well, I'm not going to finish that statement. If you're a muggle, I can bet you'll like this, although the exposition is cut short here. Those who aren't familiar with the Harry Potter world will be quite confused, like with the new term ""Horcrux."" Pay attention to that word, ladies and gentlemen! It's crucial to the next two films! Anyway, the film is up there with STAR TREK and UP as one of the best summer movies this year, because there weren't very many good ones so far.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince

79,pyrocitor,"Incoherent and misguided, a severe straying from the franchise's quality",6,20 July 2009,"With any literary adaptation there lies a precarious balance between adhering faithfully to the text and re-shaping the content for a suitably cinematic watch, and never has this been more true than with the Harry Potter franchise. Forced to appease a massive fan base, most of the early films favour a talky, slightly clunky style, as if afraid to take chances cinematically at the expense of precious content. As such, it is both a blessing and a curse that with Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, returning director David Yates appears finally confident of just about every potential viewer on the planet being abundantly familiar with Potter lore enough to finally branch out from the irritatingly excessive exposition of the earlier films. The problem being, Yates' chosen approach backfires spectacularly, managing to mostly squander one of the most intriguing narratives in the Potter series in an inane, incoherent mess. Perhaps to inject interest into his adaptation of the book often dismissed as a bridging gap before the climatic events of the final novel, Yates piqued initial viewer interest by promoting his film as the ""sex, drugs and rock 'n roll"" of the Potter series. This description could hardly be more apt, as nearly all of Yates' film plays like an uncomfortable attempt at a teen comedy, complete with scene after scene frequently thrusting aside or bending the content of Rowling's novel for leeringly obvious sex and narcotic references, which could hardly feel less clever or more out of place. Seemingly determined to fish for broad comedy at every possible point, Yates often ruins crucial emotional moments by transfiguring them into deliriously inappropriate bids for laughs, usually helped by a surreal, absurdly out of place musical score. In fact, Yates' most prevalent success is accurately conveying the inherent awkwardness of teen years, but but his penchant for flooding the screen with such moments so frequently makes the film a cringe-worthy watch not only from the content, but the recognition that precious, bladder paining minutes of an already overlong film are devoted to such senseless stupidity. But beyond an ill-advised directorial slant, nearly all the successful components of Yates' superb Order of the Phoenix appear tragically absent. While its predecessor concisely flew along at a rapid but easy to follow and perfectly flowing pace, Half-Blood Prince stumbles over awkwardly abrupt, jarring transitions, feeling clumsy and episodic, especially considering the chaotically fluctuating emotional tone. Similarly, despite attempts to broaden the scope by bringing the 'Muggle world' into the looming conflict, Yates' world of magic feels crushingly small, with the few attempts at drinking in the realm's spectacular wonder feeling throwaway and forgettable. This veneer is hardly helped by the surprisingly poor special effects, as even the most basic CGI sequences (a collapsing bridge, a would be tense Quidditch match) come across as far less believable than efforts from years before. Seldom has an immersion into a world of spectacular wonder felt so dull and uninspired.However, plentiful complaints aside, it is indisputable that the film has its moments - and spectacular ones at that. A couple of fleeting set pieces, and, in particular, a half hour segment during the film's climax, see Yates finally hit his stride, achieving the sublimely dark, gripping and devastatingly powerful tone with which he succeeded in the last Potter film. It is enough to feel almost like adding insult to injury to envision the entire film being as starkly brilliant as its patches of excellence, as they are inevitably followed by more banal, unconvincing romantic wailings or painful attempts at comedy, bringing the momentary exhilarating rush to a screeching halt. Even the acting quality nearly universally suffers, as the three leads, who had previously shown alluring glimmers of gestating talent, seem to be regressing rather than growing in their roles. Daniel Radcliffe retains a solid charisma and confidence but is even less adept at making difficult emotional scenes plausible than in the past, while the delightful Emma Watson is left pouting uncomfortably with insufficient character to work with, and Rupert Grint is often reduced to embarrassing character quirks, or simply ignored altogether. But even more tragic is the sight of supremely reliable thespians as Robbie Coltrane, Maggie Smith and Alan Rickman (the greatest shame, given Snape's crucial role in the film) floundering on autopilot, far from catastrophic but an uncomfortable drop from their usual standards of quality. However, the most objectionable is Michael Gambon's oddly cantankerous Dumbledore, whose miscasting becomes all the more sadly clear through his character's pivotal role in the narrative. While Gambon is an undeniably powerful performer, try as he will, he simply cannot capture the character's trademark twinkle in the eye, and the film's emotional core feels all the more imbalanced from it. There are, mercifully, exceptions, as the presence of Jim Broadbent as Professor Slughorn is a tremendous boon to the film, alternatively delightfully quirky or powerfully poignant given the demands of the scene. Helena Bonham Carter oozes deliciously deranged evil as malevolent Bellatrix Lestrange, and Tom Felton as Draco Malfoy also demonstrates commendable talent, overcoming an important yet underwritten character and rising to the occasion with genuine emotional weight behind his contemptuous sneers. Most supporting characters are inserted with no purpose beyond audience gratification, while others either ferociously masticate scenery, going obscenely over the top (Jessie Cave as Ron's clingy girlfriend) or generate no emotion whatsoever (Bonnie Wright as Harry's love interest Ginny Weasley) amplifying the uncomfortable overtones of the film exponentially. Occasionally funny, very strange and sporadically brilliant, Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince proves a dangerously misguided dip in quality in the franchise, feeling little like a Harry Potter film, and far from any sort of cohesive or compelling film whatsoever. While Yates' taking creative chances marks a commendable effort, one can only hope desperately that a more sensible and gripping tone is settled upon for the cinematic culmination of the series. -6/10",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince

The Harry Potter series has had some great films like The prisoner of Azkaban and The Goblet of Fire. But The Half-Blood Prince is one that goes deeper into the characters lives. Harry (Daniel Radcliffe, who should be in more films )has feelings and things for Ginny Weasly, his best friend's sister. Harry's best friend, besides Ron, Hermione, has feelings for Ron. You get a bit more acting and appearances from some of the characters also. Snape (the always great Alan rickman) has a bit more of a role this time. Tom Felton returns as Harry's long time nemesis Malfoy is walking around trying to kill people and looking like a nazi with the hair done and stuff. And one of my favorite actresses (Helena bonham Carter ) returns as that evil wench Bellatrix Lestrange. The new Harry potter film is awesome in every way. Quit giving your money to the disappointing Transformers sequel and see the new Potter film. If you love him or hate him, go see it.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince

85,jaredmobarak,The binding is really fragile  Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,9,13 July 2009,"It's a real shame that I could never give a film featuring Harry Potter the status of a perfect film. Each tale relies so heavily on those that came before or after that one can never be a truly all-encompassing work. Sure, the three-act structure can be utilized, but without the background info, nor the knowledge that more will be coming, watching a middle installment alone will leave you confused and disorientated. The reason I bring this up is the fact that Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince is good enough to warrant the praise and to put the idea in my head about whether to call it a masterpiece. The tone is perfect, the laughs are many, the darkness is charcoal black—how could this be the same director as the abysmal—in comparison to the rest of the series—Order of the Phoenix, David Yates? Two words  Bruno Delbonnel.Who is Delbonnel you may ask? Well, he is the brilliant cinematographer behind the camera. I may have blamed the failures of the fifth film on its screenplay as Steve Kloves was glaringly absent, (he being the writer of each other film, including this new one), but a film is a team effort. Therefore I guess maybe I shouldn't put all the accolades on one man now; I just feel absolutely compelled to do so because so many moments linger in my mind due to the beauty of their composition and use of their environments to stay interesting and exciting at all times. Visually, you cannot be bored. It just goes to show that it is never the director alone, but also the team he or she brings along. I like Yates and was surprised at how much I disliked his first foray in the Potter universe, granted, I felt the book itself was sub-par at best. Thankfully, he did not disappoint with his second of three, (make that four as book seven goes to a two-part finale), because, as it was with the novels, Half-Blood Prince is by far the best of the series—until Deathly Hallows of course. And adding the pedigree of a guy like Delbonnel, with films such as Across the Universe, A Very Long Engagement, and Amelie in his back pocket—all stunning works of art—only makes his job easier.I can't get over the use of close-ups throughout, or the multiple instances of framing used to hide something on screen. Oftentimes, the camera pans or cuts to reveal something in the fringes, to highlight the focal point when it's not centrally located, or literally move our eyes to exactly where the filmmakers want them to be. The blocking is superb with some scenes blurring the edges and keeping only our main object of interest in focus, timing and positioning executed with aplomb. And did I mention the close-ups? (Yes, I know I did.) One sequence, with Harry and Ginny running through a field of tall grass after intruding Death Eaters, is shot with a high speed pan to keep the characters crisp as the foliage darts and blurs in their wake. I'd be remiss not to mention the special effects as well, especially when dealing with the black smoke trails from Voldemort's flying goons as well as the wispy pensieve. Whether completely computer generated or practical dye clouds in water, the effect is pitch perfect, even dissolving each memory in sections, leaving important pieces, like young Tom Riddle, to be lingered on just a second longer than the rest.As for the leads, Daniel Radcliffe and Emma Watson are solid as usual, (Radcliffe showing some solid comedic chops after taking luck elixir), and Rupert Grint's Ron Weasley gets some room to break free. But it is the supporting roles that deserve notice. Helena Bonham Carter will scare children, so kudos to her, and Michael Gambon's Dumbledore will win even more hearts as his leader finally allows Potter into the inner circle of the plan to rid the world of Voldemort, it now being a circle of two. It is newcomer Jim Broadbent, however, as Professor Slughorn who steals the show. Broadbent is known for his many comical expressions and his rubber face is utilized to great effect here. A blowhard and man with many ""friends"", his jubilant smile and need to collect powerful and famous wizards for his Slug Club are ever-present, bringing some levity as well as effectively hiding the dark secret that lies beneath.Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince succeeds in the details. It is an exercise in minimalism and showing only what is necessary to the plot. Condensing the novel better than ever done before, Kloves has given Yates the tools to make a film and not just a visual representation of the words. What had previously been done best by Azkaban's Alfonso Cuaron, this one works better at retaining more subplots and not stripping it quite so bare. Subtle hints are planted so no longwinded exposition is needed to make us, as an audience, feel stupid and lectured to. Instead Yates and crew allow us to show our intelligence and ability to use our eyes and memories to piece things together, making the experience more enjoyable as we believe we are solving the mysteries and not the director who is skillfully guiding us through. I'd say it couldn't get better than this, but my confidence in Yates has been renewed and my hopes that Deathly Hallows is treated with respect is at one hundred percent, so who knows what the future has to offer?",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
86,vip_ebriega,The magic is back!,9,27 July 2009,"My Take: While both loyal fans and non-fans may get picky, this is a good change of pace for the big-screen series.After much suspension and delay, the much-anticipated HARRY POTTER AND THE HALF-BLOOD PRINCE has finally arrived! The book, which I haven't read, sprouted much controversy amongst Potter fans (myself included) due to many turning points in the series. In short, expectations for this 6th chapter in the ""Potterverse"" are progressively high. So it's just pitiful that the film fans (and non-fans) finally get to see is something their not particularly prepared for. That some people find movies like TRANSFORMERS: REVENGE OF THE FALLEN a better movie to go to than this one is just a sad fact that some people are slowly relying on explosions and endless special effects for a satisfying summer blockbuster, while there are also characters and plot. I wouldn't mind a little escapism myself, but seeing people call this ""boring"" and ""empty"" is just sad.I've not read another HARRY POTTER novel since PRISONER OF AZKABAN, but movies turn out to be good stand-alone efforts that all I needed was some of my Potter know-how to catch up on some of the details. As usual, I had high hopes for this new Potter saga, and like everybody else, turns out I really didn't know what to expect. I've been a connoisseur of the series and lets just say this 6th chapter is like a big reunion in which I marveled at the screen and keep telling myself ""My, look how much they've grown!"". Like any good franchise, it's nice to see these characters I grew up with growing up, with the movie maturing right along with them. Not only is HALF-BLOOD PRINCE a different film in the series, it's quite a different movie-going experience for the uninitiated (and maybe a few of us long-time fans) altogether. David Yates is back for this film and this time, it seems he has grown much more comfortable with the material. Unlike his serviceable but rather rushed ORDER OF THE PHOENIX, Yates not only understands the ""Potterverse"" and acts on it quickly, he also happens to believe that it can be taken one step forward. While not as perfectly balanced as PRISONER OF AZKABAN (still my personal favorite I'm afraid) or any of the earlier movies, THE HALF-BLOOD PRINCE is refreshing change of pace; a dark yet mature adventure balanced with darker chain of events and a witty teen romance, proving that the series can stand alone without too much special effects and too little drama. Still, the fans may find that this one leaves some relevant details from the novel (including a famous battle sequences in the novel), and it shows. Since the movie is anticipating a two-part screen version of the final chapter in the book series, I guess they decided to leave the best parts for that. Even with its distinct lack of action and soaring special effects, I think what's there to admire in HARRY POTTER AND THE HALF-BLOOD PRINCE is the maturity of, not just the story, but the entire series itself. If earlier entries were ""Hardy Boys""-like detective stories and later entries like GOBLET OF FIRE and ORDER OF THE PHOENIX were action entries, then HALF-BLOOD PRINCE should register itself as the drama entry in the series. This is just what the series needed: A deeper and more complex adventure that required less special effects to make it entertaining in its own way. The trio of Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson are back and given much more time to shine with more complexities to tackle in their respective roles. Even Tom Felton as Draco Malfoy is given a chance to become a fully-realized villain than just a ""that bully from the Slytherin House"". As usual, the cast of veterans (Michael Gambon as Dumbledore, Maggie Smith as Professor McGonagall, Alan Rickman as Professor Snape, Helena Bonham Carter as Bellatrix Lestrange, Robbie Coltrane as Hagrid, and Jim Broadbent as Horace Slughorn) bring out the best in their characters.HARRY POTTER AND THE HALF-BLOOD PRINCE is probably lacking in the sort of high-flying fun that the earlier chapters have. Avid readers will be let down by how much have been omitted. But when it came to reuniting us with our beloved characters in their ever-progressing adventures, it delivers. Here's to another smash from everyone's wizard and here's for more yet to come. I can now finally confirm that, of all the new pop-culture icons (Stephanie Meyer's TWILIGHT comes to mind) and the wannabes, the world of our-young-but-no-longer-so-young Mr. Potter is the one that hasn't let me down yet. Rating: ****1/2 out of 5.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
87,educallejero,Abrupt decline in quality,3,11 July 2020,"Visually awful: trying to show how Voldemort's darkness was consuming Hogwarts, they made ugliest Potter movie to date.
Slow: With little actuallly happening (as important as it might be), the movie becomes tedious and boring.
Overtly melodramatic: Almost tv quality of melodrama all over the place. Maybe justified in the books, the constant whining and crying from some characters made it harder to enjoy.
Awful new characters: The annoying Jim Broadbent as the annoying proff. Horace Slughorn was... annoying in every single scene. And we had too a young Voldemort, the typical ""sociopath kid"" with the cliché and annoying sociopathics faces and remarks.In the middle of all of that, there was some great comedic/fun scenes here and there related to the teen drama, and what it was told was important to the overarching story of the saga.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
88,Stampsfightclub,Wonderful adaptation that brings the comedy and magic back,9,22 July 2009,"Girls, Quidditch and a mysterious potion book distract Harry Potter (Radcliffe) from the dangerous events outside Hogwarts whilst Dumbledore sets him a difficult task.After the controversial switch from last November to this Summer the sixth instalment to the best selling book series of all time is finally here and, you may have heard this before, it is bigger and better than its predecessor.At the end of book 5 the Ministry had come to terms with Voldermort's return and so the beginning of The Half Blood Prince, the novel, showed a meeting between the Prime minister and The Minister for Magic. Oddly left out here and so we are treated to a dramatic collapsing bridge and Death Eaters destroying everything in sight. But this has the best opening of them all with a slowly played flashback of Dumbledore taking Harry's arm after the previous events at the Ministry. It sets the perfect tone for the mood of the picture. An underline sense of sadness but with hope.As with all Potter films, there are plenty of elements missing and new parts included. The beginning is equally fun to observe as a waitress chats Harry up but there are no Dursleys again. The Christmas period has a new element of a Burrow attack but no Minister Potter argument. The ending showdown with Malfoy and the Headmaster is changed quite dramatically also.When reading these fantastic books we dive into our own imagination and inevitably the film impairs that vision and we can agree or disagree. So when the final dramatic changes in the Astronomy Tower take place, I personally felt a minor twinge of annoyance. The big structure in the middle hinders the showdown quality, with the crucial spell not as quick as the book played.But it is tricky to really fault this film on anything else because it is blissful enjoyment. The book is darker but this is oddly funny. There are funny relationship scenarios with Rupert Grint on perfect comedy form and finally getting some limelight off Radcliffe. The central star has some equal comic influence, particularly the scene with the lucky potion.The star of this film is probably Grint as it is so grateful to see him more frequently than any other film. But plaudits must surely go to Jim Broadbent who has made Slughorn his own with a stumbling and curious personality that generates comedy and tension at the same time.The plot is well adapted with all crucial elements added. The whole memory/pensive subplot takes a back seat as we learn little of Riddle's true past but the book, the Malfoy scenario and the teenage social aspects get a full thorough working.The teen stars have never been better and this, like we seem to say every year, is the best Potter so far.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
89,fwomp,The Best Harry Potter Film Yet,9,14 February 2010,"I constantly and consistently hear complaints from Harry Potter book fanatics about the film adaptions. Oh they left this out! Oh they left that out! It's the same sorry grumbling time after time. And I wish it would stop. The mediums (literary and theatrical) are not 100% compatible. Period. It will NEVER, EVER happen. This movie alone was 153 minutes long, right in line with the rest of the series in terms of length. But this one stands out quite a bit compared to the others for a couple of reasons...The first is that this is a mature story. As Harry (Daniel Radcliffe, HARRY POTTER AND THE GOBLET OF FIRE), Hermoine (Emma Watson, HARRY POTTER AND THE PRISONER OF AZKABAN) and Ron (Rupert Grint, DRIVING LESSONS) continue their natural physical growth, so does the story. With age comes interest in the opposite sex, increasing responsibilities, and increased danger. It is this last one that stands out for the film, too. Dangerous and dark, this story is the most muted in terms of fun that any of us have seen so far. Director David Yates (THE GIRL IN THE CAFÉ) pulls off a stunningly stark and surreal landscape that has altered Hogswart from a place of fun and learning, to one of deception and dread.The second reason this one stands out is that it never spoonfeeds the viewer. If you don't know what something means, or where you're at, or why someone is interested in someone else, well, you're outta luck. But the connections within the film, if you pay attention, will give you all the answers. I applaud screenwriter Steve Kloves for stepping up and giving us an adult fantasy story that, at times, can make you squirm in your seat or jump out of it. I was actually surprised that the film retained a cool PG rating instead of PG-13.The third reason this film works is that it touches on relationships in a hard way. Fomenting strong bonds with each other, and sticking to them, is not something that is normal in society, and we see the fraying of friendships as they mutate, and watch how death can affect even the sturdiest of hearts.HARRY POTTER AND THE HALF-BLOOD PRINCE outstrips all the other Harry Potter films for these very important reasons. And as for the ending? No complaints on that from me, either. I can't wait to see what Harry and his friends do next.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
90,Ruskington,A strong piece of cinema but far too much material is omitted,6,14 April 2020,"Compared to the preceding two movies, The Half-Blood Prince is a lot less cluttered and much easier to follow. The direction, acting and editing are arguably the best of the series so far and I was particularly impressed by Michael Gambon's performance, who has improved with each instalment. There was probably overkill on the teenage romance dynamics but I thought the actors involved in these scenes did a pretty decent job working with that part of the story.Once again though, large parts of the original story are missing and the film feels very rushed and frantic. The theme of the adaptations is becoming clearer with each release; for die-hard book-readers they are highly disappointing because far too much of the source material is omitted; for people just watching the films they are fairly entertaining but often a little confusing.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
91,fernandoschiavi,"Half-Blood Prince reaches its peak in technical and character development, improving all aspects of the previous film and proves that the adjustments were not made by chance",8,2 January 2021,"Steve Kloves changed important parts of the narrative J. K. Rowling, removed details of certain sequences to make them more dynamic, accelerated in certain passages and contained in others. Action scenes left and teenage romances appear. He joins all subplots with cohesion and makes the powerful climax, not so much in action, certainly in the category emotion (especially for those who had not read the earlier books). In adapting not see some important events: Some characters were cut.Other relationships are more thorough than ever, preparing everything for the completion of the series. One of these moments is the long-awaited kiss between Harry and Ginny. In the book it occurs after Grinfinória win the Quidditch Cup, but it is shown in the Room of Requirement when Harry hides his potions book after using the Sectumsempra spell at Draco. Even with this change is undeniable that the movie scene is very interesting. Gina always liked Harry in the books and movies, but the boy was interested by Cho, the girl acabaou deciding to move on and sometime later began a romance with Dean Thomas. But in this film, from the opening scenes, Harry realizes that he is increasingly in love with Gina and she still likes him. David Yates has managed to create several smaller scenes along the projection in order to bring the two (Harry watched through the window as he desaparata the lake near the home of the Weasley; embrace uncontainable when he arrives at the Weasley house, taking care of her injury in his mouth after he is injured by Malfoy in the nose, the conversation in which Harry tells Ron that Dino was probably with Gina because she was smart, funny and attractive; Harry standing when Gina arrives at the meeting of Professor Slughorn, among others). The scene created to get rid of the Potions book which served for the two had their first kiss is well directed, romantic and packed by Nicholas Hooper beautiful trail to the bottom. It is true that everyone expected a kiss more overwhelming, but in calmer weather and subtle scene ended up being a good solution.The relationship of Hermione / Ron and Lavender / Ron is also well explored in the script by Steve Kloves. Lavender Brown (Jessie Cave, selected among 7000 candidates for the character) is a student in love, the kind of girl that sticks and chokes her beloved. Ron is not really so in love with her and instead, but she was crazy about him and had given attention as no one had given him before. Ron, not even passionate, very fond of Lavender despite acknowledging she suffocates. He also, at heart, he knew it was not in love with Hermione even knowing really sure of your feelings or perhaps unwilling to admit the fact. As the two get closer, Hermione finally reveals his true feelings and have to live with seeing Ron and Lavender increasingly together. She suffers and opens to Harry talking about his real feelings. Jealousy of her for he was never so explicit. Finds Hermione in Harry - who also suffers from Gina who is with Dino - the support of the friend who understands exactly what she is going through and how you are suffering. In the hospital scene after Ron almost being killed by poisoning, which Ron, half unconscious, calls for Hermione and the two are left alone in the room, leaving Lavender angry and realizing that Ron really likes her best friend. The scene is sensitive, fun to show anger Lavender, and touching.This further development of the characters and a larger number of events have been a great chance for everyone to stand out. Emma Watson gives his best performance in the entire series, knowing be fun (note when the meeting Professor Slughorn she tells about the profession of his Muggle parents, when it hits Harry in the library; scenes starring the disregard for romantic overtures of Cormac McLaggen (Freddie Stroma), when she says she will vomit so see Ron with Lavender, the discussion she has with Lavender in the medical wing of Hogwarts). Also she sta more beautiful than ever, and Emma felt with all the suffering at seeing your beloved in the arms of another so long. Rupert Grint also can raise your character. Without exaggerating facial expressions, the actor sees Ron with his wishes being fulfilled. He goes on to play well and be recognized in the Gryffindor Quidditch team, has his first fiery passion and still carries some hilarious scenes, as he is hit by a strong love potion. The scenes of him completely high on the potion are among the best in the long. Daniel Radcliffe has never been better, having to deal with the pain of loving Harry, the book Half-Blood Prince that becomes obsessive and past his biggest rival that lead to real dangers in this. Bonnie Wright, who always had so much space to shine as Ginny Weasley, is a welcome addition to the limelight. She had already appeared with some prominence in the film past, becomes one of the characters that have more scenes throughout the film to develop the relationship between Harry Ginae. But Tom Felton Draco Malfoy composes its so scary, portraying a young tormented and tortured by his conscience and obligation. As addition to the cast, Jim Broabent is irreverent and eloquent with his portrayal of Horace Slughorn, who admires have in your back and registered in your life, the presence of illustrious magicians, which does not prevent it from being sentimental enough to remember the mother Potter. Another who has featured among the cast is young Tom Felton, Draco Malfoy. Even with their expressions slightly caricatured, he lives a conflict and constant fear throughout the film and comes to crying in an outburst at any given time, shifting the weight of responsability passed him in this episode. Surely he is torn and do not want to do what was asked in that year, but at the same time afraid of dying at the hands of Voldemort. Who appears in a few scenes and is also Hero Fiennes Tiffin (nephew of Ralph Fiennes) who is Tom Riddle at age 11, and Frank Dillane who plays the same character teenager. Christian Coulson, interpreter of Tom Riddle in Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (2002), has been tipped to reprise the role in the teenage version of the character, but was discarded because it was considered, at 30 years old, too old for the role.After commanding the fifth film in the series, Yates returns constructing the necessary somber mood and makes the audience feel closer to the characters. Yates dedicates itself well to develop the relationships between the characters, especially between Harry, Ron and Hermione, and also the relationship of the Elect with his mentor, Dumbledore. Focuses on questions of adolescence started in Goblet of Fire and expands everything to be finalized only in the adaptation of the final book. Thus, using planes closed to highlight the varied expressions of the characters, camera in hand in the most disturbing scenes and tense, and in certain scenes plans more open and high. The presentation of Mrs. Weasley, Ron and Hermione in a counter-plongé is very well done. Notice also in the scenes involving Draco Malfoy in the Room of Requirement. Yates uses scenes usually open with the characters more distant with slow zoom in to increase the suspense, which becomes even more present with the use of the soundtrack. The Half-Blood Prince finally puts an end to childhood of their characters. Students are aware of the drama in which the magical world and death through protected round the walls of the school, but without forgetting the passion, anger, pain, jealousy, relevant to this new phase of life. While many blockbuster visual appeal to the battle, the decreases Yates, valuing them as existing plans with beautiful camera.Yates directs with sensitivity passages of teenage love, like Harry and Ginny kiss and the scene of the discussion between Hermione and Lavender next to Ron, who had been saved from a spell just for Harry. The most beautiful scene and still summarizes the proposal of the film is where the camera walks the towers of the castle and see Ron and Lavender kissing (the melancholy of this piece takes the feelings of Hermione in relation to this fact, as well as romantic frustrations her as much as Harry), Draco Malfoy, absorbed in his thoughts about the tough task which was granted. Yates does well also in the passages of suspense and terror (as Harry and Dumbledore began to be attacked by Inferi, action scenes, and mood (with Harry and Ron Potion Felix Felicius with potent love potion, and the scene where Ron sits in the middle of Harry and Ginny disrupting the atmosphere between them offering pie).Even with all the accolades, it should be mentioned that in recent episodes had become quite clear that the villain, Lord Voldemort, was restored and ready to dominate the world, we feel now is a setback in the rhythm, as if all battles had been preserved to the end. The scenes of destruction seen in the trailer even occur in the first minutes of the movie and Voldemort does not even appear. The Half-Blood Prince features a beautiful and melancholy end, when students gathered point their wands at a cloudy and full of mischief. Has the same effect as would have the funeral scene and song of the phoenix Fawkes, but the solution is worthy of applause. David Yates did an exquisite work that reaches its peak in technical and character development, improving all aspects of The Order of the Phoenix and proves that the choice of his name to lead the final part of the adjustments were not made by chance.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince

Having never read the books I don't really go into the movies with any knowledge other than the a few spoilers that you inevitably pick up.The one thing that I've always found disappointing with the Potter movies is the special effects and they continue to disappoint in Half Blood Prince. The acting is again very sound and Jim Broadbent is a stand out in this movie.The movies are becoming progressively darker in nature and they are all the better for it. The other thing that I've noticed is that I now have a bit more empathy for Harry Potter. In some of the earlier movies I wanted Malfoy to give Potter a lesson, but that's no longer true.

93,itamarscomix,Entertaining but still not satisfying for non-book fans,6,23 September 2011,"I enjoyed it more than Order of the Phoenix, mainly because the dark ominousness of the finale actually works this time. But it suffers from the same weakness - emotional inaccessibility, and a general feeling of messiness, both originating in the fact that a huge book is crammed into one movie and a lot is disposed of, but without giving too much thought into forging it into a coherent film. And as someone who hasn't read beyond the third book - I admit it - I felt this was largely an illustration for a book I didn't read, and spent most of the time trying to keep up with the plot and characters, ending up not caring too much for any of them, which means the romantic angle in particular really doesn't work.It's still very entertaining though, and Jim Broadbent gives a very nice performance (making up for the absence of Gary Oldman). Honestly though, I'm quite happy the last part is coming along, because I really want to see how the story ends, but I don't think I can take much more of it getting more complex and having more characters brought in.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince

Not only Half Blood Prince movie is less than half of the novel; but this is a two and a half hours movie where almost NOTHING happens. I suspect, the director unable to transmit the complexities of the book (this and the next one are the darkest of the series) and decided to just fill up the time with unimaginative action scenes (not even in the book) and empty enlarged situation; but nothing that benefits the movie at all. As an example; if you want to know what is the meaning HALF BLOOD PRINCE you will have to read the novel. You will no WHO IS thanks to phrase by the end (""I am the HALF BLOOD PRINCE"" ) but that's all the reference you will get on the books title.

Will (the great) Ralph Fiennes' Voldemort curl like a serpent and encompass the screen with his full evil glory? Will Daniel Radcliffe ever learn proper acting and hold the spectacle together as the heroic character he portrays? Will director David Yates put away all that schoolyard-nonsense once and for all and start making a thriller? Some of these questions will be answered, and some not, in Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince.The Harry Potter series has been growing darker throughout the years, and film by film we've been given more ingredients to relate to; the whole coming-of-age trio of Harry (Radcliffe), Ron (Grint) and Hermoine (Watson) sailing through adolescence, the darker underbelly of Hogwarts, the ever enlarging ensemble of characters, and the seriously evil powers that Voldemort beholds. In this sixth installment we continue this, and though being possibly the least action-packed of them all, this one focuses more on the fairly complicated plot uncovering - and so to answer one of my early questions, yes; Yates actually paces this as a sort of dark thriller. But still sadly, he is merely thorn between his needling plot, and making a teenage romance that gushes forth, appropriately or not. Anyhow, Yates baldly fires his cylinders with a sharp eye for detail, and so his confidence of nitpicking through J.K. Rowling's book shows him in the final end as the captain of this Harry Potter spectacle; he doesn't go for the mainstream, he aims for something a bit more clever, a bit more cinematic - and though he doesn't always achieve it, he deserves amounts of praise for trying! Now, as with all the Harry Potter films, the crew of characters are greatly colorful; Alan Rickman as the slick Severus Snape is always a delight, Michael Gambon washes the floor with the late Richard Harris (by all means, he was great, RIP) as Dumbledore, Jim Broadbent (what a joyous fellow!) is dearly welcomed as the new teacher Slughorn, Helena Bonham Carter as Bellatrix is fantastic, and sadly Ralph Fiennes only appears in a short flash as the evil puppet master he has become, Tom Felton goes complex as the immensely developing Draco Malfoy and Emma Watson and Rupert Grint are both enormously charming backing Harry up through tough times when both the character and actor really needs it.

This loses none of the vast imagination and inventiveness of it's predecessors, and at the same time is decidedly a very still, brooding, tense, and suspenseful film.Most of all, though, it is good solid drama, with believable and significant conflicts having a spacious canvas on which to play out in the aftermath of the fearful situation created by the political intrigues of the previous film and starring actors who luckily have all grown up to be good enough actors to play full-blooded scenes.There's a nice balance where humor has a strong presence throughout, but is a current under the pervasive sense of dread, rather than interrupting it. There is a satisfying theme addressing loyalty and the lack thereof that permeates both the interpersonal dramas involving Harry and his friends' interpersonal relations and the increasing sexual and romantic tensions between them, as well as the dangerous Big Events surrounding Voldemort's return. Michael Gambon is an extraordinary actor, and he really gets enough time here in several scenes to display that; he makes really human and believable a character who could easily become a stereotyped fantasy Wise Wizard. Jim Broadbent has a great dramatic turn as an enigmatic new professor whose secrets are revealed slowly and with effective suspense. The character of Luna Lovegood has more screen time and becomes even more delightfully original and eccentric.In large part, this is the lengthy, big-budget, based-on-the-hit-book movie done right: it uses its length to genuine scenes with genuine actors, it's not forced to fill the screen with action and special effects every five minutes, but when the driving story demands them they are as impressive as anything of their kind that shows up on our screens. There's a great variety of material but it all comes around to lead uniformly to the difficult but, it seems, necessary tragic conclusion. In sum , a success, and it made me wish until the final film or films had been released before my marathon.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
98,manitobaman81,Good,7,22 August 2014,"Here's my first thought: The editing lets the actors breathe and the music lets the atmosphere live. As Potter begins his sixth year at Hogwarts, he discovers an old book marked as ""the property of the Half-Blood Prince"" and begins to learn more about Lord Voldemort's dark past. The film is more than just a glimpse into the life of a man who does know how to live, but I was wondering if he served more as a metaphor for everyone of us as a part of the human race who live better when we're on a leash. I think it could use some editing to speed the pace a bit. The film is hard to watch at times and difficult to call enjoyable, but the story is nonetheless powerful.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
99,grahamsj3,Too much liberty taken with the book,4,17 December 2009,"J K Rowling really needs to have some stronger input into the screenplays because half of her HBP book is missing from the film version. This film just left me feeling ho-hum. I was expecting to see the big first ""Battle of Hogwarts"" going on while Draco Malfoy, et al, were confronting Dumbledore in the tower. Also, why was Harry cowering down below instead of under his invisibility cloak on the tower - I saw no point at all for that change. In the books, Harry is becoming more and more attracted to Ginny, but is fighting it because she's Ron's sister. In the film, it's as if he's loved her all along and Ron has always been aware of it. But the most glaring omission is the entire Tom Riddle backstory, told as a series of memories in the books and pretty much not told at all in the film. I really wanted to see the Marvolos and Tom's early years at Hogwarts (and, of course, a snake nailed to the door). And, while the book takes great pains to describe how dark Horcruxes are, in the film, there's no real sense that anyone thinks them all that evil. There's too much emphasis placed on the snogging of Ron and Lavender while Hermione can just stand by helplessly. All in all, a very poor adaptation of the book, almost ploddingly executed and a pretty dull film in contrast to a well-paced book. I sincerely hope the Deathly Hallows are better than this one.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
100,deatman9,Uggg....So much left out,6,14 November 2012,"I know I say it with every review I write of this series but Im sorry I have to say it again and its the worst yet. However the movie is not bad the acting is actually getting pretty decent and the special effects are good while the movie is very intriguing and interesting. If you have no read the book you will probably enjoy the movies much more but if you have read the book you know what I mean..they left out too much stuff.As Harry Potter begins his 6th year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, he discovers an old book marked mysteriously ""This book is the property of the Half-Blood Prince"" and begins to learn more about Lord Voldemort's dark past.This movie was still good and for anyone who likes the books I do suggest you watch it just because it is Harry Potter and it is fun to see you childhood hero on the big screen but it leaves out so much of the book and adds and changes certain scenes. Some unimportant scenes are played out way too much while very important scenes are left out completely. Very upsetting to say the least. I would give this movie a lower rating but simply because of the effects and the fact that its harry potter I give it a 6.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
101,mikayakatnt,Borefest,2,16 May 2020,"Honestly, after watching the entire series recently, I forgot this film existed. It was that forgettable.Disclaimer: I never grew up on the Harry Potter series nor have I read the books. So my review may be biased.Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince continues from where the story left off at Order of the Phoenix. But the momentum is completely effed up.Audiences are introduced to the ""Half-Blood Prince"" in a textbook near the beginning. But the film forgets Half-Blood Prince's textbook about this for 2 hours until the big reveal. The rest of the plot is twisted with awkward ""love"" sequences, more Quidditch, useless Hogwarts staff, and more world-building. So much filler that I forgot this installation was about the Half-Blood Prince.As usual with the Potterverse films, there's comic relief, witty remarks, some magic. Radcliffe, Grint, and Watson do their best to save what mess this film is but frankly, it's not enough.1/5.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
102,Prichards12345,A Return To Form,8,18 July 2009,"The sixth of the Harry Potter films is a definite improvement on the previous effort, which was largely static and drab-looking. Director David Yates has learnt from his mistakes, coaxed better performances from the young leads and visually made the movie far more arresting.This may not be for the fan base, as much is cut from the book and a fair number of changes made. However, on a cinematic level I found it entertaining, occasionally moving and a good lead-in to the final instalments to come.I won't go into the plot for fear of giving spoilers to those who have not read the books, but the movie is well-balanced this time out - the Potters have got progressively darker as time as gone on - here there is shading, with plenty of laughs to offset the darker moments. Rupert Grint appears to be developing some talent as a comic performer.Indeed, the actors all seem much improved after the listless Order Of The Phoenix. Michael Gambon at last makes Dumbledore his own, and Tom Felton gives his best performance so far as Malfoy. But Jim Broadbent steals the show as Horace Slughorn; along with Imelda Staunton in Order Of The Phoenix his is the best showing in the entire series. I also thought the music score was excellent after a few mediocre outings in the previous films. The film actually felt epic in a Lord Of The Rings kind of way; the first time I've experienced that with the Potter films.All told this is a return to form for the Franchise.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
103,Movi3DO,Story was not as intriguing as it could,8,17 June 2021,"Sectumsempra, aka non-lethal Avada Kadavra.The danger and treachery continues to plague Harry and his friends at Hogwarts.But first, the teen drama continued to get more spicy as the trio now got into a love polygon with other students. Most of it was funny and interesting, but some felt sudden and not adequately developed, even considering the past movies. Probably the book built the relationships more.One thing I noticed was that the color became more monotonous and dark, which reflected how grim the story was turning. The Dark Lord and his servants had more violent and destructive schemes. Honestly, at a couple of points I wasn't sure where the movie was going. Once the purpose was revealed, it became shocking and a major turning point in the story.As the title mentioned, the half-blood prince was introduced early on, but it took a while before the character was revealed. However, we actually knew this character already, and considering the nature, I wasn't too surprised, but it definitely raised questions that I hoped would be answered in the next movie.A problem with this title was that it felt like subplot. The majority of this movie didn't involve the half-blood prince much.Overall, still a grand adventure with a mix of romance and dark magic. The plot was a bit uneven though. 7.5/10.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
104,qormi,Horribly Awful Garbage,1,31 July 2009,"Once again, I dutifully took my wife to see the latest installment of the Harry Potter series. I was completely bored and actually thought about suicide. The acting was so amateurish it makes a 1940's matinée serial like Flash Gordon seem like Citizen Kane. Nothing happened in this boring bore of a film. Things seemed to liven up every 45 minutes or so when a Gothic looking girl dressed in black cackled as she burned something to the ground. After a minute, she disappeared and you were back to the boring premise of weird looking teens having a crush on one another. This film was utterly stupid, poorly acted, and excruciatingly boring. Captive terrorists at Guantanimo Bay should be forced to watch this film repeatedly until they reveal where Osama Bin Laden is hiding.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince

106,DonFishies,The return of Harry Potter is much better than expected,8,15 July 2009,"Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince, much like the other films in the series, picks up almost immediately after the events of the last film with Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) and Professor Dumbledore (Michael Gambon) revealing Voldemort's return to the wizarding community. But despite this ongoing threat, Harry just wants to be a normal teenager chasing pretty girls and spending time with friends. But with Death Eaters trying to break into Hogwarts, and strange occurrences Harry is sure Draco Malfoy (Tom Felton) is involved with, life is anything but normal.Following up the near catastrophically disappointing Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix with what is essentially a filler book is clearly not any small task for director David Yates. While I was not enthusiastic about trusting him with another entry in the series, it seems to have been a good thing that I did. Prince not only excels greatly in areas Phoenix failed, but improves upon the hastily written book (in no small part due to the return of screenwriter Steven Kloves). Yes, it gets bogged down in excessive narrative meandering like the book does, but then it was almost guaranteed to right from the start.But unlike the action-packed Phoenix, Prince has nothing to fall back on except for exposition. There is so very little action that it almost feels like alien in light of the other entries in the series; a unique entry if you would believe it. But even in its longest of dialogue filled scenes, Prince zips along with very little trouble. The dialogue is just so seamless and natural. Everyone looks and sound laid back in their roles, and even the cheesiest pieces of dialogue sound great here. I was genuinely impressed with just how much of an improvement this film was over the last one just in the exposition and story alone. Sure this film lacks the focus on the titular Prince that the big reveal deserves, but what is here is more than enough to make up for it.Speaking of the actors, everyone in the cast seems to just be getting better and better as the films go on. Radcliffe sizzles on screen, as do Rupert Grint and Emma Watson as Ron and Hermione. Bonnie Wright does an amazing job amping up Ginny quite considerably, as does the always reliable Alan Rickman as Snape. Gambon delivers another great performance as Dumbledore, Helena Bonham Carter continues to be deliciously evil as Bellatrix Lestrange and Jim Broadbent is an excellent addition as Slughorn. But the real star is Felton, who outshines just about everyone in the cast. He does not get many lines surprisingly, but gets a lot of time just to emote. And his facial expressions say so much more than words ever could. I look forward to the final two films just to see if he can continue the seriously conflicted back-and-forth Malfoy exhibits throughout the film.But it is not all great. The film does drag as it nears its ending, and at 153-minutes, it could have done with a a small edit. It never becomes mundane, but slight boredom does set in before the climax. This may be because of the inherent lack of action, but feels more inclined to the fact that the source material left too little of an option of what not to include. I realize I disliked certain scenes being cut out, but some of what was included covered too much of the same territory at once, and some scenes actually look like they were repeated out more than once. Some much needed scenes are missing altogether. It takes away from an otherwise excellent screenplay, and makes it feel like the filmmakers are not learning from their mistakes. J.K. Rowling is a superb fiction writer, but ever since Harry Potter caught on with the masses, she seemed to lose her taste for brevity. After four films, Kloves should know better by now of what he needs and does not need to help form a story good enough for readers and non-readers to understand.The film also spends a bit too much time on the sexual escapades of the cast, and not enough on the titular Prince. While the real joy of this very dark picture comes from Harry and Ron's hormones catching up with them, some of these scenes just do not need to be here. And while subtly has never been a strong suit in the franchise, a lot of these scenes practically beat the audience over the head with what is going on in case they were totally lost (chances are, most will not be). There was a bit too many homoerotic and pedophilic overtones for my liking as well. As for the Prince, there is just too little of a focus on him. When the big reveal comes, it feels like a wasted opportunity, instead of how earth shattering it is in the book. More on this character could have only made the film stronger and blended in with its immense backstory motif.While the CGI has improved over the last round as well (look no further than the opening bridge destruction for proof), Prince is just an all around better movie than Phoenix. It has a better sense of where it wants to go, and an even greater sense of how to take the audience there. It has its shortcomings, but the movie remains one of the better entries in the franchise anyway (and stands as a stellar improvement over the disappointing book). I went in with low hopes, and ended up being very impressed at the film Yates and his crew created. With two more movies to go, I (and everyone else) can only hope that things continue to improve from here. The real challenge for the filmmakers has yet to come.8/10.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
107,sashank_kini-1,Probably the best of the series,9,20 July 2009,"I found this film much, much better than the fifth part. I did not like the fifth one mainly because the action seemed a bit silly. And even though this movie too has its problems, its still very likable due to its story and its acting.Harry's sixth year mainly focuses upon his love interest (not only his, but Ron's and Hermione's also). It also digs deep into Voldemort's childhood and later life. Much of the film however focuses on the former rather than the latter. The balance should have been there. There should have been one or two more instances from his life. However, the love story is explained very well.The acting comes as a surprise in this part. For example, Tom Felton, Alan Rickman, the girl who portrays Lavender Brown and Helena Carter shine in this movie. I was really impressed by Tom Felton's performance who looks more mature in this movie. His role gets a bit complex and he plays it well. Helena is fabulous as the madcap Bellatrix with all her craziness adding to her performance. Alan Rickman would has got many awards if his role was longer. He was particularly impressive in the starting scene. Lavender girl too shines in her role as the love interest of Ron who keeps sticking to him like a chewing gum stuck under one's shoes. She plays her character really well.I was also impressed by Michael Gambon's performance for the first time since he has understood his role properly. Rupert, Bonnie and Emma to shine in their respective roles. Daniel too has done a good job but overdid it a bit during Aragog's death scene. It was a bit odd to watch him clap like a baby when Slughorn and Hagrid were singing. And, talking about Slughorn, how could I forget about him. The actor fits into the professor's shoes perfectly.And the guy who plays teenage Voldemort excels in his short role. He seemed to be really creepy. The movie never drags at all and I was surprised when it was interval already. The story keeps progressing wonderfully and keeps the viewers hooked.Few problems in the movie were:1) The scene where death eaters attack Weasley's house: Not there in the book, waste of five minutes ( speaking of the Weasley's, I found the twins actually funny for the first time)2) Shift from the main story: The love story was really done well. But one can't deny that it was a bit of a distraction from the main story, which is supposed to be of Voldemort's past.3) Reaction to Dumbledore's death: Odd reaction by some people. I was expecting Hagrid to shed a bucketful of tears but he was just staring at Dumbledore. Only Harry seemed to care a lot about him.In spite of these small problems, I loved the film and would love to watch it again. 9 out of 10.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
108,griffolyon12,Into the Pensieve,9,15 July 2009,"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince might just be one of the better Harry Potter films released thus far. Director David Yates and screenwriter Steve Kloves took the novel and translated the spirit and integrity of the story into moving images. Like the book it is more of a character piece than an adventure film, but the greater emphasis on character makes the emotional climax have a greater deal of resonance.I see no real need in simply rehashing the story because my words couldn't do it justice. David Yates has improved a great deal since the previous film. He draws the focus on the characters so perfectly that you often forget all that is going on in the world. Yates has scaled the story down to its very essence. Probably any other director would try and make the film feel as epic as they can, but Yates takes a more subtle approach that serves the story beautifully. On top of that, the acting is possibly be the best work from the Potter ensemble yet. Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, and Emma Watson have all grown as actors since the last film and are truly transforming into very fine actors with promising careers ahead of them. As well, Michael Gambon turns in a performance that could rival Richard Harris's Dumbledore, being a deeply affecting performance that genuinely comes through in the cave scene. Plus, Jim Broadbent is superb as the new Potions Professor Horace Slughorn, playing the character with the right amounts of wit, charm, and tragedy. Though the actor that surprised me the most was Tom Felton as Draco Malfoy. Tom hasn't had much to do in the previous Potter films, so we've never really been able to tell if he could pull off more than just the bully role, but he manages to achieve success and he plays his conflicted part here very well. Of course, acting aside, I think it is safe to say that this is probably the prettiest Harry Potter film to date. Cinematographer Bruno Delbonnel does a superb job giving back a sense of fantasy to this world. The film looks very much like a painting and every image within is a genuine work of art. As well the special effects are taken up a notch this time around. ILM has done a wonderful job with the effects work, but it's how Yates utilizes the effects to service the story that truly makes them pop. Never does Yates do an in your face effects shot, to where you clearly know that you aren't looking at a real thing. Yates weaves the effects seamlessly within this world and you never truly think about them while watching, and that's the magic of cinema. Though the biggest props on the film should go to Steve Kloves. After sitting out the fifth film, Kloves returns to pen this installment of the franchise and what a welcome return it is. He has come back with a new energy that genuinely comes through in the script. He has trimmed much material from the 600 page book, but has left all of the major points to the story in tact, weaving them together and connecting the dots into a film that flows very fluidly from scene to scene. However Kloves' greatest accomplishment is how he brings out the humanity of J.K. Rowling's characters in his writing. Half-Blood Prince is arguably the most human installment of Harry Potter to date. Some casual moviegoers may be disappointed to learn that this is not an action film, but rather a character piece that just happens to have a few thrilling sequences within, but those few sequences are electrifying. The Quidditch match is brutal and exciting, the attack on the Burrow is a fast-paced chase scene, the bathroom blow out is exquisitely realized, and the cave sequence is tense and frightening. Plus, there are many moments of simple awe and wonder within this film, such as the scene where Dumbledore creates the ring of fire to fend off the inferi, or some of the sweeping shots of Hogwarts. Of course it's the emotional scenes that steal the show, such as the one between Harry and Hermione on the stairs, or the scene in Hagrid's Hut near the end. There are just too many great moments to mention them all.When all is said and done, Half-Blood Prince is one of the more satisfying filmgoing experiences I've had in a while. It's a beautiful film that is actually quite funny, but is also quite moving at the same time. It's definitely on my list of favorite films of the year. I can't wait for Deathly Hallows. I'm extremely glad the duo of Yates and Kloves are returning to finish out the series.I give Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince an excellent 9 out of 10!",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince

110,meydiana-65242,Key Points missing!!!,10,19 October 2020,"If you love the series like I do you will know that in every movie they have to cut parts of the book out. Most of the time they manage it without compromising the integrity of the film. This time they fall very short of the mark. For those that have not read the book this movie will impress. The effects are top notch and it is a very engrossing film. I understand the need to cut the movie in order to fit it into a realistic time frame. In doing so, it seems as if they cut key parts in order to allow for more comedy. They also cut out a large action scene at the end of the movie. This scene could have been added if not for the adding of a scene in the middle that was not part of the original book. Furthermore, the scene makes no sense because during which they destroy something that is key to the book in the seventh volume. Not only do they cut scenes, but they change others to suit what purpose you might ask? The unfortunate answer is I don't know. Another minor point that I noticed during the movie is, although there is not as much violence as previous movies the overall film includes adult content that in my opinion warrants the pg-13 rating.Do not misunderstand me. I recommend seeing the movie as it is enjoyable, but trying to change a masterpiece like J.K. Rowling's book is a mistake and I think this movie suffered from it. If I didn't have the book to reference I would've rated this movie an 8, but the simple fact is I do and it unfortunately falls short..",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince

112,LoneWolfAndCub,One of the worst adaptations I've ever seen,4,16 July 2009,"I will keep this review short, sharp and to the point. The sixth Harry Potter book is by far my favourite, with a nice balance of story, character building and action. This movie, however, is probably the one of the worst of the movies. Despite the entire cast giving great performances and the usual excellent special effects and score, the story was appalling, with so many vital points omitted and needlessly changed. So, to put this simply: fans of the book will come out sorely disappointed and fans of the movies will come out happy, but slightly confused. The pacing is all over the shop, most of the movie just jumps from scene to scene until the last half hour in which everything slows down for awhile.I feel I need to list some of the things which were cut, and were sorely needed for a more complete Harry Potter experience. Without these, this film just piles on copious amounts of information and expects the audience, fan or not, to be able to understand. So, to begin: - Rufus Scrimgeour's character is gone, meaning the entire first chapter is gone. - The Dursely's are absent as well, meaning one of the funniest chapters is also gone. - The Gaunts are also cut, meaning one of the most vital memories is, you guessed it, not there. - The battle at Hogwarts at the end...is gone...completely. This confuses me, as this was an amazing chapter. - Also, the final chapter has been cut, which is just stupid in my opinion. - There is much more, but I don't want the list to go on forever...Now, David Yates has given excuses for leaving this stuff out, but they are poor and just weak. With book as complicated and rich as The Half Blood Prince you have to film almost every scene to get a full picture. This movie is adequate in terms of ""blockbuster entertainment"" but fails to do justice to its source. Despite it being mostly entertaining and quite funny, I can only give it... 2/5",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
113,doctorsmoothlove,Harry Potter is not Twilight,4,6 August 2009,"Another year, another Potter film. Not actually. We've been without a franchise entry for almost two years with no good fantasy film to compensate. Twilight was an inadequate substitute, even if Half-Blood Prince isn't up to series standards. The two movies are, unfortunately, too similar. Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince is heavily influenced by its contemporary rival. As many hormones jitter around, the film is saved by a surprising dark story.This Harry Potter film opens with no Dursley sequence. We are taken to Hogwarts immediately. Harry notices Malfoy acting strangely, keeping to himself, and visiting a restricted portion of the castle. Harry also finds a textbook formerly owned by the ""Half-Blood Prince"". For being the title of the movie, the prince is rather unimportant. At the end, someone says ""oh by the way, I'm the half blood prince."" Unimportant princes aren't all that detract from the movie. Potter seems to have taken a cue from Cullen and included much romantic drabble.Harry loves Ron's sister Ginny but she is dating another guy. Oh, and Hermione loves Ron but cannot tell him. Ron, being more stubbornly naïve than any Final Fantasy protagonist, fails to notice her interest and starts dating someone else. Seriously, the central portion of this film is forgettable fluff that ignores established characterization. Hermione's personality is filtered to the point of only serving as Ron's secret admirer. Unlike previous films, she has little relevance to the plot. Ron, being her love interest, is even more poorly developed than she. He is now a stereotypical dumb jock who lacks the tenacity of previous titles.After lighthearted banter for so long, the final portion is surprisingly intense. Harry and Dumbledore look for Voldemort's remnants. He-who-must-not-be-named has sealed his soul in various objects (a common video game plot device). Malfoy summons death eaters who enter and murder Dumbledore. Harry then promises his friends that he will find the remaining pieces of Voldemort's soul and destroy them.I once watched commentary on a children's program in which the series creator mentioned his inclusion of ""fun"" episodes to counter the ""heavy"" material in that particular season. This movie makes the same mistake. It underestimates people's ability to enjoy complexity. The running time of this movie could be reduced by nearly one hour if director David Yates had eliminated unnecessary ""cute"" scenes. Harry Potter is not Twilight or Eragon. This is a film and a saga with a rich story and deep characters. I haven't read the 6th book, but I still feel disappointed. I have to give a negative review to an otherwise fine film simply because it engorges itself on fanservice clichés.I'm an outspoken critic of the MPAA, and I usually lambast their conservative approach to sexual material and liberal approval of violence. This movie has a good dose of both with only a PG rating. This will be one of the few times I disagree with them for giving a film too low of a rating. This is clearly a PG-13 motion picture. The romantic parts are full of innuendo that children will not understand. When Ron falls under influence of a love potion, yes a love potion, Harry gives him a pillow to cover his crotch. The fluff is an attempt to sympathize with aging Potter fans and contrasts sharply with plot progression. I've never seen a PG film that explicitly depicts a character's death as directly as this one. Convulsions and blood are also present, though in small dosage. I think the rating doesn't accurately reflect the intended audience. Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince would have made a fine 2 hour film. At its indulgent 3.5 hours, most audiences will enjoy only part of it.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince

118,willcundallreview,This is a real step up as the series approaches the near end,8,10 July 2015,"Rating-8/10Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince is the sixth time we see Harry Potter in film and oh what an emotionally dark year. This movie seemingly changes the entire series, makes it completely new and refreshing, mixing comedy with the dark parts, fun little adventures with teenage love. The movie isn't airtight but it seems this is a step up from the previous two in the series and one I feel really showcases the very best of what Harry and co have to offer, even if you are only seeing Harry Potter for the first time now.I said about the darkness and it seems to run through the entire movie it seems, with splotches of even black comedy in some places. This is the way in which I feel you should make a fantasy movie, obviously with such a massive budget not many get this kind of opportunity but this truly shows how to do it well. The story runs a long nicely and our three heroes bring into the game teenage love, which becomes a recurring theme of this, as well as the scary threat that dark forces present.Daniel Radcliffe completely puts himself into a new gear here, turning from a young boy wizard into near fully grown man, as Dumbledore remarks ""I think you need a shave Harry"", it shows how far all have come in this. Now this is the kind of movie that of course has top class acting but I felt for the first time ever in the Harry Potter franchise that the young actors(such as Grint, Watson, Felton etc) actually stand up toe to toe with the likes of Alan Rickman, Maggie Smith and the such, it's great stuff and the best acted of the series so far.Now I can't hide that I wasn't too keen on the script, but only when it works alongside David Yates and his direction. Some scenes for me seemed like I have seen before, too obvious. What I mean is there are times when scenes are just too set up, they don't flow enough and although I like Yates and his direction(especially the end half), the script isn't the best of the adaption's from Steve Kloves. There is very little surprise this movie received nominations such as in the Cinematography and special effects, this movie blends the technical side beautifully, making this a swift movie, where the scenes can cut fast or cut slow, but either way it works perfectly.Now one thing Harry Potter films do well is get the design part right, and yet again this is absolutely no exception, the sets get bigger and better, the lighting and again the effects get more pin point on to accuracy. I think the sinister kind of background to this movie makes the sets more dark but work better, the earlier films in the series had dark design sure they did, but this one is the first where the emotion matches the set, and then doesn't look silly either.So what is there to look out for in this one, you'd think after having five before this, Potter movies would be getting faded and dull, not in my opinion and also in most others minds I have seen too. I mentioned Tom Felton among the young cast who get better and he is one of the stand out people here, new addition Jim Broadbent gives this his extra touch and brings in to the series a whole lot of new comedy, but also more serious and suspicious behaviour etc. Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince is long but worth the watch, and could become one of if not your favourite of the entire franchise.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
119,alcantaraj-16594,UNEVENTFUL BUT GREAT,9,26 November 2018,"Because it focused too much on the love story and less on creating the mystery of who the Half-Blood Prince is, therefore, excluding Dumbledore's death, making this the most uneventful film in the series, along with the fact that I disliked Bonnie Wright's acting & some things did not make sense for people like me who has not read the books, it is very surprising that I still loved ""Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince.""

120,sunznc,Some of this seems tired,7,11 August 2009,"Let me start by saying that I'm not a HUGE Harry Potter fan. I've seen all of the films but I've never read the books. I am told that because I haven't read the books this is why I am sometimes in the dark about what I'm seeing on film. It seems esoteric to me. That aside, I will say that this film has some good special effects and CGI. Very good! Also, I loved the sets. They are charming and inviting and curious. All the colors and textures are perfect! The acting is good but doesn't seem like much of a stretch for these experienced people. And it didn't feel like anything too new to me. Some of the scenes just felt very familiar and even a little stale. How do you keep something like this interesting when it has the same characters as the films before it? I have no answer. I just know that this didn't feel like a new film to me. I believe there are two more left. Hopefully, they'll be a bit more new & exciting. Somehow.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
121,david-meldrum,"Not Without Strengths, But Ultimately Far Too baggy",7,25 June 2021,"Genuine and well-staged darkness and visual spectacle can't make up for a baggy running time - the whole film could be 45 or so minutes shorter and sacrifice little in terms of plot or character. The love sub-plots feel like they get in the way; the first hour or so could be half that length; the rest of the film is only marginally less over-long. The strengths are real and effective, but it's hard not to think it could have been more so with more discipline.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
122,EthanBJones_03,It's a great MOVIE but falls short as a book-film adaptation,9,4 March 2017,"Directed by David YatesStarring Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson and Rupert GrintOverall: On its own, this movie is actually a really good and well made movie. As a book-film adaptation, it falls very short and that is a major complaint for many fans.Good: 1. Daniel Radcliffe does a great job as Harry Potter,2. Rupert Grint does a good job as bumbling Ron Weasley as does Emma Watson as Hermione Granger.3. Michael Gambon does a phenomenal job as Albus Dumbledore and does a better job here than I imagine Richard Harris would have done.4. Jim Broadbent does a great job as Horace Sloghorn, and gives the character numerous layers of depth.5. Alan Rickman is Alan Rickman. Nothing more needs to be said of the matter.6. Tom Felton plays a much larger role as Draco Malfoy and explores numerous sides of the character not previously explored.7. Bonnie Wright also gives a great performance and plays a much larger role in the movie.8. I love the cinematography and set design.9. Awesome effects, especially near the end.Bad:1. Out of the many things left out of the book-screen script, the reason as to why Snape is the Half-Blood prince is one of the main ones and is very stupid. I know why he is but the casual audience member probably won't and that defeats the object of it.2.

123,kdnor2011,"What up with the hate, I thought it was awesome",9,31 March 2010,"Plot: In his sixth year at Hogwarts, Harry is given private lessons from Dumbledore. So as Harry is learning about Voldemort's past, Malfoy begins to sneak off for extended periods of time, trying to carry out the deed, that He who must not be named asked him to do. Review: It seemed like it was destiny for this to be my least favorite in the series, or at least one of my least favorites. The book is my least favorite of all the books, it wasn't bad, there were just so many moments were it dragged that every time I reread the series thats the one I look forward to the least. Yet somehow, this became one of my favorites, in fact, as of today, it's my third favorite in the franchise.Why, it follows the book. After two OK adaptations, we finally got the first pretty good adaptation since Prisoner of Azkaban, and even though Sorcerers Stone and Prisoner of Azkaban stay closer to the books, I like this one even more. Now yes, I know that there is stuff cut from the book such as the whole flashback of that old woman who had Slytherins Locket and Hufflepuffp's cup. Tonks and Lupin had bigger roles, and the Weasley's house didn't burn down. But it seems that this is the first film since Prisoner that put stuff in, that I thought they would cut out. And while I would have liked more of Neville, the Dursleys, and Luna, they weren't that important in the book.So how did my least favorite of the books become one of my favorite movies. Well, it wasn't as boring. It had a good pace, I was never bored unlike some parts in the book. Also some of the actions scenes were cool. Although I think they did mess up the end, I wanted more action for the battle of Hogwarts, and see Dumbledore's funeral, but I think the reason this film works so well is the characters. The actors really do a good job here, and thus the movie doesn't need to rely on heavy visuals and action to keep my interest, just the plot and characters. And I actually liked the whole burning down the burrow scene, it's to show that no where is safe, the burrow was the only other home Harry had besides Hogwarts, so to show it burn is basically just as bad for him as it is for the Weasleys.Like I said, the movie isn't perfect, but everything that works in this movie, works really well. It amazes me though that this is the one that cost the most to make, yet it has the least amount of visuals of all seven. It was at this point that I knew David Yates was going to do a great job with the rest of the series.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince

Now, different from the other movies in the series, ""The Half-Blood Prince"" is maybe one of the many Potter flicks to have great characters, visual effects, cinematography, and many moments of drama and suspense. But this movie contains separation from some of the important characters in this movie, and only a few moments in the film made no point. Also, some moments in the film felt like I was watching another episode of ""Gossip Girl"". But there were also positive comments on the film that included: Jim Broadbent's new performance, the neat visual effects, the cool cinematography, the new and improved storyline, and let's not forget that the Malfoy character has reached a more darker side to the role. Well, I'm not saying the movie is bad, I'm just saying the movie was cool and powerful, but some moments kind of made a fool out of the film. Well, sometimes we just have to understand what the Potter films will bring next. But I still think the movie was well-interesting, and it's another personal favorite film in the series.

How you've grown.,6,18 July 2009,"As we have seen with the opening sequence of Prisoner of Azkaban (2004) and its metaphor for reaching puberty, the experimenting stages of Order of the Phoenix (2007) has the team in discussions of love and snogging. Now, the Half Blood Prince has truly set the foundations for the Harry Potter clan to now fully transcended adolescences by taking the next step that is young adulthood. It has been a long and sweet journey since the oh so sweet little darlings of The Philosopher's Stone (2001) first stepped into the limelight. The Harry Potter world has finally flowered.This, the Half-Blood Prince has the love potions flowing deep into the arms of the now young adults hearts. It had to happen, we know this, and why not here, and why not now? It has to be addressed and finally getting it out into the open and out of its system is, frankly, a relief. The symbolic, sexual innuendo's, metaphors are present and with a little imagination make this, the sixth adventure, a film that uses tact with a light touch of subtlety that has no reason to hide behind vulgarity and comes across safe for a family viewing. Look behind the magic, the fun, the adventure, the daring, the frolics and it is there, it is all very safe and precautious enough for good family entertainment.With the usual crew and the added talents from one Jim Broadbent (Prof. Horace Slughorn) and a returning beauty that is Helena Bonham Carter (Bellatrix Lestrange) and Hero Fiennes-Tiffin, as the young eleven year old sinister, inspiring evil to be Tom Riddle aka Lord Voldemort. There is a refined class of talent that brings the Half-Blood Prince to an exceptionally high standard, as with the Potter name throughout, which is expected with this pedigree of experience, from all sides. With wonderful cinematography with shadings and contrasts setting mood rather than its script, in this area, that sets a rather typical pace from this calibre. It all makes for a green-screen, CGI adventure that too has matured to be more precise, more detailed and more fetching, the typical style, formula has, again, a slow build-up to yet another anticlimax finale. It's all well and good, with each build-up comes what is rather a less than average ending, a closure if you wish, the chase is always better than the catch were the Harry Potter finales are concerned, falling a little flat is less than adequate for such an adventurous legend.Of course, with two mediums such as pen and celluloid there are always differences and comparisons to debate, and as a work projected onto the Big Screen, it falls into an experience that, with its running time, becomes easy watching for the target audience it reaches out too. It is a highlife of wands and wonderful excitement for the young audience and as fantasy and magic, they shall not be disappointed.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince

At least the previous five has tons of action, adventure and humor. But this one is two hours and a half of the same boredom story. It is a flat plot that never advances and the lame excuse or romance make the film ridiculously cheesy. The very few of special effects that the movie has were very good. The cast were good but their performances in comparison to the previous movies were a little weak, I don't know but I never felt any emotion in them. The only ones that were convincing enough were Alan Rickman as Snape, Michael Gambon as Dumbledore and the very little appearance of Helena Bonham Carter.

She never read the books but she did enjoy the previous movies and was asking me about what she missed. I was happy to fill her in on the details. This is one of those school drama type of films but it's dark and funny both. There were some scenes that were changed, but at least Luna Lovegood was back and we get to see her doing more.

A gripping gloom without sticky sentimentality with wonderfully imaginative aesthetics and beauty, supported by a fantastic storytelling craft.

Indeed, our Harry Potter has grown older and his world much, much darker.

This book is very important as it reveals a lot about the villain Lord Voldemort's past, and how things have escalated to this point as the penultimate in the series.I was also quick to judge when ""The Sun"" newspaper released an article at the time, revealing how many fans actually hated this movie in a special advanced screening. Missing out about 3/4 of those all important flashback scenes. Needless to say, I went to see the movie anyway and while I admit it was incredibly stupid not to get all those flashbacks in, David Yates somewhat redeems himself from a lacklustre start. Pushing the franchise well into the deep end.With dark and sepia lit colours, everything just felt more threatening. The once street-filled lanes of Diagon Alley are now empty and gloomy, and a secret assailant looms around the corridors of Hogwarts. Finally we are introduced to Professor Slughorn, played by the always wonderful Jim Broadbent. Plus the friendship of Dumbledore and Harry is really tested to it's limits, in the first of many grizzly challenges to come.Final Verdict: An awful adaptation of the book, missing out on what would have looked amazing in this chapters conclusion.

To me it was - as all the previous Harry Potters have been - a fun movie filled with gorgeous special effects and good actors. It was only after discussion with my movie companion that I realized a lot of the novel had been left out. I kinda guessed as much, since the movie really wasn't about any Half-Blood Prince and the revelation of his identity at the end was like an ""Oh yea, and here's who he is."" All that said though, I find that - probably because I've never read the books - I'm not all that emotionally involved with the characters even though they're quite fully fleshed out.

132,renegadeviking-271-528568,Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,8,24 December 2019,"Like James Bond, the Harry Potter movies just keep chugging along, immune to the outside cinematic world, ensconced in their universe of quidditch and muggles, inferi and death eaters. They have perfectly fitted their source material from day one: each arriving regularly with a thud on the doormat every year or so since 2001, achieving a near-institutional status that has eluded the Narnia adaptations.There had been mutterings, however, over this sixth in the Potter series, pushed back from its original planned release date last Christmas. Monkeying with the schedule tends to alert the paying public that all is not well. The Half-Blood Prince is adapted from JK Rowling's penultimate novel, but so desperate are the producers not to compromise their revenue stream that the final book, the Deathly Hallows, will be divided into two parts.Nevertheless, there's little here to suggest there has been any let-up in the Potter machine. The eponymous schoolboy - still in owlish spectacles as he hits 17 or so - is up against skeletal blond Draco Malfoy, on some kind of vile mission from evil genius Voldemort. Hogwarts' main asset against him is Professor Horace Slughorn (played by Jim Broadbent in that cod-Dickensian style that is practically compulsory for the Potter cast). Slughorn's brain contains key memories of Voldemort's schooldays and Harry must extract them.There's lots of blushing, stammering and smooching. Will Harry lock lips with Ginny? Is Ron smart enough to see that Hermione ... well, it's not Skins. Hands are kept above the waist at all times.Putatively winsome all this may be, but what it actually does is throw the series' biggest weakness into sharp relief: film-making can (and does) control pretty much everything - except how the cute juvenile leads grow up. Still, director David Yates knows how to play all the cards. Although a touch ungainly, his film is solidly constructed, with lots of fine effects. If, as Potter approaches his final confrontation with Voldemort, the wizardly battles begin to resemble Lord of the Rings, it's hardly a handicap; this is tried and tested cinematic language, and does all it needs.... in the coming year, and the results will define the country for a generation. These are perilous times. Over the last three years, much of what the Guardian holds dear has been threatened - democracy, civility, truth. This US administration is establishing new norms of behaviour. Rampant disinformation, partisan news sources and social media's tsunami of fake news is no basis on which to inform the American public in 2020. Truth is being chased away.

133,Eternality,"The dark, ominous mood continues since The Goblet Of Fire and is felt the strongest here.",8,22 November 2010,"Harry Potter And The Half-Blood Prince is the sixth out of a projected eight films from the wildly-popular long-running fantasy series which began its cinematic life in 2001. Adapted from J.K. Rowling's original novels of the same name, the Harry Potter films have, over the years, been helmed by four different filmmakers: Christopher Columbus, Alfonso Cuaron, Mike Newell, and David Yates. Newell's The Goblet Of Fire (2005) remains the weakest of the bunch thus far. But ever since Yates took up the directing job for The Order Of The Phoenix (2007), the series is looking at a revival. The Half-Blood Prince confirms that revival.The Half-Blood Prince starts out excellently with the establishment of the villainous Death Eaters led by Bellatrix Lestrange (Helena Bonham Carter), and a key scene with Professor Snape (Alan Rickman) who plays an important role in the film's climax. After that, the main plot begins: Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) finds a book belonging to a mysterious half-blood prince and dwells deeper into a dark conspiracy involving the possible murder of Professor Dumbledore (Michael Gambon), Hogwarts' headmaster. The best performance goes to Rickman who gives his most complete Snape portrayal thus far - eerily calm and chillingly precise with his lines.This film focuses more on the relationship between Harry and Dumbledore to an extent that Harry's friends - Ron (Rupert Grint) and Hermoine (Emma Watson) - become less important to the narrative. In fact, they are largely consigned to peripheral roles that explore, more than anything else, the ups and downs of romance and infatuation in a college setting. The Half-Blood Prince takes on a different direction from the previous five prequels. Here, Yates refuses to succumb to the temptation of making an all-out action fantasy extravaganza. Instead, he concentrates on developing the characters and advances the story quickly, sometimes at the expense of entertainment.This is important because ultimately this is a 'setup' film which paves the way for an eagerly-anticipated finale. It may disappoint Potter fans or the casual moviegoer, but the film is likely, in retrospect, to gain appreciation after the whole series is completed. The lack of action is compensated by excellent production design and art direction, perhaps the best thus far. The dark, ominous mood continues since The Goblet Of Fire and is felt the strongest here. With The Half-Blood Prince, the magic and innocence that filled Hogwarts has disappeared, but Yates' bold, new direction for this film will be rewarded if not sooner, then later.SCORE: 8/10 (www.filmnomenon.blogspot.com) All rights reserved!",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
134,dy158,The great magical divide,7,18 July 2009,"It was only after Sirius Black's death in the previous instalment, the whole of the wizarding community finally believed what Harry Potter had knew all along. Lord Voldermort or the Dark Lord as he is known in the wider wizarding world is well and truly back. The wizarding world is convinced that Harry, who survived the Dark Lord's attack on him when he was a year old, is the 'Chosen One'. In the summer, strange occurrences had been happening in the Muggle world of London. Dark clouds swirling around the London sky, a bridge had been cracked apart for no apparent reason. It was something not expected. Harry went on with his summer holidays at usual, and when he met Professor Dumbledore, it was after he was finished reading what had been reported in The Daily Prophet (it was about him being the 'Chosen One') at a café in an underground train station. Professor Dumbledore had something for Harry to do.The Hogwarts headmaster wanted Harry to help persuade a friend of his to come out of retirement to teach at Hogwarts. As usual as it is the case, there is always a vacant post after the end of each school year. Both Dumbledore and Harry were due to meet Horace Slughorn (Jim Broadbent), who once had his own selected group of personal favourite students including Harry's late mother Lily. Initially Slughorn refused to give in, and it was only after Dumbledore and Harry left (this was after Dumbledore had finished using the toilet) then Slughorn decided to come out of retirement.Meanwhile, the murderer of Sirius Black in Bellatrix Lestrange (Helena Bonham Carter) and Mrs. Narcissa Malfoy (Helen McCrory) made a visit to Professor Snape. It was in view that Lord Voldermort had assigned Narcissa's son Draco who is in the same year as Harry at Hogwarts, a task. Narcissa was worried of the fact that with her son's age, he had actually being tasked to do what Lord Voldermort had assigned. Bellatrix suggested that they should do an Unbreakable Vow. It is in the event that should Draco would not be able to fulfil Lord Voldermort's wish, it would be Snape himself to do it on Draco's behalf.At the almost-empty Diagon Alley on the opening of Ron's twin brothers' joke shop, Harry knew Draco was up to something after he and his friends Hermione Granger and Ron Weasley (Harry would eventually spent his entire summer at the Weasleys' residence) secretly trailed their classmate who was together with people he did not knew about when they (not the trio, that is) entered Borgin & Burkes. There is always something sinister going on at Borgin & Burkes and Harry knew something was suspicious about Draco being there. But when on the train back to Hogwarts, Hermione wondered if Harry was reading too much into things with Harry's conclusion that Draco has actually become a Death Eater (during Lord Voldermort's rise to power before it was thwarted by Harry's survival, he recruited people who believe in his cause and they are called the Death Eaters).But even if there was a confrontation between Harry and Draco after everyone else had gotten off the train and returned back to Hogwarts which ended quickly after it begun, the magical world is definitely not as safe as before. In between the fears that there could be a possibility that the Death Eaters would invade Hogwarts, there are the cases of Slughorn had returned back to his old ways of trying to select students who could be his next group of personal favourites, the case of the teenage hormones really kicking in for Harry and his friends. At the same time, Professor Dumbledore has been together with Harry, trying to understand more about what possibly make Tom Riddle who would eventually be known to the wizarding community as Lord Voldermort as the most darkest wizard in wizarding history. And also, why is Harry's Potions book is the 'property of the Half-Blood Prince'?Even as someone who had read the book beforehand and not holding any pre-judgement of what the film may hold, the film adaptation kind of disappointed me somewhat. But watch it for Horace Slughorn, the teenage hormones which hit Harry and those he knows, the final scenes. There are the occasional times I could not bear to watch the cave scene which Dumbledore suspected Lord Voldermort had hidden something there. For me on a personal scale, the final scenes were definitely scarier than I had imagined. One would eventually know what had Lord Voldermort actually assigned Draco Malfoy to do and one will know why Draco's mother Narcissa was initially worried of it.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
135,curtis-8,"Has Good Points, but again--WAY too Short",4,9 August 2009,"This installment of the cinematic Harry Potter has great cinematography, lush cg effects, good performances, and a great musical score. But as a movie--it's pretty much a failure. Except for the romantic comedy elements (Ron-Hermione and Harry-Ginny) nothing in the film makes any sense. Incidents fly by one after the other with little if anything connecting them. To the viewer who hasn't read--or doesn't really remember--the story from the book, there is no cinematic story to follow. There is only one thing happening after another quickly followed by another seeming unrelated thing followed by another. No image, character or plot element is lingered on longer or shorter than another in this ADD afflicted film, so the viewer can't tell what's important and what's not. The drama is totally lost, making the film feel like nothing more than an extensive highlights reel. Half Blood Prince needed to be, at the very least, an hour longer. In fact, every adaptation from the third film on has needed to be longer as each successive installment has suffered more and more from fractured, cluttered, hard to follow storytelling. The first two films get ragged on by some for being simplistic and old fashioned, but as far as storytelling goes—i.e. involving the viewer in a coherent narrative with a beginning a middle and an end—they were far and away superior films to the rest of the series.In my opinion the last couple of films should have each been at least 3 hours long or longer, or better yet, each should have been split into two films a piece, as the final installment will be.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince

The Professor's only fault was not reporting Riddle's inquiry, I imagine such a level of evil was unprecedented...

see on the CW prime time audience.After the shift to a darker mood with ""The Goblet of Fire"", and the denial , frustration, and trying to work preemptively in ""Order of the Phoenix"" to date I hadn't seen a horrible Potter movie till this one.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
138,dommercaldi,"It's A Good-Enough Adaptation, But Makes Some Really Bizarre Changes And Additions. But Is Still An Enjoyable Movie In Its' Own Right",7,27 February 2021,"Pros:
1. The humour is well-timed whilst serving as great character bonding, which is needed to balance out the overall dark themes.
2. The score fantastically creates the relevant atmosphere with it being brooding and heavy for the dark moments, but fluffy and light for the upbeat moments.
3. The special effects look incredible and have come a very long way since 2001.
4. The chemistry between Daniel Radcliffe (Harry Potter), Rupert Grint (Ron Weasley) and Emma Watson (Hermione Granger) is palpable and it shines through in every scene they're in together.
5. The sound design and mixing are wonderful, therefore helping the wizarding world come to life.
6. The set and costume design, per usual, are immaculate and - like point 5 - help bring the Harry Potter world to life.
7. Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, Tom Felton (Draco Malfoy), Alan Rickman (Severus Snape) and Emma Watson (Hermione Granger) deliver great performances.
8. The death of Albus Dumbledore (Michael Gambon) is exceedingly tense, tragic and emotional. It's one of the most heart-wrenching scenes in the entire franchise.Cons:
1. The sequence wherein the Weasley house is destroyed is just pointless and makes no sense whatsoever.
2. It's never explained why Luna Lovegood is randomly wandering the train in the beginning. It's a strange re-writing from the book as in the book Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger (as the prefects and close friends of Harry Potter) are the ones prowling the Hogwarts Express.
3. The movie didn't focus enough on Draco Malfoy's struggle to carry out his task, and instead treats it as a simple side-story, even though it's integral to the events in the sixth book.
4. The score played during the credits is distractingly inappropriate as it's upbeat and plays straight after Albus Dumbledore's death.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
139,dickinsonjason-34081,Very Good,8,14 June 2020,This was Good movie I liked it a lot it's way to long drags through half of the movie but it was still a lot of fun,Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
140,tburke85,The Half Blood Prince Was Good Despite Some Flaws,7,19 January 2010,"Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince was good despite some flaws. Director David Yates is admirable in making this movie based on the popular J. K. Rowlings book series. Daniel Radcliffe continues to show why he was perfectly cast as Harry who begins his sixth year at Hogwarts. Radcliffe is effective in the role and has matured over the years as an actor. Well done. Ruper Grint and Emma Watson also return as Harry's best friends who are equally impressive like Radcliffe. All three of them have grown up a lot and it shows. The same can go for Tom Fenton whose role in this one is a bit larger than the others portraying Draco as a conflicted young man whose given a task he may not be able to do. The rest of the cast are good in their limited screen time including Michael Gambon, Maggie Smith, Jim Broadbent, Alan Rickman, Helena Bonham Carter, and Robbie Coltrane. Ralph Fiennes is absent as Voldemort but hopefully his role will be larger in the next one than his cameo appearance in The Order Of The Phoenix. This movie is definitely a little darker than the other ones and I'm sure The Deathly Hallows will have that same sort of feel to it. The Half Blood Prince doesn't have a whole lot of action in it but the parts that do are well executed. What this movie does have is character development, drama, some suspense, humor, and a little romance. The running time of 153 minutes did make the movie drag in some areas but it's still worth watching. The identity of the Half Blood Prince surprised me and I didn't necessarily see coming but I suspected it might have been him. Overall I thought this film was good despite some flaws. Fortunately however the good outweighed the bad. If you're a big Harry Potter fan than chances are you'll enjoy this one just as much as the others. It has character development, drama, humor, romance, and some action with solid performances by the cast.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
141,The_Amazing_Spy_Rises,Far and away the best in the series,9,14 July 2009,"Harry Potter. The name alone induces screams across the world, and may make movie theater managers such as myself fall on the ground when the prints arrive in the building. Just because I did get to watch it early does not mean I didn't do my share of waiting around the theater. More than 7 hours after I got off work, I was still at the theater and ready to watch what I had been waiting for ever since the wonderful 'Order of the Phoenix' two glorious years ago. Not only was 'Half Blood Prince' my favorite book in the series, it was also one of my favorite books of all time. My expectations could not have been higher, possibly the highest for any movie I'd ever had.So is it absolutely crazy that my expectations were still surpassed?Whether it be the shockingly wonderful script from Steve Kloves, the perfect acting across the board, dazzling effects, or the absolutely excellent direction and cinematography, 'Half Blood Prince' is EASILY the best film in the series, and is a great cinematic achievement that becomes the first Harry Potter film, in my opinion, that stands alone as a fantastic film, one that could even be Oscar worthy.It appears as if the book series finally being finished has done wonders for the films, as this is the first film produced since the end of the series. Steve Kloves' for films 1-4 were average at best, as he often struggled to write compelling dialog for the younger characters. Not only has he vastly improved, but for the first time in the entire series, I was more interested in the younger characters than the absolute gems of characters played by the adults. 'Half Blood Prince' probably has the least amount of action in the series, but it is by no means boring. Kloves' script assures us that this ride is just as mental as it is physical. There are some minor problems, such as the backstory of the title character, the Half Blood Prince, not really being explained at all, but these flaws are outweighed by Kloves' seamlessly weaving plot points from both 'Half Blood Prince' and 'Deathly Hallows'. Some characters, such as Rufus Scrimgeour, Bill Weasley, and Mad Eye Moody are sorely missed, while others, such as Ginny Weasley and Bellatrix Lestrange, benefit from much more to do than they had in the book. To put it simple, Kloves' adaptation this time around is his best yet.To me, the lines a writer writes are only as good as the actors that say them, and this flick boasts what could be called the best ensemble cast of the year. The bright points for me were Alan Rickman, Tom Felton, and Bonnie Wright, who both really got the chance to flesh out their characters in this one. Wright nails the passionate, hot tempered Ginny very well in brief opportunities, while Rickman is once again perfect as the icy Severus Snape, though to reveal why he's perfect would be robbing the viewer of a wonderful show. Felton packs a world of emotion and nails the character once again. The main newcomers to the cast were all excellent. Jim Broadbent is perfectly cast as Horace Slughorn, while Hero Fiennes Tiffin and Frank Dillane are positively chilling in their cameos as the younger incarnations of Lord Voldemort. Dillane in particular is nothing short of brilliant in his two scenes. Helena Bonham Carter's over the top performance as Bellatrix Lestrange is something that would only work in a Harry Potter film, as she is hilariously psychotic and sadistic in her role. The biggest surprise of all is Michael Gambon, who plays Dumbledore to perfection this time.The faces of the Harry Potter franchise are the three actors that now appear to have grown up with their characters long enough to actually be them. Emma Watson is at her best for once as Hermione, while Rupert Grint brings everything back to the table after basically taking a movie off. Daniel Radcliffe tops what was his best performance in 'Order of the Phoenix' in this one, but for different reasons. Radcliffe is showing real all around talent as an actor, as he exudes the sarcastic confidence that he's always been missing that is integral to Harry's character. It should be noted that Radcliffe is definitely the best at comedy of the trio.While I viewed it to be perfect, this might be because I've read the book and plugged in what few leaks there were. All the non-readers I saw it with said that they didn't have that many problems keeping up, and that this one really gelled with the previous installment. I credit that, and the movie's overwhelming excellence to David Yates, who really just gets this franchise. He has recreated the magic I felt when first reading the book again and again, with classic moments meant for readers that non-readers will still find entertaining enough.This movie definitely strays the furthest from the book, but I really didn't care. I didn't miss any of the things that were cut, nor did I object to any changes in the movie. In a word, it was perfect. Bruno Delbonnel does a marvelous job with the cinematography, which is amongst the most beautiful camera work I've ever seen, especially with the colors and lighting. The art direction is equally brilliant.'Half Blood Prince' is an exciting thriller, that is as charming and sweet as it is mysterious. It is as suspenseful as it is angsty, and that's saying something. Hormones and chaos are abound at Hogwarts, and Yates manages to handle it with perfect grace, as his film does not, for the first time ever, feel choppy or rushed. The film flows wonderfully, and builds to a climax that will keep your emotions running high for at least 20 minutes. I really could not have been more pleased with this movie.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
142,Jay_Exiomo,"Teen love, thin plot",5,16 July 2009,"Now far removed from the innocence of Chris Columbus' literally faithful yet cinematically unsatisfying Hogwarts appertif ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone,"" ""Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"" at the onset plunges to its increasingly horrifying world with little regard to establishing its characters or the story for the sake of those uninitiated, which is not to say it's a bad thing, since it's unlikely one would only start this deep into the series. Yet it's this same urgency that typifies this installment's character as less a product in itself than an obligatory assemblage of a gorgeous production design and a handsome cinematography designed for the series' inevitable denouement. Set to conclude with the seventh book split into two parts, there are no more surprises, only mandatory buildup.The central point of returning screenwriter Steve Kloves' script involves teen wizard Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) and Dumbledore (Michael Gambon) trying to obtain a vital piece of information about their arch-nemesis Lord Voldemort and enlists the help of former Hogwarts Potions Master Horace Slughorn (Jim Broadbent), who, being close with a young Voldemort (Hero Fiennes-Tiffin) -- then known as Tom Riddle -- possesses that knowledge. This gist, however, is cheerlessly relegated to minor concern, getting lost amidst numerable subplots that mostly include the brewing romance among Harry and his adolescent friends Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint), Hermione Granger (Emma Watson) and Ron's sister Ginny Weasley (Bonnie Wright).David Yates' sophomore turn as a Potter director has the film in a more ominously cold-blooded and deliberate pacing, producing the ultimate flip side to the fanciful inception of the magical saga. Playful magic is now scrimped and the pervading melancholy manifested through the gloomy desaturated tones provides a fitting analogy to its love-spurned heroes, an aspect that the film so insistently prioritizes and, to some extent, accomplishes. Still, in the greater scheme of all things Harry Potter, ""Half-Blood Prince"" goes by without the requisite dramatic thrust to substantiate itself as more than a compulsory episode with mostly no consequences, and, save for its paramount climactic showdown, it's a constant looping around its panoramic mythology to give a constant sense of activity but one that actually leads nowhere.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
143,Rindiana,Not Just Half-Blooded But Anaemic,4,28 October 2009,"The sixth round in the ongoing fight between pubescent wizard Harry and ugly Lord Voldemort, formerly known as Tom Riddle, is even weaker than its numerous predecessors, lacking some of the earlier movies' visual wit and superficial charm while emphasizing the well-known shortcomings that hampered all installments: variable performances, sketchy and episodic narration and arbitrarily twisty (and often downright silly) story lines based on a hodgepodge of ancient and contemporary cultural mythology.Even the stellar British supporting cast can't save this overblown pic from its lethargy, this time.Not really a bad movie, to be sure, but simply an insignificant one.4 out of 10 ""Dumbledore does Gandalf"" impersonations",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
144,Jerique,Terrible Harry Potter installment; Decent fantasy movie.,4,3 January 2010,"Perhaps the most important book in the series of Harry Potter makes for the worst film in the saga yet. Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince perceives Ginny still as a shadowed character, with Hermione and Ron at each others throats only somewhat and Harry, is not shown as very matured since Order.This film does no justice to Rowling's literature. A great deal of important plot points are omitted and even more points of the story have been changed. Snape's role is drastically important in the book, but is limited so a couple dozen lines and not more than eight scenes.Ginny was supposed to break out of her shell in Order of the Phoenix, much like she does in the novel, but she doesn't. The romance of Lavender and Ron is developed, but Harry and Ginny's romance is taken a backseat to the plot of Horcruxes.Even the Horcruxes are not developed far enough, as the ring and the diary are the only ones spoken of in the film. Voldemort's past is not brought up and the interactions between Harry and Dumbledore is very few.I found myself thinking that this film is good for kids and good for fans of the films, purely. If you're a fan of this saga in novelization, then you will not like the film adaptation as it doesn't follow the book. Vast differences and changes and the complete removal of some aspects made me loathe the screenwriters.I loved the book and I cried in the end, but I didn't cry to this film because of lack of story. Harry Potter novel fans, stay away. If you love fantasy and magic, just for the sake of it, this movie is for you.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
145,illbebackreviews,My Favourite HP Novel Turns Into My Worst HP Film,1,9 January 2012,"Does everyone remember the novel of Half Blood Prince? That was a masterpiece. That had some of the best moments in the entire saga. There were memorable scenes in that novel. HBP Novel was my favourite of the series, so I was so looking forward to the movie.I was looking forward to:Battle at Astronomy Tower Dumbledore's Funeral The Advanced Tom Memories The Harry-Ginny in the Common Room The Quidditch Final The Expressions of Dark Times Bill and Fleur Especially Greyback's attacks on Bill Harry's wants to avenge Snape at the end of the filmAND SO MANY MORE THINGSThere was no Battle. Instead it was Harry chasing Snape into the Forbidden Forest where he gets owned by Snape. No Order of the Phoenix fighting. No McGonagall. It was poorly done. Instead it was ridiculously replaced by the Burning of the Burrow, which should've also gone along with this battle at Hogwarts.The death of the most important character: Dumbledore. Yet, there's no funeral for him. Instead, its replaced by some shocking love scenes between Ron and Lavender. They find the love more important than Dumbledore's death.Where was the Quidditch final. Instead it was replaced with the Gryffindor and Slytherin match, which wasn't that great.There wasn't much proof of the dark times, except for a brilliantly made Attack on Diagon Alley and Destruction of the Bridge. The film starts in the most brilliant way, yet it doesn't continue on.No indication on Greyback's attack on Will, yet this is saved for DH Part 1.GOOD PARTSActing, special effects and some outstanding scenes.Bellatrix and Narcissa Meet Snape And the Beginning where the bridge is destroyed and Ollivander is kidnapped.AND THANK GOD!!

146,Rcwilkinson123,"Decent, but a bit muffled",7,13 July 2010,"This installment of the series is strong in its portrayal of darker moments, the conflict of Harry, and of the uncertainty of Snape's motives. However, it was surprising to see the heavy focus on romantic triangles that were not so much a focus in the novel, though it did seem like there was an emphasis to draw a parallel of commitment in a relationship to the commitments that characters like Snape made to follow through with the plan set forth by Voldemort and executed by the Death Eaters. Additionally, the portryal of a particular death seemed very quick and without emotion, like the directors and producers were expecting to not have to focus on that moment much because they perhaps assumed that the majority of the film's watchers would have already been emotionally influenced through the event by having already read the book. If that was their assumption, that was a mistake. The dark emphasis was good, but glazed over story lines and key events from the book make it a film that serves only to tell the story, but ought not to be remembered as anything legendary by any means.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
147,mistoppi,Yates still doesn't get it,5,20 October 2016,"Yates's style still annoys me. He's trying to force fantasy literature into action. With Yates directing it seems that the grim visual side and ""action"" is more important than the actual story. And again, the idea of a dark fantasy story is making the movie so dark it's hard to see. That kind of aesthetic only suits David Fincher, and Yates is nowhere near his brilliance.Also the romance side doesn't work at all in this movie. Sure, teenage romance is of course a bit awkward, but this is so outrageously clumsy it's painful to look at the scenes. The writer still hasn't managed to capture Ginny Weasley, nor has he decided what she should be like. Ginny is a completely different character compared to what she was like as a small child and even when Half- Blood Prince is compared with Order of Phoenix. Did the writers just want to have someone cool to be Harry's love interest? She is nowhere near as cool as she is in the book. Why is it so hard for men to write believable female characters? But if there is one character this movie manages to capture it's Draco Malfoy. Still, there's no sign of actual character development, because in the fifth movie he was still that annoying school bully and now he's, well... this. To be honest, that development happens very quickly in the books also. It's of course understandable, but slightly annoying. I love how they still pretend like now we get some real insight into Voldemort's past when we see like two memories of him. It's ridiculous. Half-Blood Prince is slightly better than the fifth movie. Maybe it took Yates some time to get used to the series. Still, he just doesn't seem to quite grasp the idea of Harry Potter, he just wants to make dark fantasy action for young adults.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
148,Chalice_Of_Evil,Magic has returned to the world of Harry Potter!...,9,17 August 2019,"After being disappointed by Order of the Phoenix, Half-Blood Prince was a nice surprise. Goblet of Fire remains my favourite, but this one's not far behind. The absence of Dursleys was a good start, and although the film begins in the 'real world', it's a more exciting scene than the last film's opening, as Death Eaters (including a wolfman dude) wreak havoc, leaving Muggles thinking ""WTF?""...including a waitress who gets chatted up (and then stood up) by self-confessed ""tosser"", Harry Potter, who's whisked away by Dumbledore to the world of magic and we're introduced to part-time armchair, Professor Slughorn. Jim Broadbent's character is a welcome addition, as Slughorn likes to 'collect' special students and the prospect of acquiring 'the Chosen One' is too good to pass up. Meanwhile, the still wickedly fun Bellatrix Lestrange and Draco Malfoy's mother, Narcissa, have a special mission for Draco (and ensure Snape keeps him safe/makes sure he follows through via a magical 'Unbreakable Vow' handshake).Harry's soon reunited with his friends and it quickly becomes clear that films are not only ramping up Ron's/Hermione's feelings for each other, but also the heretofore barely-touched-upon Harry/Ginny relationship. Luna Lovegood, who was the fifth film's bright spot, makes a welcome return when saving Harry from Draco's foot-to-the-face (this film feels a bit more 'brutal' than prior ones, with a fair amount of blood) thanks to snazzy glasses called 'Spectrespecs' and Harry's head apparently being full of something called 'wrackspurts' (her particular brand of 'kookiness' and dynamic with Harry lights up every scene).Another scene-stealing new addition is Lavender Brown, who becomes obsessed with Ron, starts a relationship with him (much to the annoyance of Hermione, who you *don't* want to get on the bad side of...lest she magically sic a flock of birds on you), but verges into 'stalker' territory. Jessie Cave is hilarious in every scene. Also funny is Hermione's (unwanted) admirer, Cormac McLaggen. The amusement derived from his rivalry with Ron is only surpassed by Hermione's reactions to his advances/leering looks and her efforts to ditch him after taking him as a 'date' to Slughorn's party. Emma Watson and Rupert Grint are in fine form playing both their characters' humourous sides and their more serious/dramatic sides. Their chemistry with each other and Daniel Radcliffe is the glue that holds this whole film series together.Speaking of, I'm surprised to learn Daniel Radcliffe apparently disliked his performance here, as I thought he was very good (and certainly more likeable than in the previous film). He proves to have nice comedic skills (especially in a scene with Hagrid, Slughorn and a dearly department friend of Hagrid), and this film's humour was sorely needed after the last film's lack of/failed attempts at 'good' humour. Harry also goes through some quite dramatic stuff too. His relationship with Dumbledore gets some major focus, proving crucial to the film's plot. There are some really dark/shocking moments towards the end of the film. We also get flashbacks to pre-Voldemort Tom Riddle, and the two young actors playing him at different ages do a good job of portraying this creepy soon-to-go-bad-wizard-in-the-making.Finally getting some overdue focus/screentime is Draco. Or rather, it *seems* like he's getting a lot more focus...but, mostly, it's just him being his usual 'foul evil loathsome little cockroach' self (and if I had to watch him pull the cover off that damn Vanishing Cabinet ONE MORE TIME...!). Ginny gets more screentime as well, though it doesn't amount to very much other than snogging, shoelace-tying (yes, really) and running into danger after Harry (though the attack on the Weasley's Burrow is pretty awesome). Also getting focus, but with a bit more substance, is Snape as the new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher (because THAT bodes well). He does something pretty dramatic near the end and Harry's confrontation with him is a memorable one.Although the movie is quite lengthy, it never really felt like it 'dragged'. There was plenty of action and magic on display, but when things slowed down I still felt invested in what was happening. The film is quite gloomily-lit in places, but it doesn't forget to have a sense of 'fun' (wackiness with love potions, 'Liquid Luck', and cursed objects just being a few examples). For me, this movie was everything the fifth one wasn't, and that's why it joins the 3rd and 4th films as one of my favourites of the series. Book readers might have issues with things left out/changed, but I found the movie entertaining/riveting, and a fine lead-in to the two part finale.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
149,Bruce722,They missed by just a bit:,9,5 June 2012,"This is the first time in this series where I can honestly say that the movie was every bit as good as the book... though, for different reasons. You see, there is not all that much adventure and action sequences in the book so, while it doesn't drag because the characters are and plot development is outstanding, it still felt a bit on the long side. This caters perfectly for the movie. The challenges in fitting in all sorts of scenes are completely different than those in fitting in various emotions, which is what they faced when making this movie. In capturing those emotions, thoughts, moments of internal conflict, etc. they did a fantastic job. The only thing I thought they could've done a better job of was making Dumbledore's exit a bit more emotional like it was in the book. Still though, they did a great job there in general so that's not the reason I didn't give it a perfect ten. That reason lies with the fact that they hinted towards things in this movie that were not so profound in the book. I have not finished the final book yet so I can only speculate on some of the things I was already wondering but it seems as though, regarding Severus Snape, that they took advantage of knowing the ending of the entire story rather than the particular book itself. By knowing this, it seems as though they hint a little more at certain elements of the story than the book did causing you to think entirely differently about the act that took place. Nonetheless, this movie was still outstanding and I look forward to watching the final one(s).",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
150,robert-710-767167,Gets better despite... it's ending,8,2 July 2011,"Simply put, unfortunately there is a death in the film a bit more significant than the last time. However, there was just as many good scenes and happy moments as well.I liked how they put in some romance into the film without, again, making it be too distracting. It was funny seeing the characters grow up so realistically and how they interacted with the idea of love and romance.The special effects have improved once again.

152,Christopher_Reid,"Yeah, not bad. Weak direction and crap music but otherwise good :)",7,22 July 2009,"First I give you my background. Yo, so Azkaban be my favourite so far. Smooth cinematography and a wonderful story energetically and meaningfully told. The first two was also very nice (John Williams in tha house). But Goblet felt rushed. Yeah, it had its moments but dem beats was wack (music not bad per se but didn't enhance the movie enough). Also found that one more fragmented and less distinctive than the earlier ones (which established the whole look and style, y'all). Phoenix worst so far (hopefully ever). Lacked personality (Yates Schmates - no directors' touches). Just going through the motions. And even worse music (yes I consider that incredibly important).This one was certainly an improvement. Reminded me of how kick-arse the book is. But I didn't have very high expectations. The look was very nice - it has some very memorable images. The climaxes were handled decently (cave scene being my favourite probably). Music (yeah, yeah, shut up, whatever) didn't get in the way too too badly for me. But the extensive teen comedy sections sometimes had music that coulda come from Desperate Housewives. Williams always knew how to really bring scenes to life. Create magic out of nearly nothing. Tension where all seems to be calm. Anticipations of the dark things to come. These kinds of contrasts are well-suited to intelligent audiences if you ask me. They raise questions. Are you watching closely? Perhaps all is not quite as it seems. The game begins!Moving on. Snape was pretty awesome I thought. Rickman slithers those words out ever so somethingly. Gambon solid as always. Ooh, just remembered. I really liked the scene where Riddle's talking to Horace. Well, mainly that kid and his whole manner. That's the kind of thing that's really fascinating to me and the scene got into that pondering mood. Entices you to think. Was he evil yet? If not, already set on that path? Tempted by power? So intelligent and refined. Was it inevitable? When one is so powerful and ""superior"", is ""evil"" (like, say, killing people without remorse) so far-fetched a consideration? After all, who cares about killing spiders or cockroaches?Now, don't get me wrong. Emma Watson seems like a lovely lass. But she still seems to be overacting. Doesn't really bother me but there's no drama. She's overdoing it. Constantly concerned. Could be directors' fault as I liked her in the first few. Grint is Ron. Same as always. Good with comedy I should admit. Also likable but whatever. He's just Ron. Radcliffe's very cool. I think he's going places. A child star but dealing with it brilliantly (as Potter would say). Great potential. Needs a great director (especially as he matures). Handles both serious parts and comedy well. Broadbent not bad. But pretty plain for a new character. What's the new spark in *this* Potter film? It's not his fault, it's just that he's the new change and he doesn't carry it. Felton in good form - captured Draco's struggle pretty well. Lynch (Lovegood) was very likeably dreamy. She's always in her own world although she's also more observant and perceptive than one might guess and the performance is very convincing. Natural. Seriously, I may have a mini-crush on Luna :/Special effects generally seamless but not always that exciting (typical camera angles and shot-logic if that makes sense). Man, this is like a post-match analysis. Useless to people who haven't seen the movie (or those that have) unless you're as obsessive as I am. Only big misstep in the movie: a slow-clap (y'know, like some dude starts clapping then others join and then everyone's doin' it and it's oh so moving) but with wands. Guessably occurs during the later stages of the movie. Forced emotion(s) ain't cool.Summary: good. The time goes by pretty easily. Book fans'll get annoyed at several things (no way!). There are a couple of high points. Awesome cast doing their stuff in front of an indifferent director. Story's great enough that it's generally good. But seriously, the novel's a masterpiece innit?",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
153,Thats_some_scary_stuff_Reviews,The magic may have worn off in Order of the Phoenix but i don't remember it being so funny.,7,10 October 2009,The magic that made this series a family movie would have disappeared in Goblet of Fire when it got dark. But Harry Potter still has a little bit of magic still left in it. Half Blood Prince brings the story into full circle as we draw nearer to the massive finale of one of the biggest series in movie history.The newest installment of the Harry Potter franchise is much different then the others. It had hints of a romantic comedy in there and the story is getting much darker. The Sub Plots of The Half Blood Prince felt like American Pie but the Harry Potter Version. Replacing drugs with potions and watching our favorite characters grow up is hilarious.Like always the movie wasn't better then the novel but it was funnier and visuals were great. But compared to the book it wasn't good enough but as a stand alone Potter film it was fun and enjoyable. I recommend it if you like the series or you seen up to 5 and have come to far not to watch the rest of the series. I give Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince...7/10,Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
154,RichardSRussell-1,Splendid,8,16 July 2009,"8-8-7-8-7-8. That's the track record that the Harry Potter series has racked up to date on my 9-point rating scale. M. Night Shyamalan has been more consistent; he started at 9 and dropped 1 point on each of his next 5 films. Peter Jackson has been more consistently good; I gave all 3 LotR movies a 9. But Harry Potter has maintained its high quality and solid internal consistency under 4 different directors (Chris Columbus, 1–2; Alfonso Cuarón, 3; Mike Newell, 4; and David Yates, 5–6). Credit for that must go, up front, to the source material from author J. K. Rowling. But not enuf attention has been paid to probably the most under- appreciated screenwriter in the biz, Steve Kloves, who authored 1–4 and returns now for 6, after having left Phoenix in the capable hands of Michael Goldenberg. I tend to favor screenplays by a single individual, rather than by committee (which, as we all know, tends to start with a blueprint for a horse and end up with a camel), and Kloves and Goldenberg lend credence to that preference.Immediately behind wonderful writing comes amazing casting. Right from the get-go, back when Daniel Radcliffe was the tall one, these have been distinct, fully realized, memorable characters. Compare Harry, Ron, and Hermione to the Pevensey kids of the Narnia series, the youngest of whom is, I'm pretty sure, named Lucy. She's got 3 older siblings; if they swapped in new actors, would you even notice, let alone care?And it doesn't end there. Contrast Transformers 2, with its 3 half-actors and legions of instantly forgettable spear carriers, with the Potter series, where even the 20th-billed actor paints a distinctive character that you could pick out of a police line-up, probably by name. Maggie Smith, maybe 4 total minutes of screen time — perfect! Alan Rickman, born to play Severus Snape the way Pierce Brosnan was the living embodiment of James Bond. Helena Bonham Carter, one of the most stunningly gorgeous women on the planet (tho you'd never know it if all you'd seen were her performances as Charlie's mom in Chocolate Factory and Mrs. Lovett in Sweeney Todd), is electrifying in her few fleeting appearances as Bellatrix Lestrange. And the newest featured actors in the ensemble continue the unbroken tradition of perfect casting: Jim Broadbent as Prof. Horace Slughorn, the new Potions instructor, and Bonnie Wright as Ginny, the sensible, competent, quiet, and often overlooked youngest member of the Weasley brood.It's been said that the main problem with special effects is that they're special: They practically stand up and wave in your face, demanding to be noticed. (That was certainly the case with the 1st several hundred 3-D movies.) But, in a world of wizards, the utterly marvelous should be literally unremarkable; for example, nobody at Hogwarts should ever remark that the great dining hall is illuminated by hundreds of floating candles. And here, gloriously, nobody ever does. The effects are not special, they're mundane, taken for granted by everybody, and this enables the audience to feel like personal participants in a world of never-ending marvels. But be not deceived; it takes hard work to make so many glorious illusions appear commonplace.I've led off with so many compliments for this dandy film because I want that to be the dominant impression you carry away from this review. I will now get to the part where I explain (at probably unwarranted length) why it doesn't quite get a 9 from me.(1) Too much of a good thing. I only hand out 9s to movies that I'm sure are so memorable in their own right that I'll have no difficulty calling them back to mind a decade from now. So far this year, that's been Watchmen, Star Trek, and Up; no matter how good the others have been, they will tend to fade over time, but those 3 will not. Half-Blood Prince simply does not stand out from the rest of its series in any truly unforgettable way.(2) Not enuf of a good thing. The source novel is so abundant in riches that it's impossible to cram them all into a 150-minute movie, so Kloves, in some sense, has had to be more of an abridger than a writer. But every little bit of the book has its ardent fans, so he can't omit very much. Consequently, there's a dollop of teen romance here, a smidgen of mystery there, a hearty dash of adventure, sprinklings of portents, a few garnishes of classroom antics, etc. — lots of seasonings and flavorings, but it's hard to find the entrée. To illustrate: The title mentions a ""half-blood prince"". What's the significance of ""half-blood""? Why is this particular half-blood considered princely? Who exactly was he, anyway? So little time is spent examining these issues that the reveal — tossed off casually and without provocation at the end of the picture — carries almost no emotional weight, let alone providing insight into the terrible soul's burden that the prince has carried all these years. (For that, read the novel, which handles the matter masterfully.)(3) Ambiguous ending. As with the novel, the movie ends with a huge major plot line left unresolved. This isn't necessarily an insurmountable obstacle, but it's a handicap. A work of genius (again reference the 1st 2 LotR films) can overcome it; Half-Blood Prince doesn't quite pull it off.I hope you will recognize that I have been praising with faint damns. This really is a splendid film. Everyone should go see it.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
155,wildlife-ptech,Slow paced installment but very stylish,8,12 October 2019,"Rating7/10Despite it's languid pacing this installment remains watchable for its visual style. It's certainly the most stylish in the series after Azkaban. Despite it's faults - length, pacing, dodgy script choices of what material to keep and cut, the solid acting and visual appearance keeps monotony at bay. The screen is almost too dark at times.Watchable",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
156,freaky_dave,Probably the least in the entire series,6,16 July 2009,"THe Half Blood Prince is one of the first movies in the Harry Potter Franchise that I could not get into. I read the books awhile ago, so I don't remember everything, but I do seem to recall that the novel, much better than this movie, had a lot more detail. It seems to me that a lot was cut out. I mean more than half the story. THere is one scene in particular that I do remember however, the final battle sequence, and it was totally cut out of the movie. I cannot accept this.Let discuss some of these points now shall we. Let's start with all the romance first off which took up most of the movie. Too much time was wasted on this when we should've been learning more about VOldemort and what Malfoy was actually doing. THe details on this were lacking to say the least. We still don't know much about the Horcruxes(sp.)and little was seen of what Malfoy was doing for so much of the time in the novel. Yet we got to see kissing and romance over and over again, with girls turning into baffling idiots when it involved love. I guess I can understand why some girls may find this a little offensive. THe other part that seemed to be lacking was the identity of the Half Blood Prince. If you read the books, you will not be surprised at who it ends up being, but with the movie, the identity of said individual is given only a line of dialoque. In the book this same character is given much more to work with and gives somewhat of an explanation which sets up the final two parts of the series and clues us in to whose side this same person may really be on.Some will wonder why I've given this movie a six instead of a lower rating of maybe 1-5 after reading what I've said, and the reason is that it wasn't a horrible film. THe acting was decent and I enjoyed the dark sinister look of the movie as well as the special effects. THe three friends Harry (Radcliffe), Ron (Grint), and Hermione (Watson), do what they can, but the best acting comes from the likes of the teachers Dumbledore (Gambon) and the newest teacher of potions Slughorn (Jim Broadbent). I also liked the actor who played Malfoy (Felton) and the two different actors who played Tom RIddle (Hero Fiennes TIffin, and Frank Dillane). Most of the other characters in the movie were left out or had very little to do, so I really can't rate them based on what I saw. Overall, this was a little disappointing, but not a scourge of existence. However, when comparing it to the films that have come before, I cannot recommend it.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
157,helmutty,Harry Potter 6,6,24 July 2009,"Harry Potter is now more onto the teenage drama, the first few movies are on the fantasy side. Harry Potter and the Half-Blood prince's pace is not as fast as the recent Harry Potter movies as it is more like a drama. The characters do not do much action, just babble and kiss. I have not read the book so I do not know whether the movie is following according to the book's pace. Though it is heavy on drama, I still enjoyed it.The story: Yeah, it is darker as the three characters grow into adults, dealing with some adults situations. Although, it has a PG rating in USA, it is quite dark. Everything is dark. Even the clouds are dark in mostly throughout the whole movie. I must say it is the darkest PG movie. Aside from that, action fans should already know that Harry Potter does not feature big and loud action sets. So if you walk in and expect to see big magical action sets, you will be disappointed. There is some mild action involving magic. And they are not as fantastic as the recent movies like Order of phoenix. Still, David Yates did a good on realistic sets and daringly put heavy drama. I have to admit that the pace is a bit slow, it is the last hour that bring the pace faster and more intense.Overall: Harry Potter's fans will watch this. Those following the Harry Potter movies like me will also catch this. There will be the sequel next and the following year. The long-awaited battle between Harry and Voldemort is coming...",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
158,colinrgeorge,"""Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince""",7,6 April 2010,"Director David Yates' second venture into J.K. Rowling's world, ""Harry Potter and the Half- Blood Prince,"" is an occasionally magical film in both its content and its effect. Built with an eye for the fantastic, Bruno Delbonnel's cinematography is loose and airy, and Yates is adept at grounding and making accessible the supernatural world. ""The Half-Blood Prince,"" is a technically impressive but inherently imperfect film that corrects some of the series' longstanding problems, but stumbles over just as many others.Like every ""Potter"" film before it, except presumably the first, ""The Half-Blood Prince"" suffers as a singular piece of entertainment. A standing knowledge of the novels or a recent viewing of each previous adaptation is almost a prerequisite for full comprehension of the latest, as the protagonists interact with a revolving door of minor characters between the two or three major plot points in a given tale. In ""Half-Blood Prince,"" those points are spread almost two fatty hours apart, and I hope you like wizard flirting.Granted, the most glaring issues with this sixth installment in the boffo franchise are ultimately issues with its source material. My recollection of Rowling's novel is now four years old, but I recall a distinct sense of ambivalence toward the uneven work. What's on the page (and what translates to the screen) often feels like a storyteller stalling. At 652 pages and 153 minutes, respectively, both versions of the tale of the eponymous Half-Blood Prince are overlong, concluding with a knockout finale that almost makes up for all the time wasted.Admittedly, the nothingness is a sometimes-welcome change of pace for the film franchise, the past two iterations of which became increasingly hurried and muddled in their attempt to keep the stories as faithful as possible to the bulky source material, both-times backfiring, creating watchable if ineloquent adaptations of their literary counterparts. Perhaps the moments to breathe in ""Half-Blood Prince"" should be savored (though in splitting the series' conclusion, ""Deathly Hollows,"" into two parts, I fear the worrisome languid pacing may only worsen), with Screenwriter Steve Kloves painting ""Half-Blood Prince"" as a more anecdotal film, allowing Harry and his pals to be more than just movie heroes. He lets them be kids.The statement sounds more praise-worthy than it should (your average sixteen year old not being terribly compelling), and while that ideology might improve the franchise on the whole, it does relatively little for the individual film. The middle of ""Half-Blood Prince"" sags and is largely inconsequential filler between the heavily plot-driven beginning and end.""The Half-Blood Prince,"" finds itself in the unfortunate position of being a largely successful adaptation of a mediocre novel. The film is fun and thrilling when it should be, and just as forgettable as its source elsewhere.Despite its PG rating, Yates treats Rowling's characters with the maturity and the respect they deserve, and ""Half-Blood Prince,"" fittingly ends on a scene reminiscent of the conclusion to ""The Empire Strikes Back."" The sun is setting beyond a great balcony and our worn heroes are preparing for what's sure to be their greatest challenge yet. Here's hoping Yates fills the series' final chapter(s?) with the invigorating excitement of ""Return of the Jedi,"" or even ""Half-Blood Prince"" at its best.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
159,haterofcrap,Okay,7,12 September 2010,"All those Harry Potter movies were just okay. The books were funny enough, and all the movie adaptations were decent and satisfying. I'm not a big fan of those book, but I liked them. Daniel Radcliffe was a very good choice as Harry Potter, he is very handsome and talented. The performances, the script and the special effects were good enough, not as good as better films as ""Avatar"" and ""Watchmen"", but were good. My only problem with all the Harry Potter films is that all of those movies are pretty long. Since those book and movies are aimed to children they should be shorter, I guess. All the Harry Potter films are good, but I still prefer ""Avatar"", because ""Avatar"" has aliens, and I love aliens.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
160,seaview1,Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince Sets the Finale,7,30 August 2009,"This remarkably well balanced series of wildly successful films based on an equally popular series of novels by J. K. Rowling shows no signs of waning with Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince. Potter veteran director David Yates and keeper of the flame scribe Steve Kloves have kept together a burgeoning franchise that is laying the foundation for a grand finale.A new school year begins, and Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) is coming to terms with being the 'chosen one' to do battle against the ultimate in evil wizardry, Lord Voldemort and the evil Death Eaters surrounding Hogwart. Professor Dumbledore (Michael Gambon) enlists Harry to serve as bait to draw out the supremely evil Voldemort. An older Professor Slughorn (Jim Broadbent) returns to the school and brings with him a mysterious history of having taught the boy who became Lord Voldemort. Harry in the meantime discovers a manuscript by the 'Half-Blood Prince' and thinks that it is the key to learning the wizardry secret that will enable Harry and his comrades, Ron (Rupert Grint) and Hermione (Emma Watson) to defeat the man who killed his parents and godfather, Sirius Black. Harry's school rival Draco harbors revenge against him for the death of his evil father. There is the aerial game Quidditch that challenges Ron's mettle, and the blossoming of adolescent romance between Potter and Ron's sister, Ginny and between Ron and Hermione. Then there is Professor Snape (Alan Rickman) and some mysterious behavior that questions his allegiance. As Dumbledore makes Harry promise to do whatever he instructs, the Death Eaters are unleashed within Hogwart with devastating consequences and a shocking betrayal that will forever change the destiny of the school and foreshadow the coming showdown with Voldemort.This is a more grownup Potter as it explores relationships more thoroughly and some amusing situations arise such as a love triangle that plagues Ron. It is amusing to see how hormones are thriving amongst the teens and love is in the air. Growing up was never this hard. There are also surprises of a high order that will send the series on a new, ominous path while raising questions about the loyalty of a major player. The one constant is our beloved trio of maturing wizards who must face an uncertain future without an important character. The film reinforces the continuous themes of loyalty and friendship among our wizard heroes. That bond and natural chemistry among the three actors is partly what holds this remarkable series together.Most of the characters are back from the previous film Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix. It does feel like school has restarted when Professors Dumbledore, Snape, and McGonagall (venerable Maggie Smith) show up. Other familiar faces reappear, which greatly help in the continuity and progression of the story. The filmmakers are wise to introduce a couple new characters here and there without shaking up the status quo too much. All the Potter films have benefited from a strong focus on storyline in keeping with the novel sources.Production values are topnotch again, and the dark, moody colored cinematography is an artistic triumph. It is impressive at how mainstream films have pushed the creative aspects of film-making without sacrificing popularity; witness the cinematography and art direction of The Dark Knight and the film editing in The Bourne Ultimatum. It has almost become passé to expect imaginative state of the art special effects in the Potter films, but they are always serving the plot and not merely to draw attention to the spectacle itself.Since these are British performers, there is a bit of adjusting to their heavy British accents. This film, perhaps more than any other, assumes that the audience is already well versed on Potter lore, and so it may prove a bit confusing to the uninitiated. It starts out well and tries one's patience just a tad as it builds a complex narrative that loses steam half-way through and picks up momentum toward the end and never lets up with a devastating payoff which in turn sets up the two part finale in grand fashion.Though not the best film of the series, The Half-Blood Prince sets the table for the final battle of good versus evil. This must be a pretty good film because I can't wait for the final installments.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince

162,arthera09,maybe the best Potter Movie,8,26 July 2009,"I loved this movie honestly. The third may still be my favorite, but this movie has a lot going for it. It had some good camera angles and shots that made me happy. I guess what makes this a good movie is that it worked as a movie and did not try to put too much from the book in and make it feel too disjointed. The best thing about this movie is that for once the kids felt like the kids that they actually are. They feel like teenagers dealing with lots of different issues and teenagers deal with. I do not mind that that moved up certain romantic aspects of the book, because it felt right. I think the entire cast really came around and gave some top notch performances even with minimal screen time. I love the casting that they manage to pull off even though they get so little screen time. I love what Maggie Smith did with her few scenes especially the end. I really felt the emotion of the loss at that moment. Rickman gave his best performance as Snape and those that know how the books end have the pleasure of recognizing how good his performance is and what a tough job he has. I still love Luna Lovegood and she was as quirky and perfect as always. Also some great casting of young Tom Riddle. I think overall this have the best performances of the entire cast with a few exceptions. Hagrid did a great job in the first and third movie and did not get a lot of screen time here. This might have annoyed some of the audience, but I love how they put in Remus and Tonks relationship in the movie in the smallest way but did not put any focus on it. It gives us an idea of that real people with real relationships are at stake here. I might not like how some of the side cast did not get bigger moments especially the other students, but I would rather have a coherent movie that a bunch of random moments strung together. I did have to say I think the music was overpowering at moments, but the lack of music in the last scene was nicely done. I think Yates did an excellent job and have high hopes for the last (two) movies.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
163,joestank15,"Dark, funny, and not weighed down by too much exposition.",9,19 July 2009,"Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - A footnote: Funny thing about Harry Potter reviews. If you peruse enough of them, you'll notice that ""lack of nit-picks"" is a substitute for praise. Everyone comes from different points of view when they go in to see these films. Some people read the books, some haven't. Everyone has their favorites, or hates the films in general. I have never experienced the films without having read the books first so I cannot comment on how hard it is to follow any of them. For some they are too long, for some not enough. I have enjoyed all of the films to varying degrees all for different reasons. David Yates continues from where he left Order of the Phoenix, arguably the weakest of the seven books but one of the stronger films.In the sixth Harry Potter, Harry works with Dumbledore to unlock a key secret about Voldemort. To do this, Harry has to get close to Professor Slughorn (played with aplomb by Jim Broadbent). What interested me most about the way this is played out are the quiet similarities presented between Harry and Tom Riddle. Dumbledore actively wants Harry to act more like Tom in an attempt to defeat him. This enhances the idea posited back in the 2nd film and book. The sub-plots surrounding this are delightful. Quidditch has never been done so well. The Slug Party is also delightful. Harry's fancying Ginny and Ron's troubles between Lavender and Hermione round out the film. A small downside of this is there is less room for some of the best talent in the UK, many of whom merely supply the garnish on a good meal.Michael Gambon is wonderful in this turn as the greatest wizard Dumbledore. He just needed the screen time to shine. I hope this nails the lid on the doubters. Alan Rickman plays Snape to perfection, much as it would have been fun to see him momentarily lose his cool. Maggie Smith and Robbie Coltrane have wonderful cameos. I seem to be the only person that appreciates Daniel Radcliffe post-Equus. I think the young man has really come into his own. Rupert Grint has also become a fine comedic actor. Tom Felton slowly freaks the hell out as a young man given an impossible task. My favorite little scene stealer is Evanna Lynch as Luna Lovegood.The film plays fast and loose with the source material, and, unlike with Prisoner of Azkaban, the results are not disappointing. On the contrary, this might be, next to Goblet of Fire, my favorite of the films. Part of the reason this time is the film's atmosphere is so appropriate, the characters so well acted and written, that it makes us yearn for more of everything that IS in the film, not lament what was cast aside. I can forgive plot simplification as film is a different medium. I would not have made all the choices Yates has, but he nails the beginning and end of the film, includes many touching character moments, and the movie on the whole is FUNNY damnit! True Potter fans should see that Yates has broken the letter to preserve the spirit of Harry Potter.One note from the Potter die-hard within the competent film critic: it is disappointing to miss out on one crucial flashback that would have given Ralph Fiennes a terribly awesome scene to do with Michael Gambon. As for the rest. Potter-ites, Yates has this well in hand. Put aside the canon-charts, and enjoy watching small variations on a story you know and love. I know, given the choice, I prefer a story that pops to life over one nailed down to a strict regiment of plot points and exposition. A-",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince

165,AnishMisra,Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince Review,8,11 July 2018,"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince is a film directed by David Yates. I was quite excited to watch this chapter of the film as it was the one that was closer to the final 2 chapters. And I can say it was an entertaining venture.Plot: Harry Potter stumbles upon an old potions textbook belonging to the Half Blood Prince.Story and direction: This film marked the return of Steve Kloves as screenwriter after Goblet of Fire. And he had again a daunting task of matching with David Yates' vision. But I can say they really did it. The film on a story basis has nothing much to offer. But the character work is so awesome that you can even forget the story part for some time. The characters progress has been shown over the years and that is one aspect this film is to be noted for. We see the characters having realized what love is and also whether or not they are on the good side or bad side. The conflicts are very well written and portrayed by the actors. Also very much noticeable is the photography used. I was just instantly attracted to it. The dull kind of palette suited the environment in which the film is set in. No wonder it was nominated for an Academy Award. Also the VFX are commendable especially in the Quidditch Sequence. That was just wonderful. Even Nicholas Hooper's score does wonders. My other problem with the film was the main title itself. The Half-Blood Prince as the title suggests has very little importance in the film. As the film progresses I did feel the makers just forgot the title they kept.Performances: The cast of the film is just awesome and pin-pointing out their performance would be equal to a sin. I would although like to mention Tom Felton as Draco Malfoy. He was a character that was quite much different in tone to the other films. And I commend Tom for justifying Draco's character beautifully. This film introduces Jim Broadbent as Horace Slughorn. His character was very nicely portrayed by Broadbent. Also introduced is Helen McCrory as Narcissa Malfoy. Although the role was small but it was emoted perfectly.Favorite Scene: It would be the one where Ron is lying in the hospital and Lavender Brown comes to see him. Standing beside Ron is Hermione. And Ron utter Hermione's name to Lavender's disappointment. The smile on Hermione's face was very evident and it showed the future that lies ahead of these two characters. In addition to that, I felt happy for these two characters.Verdict: Although a bit weaker in terms of plot in comparison to the previous instalments, I cannot deny from the fact that I had a good time while watching the film. Never for a moment I felt I was watching a bad movie. I am going with an 8.5/10.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince

Meanwhile, Harry is taking private lessons with Dumbledore in order to find out about Voldemort's past so they can find out what might be his only weakness.This film, I thought, brilliantly stages the penultimate and final films - in that it is very much centered on Voldemort, without excluding the magical world and the friendships within it.I really thought it was a great film in the series.

There is a little more romance in this film and again it shows that the students are getting older and wiser to real life and what its all about. It was very funny seeing the awkwardness at times and the romance does have funny cringy moments.its a great film and leads us just nicely into the final book which is split into two films and wow are they a great end but sad to see the close of such a spectacular series.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince

This is a dark film but there are also very heartfelt and sweet moments as well. You get to see Dumbledore and Harry's relationship grow as well. There are some funny parts in the movie as well.

174,Solnichka,"Mediocre, at best",6,15 July 2009,"Mediocre.The acting is as good as it's ever been, with one exception. The actor cast as the teenage Tom Riddle who asks about Horcruxes is terrible. Why they didn't re-cast the same dude from the second movie is curious. Jim Broadbent was enjoyable as Slughorn; the actors cast as Lavender Brown and Cormac McLaggen were pretty good additions, too.The film is humorous in enough places to make it enjoyable, but overall the pace of the film lags because there is no coherence to the plot flow and storyline (see reasons why below).The special effects are cool enough, but continuity issues from film to film in the series always hurt. The Burrow is now in a completely different setting than it was in the second and fourth films, for example. It's like when Hagrid's hut and the Whomping Willow were moved from their first- and second-film settings for the third movie. I mean, come on. There is ONE singular description in the texts for each of these settings. It's not hard to maintain consistency here, is it, Hollywood?? The ""fabricated"" scenes are simply asinine. And to think they were added at the expense of intriguing scenes from the text is even more disappointing. No purpose is ever given for the holiday scene addition, for example; I really have no idea why it was even in the film. The omission of some key scenes -- for instance, the entire ""Battle at Hogwarts"" that ends the sixth book was deleted, making the ending completely incoherent and weak. And the elimination of the significance of each Horcrux isn't explained, either -- not to mention the omission of the tiara in the Room of Requirement. But that isn't surprising, since the locket in the fifth book was omitted from that film as well.No Dursleys, which is always disappointing. The image in the sixth book of Dumbledore's mead glasses knocking the Dursleys upside the head would have been nice. I assume they'll just ignore the Dursleys for the seventh film, too.The Ginny-Harry subplot arch was altered in a ridiculous way, including the post-Sectumsempra event. This I can understand a bit more, since Ginny is so irrelevant in the seventh book, but still: Harry Potter in love is a key element of Book Six, and it was mostly ignored.I realize no adaptation will ever satisfy everyone, but that's what made LOTR so successful: as much adherence to the text as possible. The HP producers have failed this time, just like they did in the last two films -- the best film of the bunch was probably the third.Let's hope the seventh and eighth movies are better than this trash. Luckily, I only paid $6 to see it this morning.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
175,RCWjr,"A good film, but the least stand-alone entry in the Potter franchise",8,15 July 2009,"All in all, I enjoyed the film. There is an avant-garde feel to this chapter which has been evident in places in the previous films, but this is the first full-on attempt to make something more than pop fare. My review will come from strictly a movie knowledge of the franchise.More so than any other entry in the Potter franchise, this film requires a history with the franchise from a book and movie standpoint. If you are a casual fan or have only seen one or two of the films and have not read the books, Half-Blood Prince will be an effort for you to get through. Given that, you must give this film at least two viewings, as I did, to render a full opinion.The budding relationships between Hermonie/Ron and Harry/Jenny are prime examples where you need to be an informed fan. This is not to say the film totally blows through these relationships; the previous films have spent time setting up Hermonie & Ron, so their coming close together here is expected. However, the budding relationship between Harry and Jenny is for all sense and purposes started in this film. What may confuse the non-informed is that it is mentioned Jenny is seeing someone and is even shown kissing them. Then we see her longing for Harry. A reference to ""another"" fight between Jenny and her bf is, I suppose, meant to convey their relationship has ended. But it would be a little easier for the causal fan to accept Jenny & Harry if the whole bf subplot was done away with. Even Ron's quick relationship with Lavendar Brown (you can even miss her name if you aren't paying attention) plays out as merely a way to pull a few more laughs rather than be of any significance. The time spent on Ron and Lavendar's scenes could have been used to showcase other characters such as Luna Lovegood who is sorely underused here. Another example of new characters coming in without any previous appearance and given no setup, is Fenrir Greyback. He is never really introduced or referred to by name (a quick view of his wanted poster is the only introduction we are given), so anyone who has not read the books has no clue who he is. This could cause those not familiar with the book to struggle in their initial viewing of the film, again, reason more to give this film at least 2 viewings. We finally get some weighted screen time and performance from Malfoy and Snape; Tom Felton and Alan Rickman respectively. Both give their best performances to date. Rickman has long been underused in the series and he finally gets to put his teeth into Snape here. Felton does a great job showing Malfoy's internal struggle with the mission he is given.Jim Broadbent delivers a wonderful Professor Slughorn. Helena Bonham Carter gets more screen time as Bellatrix and delivers in spades. Michael Gambon is given the most to do with Dumbledore since he took over the roll; rising to the challenge and giving a great read on Dumbledore.Our three leads; Radcliff, Watson and Grint, give their best performances to day. There is a casual and effortless ease to their interaction with each other. By far, it is their continued mastery of the characters and craft that have been the hallmark of the series.As I have mentioned, this is a chapter of the film series that is the hardest to get through as a fan who hasn't read the books but has seen all the films. The previous films I have been able to view with no knowledge of the books and not come out feeling I missed something. This time however, as much as I enjoyed the film, I had the feeling there was a lot not featured. I felt disconnected from those around me that were more informed and could fill in the blanks left by the film. Upon a second viewing, I better understood what was going on and the film was much more enjoyable. So my recommendation to the casual fan; give this film 2 viewings, you like me, will enjoy it a lot more. A second viewing pushed this from a 7 to an 8 for me.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
176,pritol,The calm before the storm....,8,11 May 2021,"This movie is certainly a lot darker than the previous Harry Potter outings, and in many ways you feel it's the calm before the storm...In some ways this makes it a little disappointing, because all it's doing is setting up the battleground for the final story (split across two films). However in saying that, it is refreshing to have a darker story being told, it feels like the story is becoming more adult as the main characters grow up. (They have all the teenage growing pains you would expect as well, which offers some light relief throughout).What the film does do well, is give us more background on Lord Voldemort, and give the viewer an indication of what needs to be done in order to defeat him. The road to success or failure will be long...which is why they split the final book across two films.At the moment it is very much advantage Voldemort, with the Death Eaters making their presence ever more known, the animosity between Draco Malfoy and Harry Potter coming to blows, and an ending which is a total shock! (Both in who the Half Blood Prince is, and what he does...)On to the next ones!",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
177,neenahhh,Thumbs up for the action and drama! But thumbs (and toes) down for too much romance.,7,13 July 2011,"I have grown up with ""Harry Potter"" and as preparation for the last film, which is going to be shown this week, I am going to be re-watching all of the previous films this week.Harry's back again in Hogwarts for his 6th year. The school has a new Potions Master, Horace Slughorn who has a few secrets himself. Harry is assigned by Dumbledore to find out exactly what these secrets are. Harry also stumbles across a mysterious book, owned by someone titled as ""The Half-Blood Prince"". Hm.Despite, the large amount of complaints this movie had, I must say that I actually liked this movie. I haven't read the book yet, so I'd like to think of myself as an unbiased reviewer.It was nice to finally see Draco Malfoy, who is usually just in the background, have an actual decent plot line. I also immensely enjoyed the short school work scenes- especially that one session the class had with Professor Slughorn. I did want more young-Tom Riddle scenes, though. Although this movie is relatively long, I personally feel like it wasn't enough. I still want more.I wasn't a big fan of the romance scenes (SPOILERS:) especially between Ron and Lavender. (/SPOILERS) They had too much scenes together. And, in my opinion, I thought that their relationship didn't add too much to the storyline. I think they could have cut down their romance scenes to make space for much more important scenes. Useless, really. Same goes for (SPOILERS:) Harry and Ginny. (/SPOILERS)I felt like the transition between scenes were sometimes, a bit choppy. Twice, I had to ask myself, how the characters arrived at the scene they were in. I also think that sine scenes were very unclear. (SPOILERS:) For example, the Weasley house scene during the holidays and the Aragog scene. What made these scenes happen? (/SPOILERS) I think that only readers of the book really understood what was going on.Nevertheless, I will stick with my original notion because I did like this movie. I liked the drama and the intensity. Minus points for too much romance, though. Yates could have done away with those, really. But other than that, great film! It made me excited for the next two films.Viewed on: July 13, 2011",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
178,eschetic-2,A fine companion to the book: EXCELLENT for two thirds of the way,7,15 July 2009,"As good a time as is to be had for fans and those new to the Harry Potter world, it's difficult not to be a bit let down after last night's supposed Premier midnight showing of HARRY POTTER AND THE HALF BLOOD PRINCE - suggested by the book which was the emotional climax of the wonderful series (even though it would take one more blockbuster book to resolve the main story lines).This latest (6th of a projected 8 films - the action-packed 7th book is to be transformed into two movies) is very good if not quite excellent for the first 2/3 and FAR better over all than movies 3 or 4. For anyone who didn't already know the story, it might merit eight or even nine stars rather than the seven it earned for me, but that let down in the last half hour is undeniable despite the great final scene of the three friends watching the phoenix from one of Hogwarts' high towers and setting up the next film....HALF BLOOD PRINCE might actually have *been* the best of the films as some sycophantic print reviews would have it, for most of the way even with the massive editing of side plots, and reassigning of lines to build up some characters. This is beautifully filmed visual story telling and the maturing cast - especially the three leads and Tom Felton's increasingly impressive Draco Malfoy have, for the most part, never been better in the subtle aspects of their characters. If Christian Coulson's charismatic Tom Malvolo Riddle (from ...THE CHAMBER OF SECRETS) is sorely missed from the undernourished Riddle flashback scenes (one gathers mere movie viewers are never to be allowed enough of Lord Voldemort's back story to make him more than an ""Emperor Ming""-like cardboard villain) and Bonnie Wright's blandly ironed hair undercuts her visual interest as the increasingly important Ginny Weasley, such forgivable matters are more than made up for by Michael Gambon finally having grown into Richard Harris' beard as a worthy Albus Dumbledore (how I look forward to his scene ""in King's Cross Station"" in the final film!), Jessie Cave's enthusiastic Lavender Brown, Jim Broadbent's perfectly fearful Horace Slughorn, and Alan Rickman's increasing fun playing the as yet unrevealed ambiguities in Severus Snape!The problems lie (and STOP READING NOW if you want to avoid serious spoilers!) in the failure to carry the figurative magic through to the end of the film. Despite the return of an essential Quiddich match, much of the actual *magic* is unnecessarily removed (a minor example: none of the *portraits* move!), the film distorts the essential nature of some of the characters (HOW could the unimaginative film maker diminish Harry to a ""wand out"" but inactive observer to the final confrontation on the Tower!?), simple rules in Rawlings' carefully crafted ""Potter World"" (like NO-ONE, including Dumbledore, being able to ""apparate"" on the grounds) are needlessly ignored and, perhaps most obvious, the first ""Battle of Hogwarts"" leading to the nicely captured emotional climax of the piece is entirely eliminated - a sad fact telegraphed early when Harry drinks *all* the Felix Felisis for a strangely UNset-up trip down to Hagrid's!! From that moment on it's ""'uh oh!' time"" for serious Potter fans.The ""flight of a future Headmaster"" which follows the non-battle - thrilling, important and intense in the book - is here a literally plodding affair with entirely gratuitous arson tossed in and with the title revelation made but *never* explained! The ...PRINCE remains a highly enjoyable film for what it is, but bit of a pity: a film which flirted with greatness only to wind up more a nice ""companion to the book"" rather than actual film ""of"" or even ""inspired by"" it. Those shallow analysts who solemnly proclaim that much must be left out of any book as long as these need to have another look at GONE WITH THE WIND or other major studio films made for adults from adult novels. The Potter films will achieve greatness when made for the adults (and adult mentalities) the books have helped develop.I had cherished the hope that this time out a POTTER film would merit the Best Picture Oscar come next spring as the final LORD OF THE RINGS film managed. J.K Rowlings certainly gave them the material, and the hope lingered right up until Harry downed the Felix and felix left the film. That Oscar honor may yet be in store for the final films for the overall series and its overwhelming success - the writing in the BOOK of ""Deathly Hallows"" was the weakest of the series for all its action - but weak books frequently make great films and in the real and Harry Potter worlds, hope springs eternal - although with more and more of the meat removed from the characters with each film - replaced poorly by ""improvements"" from screenwriters who seem unfamiliar with the canon (only Cormac McLaggen's earning a detention for throwing up on Snape's shoes is worth the screen time this time out) it becomes harder to maintain the hope.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince

Excellent cinematography, sound, score, editing, art direction, lighting, costume design and screenplay. Very well acted, especially from the established older actors, like Maggie Smith, Jim Broadbent, Julie Walters, Alan Rickman etc. Daniel Radcliffe is aging very well into the Harry Potter role, as is Rupert Grint.

181,i_odin,Favourite in the Series,9,12 July 2021,"The reason why love Half Blood Prince above all (and mind you I have read the books much later) is because this film thematically defines the Wizarding World (cinematic universe, of course) which we know today. Before that every other film is thematically very distinct. Even certain films were idealogically separate. But after HBP the whole film found its own voice. Although I know that even the books do change their tone as they mature. But the films with Half Blood Prince finds a new humor and resonance between characters which kind of becomes the central theme later in Fantastic Beasts also. I for one love this shift, especially after Order of Phoenix being so dark.Having said that, I am aware that the films never really reaches the depth of the story the books have, but Half Blood Prince creates its own niche when it comes to the cinematic world.The camaraderie between the characters, enhanced by the beautiful scores, the visual effects and of course the living and breathing Hogwarts surely gives you the feel. Yes sometimes one can't compare them with the human imagination but they surely stands on their own merit.P. S. I have no idea why I wrote this review literally a decade after watching this movie for the first time but surely I feel this was long due.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
182,piratecannon,A Step in the Right Direction,8,27 December 2012,"Over the years, I've found that the Harry Potter films have been consistently competent, but they seem to repeat themselves with fairly redundant story lines. As I've often disclosed to my wife, the movies are comprised of one basic formula: there's a mystery at Hogwarts, and it's up to Mr. Potter and company to discover the truth and prevent any wrongdoing.Cue Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince. This is a fresh, gutsy new chapter in the franchise that actually develops and matures the characters and plot in significant ways.This Potter film is foreboding even from the title screen, and the dark tone is pervasive throughout. Thankfully, director David Yates has been able to successfully transition his young cast into a role we've all experienced—that of the uncertain teenager. There are times when the excessively sappy ""snogging"" (Rowling—or maybe British?—lingo for ""kissing,"" though it certainly could indicate something much more ""adult"") between Ron and an obsessed admirer gets a little old, but on the whole Half-Blood Prince skillfully balances the true life malaise of post-adolescence with the growing threat of Voldemort and his followers. I found myself yawning during the previous Potter flicks, but there was a real sense of danger in Half-Blood Prince. There's an especially creepy scene in a cave that might be a little much for kids, but it proves that these movies are capable of maturing and saying a little something about the harsh realities of becoming an adult; namely, taking on responsibility that we may not always like. There may be some thinly layered subtext about teenage drug use as well, as the prominent classroom lessons of the film are squarely centered on potion-mixing and its results.Perhaps the best thing about Half-Blood Prince is that when it ends on a startling somber, meditative note, viewers have a clear sense that there is something truly important and worthwhile on the horizon. Whereas I didn't really care about what came next in regards to the other Potter sequels, this one leaves you wondering (if you're like me and haven't read the books, that is) how this is all going to play out. There's some real urgency here, and that's more than I can say about this movie's predecessors.The acting is solid all around, with Emma Watson delivering the most believable ""troubled teen"" performance. Jim Broadbent is a good addition to any movie, and the rest of the cast takes on their respective roles with the gusto necessary to help solidify the dark tone that helps Half-Blood Prince stand out as an entry in the series that's certainly worthwhile.In spite of all this, Half-Blood Prince sometimes feels as if it's straining to be an epic a-la Lord of the Rings, complete with Dumbledore in a Gandalf pose, waving his wand as it rains fire upon foes, spewing the usual all-knowing, cool-as-a-cucumber lines, and emphasizing the worldwide importance of the various tasks at hands. There are a couple of completely unnecessary scenes that result in whimsy that feels slightly out of place (given the tone), such as the hammy eulogy of a giant, dead spider.These complaints are minor, though. Despite how you feel about the books, this is certainly the best Harry Potter film yet. For once, I'm actually excited about what the future of this series has in store for us.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
183,basilisksamuk,Underwhelming,6,1 February 2013,"By January 2013 I had never read a Harry Potter book or seen any of the movies. I decided to start with the movies.I was a little underwhelmed by this entry in the series. It's perfectly watchable but seemed more aimed at advancing the story and rushing on to the matter of having to find horcruxes to defeat voldemort than anything else. Essentially this is setting up for the last two films of the series and as such seems a little contrived.Alan Rickman gets more screen time in this entry and that's always a good thing. In terms of set pieces the recovery of a horcrux by Dumbledore and Harry proves to be very visually arresting and left me wishing for more scenes of similar visual complexity.Casting around for more to say really – the film is OK but not more. There is also the problem, common to long running TV series and film series where a major character is killed off. By now we are so used to the way this is handled that we never believe the dead character will stay dead – there will either be a cunning future plot to explain why they didn't actually die, or they will come back as a ghost or other supernatural being and go on nagging the other characters about what they should or shouldn't do.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
184,liberalgems,What Happens When You Write Yourself Into A Corner!,1,16 July 2009,"I found Half-Blood to be very depressing and even worse, so predictable! There is no greater sin in writing a story, except being boring! The story also made no sense. No, I did not read the books, nor would I ever waste my time. The only strength in the world of Harry Potter is the bond amongst friends. This strong sense of friendship and loyalty are the only reasons why I, and many other people, keep going to the theater. Of the six films, only the previous one ""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,"" felt enjoyable and made plenty of sense. In Half-Blood, I'm amazed that you can kill off a major character and have even Harry Potter, himself, going around saying: ""It was a waste, it had no meaning. He died for nothing."" How ironic when a story's main character literally sums up the ENTIRE story! I had high hopes for Half-Blood! I don't like seeing Harry Potter and all the other ""Good Guys"" being so powerless/clueless, or a main character turning into pure evil for absolutely no reason, whatsoever! (I should be able to know what's going on by not having to read the books. I have watched every film in order, but it still made no sense!) What is obvious to me is that the Harry Potter series has become a commodity like toothpaste and underarm deodorant! Lets stretch a very thin storyline into as many billions of dollars as possible, and see all the star-struck idiots spend their money! Sorry to say, Harry Potter could have easily been condensed into a trilogy and if Half-Blood was never written/filmed it would not have harmed the Harry Potter storyline ONE iota! Sorry, but when the grand finale comes out, I'm skipping the theaters and going to rent it for free from my local library. I have spent enough money on Harry Potter movie tickets and I have no intention, whatsoever, to waste another penny on making the writers and filmmakers of Harry Potter, richer!",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
185,jburtroald95,"Astonishing, terrific, multi-layered, excellent, satisfying...",10,15 August 2009,"The sixth instalment of the long-running Harry Potter series based on J.K.Rowling's series of novels is a remarkable achievement from director David Yates and joins its predecessor Order of the Phoenix as the franchise's two best releases. It has been very intriguing to see the development of the characters, plot and style throughout the saga. I'm sure we're all curious to see what things will be like in the eighth – the seventh book, Deathly Hallows, has will be split into two parts –and final film. While the first was simply a children's fantasy/adventure mostly, the latest one is a mixture of mainly three genres: action, romantic comedy and mystery. Now that the return of Lord Voldemort has became known to the general public of the wizarding community, the monstrous villain has ceased to restrain his merciless and menacing Death Eaters and so they have gone on a violent rampage through the cities and towns of both the muggle and wizarding worlds. This as well as a perilous and noble endeavour the title character embarks on late in the film, produces a number of intensely terrifying action sequences that are scattered throughout the film to give you a powerful adrenalin rush when needed. At Hogwarts however, within the magical protective barrier that keeps the Death Eaters from entering the school, things have settled down since the previous year. The new professor, Horace Slughorn (Jim Broadbent), proves to be far less malevolent and troublesome than the vile Professor Umbridge, and is instead a rather wild, nervous and eccentric old man who likes to make allies of his brightest students and takes a liking to Harry. With this and the fact that most of the central characters are now sixteen and beginning to mature into adulthood, the stage is set for some very interesting suppressed feelings of love and flirtatious gestures from the students we've come to know. These are portrayed as they should be, light-hearted and humorous, and give some delightful lighter moments to contrast with the darker ones. The mystery elements are the most prominent, and are the major parts of the plot. Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) and Professor Dumbledore (Michael Gambon) investigate Voldemort's past and begin to discover his true origins and, more importantly, the secrets behind the key to his power. There is also an unmistakable sign of trouble as Professor Snape (Alan Rickman) – who is now the new Defence against the Dark Arts teacher – and young Draco Malfoy (Tom Felton), whose father is now in Azkaban and who also now seems to have outgrown his shallow stereotype of the a schoolyard bully, both seem to be acting very suspiciously. This is definitely more harrowing than anything we have seen before in the series, and leaves one feeling devastated and breathless, yet aching for more. As we begin to see how desperate things have become, how truly complicated it will be to finally vanquish Voldemort, and how little of a match Harry is against the Death Eaters, there is a troubling sense of danger and hopelessness. There is also a death even more tragic than that of Sirius Black near the end that shatters the hearts of all both in the theatre and on the screen. The changes in style and mood are done smoothly and flawlessly, and the film has complete control over what you think and feel. All elements come together wonderfully, especially the cast that is sensational as always and includes Emma Watson, Rupert Grint, Helena Bonham Carter, Evanna Lynch, Julie Walters, Mark Williams, Freddie Stroma, Robbie Coltrane, David Thewlis, David Legeno, Helen McRoy, Maggie Smith, Jessie Cave, Frank Dillane, Hero Fiennes-Tiffin and Georgina Leonidas; and though there are a few noticeable yet minor divergences from the novel, they can easily be excused.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince

I have seen all the Harry Potter movies but they have been declining over the years. Each one seems a bit more lack luster than the last. Half Blood Prince is not a good title, since the movie isn't about him. The movie is about love relationships of the students and who is snogging who. It is about time Harry Potter started having sex. After all the actor playing him is twenty.

Definitely makes you wish the next 2 years had passed so that you could see both parts of the last movie already. Harry is now a young man and his friends Hermione and Ron are coming of age. Lots of teen romance and anguish plus some great laughs which I thought really made the movie gel. Of course the action scenes ,especially the scenes in the ocean cave were very intense and dark. I didn't read the books but of course the darn internet made it too much to resist skimming the meat of the plot. I hated already knowing what would happen at the end and wished I wouldn't have read the wikipedia plot details on the books. Still though , the last 15 minutes of the movie were very sad and did tug at my heart. I will say though that the ending scene involving Harry ,Ron and Hermione was well done and the scenery beautiful -it gave me a sense of hope for the 3 who must inevitably face their fears and the dark lord one last time. See you next yr for part 1 of the Deathly Hallows. I can't wait.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
189,tubby1,A darker Hogwarts and much the better for it.,8,12 December 2009,"Dark, atmospheric and offset at points with comedic respite David Yates after his excellent Order of the Phoenix, turns out a fine spectacle with The Half-Blood Prince. Yes the Half-Blood Prince misses large pieces of the book, and yes I was not happy for it to lose so many memorable moments but as a piece of film it really does impress.The fluffy and magical childlike quality of the previous films is almost stripped bare by The Half-Blood Prince. The franchise has grown up and accordingly the ante and entertainment value has risen. There are actual moments of horror, which would scare the younger audience but it is perfectly balance in my opinion as not to be a hindrance to their enjoyment. I very much also appreciated the light-hearted moments which seem to be most effective in this film, Rupert Grint in particular shines.David Gambon turns in his best performance as Dumbledore, in actual fact I began to equate Dumbledore to Gandalf, which in my opinion is an indication of how much more credence I now give to Harry's fateful journey. Jim Broadbent is a wonderful addition to the cast as Horace Slughorn and Tom Felton as Draco is given a much more emotive core and impresses.The special effects have gone up another notch, as they always do, and the score and production values are of the highest quality. The one and only negative of the Half-Blood Prince is that it does not translate events that well, if you haven't read the book you may be a little lost. For instance Dumbledore's withered hand at the very start is not really brought clearly to your attention, there is not much at all on the story of the mysterious Half-Blood Prince or indeed how Dumbledore knew where to search for the next Horocrux. Also a little more back story of Tom Riddle aka Lord Voldermort would have been logical and prudent for events to come.In my opinion Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince is a fine film, no doubt aided by the more troublesome and darker times at Hogwarts. If you can forgive the directness of the script, and some loss of clarity, you will appreciate the atmosphere and spectacle of the Half-Blood Prince.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
190,InaneSwine,The darkest of all Harry Potter films,9,18 February 2016,"Half Blood Prince is the darkest of all Harry Potter films - quite literally. The grading effect applied to almost every single shot give the film an almost sepia tone, making the film look like the sets were illuminated solely by candles. However, given that this sixth instalment of the franchise is the most emotionally painful to go through, it works.Characters who have previously hovered mainly in the background finally take centre-stage. Tom Felton shows us a side to Malfoy - and himself - we never thought existed, and some of the finest work in Alan Rickman's career can be seen in this film. Finally, with regards to Dumbledore, one wonders how Richard Harris would have approached the material had he survived to the sixth film. His take on the character in the first two instalments is decidedly different to Gambon's in subsequent films. Nonetheless, Gambon certainly owns the part in this one, and there can be no doubt that he truly is Dumbledore.Alongside the emotionally weighty scenes is the franchise's trademark charming humour - supplied predominantly by Grint, Lynch and newcomers Jim Broadbent and Jessie Cave. The action scenes are very well shot, and the dark scenes are truly terrifying. After the final scene, you will be dying to find out what happens next.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
191,Doublej20005,The Weakest So Far. Still Great Though.,8,12 February 2021,"When I was younger, this was always my least favourite of the films, and I think I was being really harsh cause I enjoyed it a damn lot this time. Now I still think there is too much focus on the romantic aspect, and there are still a few small moments (Snape never explaining why he is the Half-Blood Prince, Dumbledore apparating in Hogwarts, some choppy action editing) do still annoy me, but there is a lot to love here. Slughorn is a great addition, and we get some much needed backstory for Voldemort. The Dumbledore/Harry stuff is the best its ever been, the Draco Malfoy parts are really good, and this might be the flat-out-funniest of the series. The visuals are also really good here, and it's great to see how they have changed over the series to match the tone. I feel like I haven't mentioned how good the cast are in a while - Michael Gambon and Alan Rickman in particular are both phenomenal here, and the original cast who were once kids and, frankly, not that good, have much improved over the years. Overall, this still isn't my favourite, but I think I was way too harsh to a genuinely great film.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
192,blackburnj-1,Magnificent entertainment delivers one of the best of the series,8,15 July 2009,"It is somewhat amazing to think that this series is coming to an end. When it first started, eight years ago, it seemed to be a very dull transfer to screen but, under the guidance of some fine directors, the films have become highlights of a year's releases. With ""Half-Blood Prince"" we have the best of the films since Alfonso Cuaron's ""Prisoner of Azkaban"". Though some problems remain, this is a thoroughly entertaining, highly effective, visually arresting piece of work which can be enjoyed by young and old alike.Director David Yates made his first Potter film last time round, with ""Order of the Phoenix"", which is the worst of the books. Here, he has the return of the stock writer of the series, Steve Kloves, and a tighter, more exciting book to work with. He is directing the final parts of the saga and you can feel that he is holding himself back before a final assault on a salivating audience but not enough to stop this from being a top quality piece of blockbuster entertainment and fine storytelling.Yates understands the world he is working in and the audience (or should that be audiences) he is playing to, maintaining a balance throughout between the traditional darkness (now darker than before) and the lightness and wonder of J.K. Rowling's universe. He opens with a brutal scene of destruction, before following it with a brief spell-casting scene where the youthful wonder of Harry allows the audience to immerse themselves once more in the world of Potter. The film is long but it merits every minute of its running time and feels a lot shorter than some of the bloated early instalments (though plot is largely favoured over character here). Yates also has a visual style which is breathtaking. The design of the world is as complete and absorbing as ever and it is shot brilliantly, whilst the visual effects are staggering. Despite the huge computer-generated arsenal at his disposal, Yates's directorial style remains subtle and effective. He makes his audience laugh (the return of Kloves to writing duties after a one film break leading to a return of wit), scream and sit on the edge of their seats as he moves effortlessly from light comedy to grand set piece to an absorbing, dramatic moment.As always, the cast of great British thesps excel. Michael Gambon is terrific as Dumbledore in his role's biggest film. Alan Rickman is his usual self, having enormous fun as Snape, though not as much fun as Helena Bonham Carter appears to be having as Bellatrix Lestrange. But the standout of the established actors is Jim Broadbent as Professor Slughorn who is a magnetic and charismatic presence. The younger actors have improved once more. For the lead three, these are their best performances yet, but they still haven't delivered really exceptional performances, though Tom Felton (Draco Malfoy) is surprisingly strong in an expanded role, whilst Evanna Lynch (Luna Lovegood) and Jessie Cave (Lavender Brown) are really impressive.However, the real strength of this film is its excellent story-telling. It never lets the pace drop and has some very gripping scenes. The grand set pieces are all carried off with aplomb. The final horcrux sequence is as gripping as it is in the book and brought to life with great visual verve. But, the bit after that (yes, that bit), isn't as gutting as it perhaps should be. Perhaps that's because the end of the book is so memorable that, those who know it's coming, pre-empt it, but it still feels a little undercooked. Then again, Yates has said that he's holding himself back, but he demonstrates here, with an excellent film, that he can deliver. Roll on the grand finale.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
193,MovieZoo,Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince: full blooded funmaking fills my veins,8,18 July 2009,"Finally!! A Harry Potter movie that I really liked.For the first time I felt like I could connect with the characters. I am sure it is because of only a couple differences between this HP movie and the others: the in-depth, overall use of the younger characters and the CGI.While the mainstream characters are back a little older and wiser, they are still young enough to be learning. And the learning process is more engaging - charming, witty and even frightening. The magic takes the backseat to mortality. While the traditional magic is at hand and wand, it's that human process we can all relate to that sucked me in. Don't get me wrong, the magic is still there and it is plentiful, but the things we mortals know about are more enchanting, yet fearful.The CGI was fantastic. Not at all as cartoonish as Harry Potter CGI in the past. Yes there are scenes we all challenge and attribute to CGI, but the realism has been enhanced - less bright, cartoonish fakery.Some may be disappointed with the path the movie avoided, and yes I hear it is still unlike the book, but I say ""So what, there is much better quality in the movie"". There is violence(no surprise there), there is love, there is life and there is definitely more hope for Harry Potter.8 out of 10 and that's saying a lot from me",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
194,georgioskarpouzas,The awakening of the chosen ones,7,28 August 2009,"This movie left me pleased in general. I will not try to grade it in comparison with the other Potter movies but I have to note certain aspects that make it distinct. The most obvious one is its comparatively overt portrayal of the adolescent awakening of the attraction to the opposite sex. The fact that the main characters are more that just friends becomes more than evident for the fist time. I have not read the book in order to be able to say whether that is the choice of the director or the accurate reproduction of the novelistic text but either way it is a departure from the past.Also it is clear that both Harry and Draco come to self-realization through their role as chosen agents of Good as personified by Dumbledore and Evil as personified by Voldemort, respectively. This is an innovation especially concerning Draco whose character was more one-sided and flat, as Tom Felton admitted in an public appearance in the opening of the movie in Athens.The entrance of a new character, former teacher of Tom Riddle, that is Voldemort, with a good performance by the actor adds interest to the movie since this character is complex, being secretive and vain and prone to favouritism without being essentially evil, in any accepted sense of the term.He is also the one who defines the meaning of the term Horcrux for the first time.Of course the major event of the movie is the assassination of Dumbledore, which he seemed to expect and did not give the impression of doing much to avert, given his universally acclaimed magical powers.Finally despite its wholly outlandish magical context, this movie related to real-life situations, as rivalry, jealousy, favouritism and realization of personal destiny.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
195,sammielimehouse-84658,An Underwhelming Film Saved by Great Ending,9,9 June 2021,"This movie is incredibly disappointing, especially when considering it's source material. Half-Blood Prince was one of my favorite books in the entire Harry Potter series. But this film is nothing like the book it came from. This movie felt bland and felt like something big was missing. About halfway through I knew this movie would be my lowest rated in the entire franchise, but then the ending happened. The ending of this film is easily the best of the entire series, and I think it's even superior to the graveyard scene from Goblet of Fire. Overall, this was an unbelievably disappointing film that was saved by a perfect ending.8.5/10.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
196,andrewjoy-75878,Um,10,26 March 2020,"Luna lovegood is the backbone of the series, an underused and unapriciated character",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
197,Monotreme02,The best in the series so far - the last half-hour in particular is incredible,7,16 July 2009,"A fact too many filmmakers and producers tend to forget lately is that the single most important element of making a successful film is a compelling plot and characters. While the previous entry in the series, the fifth, perhaps suffered from too much plot and characters, this latest installment, with its substantially longer running time, reaches a very satisfying balance. Sure, many sub-plots and entire sequences are lost in the adaptation, but this is an understandable and natural event, and necessary to condense the plot and keep things moving along. But more importantly, the filmmakers and screenwriter Steve Kloves know where to keep the focus for most of the duration of the film: its characters. At least in its first couple of hours, the film is essentially a character study, building up the relationships, feelings, thoughts and emotions of its three (already-not-so-young) protagonists – Harry, Ron and Hermione – while also devoting substantial time to develop and explore the emotional conflicts of a fourth character who was always so flat throughout the first five films but finally fulfills and even surpasses his potential this time around – Draco Malfoy. I was overjoyed that the film took the time out to develop his character and portray his emotions and conflicts, and it added an extra compelling element to an already very rich film.These first two hours, besides showcasing some fascinating and excellently done character development as well as some darker but quite important and gripping plot points are for the most part quite light-hearted and humorous, and better than any other film in the series showcase just what life is really like for these hormonal, developing teenagers, on top of all their burdens. The fifth film was rather weighed down by its focus on plot and the conflict and emotional burden of the characters, but the fourth film, my second favourite in the series, dabbed quite successfully into this territory. Now, the sixth builds upon and expands these themes to provide some of the most enjoyable and certainly the absolute funniest scenes in the entire series. But it is in its final half hour that this film truly and utterly surpasses anything else previously achieved in the series. The shift in tone to dead-serious and quite somber and emotional – not to mention totally gripping, thrilling and quite scary – from the funny and light-hearted first couple of hours is most appropriate and expertly done, and the important plot developments that unfold in this final half hour are without a doubt the best scenes of the entire film series so far; they are just absolutely, no-holds-barred, purely magical and hauntingly beautiful cinematic moments that take the film and the series in general to a whole new level of compelling drama. Harry isn't dealing with trolls or giant spiders or dragons or anything of that sort anymore – he's dealing with massive, life-altering, burdening emotions, and it's all so absolutely compelling and thrilling that I can't stop thinking of the half hour alone.Over the years, this franchise has become an absolute haven for the best of what two very distinct groups of film industry employees have to offer: classic British actors and technical craftsmen. Starting with the first group, I want to heap endless praise on all the actors who appeared in the film – and it's quite a large ensemble. First and foremost, the three lead actors. It is an absolute and indescribable treat to see how much these three young performers have developed as actors and honed their talents to perfection from the first film when they were just 11-year-old children. Watching the entire series, it is impossible not to notice the immense leaps and bounds in talent, charisma and prowess these three make from film to film, and in this one, all three of them deliver absolutely spectacular, emotional and honest performances – they've really outdone themselves, and I salute them for that. Also worth mentioning is Tom Felton, who was always quite enjoyable but harmless as Harry's smug, tormenting bully in the previous five films but who this time around finally gets his shining moment, and showcases some really, really great and most impressive acting chops in an emotional, intense performance I don't think anyone thought he had in him. And then we have one of the most impressive, talented and encompassing supporting ensembles, composed of literally the best of the best that Britain has to offer in terms of acting talent. Many absolutely fantastic and classic performers are unfortunately (but unavoidably) underused in this entry, although most of them have already had moments to shine in previous films – Helena Bonham Carter, Timothy Spall, Maggie Smith, Robbie Coltrane and David Thewlis are just a few, but there are plenty more. But a few of these supporting actors get to take center stage in this film, and particularly worth mentioning are Alan Rickman, Michael Gambon, and Jim Broadbent. Broadbent's casting was a stroke of genius as he manages to take a rather unsympathetic character from the book and really change him and shape him into his own, adding this whole crusty old British countryman element to it and really making him quite endearing and fascinating. Then we have Alan Rickman, who has always added something interesting and absolutely divine to the franchise, and who with his sharp punctuations and long pauses between words makes Snape one of the most effectively sinister characters in any film of the genre. And finally, we have Michael Gambon, who was always effective as Dumbledore since replacing the late and great Richard Harris in the third film but who really outdoes himself and draws from the kind of acting chops he's always shown throughout his career and that awarded him the title Sir to deliver his best performance in the series, and perhaps what is the single best performance of this film in particular.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince

200,MairegChernet,Reaches neither the depth nor the complexity of the book but still pretty damn impressive,9,16 July 2009,"HP6 is a dark and emotionally thrilling masterpiece. It combines magical awes that appeal mostly to children as well as mature and dark themes that appeal to almost everyone. It discovers the dark and mysterious past of you-know-who and leaves the audience aching for more as its two and half hours run time go by in a flash. The film contains dazzling visuals and terrific cinematography. It is indeed a satisfying experience that will please just about everyone. One thing is for certain though: in resemblance to the Rowling novels, the film series seems to get darker and more mature with every passing film while keeping an incredible PG rating (in the exception of HP4 & 5). This film not only has some bangs and booms but also explores the theme of teenage love as the three protagonists find themselves tangled in teenage romances. Overall a top notch film worth seeing over and over. Cant wait for the arrival of the Deathly Hallows.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
201,copperncherrio,Obligation sucks.,6,13 March 2011,"Before the movie: There is an obligation with Harry Potter. Not as much initial excitement as before , but some strange moral obligation to go to the theater and commit. I'll go to the theater, but unlike the last 5 movies, perhaps I won't go to the midnight showing. But then I'll be haunted with a new pile of regrets: not having seen the second movie until the DVD came out and not having seen the third film until the DVD. But I came back at four! But was only left with disappointment with the fifth. Ironically, I've been to every midnight showing of Pirates (Trilogy?) and I did not like the first one.They have waited too long to let this movie come out. Damn you! My love for Harry Potter film series have morphed from cocaine to low grade crack, the addition is still there. Let's just hope this was better than Harry Potter: Order of the Phoenix. -----Review: Meh, it was a dragging my feet through the sand I knew the day at the beach would be fun at first, but all I ended up doing was cleaning the sand off my feet and picking at my salted skin. I read all the books, I know what happens I guess I just lost the heart for this. It was very boring watch and it did not have the heart it did when it began. I only give it higher marks only for sentiment like a bump you would give a relative, just because they grew up with you. Blah.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
202,TheNabOwnzz,Atmospheric darkness & emotional intensity result in one of the better entries of the series,8,27 June 2018,"While Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince still utilizes cheesy teenage romance scenes and subplots like the previous entries in these series, it is undeniably dark, much darker than its predecessors as every single scene seems to feature low key lighting which further enhances the onimous feel we get after watching the more serious scenes.Finally we once again have an entry that is able to equal the Prisoner of Azkaban in its cinematography, as the Half-Blood Prince has absolutely superb visuals. New cinematographer Bruno Delbonnel went for this unique look where nearly every scene spits out the atmospheric darkness that is within its sinister plot, and the result is the visuals tell the story in a great way. There are many great shots in the Half-Blood Prince, most of all the one in which Harry & Dumbledore try to grab the Horcrux in the cave, which is the epitome of fantastic cinematography due to the perfect angles & the obscuring yet detailed minimal lighting. As stated before ofcourse some of the cheesy teenage coming of age romance returns which might take your mind of the seriousness of the plot most of the time, but i found that it actually works quite well as it significantly enhances the character immersion between the three leads, which is ofcourse an essential aspect to keep. ( Especially towards the end of the series as we need to be interested in their fates )Rupert Grint & Emma Watson are once again outstanding as Ron Weasley & Hermione Granger. Daniel Radcliffe is once again not amazing as Harry Potter, but it's not that he becomes a serious weak spot that brings the movie's general core down ( See Kristen Stewart in Twilight for that... ). Alan Rickman, Michael Gambon & Jim Broadbent as professor Slughorn are most of the notable performances in the film, as the latter is a brilliant addition of a sympathetic Slytherin house character, something that was obviously quite lacking in previous films. We also get to explore Draco's ( Tom Felton ) character more in this one until we find out that he is not necessarily a bad kid as he was portrayed most of the time in its predecessors, but simply a product of indoctrination, most likely by his death eater parents.The final half hour is, like in most Harry Potter films, once again extremely satisfying, as it features the incredible visuals in the cave scene stated before and the emotional outburst after watching Dumbledore be betrayed and killed by Snape, after which an extended scene is filmed with various people surrounding Dumbledore with no dialogue while everybody is holding their wand up as an honor to the great magician. This is coupled by a fantastic emotional score by Nicholas Hooper who makes fantastic use of the violins to create that dramatic sound which equals what we feel after seeing such a close friend to the audience get killed. John Williams he is not, but the score in this film is still definitely worthwhile on its own, albeit not reaching the level of greatness of the first three films.While a lot of the film might seem like a filler ( For example when the death eaters attack Weasley house and suddenly disappear while only having destroyed the house, which seems a bit out of place ), it is in the end an important entry since it explains how Voldemort's immortality works, and serves as a crucial plot device in the final two parts of the series. While there is some shakycam in said scene of the Weasley house attack most of the film is very subtly and stylishly filmed with graceful camera movements, and therefore this scene can be forgiven of its camera shaking, even though the scene is obviously not one of the films finest parts.Unlike previous Harry Potter films, no joy can be gained by the dark visuals, as it embodies the sinister feel this film should have very well, instead the only joy we can hope to get is between the camaraderie between the three leads, and while these scenes might seem cheesy, but in the end they truthfully only enhance our bonding with them. Like in the Order of the Phoenix, the demise of an established main character hits hard and the following scene is the epitome of emotional immersion, as we see the characters also feel what we would expect them to feel, which results in the audience easily seeing themselves in their shoes.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
203,brettchatz-1,Simply awful entertainment,3,4 August 2009,"Contrary to the generally positive reviews this film has been receiving, I found this to be an awful film.From the perspective of retaining a strong correlation to the authenticity of the Harry Potter books, this film is perhaps a triumph.However, what it succeeds in from that perspective it totally misses in the sheer boredom the more than two hours of screen time it occupied.Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince was not only exceedingly tedious, it was shoddy. The acting was awfully contrived for the most part, scenes were inane and the general impression from the audience was hardly appreciation for an entertaining evening out.I fail to see how children of any age, let alone adults, may find this subject matter exciting. Harry Potter 6 may well have sounded the death-knoll for the series.A word of advice, read the books because the movie simply fails hopelessly to impress - perhaps as a sedative - nothing more.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
204,dudedazzreviews,Might not be as good as the book but it's still awesome!,8,7 October 2010,"Harry Potter returns for his sixth year at Hogwarts along with his best friends Ron and Hermione. This year, a new Potions Master, Professor Slughorn, teaches at Hogwarts. When Harry goes to one of Slughorn's classes, he finds an old battered Potions textbook with scribbles all over it which, in the end, turns out useful to him. This book belongs to, drumroll please, the Half-Blood Prince. While Harry is fixated with the book, he must find out who the Half-Blood Prince is. The Half-Blood Prince has been much anticipated since November (it's real release date before it was cancelled for July). So Harry Potter fans, like me, have been waiting for eight months for the release of this movie, watching the brilliant trailers, hoping the movie was going to be the same quality. Ladies and Gentlemen, I can tell you that the movie is just brilliant.OK, I promised myself I wouldn't be one-sided in this review because I am a massive Harry Potter fan and I won't. But even so, no-one can deny that this movie was just great. The special effects were jaw-droppingly realistic and you could tell so much detail went into it. The best part to prove this was Quidditch and the cave Dumbledore and Harry went in. I've seen behind-the-scenes of this movie and saw that every little bit of that cave wasn't real, it was all entirely special effects and to me, that scene was amazingly real so good work to all the people who done the special effects.The story itself followed the book but it also went in it's own direction which worked very well such as the Burrow being attacked (how will they do Bill and Fleur's wedding?). Daniel Radcliffe gave a very good performance but the actresses that outshined everyone, to me, was Helena Bonham Carter and Emma Watson. In my opinion, she played the jealous Hermione Granger fantastically. Her performance made me believe her jealousy and bitterness toward the person she loves. Rupert Grint, who plays the zero-to-hero Ron Weasley, made me laugh in some places of the movie and Michael Gambon who plays the greatest wizard of all-time, Albus Dumbledore, gave a terrific performance. Helena Bonham Carter, who plays baddie Bellatrix Lestrange, was just brilliant in the movie. I couldn't fault anyone's acting really (except for Daniel Radcliffe when he took the Felix Felicis, haha.) Non-Potter fans will be asking questions about some parts of the movie that only fans will know but even so, the questions are obvious and will either be answered in this movie or the next. I can't really pick a fault with this movie. However, I will say that, in my opinion, I thought that the ending was a little rushed and it felt like it was over in a split second. In the books, there was more to the ending but there wasn't a lot in the movie but even so, the rushed ending would not spoil this marvellous movie for you. I must say bravo to Director David Yates and all of the cast and crew for making a movie that was fantastically dark which was the mood of the book. I can guarantee you that this beats any movie that's out now and is the best summer blockbuster of 2009! Potter fans and non-Potter fans will not be disappointed, I promise you that.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince

I don't know if it's true, but trust me, if you don't know the books, this movie still makes sense totally. It is one of the greatest parts. Especially if you like the direction into that Harry Potter is going. This movie is as dark as the 5th part. - I love it, and hope that the 7th part will be even darker.

207,HanShotFirstGR,A downgrade before the big ending!,7,6 March 2021,"Plot:As Harry Potter begins his sixth year at Hogwarts, he discovers an old book marked as ""the property of the Half-Blood Prince"" and begins to learn more about Lord Voldemort's dark past.Analysis:After his first attempt with The Order Of The Phoenix, David Yates comes back with a more serious, more character-driven and equally emotional film to continue the story by turning to a darker theme that suits the franchise perfectly. Despite being a film with many flaws, it's also a film with a lot of great moments which seems more important. It's a combination of slice-of-life teenage interraction with a mystery adventure that follows the attempts of Harry to learn more about his mortal enemy.The most serious problem is that it's a very uninteresting film when it comes to Harry's story. There are important stuff that have been told and visually it's very beautiful, but the whole story of unraveling the secrets of the past and the way it gets solved feels so rushed and not well-written, it's like a teenage movie that happens to have a few magic in it and that is definetely not a very good thing for a Harry Potter movie. Also, the story of the title ""The Half-Blood Prince"" is actually almost nowhere in the film, the mystery is rushed and solved without any explanation, it has nothing to do with the whole plot and it feels like a macguffin that never pays off.But despite those mistakes, it's a film that has many things to be proud of, the most important is the character development. The last movie was very good but it actually lacked the influence on character's personallities, The Half-Blood Prince did a great job in this field, everyone goes through major changes and it's a story with a massive impact in the whole universe. It's not just Harry who is the main character, but also Hermione and Ron, they all have many important things going on and despite the teenage emo feeling, it's quite pleasing to watch.Yates is the director who established the signature theme of the franchise and this movie is another prime example why, he understands space and motion better than most of the other directors that tried, he chooses darkness, light and angles in a way that produces the maximum tension in a scene, the whole plot feels more mature and it's an atmosphere that elevates this impressive world. Only Cuarón managed to do a better job and it would be a shame to compare them, the important thing is that Harry Potter found a permanent director for the last films that understands the franchise and creates interesting and great material.Every actor was great, Alan Rickman had a bigger role and stole the show completely, he is fascinating, he is breathtaking and Professor Snape is one of the best characters in this universe thanks to him. Daniel Radcliffe had also the best acting moments of his entire run as Harry, especially a particular funny sequence shows that he can be very good at times. Also, Tom Felton was impressive, Draco Malfoy was always the annoying little boy of the school who teases the other kids but this one makes him far more interesting, he has an arc, he has this evil aura and Felton portrays perfectly his torn apart mind by showing every emotion he battles and every emotion he accepts.Conclusion:It's clearly not a bad movie, but it sadly looses the focus on the main idea of the universe, it's a nice story but not important at all, there are plenty of little moments but not enough big ones, surely it could 've been much better if they had the runtime to include more things from the book, but judging from the result in the screen it's definetely a good movie, but not one I would personally choose to rewatch or use as an example of this universe's quality.Rating: 7/10",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince

209,movieman89-2,Not the best in the series,6,26 July 2009,"Im a huge fan of Harry Potter. I love the books and the films. The 6th is my second favourite out of the books, the 7th is my favourite. I went to see this yesterday and was really looking forward to it. I liked it but not as much as I hoped.The story kept the gist of what was going on but missed a lot of importance. Fist of all, we need to know more about Grenier Wolfback because he turns out to be an important character, I won't say why just in case you haven' t read the books. The was no explanation of the burning of The Burrow either. I don't understand why they added the Quiddich scenes with Ron in this one and not in the 5th, but it was still fun to watch.I thought the acting was still really good and kept great connection with the characters. Great filming and direction by David Yates.There wasn't as much love interest in the book as there was in the film.I was mostly very disappointed about the ending. I thought it was too rushed and again missed out good scenes from the book. I remember it was tense and exciting in the book.Overall it was good but not absolutely fantastic as I thought it was going to be. I would recommend reading the book first before seeing it. It is good on the big screen.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
210,tomb_92,An extremely disappointing and actually quite boring film.,6,27 July 2009,"I am not a particular fan of the Harry Potter films, though I love the books. I just feel that they never quite adapted to screen well. The first two films are OK I guess, but by The Prisoner of Azkaban things start to go a bit wrong. The Goblet of Fire is almost as bad but Order of the Phoenix is actually the only one that I think is above average for a film. Because of my enjoyment of the last film I had high expectations for The Half-Blood Prince, however I was very disappointed. For starters it was just boring. What little plot there was in the film was drowned out by the ""domestics"" of Ron and Harry's love-lives (and yes I know that's in the book but I felt that it was too much here). It pottered around for a couple of hours dipping in and out of the plot when it felt like reminding the audience that there is indeed a story. Also, I feel that much of the magic of the first two films has been lost completely now, the darkness of the last film pushed it aside a little, but now it has been lost completely. Finally, when there was actually a climax, it was very weak and frankly I'd stopped caring. I felt that something extra was needed towards the end and I'd lost all interest. The only things worth watching in the film actually are the performances by Michael Gambon, Jim Broadbent, Helena Bonham Carter and Alan Rickman, all of which were superb. Worst since Prisoner of Azkaban",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
211,EchoMaRinE,weak in a lot of aspects,6,26 July 2009,"What a waste. The great book was wasted by very bad screenplay and worse directing. Honestly, did actually someone force David Yates to direct this movie? I don't know where to start. I read all Harry Potter books and watched the movies so far but I am not really a fan boy, I just enjoy. So my comments are rather objective.First, I read a lot of comments praising the good visual effects. Hello, did we watch the same movie? The effects were so clumsy. Compared to the previous books, I found the cinematography quite weak. I certainly didn't find myself in the usual mystic atmosphere of Harry Potter. The soundtracks were not particularly brilliant either.Second, the story adaptation was definitely the worst in the series. This was the first time I was bored in a Harry Potter movie. The connections between events were so fragile. Although I read the book, it was even hard for me to see what is going on. Instead of taking some time to tell the important parts of the story, they spent minutes on useless love story parts. I am not even talking about the inconsistency between book and the movie. This can happen when you make a movie out of a book but this time the screenplay was just bad. More than two hours passed with a story which was boring and full of unnecessary details. If you cut more than half of the movie, no one would notice. I am not against romance in the movie. The best part of the book was that romance but they couldn't give the atmosphere. Rather the romance was pumped into the movie without thinking whether it fits or not. I also found the performance of each and every actor far worse than ever. They looked like outsiders to the story.So the moral of the story is, the movie is disappointing in so many aspects. Bad directing, bad screenplay, key points missing, so many unnecessary details and important parts are rushed. This is certainly nothing like a real Harry Potter fan can enjoy but I think people who just enjoyed the previous movies will not like it either.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
212,vishaal811,A Welcome Return to Form for The Series,9,3 July 2015,"Harry Potter and The Half Blood Prince is the best Harry Potter movie since the Prisoner of Azkaban. The movie incorporates the main themes of the novel while leaving out some minor details. Alan Rickman's turn as the morally ambiguous Snape is a joy to watch as he portrays the conflicting emotions of his character with great finesse. On returning to Hogwarts, Harry Potter gets hold of a Potions book that belonged to the Half Blood Prince. Initially, it helps him to get in the good books of the Potions Professor. However, he later finds out who this book really belonged to and the revelation is extremely riveting.The secondary stories focus on the love interests of all of the principal characters. All of the aspects of the film like the direction, editing, music are solid as the world is already well realized and most of the crew have been there in the previous Harry Potter movies. Overall, this movie is a thrill to watch and gives us one of the best cliffhanger endings in recent times.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
213,jfcthejock,A Good Follow Up To A Good Series of Fantasy Yarns,8,24 August 2009,"Entertaining, a good follow up to Order of The Phoenix, and amusing are the words I would use for the Half Blood Prince. Because it is thoroughly good if not better than the first three films of the series as it grew darker and more deeper. Good cast, good action, good moments and some bad I will admit. But well worth the price I paid for my ticket, I like the films but I am not an avid fan if anything of the books or franchise. More of a Star Wars man myself, but I do like them.They can only build on the success of this instalment, for the two-part Deathly Hallows and make it even better as the films become interesting for adults due to how dark it has become. Alan Rickman is great as the villain and of course you have Ralph Feines and more cast members who grow on you.

214,Sanou_san,"The darker, though the lonelier the movie appeared more closer",9,4 September 2009,"I never broke my habit of watching Harry Potter movies the time they became available in theaters. For its recent movies indeed warner brothers had made its integrity solid and best in the film industry. They say the farther the movie gets into the more it gets darker. I appreciate well how they have depicted Order of the Phoenix in the big screen. I wasn't disappointed on the other hand how Half Blood Prince appeared to lack with action, but then it had served its purpose to real viewers who knows how to understand the film's crew's intention of bringing it into theaters. The HBP centered much of course on the revelation of Voldermort's past, how it played well to Harry and Dumbldore's quest of defeating him. Most of his memories had given Harry what Voldermort had done to him and at the same time served as a clue for them in defeating the dark lord. The film most of my friends said had indeed departed so much with the book. I believe however that the writers had done well, and I also had faith that this would go well for everything written and made for the Harry Potter movies got approval of J.K. Rowling herself. I got the speculation that they are recovering for their extreme budget expenditures from Order of the Phoenix, since it indeed involve wizardry battle of elite level. They had to limit it and found a leeway of depicting into the screen HBP into a revelation rather than battle-packed episode. I got faith on the Harry Potter movie crews for creating the final movies in the future as good as its viewers expect. Nevertheless, HBP had been depicted beautifully and I really appreciated well how they portray the true intention of the book to the viewers.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince

216,blackmambamark,Great film....but doesn't give you the closure that you find in the other films,7,15 July 2009,"This is coming from someone who has just watched all 5 movies for the first time a week before this film came out. Its pretty easy to peg this one. If you enjoy the others, you will easily enjoy this one. It certainly travels further down the 'darker' potter path, especially with its incredible score and fantastic cinematography that just pull you into the story even more. The movie is very well rounded.....it has just the right touch of every aspect......by having just enough action, just enough humor, and just enough suspense. One cannot help but be entertained by its story. However, the only mis-understanding i had with the film was the end. They really didn't give you much closure that you would find in the other films. Even if something bad happened at the end.....they would always find a way to end it with the audience feeling complete.....and that is something that i admired about the Harry Potter series. But this movie didn't have that edge to it. For the first time, it left you wanting more. Now is that a bad thing.....not at all......it was just different, and it took some time for you to grasp the concept. Sure we have had our Empire Strikes Back, where we leave the theatre saying ""I cannot believe that, whats going to happen to so-and-so"". If you have not read the books, and only seen the movies like i have.....you will certainly see that added effect to the end. But does it take away from the movies overall value......not at all......it has easily saved the 2009 summer....by actually providing some depth and entertainment with its story. Very well done.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
217,Tyson14,Dark places,9,17 August 2014,"Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince begins on a real somber note. The opening scene, only mentioned but not described in the book, shows Death Eaters causing the destruction of a massive bridge filled with people. What makes this scene unique compared to the rest of the series is that this destruction takes place in the muggle world, not the wizarding one. David Yates, directing his second Harry Potter film, takes great pains to show that there are no safe places now that Voldemort is back and his followers are out in the open. Even some places that were safe havens for Harry in the past, namely the Weasley residence and even Hogwarts itself, are besieged by Death Eaters.However, the danger surrounding the characters at every turn doesn't keep the teen characters from being teens. Hormones run high through Hogwarts as students pair off and young love blooms. Things may be dark, but in the world of Harry Potter there will always be some light shining through. While some people complained that there was too much young love in this film, I have to admit that I found it interesting that more than ever this film really gave an impression that the teens in Harry Potter are just ordinary (well, for wizards) kids who happen to find themselves in extraordinary situations. As a result, this film is not only the darkest film of the series, it's also the funniest.While rumours swirled that some cast members would not find their way back for the sixth Potter film (Emma Watson was considering dropping out and Tom Felton, who plays Draco Malfoy, had previously made comments that he would not make it to the end of the series), the cast remained intact for Half Blood Prince. Nine years and six films is a long time for a cast to stay together, especially when they're as young as most of this cast was when the series began, so the fact that they're still together is beyond amazing.The Harry Potter team continues its casting coup in Half Blood Prince. Royal Shakespeare Company veteran Helen McCrory (Becoming Jane, Enduring Love), who was initially cast as Bellatrix LeStrange in Order of the Phoenix but had to drop out due to pregnancy, joins the cast as Lestrange's sister Narcissa Malfoy. The cast member that everyone was talking about, though, was Oscar winner Jim Broadbent (Iris, Hot Fuzz) as Horace Slughorn. At the time of Half Blood Prince's release everyone expected Broadbent to get at least a nomination for Best Supporting Actor, and, while he didn't get nominated, he delivered the best performance the series has known. In fact, all the actors in the series give their best performance to date in this film. Especially Daniel, Rupert, Emma, Alan and Tom. Michael Gambon hits it of the park as Dumbledore this time round,It's also great to see Quidditch back in the series after being noticeably absent from the last two films and just barely present in Prisoner of Azkaban. The sequences are shot better than in the first two films, and depict the game as much more brutal, having more in common with rugby than it appeared to before. The addition of Ron to Gryffindor's team is brilliant. I'm also glad that we get to see more of Alan Rickman's Severus Snape than in previous instalments. In Goblet of Fire, besides a few speaking lines, he was relegated to a moment of physical comedy with Harry and Ron, and he was barely present in Order of the Phoenix.While Half Blood Prince didn't quite catch up to Order of the Phoenix in box office receipts, it's still the third-highest grossing film in the series and was the second-highest grossing film of 2009 with $936 million earned worldwide. According to Rotten Tomatoes, this instalment of Harry Potter is ranked the third highest, critically-speaking. It seems a lot of critics felt as though this film worked more as a placeholder in the series than as a standalone film. That criticism isn't too far from the truth, yet J.K. Rowling said that this is the best film based on her books yet.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince

You can tell that there is a close bond between the actors of which all pull of their roles well. The directing and visual effects, like all of the films to date does not disappoint.In all a great family film, a pleasure to watch and I would recommend this film to most people. I am glad that the final film will be split into two parts, to be honest they could have done it with this film!*** For people who have never seen any of the films or read the books I took my friend with me who has not seen or read any of the books and he was completely lost throughout the film (Although he still enjoyed it!).

221,brownah18,Another Harry Potter another slightly better movie!,8,7 December 2009,"Starring again is this new Harry Potter is Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, and Emma Watson of coarse are the main characters and along with the others. In this movie Harry Potter (Radcliffe) is trying to figure out who the half blood prince is when he discovers an old school book with more intelligent ways of perfecting the spells written in a potions book. After watching or reading the sixth book in the seventh movie and book everything has been unsafe to everyone because the return of Voldemort is now known, including going back to Hogwarts. Along with that Professor Albus Dumbledore (Michael Gambon) has shown him past memories of Tom Riddle who is now Lord Voldemort and telling him he is keeping himself alive through horcruxes which they will have to find and destroy in order to kill Voldemort. This movie was so well done and it's been so much fun watching all of the main characters grow up since the first movie and they have all done such a great job I don't think I would have picked any other kids besides them to do all these movies.The way that everyone has put together the school and the special effects, to every little thing as magic spells, which everyone does including avada kadavra to unrealistic beasts. In this movie it is dead souls coming from the water. Sometimes I wonder how you can have the will to do so many movies at least finish three which are all connected and do another four. It does make a difference though and when you do switch characters in becomes less interesting and people just don't want to watch it when they have come to like the character at the start. The last movie off of the Harry Potter books by J.K. Rowling will be coming soon which will be in two parts because it is such an important ending for all of these movies. You start to wonder what's next for these Harry Potter stars and I think the limits are endless with all the skills they obtained from the movies if they wish to pursue that career that is.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
222,velvoofell,Successive Films Cannot Hide Radcliffe or Rowling's Shortcomings,3,14 August 2009,"It is a truth universally acknowledged that a writing style consisting of and relying upon verbose regency prose is too unleavened to deal with magic and wonder. This has always been the case with J.K. Rowling's competitively ""adverbed"" series of novels in which the subject of magic is so strained through wildly volt-facing characters and turgidly dry narrative that no wonder is left in the books. Her ponderously elitist world harks back to an England of Tom Brown and Billy Bunter, steals the hidden bigotry and snobbery from Roald Dahl when she should have tried to emulate how he does fantasy and peppers non-white European characters throughout as a seeming, defensive afterthought.As successive books recycled plot to the extent that every ""Master of the Dark Arts"" was always a villain or helped the main villain and previous character motivations were erased and replaced in a way a ten year old would balk at, so too successive films have had to reflect the purple prose and cyclical stream of consciousness of Rowling. As the books made more money, the books grew in size, tediousness and self-importance. The films reflect this.The books and therefore films are hideously dull, salvaged only by some of the most special effects of the day and the showcasing of the great and good of modern British acting.Daniel Radcliffe's baptism of fire in 'Equus', however, has left not even ash marks as his on screen autism and by-the-numbers histrionics cannot carry a millisecond of the film - as charisma-free as a C-list action star; the nerd equivalent of Steven Seagal.Rowling's exposition-crutched dialogue is made to sound like Stopard in the mouths of Gambon and Rickman - who excels in this film after hideous underuse in six previous instalments - yet is betrayed as Secondary school-play writing when uttered by the child stars.The twist at the end of the film, as with the original novel, not only makes no sense, it bores. In an essay by an adolescent this kind of change of character would demand demerit - it is the kind of character volte-face made by boys in games of soldiers in the playground.The most unforgivable aspect is that the film, for all the millions in special effects and acting talent spent on it, cannot disguise the mundane way Rowling treats a magical world. Populating her books as she does, with off-the-peg mythical beasts and characters cut and paste from other, better children's' fiction, she thinks endless discussion of magic creates a magical world. What it does is stifle it and remove awe and fantasy immediately. One thousand glowing wands cannot atone for the vacuum of joy that is Rowling's Potter universe.If it is breathless, ecstatic wonder you are looking for from a film, go and rent 'E.T.' or 'Whale Rider' - both films do in two hours what Rowling's increasingly obese tomes and her successive film adaptations fail to do - make you feel magical and that you have been to a real life magical world.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince

224,benjamin_lappin,Harry Potter And The Inability To Build To A Climax,4,5 August 2009,"Thus after the searing mediocrity and blatant intermediary qualities of ""Harry Potter And The Order Of The Phoenix"" we arrive at the ""darkest"" of all the wizards novel to film exports, ""Harry Potter And The Half-Blood Prince"". For the second time in the series we have a director undertaking the following instalment of our wand waving hero's tale, which begs the question whether or not the studio executives are at all interested in these films. It seems that any appreciation for cinematic achievement has been jettisoned given that the two stand out films in this tale were those directed by one time only ""guest"" directors Alfonso Cuaron and Mike Newell. However, that is not to say that David Yates hasn't learnt from the failings of his previous experience, and it's also not to say that he has as well. Evidently, it seems to be the norm for any film which deems itself to be ""dark"", ""brooding"" or ""foreboding"" simply to turn down the brightness of the lights to achieve this feat. No longer must attention be paid to the frivolous ideals of suspense and atmosphere that must painstakingly be achieved through the use of all the cinematic tools at a directors disposal (including the actors) so as to engulf the audience in the sense of despair and emptiness like was felt at the end of The Empire Strikes Back, for example. No, now a film must merely have the reputation for being ""dark"" to be classified as such. What is, in hindsight, an increasingly annoying trait about this film is its inability to build enough steam to reach the overwhelming sense of dysphoria it aims to achieve. ""Harry Potter And The Half Blood Prince"" finds its main plot line increasingly usurped by the secondary detailings of the magical castles students romantic affairs, which stagnates the story and does not provide for free flowing gravitas and the all important sense of unavoidable doom. We all know, even those that have not read the books such as I, of the inevitable and impending outcome of the story, but the entire film feels as if it's one hundred and twenty minutes just to watch one character snuff it. The same criticisms I levelled at the last instalment apply just as much, if not more so, to this one because ""The Half Blood Prince"" shouldn't feel like an intermediary story but comes across precisely as that, as if we somehow only paid money for the conclusion and everything else was surplus. To give the films helmsman the credit he deserves, Yates is still capable of composing some very crisp looking scenescapes and finds himself backed by an unexpected, yet pleasingly macabre, score which is utilised at surprisingly limited intervals to heighten its impact. However, in a film which finds itself besotted with a ridiculously unassailable amount of inter-character relationships which continuously change more rapidly than it does take the film to spout out a new Latin word, the directors' inability to successfully deal with those individual characters hampers the film significantly. His lack of ambition in challenging the overseer of Madam Rowling to either elongate and make more serious the evolving relationships, or lessen their presence altogether belies a lack of direction from a man whose title implies as such. Once again, Rickman and Gambon provide substance to roles that would seem ridiculous in the hands of others, while Grint and Radcliffe continue to avoid the on screen pitfalls of puberty to provide decent attempts in their respective roles of Ron and Harry. Unfortunately, Emma Watson once more steals the show as the most grating on screen presence since George Lucas decided what Star Wars really needed was a leaping platypus. In its defence, there is not a great deal wrong with ""Harry Potter And The Half-Blood Prince"", it tells its tale as it needs to, recounting the major details from the book while trying desperately to retain that sense of mysticism, wonderment and more importantly a connection with the characters. It's just that it does this in an underwhelmingly spectacular fashion that offers the casual viewer nothing more than yet another episode in the Harry Potter series without providing enough context. Perhaps a more in-depth focus on Voldemort may have yielded results, sending cold chills down our collective viewing spines, or maybe provide a greater sense of why it was the dark forces felt the need to eliminate who they did and what it would mean to them as opposed to a mere notch on the killing chart. In all, Harry Potter proves to be yet more inoffensive summer ""blockbuster"" viewing which will entertain, as they often claim they do, yet deaden the mind and the wallet. I suppose the one thing which sums up the ineptitude of this film the most successfully is that I watched it intently for two hours and still have no idea what the Half- Blood Prince means, or adds to the story.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince

The Half blood prince, though, came as a pleasant surprise, but then again there were quite a few visible flaws and un-pleasantries about the movie, that I would like to mention (atleast so that the people reading this won't think that I am not patronizing the movie :D). First to mention is about the scene in which Dumbledore is killed. The actual scene from the book mentioned that Harry was immobilized by a charm from Dumbledore, whilst the event took place. In the movie, though, Harry was able and simple standing n watching while prof.Dumbledore was being murdered. This was quite unexplainable and stupefying to see that :(. The second thing abt the movie, is the overtly evident importance given to teen romance. Although it was quite enjoyable, I did feel that it ate away on the quality screen time which could have been used to include the conveniently dumped scenes from the book :)Negatives aside, I felt that the movie had a soul and that was the most heartening factor about the movie. The friendship shared by Ron(Rupert Grint), Hermione( Emma Watson) and Harry( Daniel Radcliff) were most effectively portrayed. The other characters especially Dumbledore,Snape n Slughorn were quite brilliantly portrayed. The background score was quite haunting and gelled well with the theme!

229,Lee-107,Why oh why...?,6,19 July 2009,"I saw The Half-Blood Prince today after days of nervous finger-biting anticipation bordering on hysteria all of which involved reading the book all over again, snapping at any remotely anti-Harry Potter remark, watching all previews on TV, buying ridiculously expensive tickets to watch the 3D version of the movie etc... I was just extremely anxious to know and once and for all be relieved knowing that the film version of THBP was going to do justice to the novel. I had my reasons to worry... if the film version of 'The Order of the Phoenix' was anything to go by then boy, I had a lot to worry! After all it was the same director and the same team who had successfully managed in trashing probably the most intricate HP book... So, I saw this movie and I'm... well, OK I'm not seething in righteous indignation as some Potter purists might be... but I'm just very disappointed...I just wish they had stuck to the book completely... Why did they change all those things? Why did they add things that weren't there in the book? Why was the film swathed from beginning to end in a gray palette? I understand that times have changed and the Dark Lord has grown stronger... but was it really necessary to visually make the film so dark? In the previous films, I really felt like I was inside Hogwarts and with the characters and a lot of that had to do with the design of the film - the great hall, the Gryffindor common room, the area around Hagrid's house and the interior of Hagrid's and Ron's house... these were places I had begin to love and I really looked forward to ""visiting"" them again... So seeing this shrunken dark, dingy version of most of the above mentioned beloved places was a nasty shock... Never had Hogwarts looked more a CG-creation than in this film... And that was one of the main reasons I felt disconnected from things happening there... And since when did the Weasley's perennially bright cozy country cottage The Burrow turn into Number Twelve Grimmauld Place? I know they didn't mean it to be... but look-wise it was as grimy and dingy as the way Grimmauld Place was designed in OOTP... In the book THBP, The Burrow is still the same old beautiful country haven... Even everything at Hogwarts was shrunken, dingy and depressing... If David Yates meant this as some sort of a motif, then it was a very bad, literal and lame one...And those were just the design issues... the changes they made to the story is a different matter altogether... since when did the Death Eaters look exactly like the Dementors? Why did they add that bit about The Burrow being burnt down and not show the first memory that Harry and Dumbledore enter into - the one about Voldermort's mother and Tom Riddle Sr.? I remember when I first read the book, that was probably (no pun intended) the most memorable memory out of all the ones that Harry and Dumbledore visit... It was so beautifully written... so vivid, scary and sad at the same time... In the film, even the memory in which Voldermort first sees the Hufflepuff Cup and the Slytherin necklace which would later on be his Horcruxes was omitted and so was the one in which he visits Dumbledore in Hogwarts asking for a job. Besides these crucial scenes, they also did not include even one in-depth discussion that used to ensue in the book between Dumbledore and Harry after their visits inside the memories... I think those bits are crucial in really understanding the basic premise of the entire Harry Potter series. They're the meaty informative bits... Instead of wasting money on one expensive bridge collapsing CG sequence which is referred to only in retrospect in the book, the film should have focused more on the memories, on Dumbledore's discussions with Harry etc... After watching the film I was at a complete loss - the film catered neither to the hardcore Potter fans nor the new ones it might have wanted to entice... Neither was there enough quality for the former nor enough quantity for the latter... Harry was like in a limbo - not completely with Dumbledore, not with Ron or Hermoine, not with Ginny... he just existed somewhere in between... I didn't for a moment feel like I was there with Harry, Ron and Hermoine... And it wasn't because the book didn't give me that feeling... it was because the film didn't give that to me...I really don't know why David Yates was chosen to direct this film... After the horror that was 'OOTP', I thought the producers would have wizened up... but evidently not... looks like Mr. Yates is their golden boy... what with him directing The Deathly Hallows too... In an article, Yates commented that if the audience thought THBP was spectacular, they should just wait for The Deathly Hallows. To which, I have this to say to him... High-end CGI, loud ear-shattering sound effects do not a good film make. Yes, they contribute to a film's viewing pleasure, but they cannot replace good solid story telling... So far, out of all the HP film-adaptations, 'The Prisoner of Azkaban' has been the best - the most loyal to the book, the film that most engaged me into the happenings and the most stunningly directed and filmed HP-film till date... For the longest time, how I hoped they would approach Alfonso Cuaron again and he would agree to direct one more Potter movie... but alas, that was not to be... I have no grand hopes for The Deathly Hallows. I am assuming that the reason they are making two movies of the book is so that they can do more justice to it. Yes, I still hold on to that hope, naive though it may be...",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
230,callie_af,Maybe my favourite Harry Potter,8,14 January 2021,"It's quite complex and often funny. It looks great, and manages to bring out many emotions at once, with characters often going their separate ways against each other.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
231,Reel_starz,The most highly anticipated movie of the summer is worth the hype!,7,21 July 2009,"The eagerly anticipated sixth installment of the Harry Potter franchise has arrived! Fortunately, the waits and delays were worth it. Although none of the Harry Potter movies have come close to the brilliance of The Lord of the Rings trilogy, this is probably the first film that actually surpassed the book in quality. Though it helped that I found the sixth book to be the weakest in the entire series, it is also a compliment to the film-makers, in particular the director, David Yates, and its stars, with special mention to the three main actors Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson.Not surprisingly, the special effects are excellent. The world created in the movie feels real yet still retains a slightly magical quality. The attention to details on the set, props and costumes is astounding. Once the movie begins, you really feel as though you've been transported into an alternate universe.Of course, while the mystical aspects of Harry's world are enchanting, Yates and the screenwriters must be credited with the fact that much of what happens is not completely different from real life. Harry and his friends have entered the high point of adolescence, ergo the many romantic subplots and teen angst. Some of the film's most touching scenes are the ones in which they struggle to overcome the commonplace obstacles of teen love and of growing up. The romances feel realistic and convincing, benefiting from the fact that there are no sex scenes like in Twilight. The relationships really do work, in large part thanks to the young actors, many of whom have been around since the first movie and almost all of whom have grown considerably, talent-wise, since then. Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, Emma Watson and the others are probably among the more talented of the young actors nowadays, and if lucky, their careers should blossom and live on long after the final Harry Potter film is released.Of course, the adult cast is exceptional as well. That is only to be expected since the Harry Potter films have had the good fortune of being graced with the presence of some of the finest British actors today, from newcomer Jim Broadbent to Alan Rickman, Michael Gambon and Helena Bonham Carter, all of whom have been present in previous films. They work well with the younger actors and the entire cast has a sort of natural chemistry.Gradually, the Harry Potter films have grown darker since the beginning of the series and this film is no exception. Though there are undeniably scenes of lightheartedness and even humor, a sinister tone permeates the majority of the movie, and I must admit that it was handled well. Most of the more somber scenes center around the young Tom Riddle, played by first by Hero Fiennes-Tiffin (a nephew of Ralph Fiennes who plays the adult Voldemort but does not appear in this movie) and later by Frank Dillane; both of them do a fine job of developing a creepy aura about Tom without making it too overwhelming. The movie's grave, gloomy atmosphere helps create a sense of urgency that is all-too-often absent from fantasy films. Like the makers of Lord of the Rings, the film-makers here recognize that fantasy is not a territory solely for kids and that it can - nay, should - be treated with the same respect as any other ""more mature"" genre. It helps too that, like Sauron in The Lord of the Rings, Voldemort has become an iconic villain.Although fans of the book may be slightly disappointed since there are some changes from J.K. Rowling's much-acclaimed source material, Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince is a satisfying, occasionally moving film that moves quite seamlessly between the universal humor and cheeriness to be found in teen relationships to the more darker material. Equipped with a capable director, a talented screenwriter, an outstanding cast, a brilliant technical team and a beloved source material, the Harry Potter series has deservedly grown into one of the better fantasy franchises in recent years. Fans of the book should worry not. They are in good hands.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
232,CaptRon-2,An entertaining movie without substance or depth,5,16 July 2009,"A strong cast and good sets always help the movie and most of the pacing kept everyone entertained. The movie definitely strays from the book and sadly exposes some plot lines that should have been saved until the next movie.I felt that too much pressure was placed on the studio to produce a lighter movie after the last two ""dark"" episodes and in doing so, I felt cheated as I left the theater. Of course, the holy catholic church gave this movie its blessings after turning its back on the other two so I guess the religious are happy.Without providing any spoilers, I felt the ending was the absolute worse. The dialog was completely inappropriate given the events that had just taken place. I felt like George Lucus was in the background trying to come up with some witty dialog after the Empire blows up all the inhabitants of a planet.Maggie Smith is used way too little, Sean Biggerstaff is still MIA which really kills the game scenes. We are completely deprived of Harry's aunt, uncle, and cousin. While we see more of Harry and Ron interacting, we see much less of Hermione Granger on a scene by scene basis. Alas, poor Hagrid visits the set long enough to pick up his school paycheck and off he goes.Likely one of the biggest disappointments was Tom Felton who plays Dragos. He has been wonderful a side note character during the previous installments but an expanded role proves to much and he really lacks any depth or soul in his performance. You feel neither anger or sorrow for him during his scenes and I found myself waiting on the next scene when the camera was focused solely on him.See the movie; enjoy the movie; and remember that it is only a movie. It fails as an adaptation of the book and without any context between the old and new, would never survive on its own. There are few climactic scenes that are memorable in this movie.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince

234,javaman-7,An engaging set-up for the final episodes,9,16 July 2009,"Java Man Reviews ""Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"" Originally appeared in LakewoodBuzz.com July, 2009.OVERVIEW: The film opens with our hero, Harry (Radcliffe), hanging out in a late night café perusing his copy the Daily Prophet and flirting with an eye-catching waitress. They make a date for the end of her shift, but Harry can't keep it because he is whisked away by His Beardness, Professor Albus Dumbledore (Gambon). They soar into the night and arrive at the home of Horace Slughorn (Broadbent), a former Hogwarts lecturer who Dumbledore is trying to persuade to return to his old job as Professor of Potions. Slugborn, with his unique technique of recovering past memories, may be the key to the psyche of one Tom Riddle, a former student who has morphed into the vile Lord Voldemort. Thus begins the sixth adventure of Harry and his conjuring cohorts Hermione and Ron (Watson & Grint) as they divide their time between studies in sorcery and the looming confrontation with Voldemort.Oh, and that crazy Slugborn mixes one humdinger of a love potion.REVIEW: 3 1/2 of 4 Java Mugs Other than the fact that they are both British, and that each is destined to save the world, Harry Potter and James Bond have one other thing in common: Their movie franchises have logged the highest box office totals ever, with Potter likely to pass Bond by the time you read this. Another item that may please the Potter fans is that there will be ten Best Picture nominees this year instead of five, giving the Potter cast and crew a pretty good chance to work some magic on the red carpet.The story is basically a set-up for the final episodes of the series; an engaging set-up, but a set-up nonetheless. Yet it works. I sensed that most of the patrons of the sold-out midnight showing I attended would have plunked down good money to watch the next two films until dawn.There is more attention paid to character than in previous Potter outings, but some of our favorite villains make only token appearances. Those dynamic Death Eaters and the deliciously evil Bellatrix Lestrange (Bonham Carter) are in far too few scenes; and Voldemort appears only as a threatening cloud formation. Not to worry, though. We will certainly see more of them in 2010 and 2011 when the series wraps up with the filming of the final book in two parts.The performances are up to the series high standards. Radcliffe and Watson are fine, as usual, and Grint has much more to do this go-around and does it well. Of course the Hogwarts faculty, portrayed by British acting legends such as Smith and Gambon, are a joy to watch. Rickman as Snape and newcomer Broadbent as Slugborn are standouts.Director Yates and his team have created a bleaker and more ominous Hogwarts, no doubt setting the stage for the dark themes that are to follow. Atmospheric cinematography in Norway, the Scottish Highlands and dozens of English prep schools provide backdrops which are cunningly combined with outstanding visual effects.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
235,sidneyleeberthier,A technical standout,8,8 November 2020,"This might well be the most underrated of all the movies. One's first impression upon viewing is usually that 'nothing happens' until the end. However, repeated viewings reveal a deep tapestry of emotions and genres, ranging from romantic comedy to murder mystery.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
236,mrrockey,"Definitely Not the Best, But Still Entertaining",6,28 August 2013,"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince is the sixth installment in the long-running series and usually by this point, franchises start to go down the gutter but is Harry Potter one of them? Let's find out!Firstly, the story. The story here about Harry trying to learn about Voldemort's past through Horace Slughorn is actually quite intriguing because it actually FEELS like there's some stakes to the story. If Harry doesn't learn about Voldy's past in time then he will take over the Wizarding World.Jim Broadbent plays Horace Slughorn excellently. He plays him as a bit of a cowardly guy who's heart is in the right place. It could've been easy for him to just play Horace as a poor, innocent guy who was just manipulated by Tom Riddle and while that's partially true, he's also seen as a coward when he refuses to tell Harry anything about Tom and even tampers with his own memory to make it seem like he didn't Tom anything. His character arc is about learning to accept the past and using it and it's acted very well by Broadbent.While that's the main plot of the film, there's also like a million sub- plots going on in this film. Some of them are Draco becoming a Death Eater and being sent to kill Dumbledore, Ginny dating Dean Thomas, Ron dating Lavender Brown, Harry learning about the Half-Blood Prince etc. I think this is one of the biggest problems with this movie because it feels overstuffed. However, it isn't really the filmmakers fault because the book(which I haven't read) from what I hear, had a lot of plot too.The best example of this is the reveal of the Half-Blood Prince. About 40 minutes in, Harry find this Potions book that belongs to the Half- Blood Prince but they never bring up the Half-Blood Prince again until the last 5 minutes of the movie and when they reveal that it's actually Snape, they never explain why he is the Half-Blood Prince. If you are just a viewer of the films like myself, you'll be completely lost about this.But with that being said, I do like most of the sub-plots in this film. My favorite is probably the one about Ron being in a relationship with Lavender. Normally, I would hate this and call it ""high-school bull$hit"" but somehow, Yates manages to make it charming and funny. And the actors sell it really well with all of them playing their roles believably.But I do think this film could use a little more action. This film focuses a lot more on the humor which I don't mind but I don't like how Yates decided to cut out the fight between Dumbledore's Army and the Death Eaters. After we've spent the majority of the film on relationships, plot, and comedy, I think we could use some action. The worst piece of action in this movie is the attack on the Burrow. Not only is it unexciting, but there's no point to this scene because the Burrow just comes back in the next film anyways!This film also feels kinda long because of the lack of action. Don't get me wrong, I'm not some stupid teenager who needs fight scenes every 5 minutes but because you have so much dialogue, it can feel a little lengthy at times.Lastly, I am gonna touch on the technicals a little bit. The cinematography is gorgeous! The film has this kinda greenish color scheme to it and it looks great! The sound editing is very detailed with lots of sounds going on even when no one's talking, it's very well done! And the visual effects while great, are a lot more subtle this time around and that's good because it shows that the filmmakers cared more about the story than the effects.Overall, while it's certainly not the best film in the series, it's still an entertaining film that's well-acted, good-humored, and visually stunning. I'm gonna give it a 6/10.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
237,stiva,"Came out just as I had Expected... Book readers, ""Avoid at all cost""...",6,22 July 2009,"I saw this movie recently and I want to save the other fans of Harry Potter readers from the misery I faced.First things first, the good part about the movie. Excellent special effects. Wonderful music. Emma Watson as Hermione has matured very well and has done her role excellent. Rupert Grint and Daniel Radcliff as Ron and Harry has fairly improved. Alan Rickman is at his best. Michael Gambon came as a surprise to me. In this movie his performance is far much improved than in the last 5 movies. That's it. These are the only good things about the book.This movie is the worst adaptation of Harry Potter And The Half-Blood Prince. I had to read this book 3 times to forget this disgusting movie. One of my favorite book in the entire series. How could they do this ? How could they just stand and wreck an amazing story. Why the hell should they extra scenes not available in the book and not add the important parts of the book. Those four deleted memories are very important. Also, the talk Dumbledore and Harry have after Harry retrieves the memory is very important too as they talk about the Horcruxes and the Prophecy. Also, a very important thing about Snape was deleted too. Ginny Weasley had an amazing role in the book but here in the movie it looks like she's added just for the romance. The Order of Phoenix members, where the hell are they in this movie ? They just disappeared. What happened to the new Minister of Magic ? Why the Dursley's are not here as again in that house Harry and Dumbledore have an important discussion. Where is Kreacher ? How will Harry know what the other Horcruxes are ? How will Harry find the ring's connection to Voldemort ? How will Harry find the connection between the locket and Voldemort. How will Harry find out why Dumbledore trusts Snape when Dumbledore finally tells him the reason for his trust in Snape ? What happened to the Apparition Lessons which is very crucial to the 7th book. What happened to Weasley's Wizard Wheezes ? Why the hell should the burrow get burned down when it's not in the book. This is suppose to be a dark movie. Why does is look like cheesy comedy flick ? Did the creators read the book at all ?This movie is nothing more than a mess. It's totally confused. Since I have already read the book I can see the way it was cluttered. I assume you guys are familiar with Kid's picture play puzzle tiles. That's what this movie is. A toy puzzle tiles. A very poor attempt at making a brilliant movie with an amazing plot. Highly disappointed. Very much disappointed. I just can't begin to wonder how they are going to exploit the 7th book (which they will do and already did) as they can't possibly exploit anymore worse than this. In short, this movie came out just as I have expected. It totally sucks. This movie is for those who haven't read the book. They will enjoy it. Not the book readers.I give it 6 just for Emma Watson, Music and special effects...My order of movie rating in HP Series:-1. Sorcerer's Stone - 8/10 2. Chamber Of Secrets - 7.8/10 3. Goblet Of Fire - 7/10 4. Prisoner Of Azkaban - 6.5/105. Order Of Phoenix - 6.2/10 6. Half-Blood Prince - 6.1/10",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince

239,greenylennon,Surprising,8,17 July 2009,"After the poor adaptation of ""The Order of Phoenix"", I thought I would have seen again a disastrous Harry Potter movie, and I especially blamed the director and the main actor for this. Knowing that this installment had disappointed some fans really didn't help me to have positive expectations on ""The Half-Blood Prince"". But what I saw at the cinema was truly different from my low hopes. Director David Yates has improved, but not so much; Daniel Radcliffe persists in being a poor actor, but a whole team of non-supporting wonderful actors protects him - Michael Gambon as Dumbledore and Helena Bonham Carter as Bellatrix Lestrange make such a good job in their roles. The real magic here, that makes the movie better, is the screenplay and the special effects. The story flows smoothly and can be understood even by the audience who didn't read the novel, because this time there are no many complicated mysteries, supernatural creatures and a lot of useless subplots. And, of course, the special effects are eye-candy, majestic when seen on a silver screen: but not only the special effects, because cinematography (by Bruno Delbonell, very very good in his previous works with Jean-Pierre Jeunet, too) and production design are top-notch - Hogwarts is a really beautiful yet Gothic place this year. All in all, I give a 8. I would give 9 if only Daniel Radcliffe were a better actor.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
240,Astralan,So much potential.,6,17 July 2009,"This is probably one of the most anticipated films of this year aside from Star Trek. After being delayed more than half a year for the sheer purpose of generating more profit (They even had it in theaters earlier in the week than most films so it will get a higher rating on the movie review sites), The Half Blood Prince hit the theaters with high hopes. The midnight showings were packed from what I understand, and the first reviews were very strong. I was stupid enough to keep track of the percentage of positive reviews, even reading the sparse negative reviews to keep myself from getting over-excited. When the time came to see the 6th installment of this movie franchise I was extremely optimistic.You see it coming, don't you? The line drops there. When I got to my matinée showing, I was sort of surprised that more people weren't taking the summer recess from educational institutions to pay for a cheaper ticket to see this. I mean, the theater had stadium seating and was completely digital (DLP). Expecting to have to put something down on a seat in a good position to save it, I walked into almost a virtually empty room. My friend and I felt our way through the dark to a good central spot and claimed our space while I ventured back to the concession to get some of the worlds most expensive water and a small popcorn with butter flavored grease on it. The opening preview gave me light heading back to my seat and I rolled down my sleeves and settled in.The opening of the Half Blood Prince was not embellished with any prelude but went right to the title, which in some ways set the tone: No fanfare, no build, nothing. From start to finish it was like listening to someone reading a history textbook. No, I didn't fall asleep; there was enough to hold ones interest but one couldn't help being a little confused by lots of little things that just would have been better if Steve Kloves (Screen Adaptation Author) just let the book do the work for him.At this time I will regretfully have to elaborate with a few spoilers in order to get my point across. I don't like spoilers. When I read reviews before seeing something I am careful not to read too much into them. However, I have read the books, and I listen to the audio books frequently seeing they tend to make my commute to and from work less annoying. So please skip the next paragraph if you haven't read the books or seen the movie.SPOILERS: 1. The Hogwarts Express reaches its destination. The students leave the train but Malfoy stays behind. True to the book he discovers Harry has been eves dropping with his invisibility cloak and jinxs him into a rigid state leaving him under the invisibility cloak to be returned to London without anyone noticing him. However, he is discovered: Not by Tonks, who is IN this film, but by Luna. Why change that? 2. During the entire focus on the Horcrux scenes, the invisibility cloak is completely left out. What harm could it have done to have left this in? 3. When the hell did the Weasleys house get toasted??? Where did that one come from??? It's a frikkin enchanted house you can't just burn something like that! Further quips where in character presentation: McLaggen didn't strike me as a hunk; I got the impression Professor Slughorn was more portly than my personal depiction.The overall production just earmarked the director into a category I would describe as more passive in his nature than someone like, say Alfonso Cuarón or even Mike Newell of previous Potter fame. David Yates likes the blue camera filter, very much like a child with a huge erector set, and he surrounds himself with familiars so he is comfortable with his resources (Nicholas Hooper, the composer being one of them). It is like he isn't challenged. The scene in The Goblet Of Fire surrounding Cederic Diggory's death was gut-wrenching. I still get misty when I watch it. It was emotional and paced exceptionally well. The ending scenes dealing Harry and Dumbledore were just vanilla and didn't invite the spectator to experience the wrath, the pain, the surprise or the solitude that should have had the entire audience in mourning. Even the final words between Snape and Harry just didn't extract the response it deserved. As I said, it was like sitting through a reading of a historical document.It wasn't an AWFUL film, and it will make it's fair share of summer money, but it didn't really deliver in putting the audience on edge and squeezing them till they cried out in anguish which this movie should have done. It almost scares me that David Yates is doing the last book. Unlike Tolkien and his Lord Of The Rings trilogy, Jacksons treatment of the books was more forgiving; you could accept his production as a piece of art that totally honored the author. You could be an avid fan of the books AND the movie. Yates comes up short, and that's a pity. These books are destined to be timeless classics. They needed to be treated with honor. -B",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
241,Foobarman,Terrific Movie - Best Harry Potter movie yet,9,15 July 2009,"I'd been waiting to see Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince for a very long time and finally July 15th came. For the first time I decided to see a Harry Potter film on the first day of release. This was partly due to how good the previous Potter film was and Warner Brothers certainly managed to gather a lot of hype for this Harry Potter installment.From the first few minutes of this movie I knew I wouldn't be disappointed. This movie made use of humor, emotion and excitement unlike any of the previous Potter movies. I believe this movie is so great partly due to the fact that the book was one of the best. But no matter how good the source material is, if the movie is not made well then people won't enjoy it. David Yates and the rest of the cast and crew did an absolutely brilliant job with this movie.I do wish that the Dursley's were in this movie and that Greyback was introduced better. I found this movie easy to follow as I have read all the books and have watched all the movies, but I fear that people new to the franchise will have trouble following this movie. There are now two Harry Potter films left and I am definitely looking forward to watching them. David Yates is a brilliant director as he has proved with Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix and now with this movie as well.I would give this movie 9.5 out of 10 and recommend everyone to see this brilliant movie.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
242,bharath-karthikeyan,Can Hardly imagine whether Muggles cud follow the movie...!,7,19 July 2009,"The Movie i would say was relatively a bit disappointing to the previous one,period.The primary reason being,the movie has scenes woven in such a manner that u really gotta have read the book or at least read the movie's plot in the internet to follow.I felt way too bad for my friends who were followers of the movie but not the book,blinking at the turn of events for good amount,parts of the movie. The next disappointment was it had very few magical delights,people hardly cast magic or fight in the movie,its all brought down to conversations,Damn!Whatever u see in the trailer is all the candy in the movie. But it ain't justice to just complain about this movie,cause it has its own light hearted moments,Hermione n Ron,Harry n Slughorn,Harry n Lovegood,Ron's Quidditch moments and his first love were all nice to watch. The movie is set during difficult times,but it doesn mean every scene has to be dark toned,where is the gorgeous meadows,the distant shots of hogwarts,these are somethings which were missing starting from the HP5 itself. The other students of hogwarts Neville Longbottom,the patel sisters,Crabbe and Goyle,and many more,even though who don't have any serious role in the story could have had actually a few parts to be played in the movie,it made my ""Movie Friends"" wonder,'did they have a quarrel or something?'!

243,Strider_1978,A different kind of very good,9,28 August 2009,"This is brief, I have lots to do.If you said to me: ""This film sucked, it dragged on for over two hours with ten minutes of action."" I would smile at you and say: (You silly American) ""There is a strong chance that you missed the point, in fact, several of them. This is a very strong chance that you missed or dismissed the concept. This particular film is geared, or engineered not to the popcorn audience, but to those who might appreciate the fact that the makers finally gave us the darker, more authentic side of the books."" It's been quite a while since I read the books. I can safely say that, regardless of how the plot according to the purists has been butchered or mish mashed, it gave me as with the previous film by David Yates, what I needed to know. Many reviews have commented on the heavy romantic issues and how they take away from other essential plot elements. I say that without something to break the ice the film would be one long walk in a darkly woven tale that does not *entertain* in the literal sense of things.Half Blood Prince presents the story with authenticity. No bright colours, no over the top theatricality just to win the family vote. The special effects have come on a milestone since the first film. The quidditch (however you spell it) matches now look like actual games rather than something generated on a computer. The characters are far more believable and 'real', even Hermoine's emotions, though there won't be an Oscar nod, can be taken far more seriously.The only negatives, if I can call them so are the somewhat ridiculous beginning with the Death Eaters trashing greater London and Hogsmeade, that and the somewhat disappointing but not completely butchered scene in the castle towards the very end. The viewer, in my opinion does not feel any negative emotions towards Severus come *that* act. The book I felt in that scene left us with a truly un-relenting lust for Snapes head on a stick.Ah well, can't have everything. A film for the discerning eye, and not the popcorn. Blu-ray is looking good to me.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
244,joben-525-633946,Certainly not Half-Full,8,21 December 2012,"David Yates' second Potter adaption is a large improvement on his flawed but very entertaining and visually impressive first. With humour in abundance, violent action, a darkened mood to coincide with the predecessors in the franchise and an improved sense of characterisation anchor the 'Half Blood Prince' into higher regard than the 'Order of the Phoenix' (film wise).We begin the Harry's sixth year at Hogwarts be learning of the fact that muggle and wizard worlds will meet as we see when numerous death eaters reek havoc across London and send the ordinary British citizens into panic. Meanwhile - at Hogwarts - Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) is asked to become close with new potions professor Horace Slughorn (Jim Broadbent) in order to discover the secrets he mistakenly told Lord Voldermort (Ralph Fiennes) when he was a Hogwarts student. He is able do to this with the aid of the book which belongs to the 'Half Blood Prince' - reaching the top of his class and subsequently getting on with Slughorn.Full of humour, interesting moments and exciting scenes bursting with action, 'Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince' is the most enjoyable of the first six movies, even if it may be a little too light hearted in certain areas.Yates may not have hit the heights of some of the earlier adaptions on his first attempt, but certainly does on his second.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
245,toutouguy,Thought this movie was great!,10,8 January 2020,"One of my favorite Harry Potter films (mainly because I love Snape's character). Although many of the books are depicted quite poorly in several of the films in the series, I still rather enjoyed this movie. Only extreme Potter fans are butthurt over missing plots and ""scenes that should have been included"" but they fail to realize that movies cannot be 6 hours long....It's arguable you can make 2-3 movies per book which would just be impossible. (How old do you think the cast would be at the conclusion?!)",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
246,enigmaticmaniac,Suspenseful Installment,8,28 July 2011,"Its the worst adaptation of the book so far as I have heard but as am just considering movie here, I liked it. Definitely better than earlier. Improved acts by everyone is a plus. With every installments its growing darker and darker and now we can actually feel the presence of Voldemort. It brings with itself more wizardry, more visual effects and a great cinematography. The romance is blooming now and a maturity is seen in characters. The movie created a mystery in the beginning itself and the suspense is carried out throughout till the end. Watch for the climax as its quite surprising. Overall I loved this one and would definitely recommend it.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
247,kylopod,"A great Harry Potter movie for fans, if not fanboys",8,9 August 2009,"A reviewer for the Washington Post described ""Half-Blood Prince"" as a Harry Potter movie for non-fans. As a Harry Potter fan myself, I not only loved this film but thought it was one of the best of the Potter movies, rivaled only by the third, ""Prisoner of Azkaban,"" directed by Alfonso Cuaron. The reviewer was confusing fans with fanboys. Of all the movies, this one is probably the least faithful to the source material. It eliminates large sections, makes subtle changes to what it does show, and includes one violent sequence that sharply contradicts the book. Fanboys (who are not, I should mention, all male) are deeply bothered by this, because they want the movies simply to replicate the events of the books on screen. Of course that would be impossible, unless each film was at least five hours long. The best they can hope for is what director Chris Columbus did with the first two films, stuffing as many events as he could manage into two-and-half-hour slots.I, as a fan and non-fanboy, want the movies to bring the story to life, and to do that, sometimes it is necessary to depart from the literal narrative of the books. I want a movie that can stand alone and be judged on its own terms, without depending on prior knowledge of the book. In one particularly awkward moment from the previous film, ""Order of the Phoenix,"" a character references the code names from the Marauder's Map, a plot point that had never been mentioned before in the films. Those who haven't read the books will have no idea what the character is talking about.""Half-Blood Prince"" is actually my least favorite of the books. It has an ungainly plot, it feels transitional, and it ends with a shocking but infuriatingly ambiguous climax. There is relatively little action, much of the plot centering on meetings between Harry and Dumbledore, in which the two enter the pensieve--a magical item that lets them relive various people's memories. In this book, they are attempting to piece together the dark wizard Voldemort's past to figure out a way to defeat him.Dumbledore has hired a new Potions teacher named Slughorn who once taught at Hogwarts when Voldemort was a student. Dumbledore wants Harry to befriend the man so that he will divulge information he has been hiding. This task may be easier than it sounds, for Harry gets hold of a Potions textbook with notes, mysteriously attributed to the ""Half-Blood Prince,"" that make him a star pupil in Slughorn's class. Meanwhile, Harry suspects Draco Malfoy and Snape of secretly working for Voldemort and plotting against Dumbledore. But Dumbledore trusts Snape completely and refuses to listen to Harry's warnings.The book also deals with Harry's budding love life. Harry begins to find himself attracted to Ron's sister Ginny (who had a crush on Harry when she was younger). There's just one problem: Rowling never bothers to give Ginny a personality. I almost got the sense that Harry courts her because he wants to marry into the Weasley family. I would have preferred to see Harry hook up with a better-developed character, such as the flaky Luna Lovegood.The movie follows this basic plot outline, but excludes many of the details. We don't get to see, for example, the memories of Voldemort's ancestors, an excursion in the book that answers some questions but hardly advances the plot. We do get to see Voldemort as a child, played wonderfully by an 11-year-old actor named Hero Fiennes-Tiffin. But the movie is not all plot; it remembers to put in the small moments that bring the characters to life: the conversations between the kids, and their interactions with beloved characters like Professor McGonagall and Hagrid (who gets a funny little scene involving the recently deceased giant spider from the second film).A few subtle changes work nicely. While the movie is unable to make Ginny into a more compelling character, it gives her a greater role in certain crucial events. As in the book, Ron gets a girlfriend and makes Hermione jealous, but the movie has a well-conceived scene in the hospital ward that satisfyingly addresses this tension. The book depicts two apparently unrelated incidents involving the appalling combination of an invisibility cloak and a ""body-bind"" curse. The second time it happens, it seems like dramatic overkill. The film finds a better way to handle it.The acting and visuals are nearly perfect, making this the first Harry Potter movie with no overacting (though I continue to be underwhelmed by Michael Gambon's Dumbledore) or phony special effects (though Robbie Coltrane still does not make a convincing giant). I reserve particular praise for Rupert Grint, as Ron. I always thought he was the least impressive of the three main kids. Here, he's terrific, especially in a scene where he becomes enspelled. Also noteworthy is Tom Felton as Draco Malfoy; there are many effective scenes where the camera pans over his face and we sense the inner conflict in his character. The eminent Jim Broadbent, as the movie's guest star, brilliantly captures the personality, if not the appearance, of the flutter-brained Slughorn.At 153 minutes, the film is continuously compelling as well as entertaining, despite the introspective tone and scattershot events. Nobody is more surprised than I am, for the director is David Yates, whose previous venture into the series, ""Order of the Phoenix,"" was by far the worst Harry Potter movie. The pacing was choppy, and the direction of crucial scenes was amateurish and clichéd. I was disappointed when I first learned that Yates was chosen to direct the remaining films in the series. Here, he has redeemed himself, and with it my confidence that the movies will continue to do justice to Rowling's books.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
248,anifanmc,"Not a bad film, perhaps the second best of the series",9,12 August 2009,"I wasn't expecting the movie to be good when I saw this film, mind you - I had no real expectations going in at all, beyond a kind of dread. The PG rating immediately turned me off, and I was pretty much going through the motions with it. The moment the film started i was utterly surprised at the dark, Gothic feel that was not nearly as prevalent in previous films.The first massive improvement over the past films is Michael Gambon's acting. Although he's not 100% perfect as Dumbledore, his previous appearances were AWFUL. He had none of the wisdom, finesse, and flair that Dumbledore seemed to have in the books. In this one he was very accurate (if a little less serene) to the book and actually appeared to have read up on his character. He seemed more like the headmaster I had envisioned in the novel and he certainly seemed to show all the characteristic Dumbledore-esquire traits.The second improvement was Ron's character. In the previous films he was like the whipping boy instead of an actual character, and that thoroughly irritated me. Instead of being Harry's best friend, they made him his sidekick and turned Hermione into his best friend. I realize the reason they did this is because he has more jovial chemistry with Emma Watson, but it's still annoying and completely out of line with his character. They improved that considerably in this film and used his romance with Lavender to round him off nicely. For reasons inexplicable to me they turned Lavender into a cheerleader-esquire bimbo, but I'm not really complaining as she's not a very important character.The plot was pretty solid. They cut out some things that were fan favorites, I suppose, including some of the memories, but overall I found it flowed very well. I would have liked them to leave in the memory of Hufflepuff's cup so it wouldn't come out of left field in the next movie, but I suppose they'll deal with that in some manner eventually.... I hope.I was not, however, impressed with the way the Astronomy Tower scene was done. While I'm sure the real loyalty of Snape is now common knowledge, it did not seem that way in the book and they should have made it feel so. Perhaps it's just me, but it didn't look like Dumbledore was pleading and that Snape killed him cold blood, which is what it was staged to seem. And why the HELL would Harry just stay below on the word of his headmaster? He was *paralyzed*, he was ready to come running but he couldn't in the book. The whole impact of Snape being the Half-Blood Prince was lost as well, they didn't really properly go into it. I didn't mind the funeral being cut, though - the scene with the students wiping out the Dark Mark from above Dumbledore was actually quite touching, and it seems like Daniel Radcliffe really got into character as Harry.Purists are going to be disappointed. This movie takes quite a few liberties from the book, going so far as to actually suggest the Ministry and the Order KNEW about Draco's plan and did nothing about it, when in reality nobody believed (except for Harry, Dumbledore and Snape) Harry when he confronted them with this news. However it is a must-see film and I would recommend it to anyone who has read the books or is interested in a solid fantasy film.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
249,dreamdemon-1,Not exactly satisfying,4,10 August 2009,"I will start by saying that if you haven't read the book then you'll be at a total loss when watching the movie. Why? Because much like the previous installment, the Half-Blood Prince feels made from unrelated patches connected in a very loose manner that defies logic.Surely enough, if you're averagely familiar with the books then everything will make sense but those who only watched the movies (and thus not privvy to all the details) will only stare blankly at times and will be left only with extremely poor acting on the part of Rupert Grint and most of the supporting cast.Why is Harry not at his foster home? Why is Hogwarts of interest to the Dark Wizard? (surely killing Dumbledore makes sense but why the other three Death Eaters had to join the party, why Bellatrix rampaged through Hogwarts and why was Hagrid's hutt of interest to them?) How come Dumbledore finds a horcrux apparently even before Harry gets Slughtorn's memory? I could go on and on for days with plot holes. Yes, they are plot holes, even if the book explains them. Regardless of the foundation, the story told by the movies must hold its own ground and unfortunately, in the latest two Harry movies, it fails miserably.On the good side, Hermione is as lovely as always (and alongside Snape, the only character who managed to keep its charm intact) and I also love the way the series follows the three little wizards growing into maturity. Yes, Dumbledore's remark about Harry shaving seems way so artificial and forced (and pointless since the whole imagery and mannerisms suggest that). Also, the entire atmosphere in the movies gradually becomes darker and grittier (kudos to the director and the producers) in a fairly subtle way, but enjoyable still.In the end, this particular installment feels less than a children/family movie and more of a Gothic flick, but unfortunately it's a weak link to the story of the series as told by the movies.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
250,sam_aj_01,I say this every year...,10,16 July 2009,"I say this every year but this was definitely the best Potter film yet. I've read the book twice so it was easy for me to pick up on the mistakes, added scenes and the ones they left out, despite all of that it made a summer blockbuster.Thinking back to the first couple of films, you sort of think to yourself how much this one has changed. They managed to include a bit of everything like Qudditch, day-to-day lessons, confrontations... you get the picture. I wont spoil it for you but there's lots of surprises in store. Harry is asked by Dumbledore to become chummy with new potions master Slughorn in order for him to spill the beans on a conversation he had with a younger Voldemort (Tom Riddle), of course by the time they start piecing things together, things get a lot worse thanks to Draco who has been given a little chore to do by Voldemort himself...And again you'll come out wanting to be a wizard, wanted to see the next film and wanted to read the books all over...",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
251,rjyelverton,Solid production that I'll never watch again,6,25 July 2009,"The plot of ""Half Blood Prince"" could fit on a cocktail napkin. Harry returns to Hogwarts, does some more coming of age, and tries to avert an evil plot by the forces of darkness. Like the Potter films before it, the production is competent, but leaves me with no desire to ever see it again. Having read the books, the films feel like visual Cliffs Notes with the only surprise being how the cast and crew interpret the material.Director Yates, who helmed the previous Potter installment, gives us the gloomiest film yet. The thin material gives him a chance to show off including a wonderful CGI-enabled tracking shot that moves across the windows of Hogwarts from a scene of young Ron in love to a pensive Draco staring out hopelessly to a shot of dawn breaking over Hogwarts. Jim Broadbent as the name-dropping Professor Slughorn delivers his usual strong work and gives the film a humane center in the midst of the exposition heavy script and CGI-wizardry.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
252,dejan8378,My excitement about last 2 parts is 0/10,4,26 August 2010,"The first part was surprisingly good and mature and above regular children movie. Second was a 2 steps down, but yet enjoyable and trapping. Third was a return to the form but the fourth was best, funny, adventurous, dark and Harry's best presentation as tortured hero.Unfortunately with a new director and screenwriter the problems begun in the fifth part, so they've turned back the old screenwriter for this one but it was useless, since it's obvious the TV inexperienced anonymous Yates is not fit for the job that previous directors have done far better. Why is decided Him to direct the last 4 parts is a mystery, if He is directing them at all. Also 250 millions $ budget... I don't buy that, spent on what? American Pie minus the sex stuff plus magic, I don't think so. The main characters are now dumber and vain and the only connection with them is thanks to the first 4 parts.If this was a first part of a series I would call it awful 1/10, but thanks to this my excitement about last 2 parts is 0/10.

The acting by Radcliffe et al was wooden and uninspired, and the story-line was infantile. It would not be difficult to make an interesting story out of these characters. It was clearly beyond the abilities of Hollywood scriptwriters. Why does ""World Class"" wizard Potter seem unable to do any impressive magic? He bumbles through uninspiring adventures, only to be rescued with consummate ease by Dumbledore or Granger.We never see him study, or perform any magic of note, yet he is called a ""genius"" on several occasions.

I haven't read the books but a friend of mine talks to me about them and I know what is going on. I heard many in the theater complain of how bad the movie was.The movie has a good plot, descent acting (like always), but it was not intense, the only intense scenes were the ones shown in the trailer. These qualities deserve a few stars, but I was disappointed in the ending, I think that they should not have cut a fight in the ending that was meant to happen.Since the movies have hit a state where the characters prepare themselves for the final battle, the films get a little boring with many explanations to be done, but don't get me wrong I love it when movies connect with previous movies explaining left over stuff.The movie is suppose to be a suspense and thriller. It does keep a little suspense but not as much as the other movies.

256,MovieFanGuyy,Another HUGE Disappointment From The Harry Potter Series! HIGHLY OVERRATED!,1,14 July 2009,"After swearing that I would never watch another Harry Potter film after the last five less than average films, I saw a free advanced screening of the sixth average installment, titled, Half Blood Prince, after hearing about most of the critics rave about it. (Thank goodness I didn't have to pay for this!)There is a lot of hype for this film, but, outside of the pure fan base, there are going to be a lot of very disappointed viewers. Critics seem to really think this is their slice of pie. However, many people in the audience I saw the film with were left confused, and applause was mild at best.Daniel Radcliffe returns as the most famous school boy wizard in the world, to his sixth year at Hogwarts, the city of London has been attacked by Death Eaters, in the only true action scene of the film. Bridges are destroyed and the city is in a panic.After that, and for over 90 minutes the film gets slow, and I mean really slow. The school of Hogwarts is supposed to be in immediate danger, but, instead the children are playing around with love potions and falling in love with one another. Half of the time I stared at my watch hoping the entire thing would finally end. Some of the comedy goes way over the top, and there were some groans coming from people on occasion as well. This film definitely has a lot less action than the previous installments.Michael Gambon returns as the hippie wizard, Dumbledore, who is supposed to be 150 years old, but doesn't look a day over 70. He spends his time warning Harry about the rise of his nemesis, Voldemort and gives him information on the memories of a former student named Tom Riddle who later became Voldemort. So, he introduces Harry to a former teacher, played by Jim Broadbent, who might have information into how Harry can defeat his enemy forever. Voldemort separates his soul into objects called ""horcruxes"" to avoid his imminent destruction. (It wasn't explained very well by Broadbent's character.)The ending which takes place in a dark cave, guarded by dead creatures brought back to life, which Dumbledore quickly sets fire to. Dumbledore and Harry return to the Hogwarts campus where Alan Rickman's Snape kills Dumbledore with Harry just standing there. The ending was extremely dull and anti climatic. There was two and a half hours of nothing and it simply ended... It definitely didn't change my mind about this series, which is definitely F.F.O. ""For Fans Only"". The special effects and cinematography were good, but the storyline skipped from one scene to another, and it felt like the same old Harry Potter formula preparing you for the last and final film of the series. As a matter of fact, many will feel cheated by this film because nothing is resolved yet again.Half Blood Prince never felt like a complete film, this felt more like a teaser as to what is yet to come. Those who have not read the books, like myself will be quite confused as to some of the events of the film. Worst of all, we never really quite see Voldemort in this film, just images of his younger self as a former student of the school, and that's it.All in all, the Harry Potter formula is getting more and more stale with each episode. Call me disappointed again. I have never read a Harry Potter book in my entire life. One should be able to enjoy a film without having to reference a book to understand the plot holes missing in the screenplay. I think this series, like the Twilight series, appeals to a certain segment of society. Fortunately, I am not a part of that segment that enjoys having to read a book to understand the movie.EASILY THE MOST OVERRATED FILM OF THE SUMMER. One star.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
257,alexart-1,Magic Returns to the Series in the Best Installment Yet,10,21 July 2009,"Unless you've been living under a rock, you know that Harry Potter's sixth movie recently hit theaters. As always, the films are good, but this one is my favorite so far. Though the film relies a bit too much on teenage romance, the action scenes are so well done and the film is beautifully shot that it is possible for anyone not to like it. Fans of the book may be a little disappointed by it because it cuts key scenes, but I have read the book and still loved the movie.The characters in this movie are also what make it so great. Daniel Radcliffe, who plays Harry if you didn't know, is excellent as usual. The downside to this is that he's gotten a bit old for the role. We all know that Radcliffe has been in Equus and that the actor who plays Ron has been in Cherrybomb (search it in IMDb). Of course, they're all still so lovable including the brilliant Luna Lovegood. The actress definitely brings a great odd characteristic to her character. Emma Watson definitely is great as Hermione Granger and actually seems young enough to play her.As anyone would tell you, the Harry Potter series is always fun and this movie is no exception.

258,YourFamilyExpert,Hilarious and heartbreaking. Captures well the awkwardness of teen romance.,8,17 January 2017,"Harry joins Dumbledore in a quest to discover details about Voldemort's past that could lead to his undoing in the future, all while the teenage trio deal with humorous and heartbreaking relationship woes. This sixth film deftly balances mystery, comedy, and romance for its first two hours, wisely slowing the pace to give its characters room to breathe and grow before thrusting them into the breathless, chilling, and genuinely heartbreaking last half hour. Michael Gambon here gives the definitive portrayal of Dumbledore, and the relatively lighthearted initial tone serve as a brilliant contrast to the earth-shattering encroachment of evil; it truly feels like there's something to lose, and the stakes are set high for the finale. IS IT OKAY FOR YOUR KIDS? Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince is rated PG. A central character is hit with a killing curse and dies; friends and colleagues mourn around the body. A central character drinks a potion that torments him mentally and emotionally; another goes into convulsions when he accidentally imbibes poison.

261,someofusarebrave,absurdly awful considering how great the book it is adapted from was!,2,12 January 2013,"Y'know, I loved most of the Harry Potter book-to-movie adaptations. It's such an amazing world to get to spend time in, I felt privileged that the movies offered me an excuse to retread previous territory in the books. I enjoyed seeing certain details as if for the first time while watching all of my favorite scenes-the most poignant ones--still present in the movies.That is, until this drivel.This movie is shot like an action movie, perhaps 'Heat' or the like; it plays as though the only major conflicts are between Ron 'n Hermione, and between Harry and Malfoy. It plays Harry 'n Malfoy off one another in classic 'hero/antihero' way..the only problem being that anyone who's read the books knows full well that a) Malfoy is no antihero, just a scared little boy forced into something beyond his ken by family loyalties, 'n b) that Malfoy does not in the end directly contribute to anyone's death, least of all Dumbledore's--not intentionally, certainly, 'n c) that in the end Harry saves Malfoy, thus redeeming him sort of. Malfoy has become the antihero by the end of the movie to the degree that any memory of Voldemort's role or presence in Harry's life has been virtually wiped out; the flashbacks regarding Voldemort's childhood seem to be completely irrelevant. Meanwhile Harry dedicates the year practically to finding out whether Malfoy's a bad man and what he's been up to, only to discover this was all wasted energy as Dumbledore engineered the whole thing himself, several books later. This is all a set-up for the 'Harry's not infallible nor is Dumbledore Dumbledore messed up this is how Malfoy's not such a bad guy nor is Snape goodness/evil are more complex than we first thought' message of the later books. This is necessary in a child's book, btw, to prevent the kid getting the wrong i.e. overly religious/black-'n-white world message, from the books in question. In this book, it just comes off like an overly simplified action movie sequence between two not too complicated men, 'n guess what? HP is a FANTASY. It's not a goddam action movie!Apparently the writer is the same for all the movies, so I'm gonna go ahead 'n blame the director for cutting important scenes for time 'n altogether making a hack job out of it. Although they could have used a female writer consulting on how women ACTUALLY behave, like, ever IMO. The women in these films all seemed rather--masculine, or else were Ginny Weasley 'n disapparated after a few minutes of dialogue when she even appeared at all.I mean, c'mon, like we don't have enough of those in the world already, now we have to make children's movies suit that structure?It's almost like--meaning it's EXACTLY like IMO!--the writer 'n director sat down 'n said, hey, let's cut anything from this movie that a religious white adult male wouldn't appreciate, then DID SO. I hate that they got their hands on my movie.Meanwhile quidditch barely featured in a book that had many fantastic quidditch sequences; Ron 'n Lavender stole Harry's first kiss with Ginny, which became a g-rated nonsense bit of tomfoolery in the longest- feeling scene since the beginning of time rather than the triumphant bit of post-win snogging it was designed to be in the book. Difference? The latter was an EFFECTIVE scene; the former just made everyone in the theater start tapping their feet hoping it would be over soon.The writer clearly did not understand the spirit of the story, nor did the director bother to demand a rewrite that would have included, say, any character development whatsoever?The thing I liked about these books is that they so well played to both the masculine desire for action 'n sports 'n snogging etc., as well as the feminine desire for conversation 'n humor 'n emotional conflict.The books managed to meet both of these needs, thus providing the best of both worlds--all packaged together in a fantasy land so rich with detail 'n life as to make one want to visit it again 'n again.This movie managed none of this.This was also the only movie I had a severe problem with, lest you believe I am simply a self-declared aficionado unwilling to accept minute changes to some of my favorite childhood stories.From a situation with a movie adapted from a book thus attempting to communicate the spirit of the book, presumably, to audiences--from a situation with a writer presented with a well-loved story who needn't have bothered adapting much at all to make the story in question big- screen presentable--from the basic fact that this movie alone did not even manage to project a world I wished to spend time in, let alone to visit again 'n again--from the basic reality that this movie creeped me out regarding human character as well as a generally oily, icky tone to it--this fan is willing to never see any film written or directed by those involved in the writing/directing processes for this film again.""Like, EVER!""",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince

263,trixie-k-88,Too much teen drama and not enough magic,6,11 April 2012,"Harry is back in the sixth installment of Harry Potter. There's lots of romance in the air, so much that it is clouding the actual plot. But, let's see what Harry and David Yates have in store for us. It's now impossible for the Ministry to deny Voldemort's return, and Harry is being hailed as ""the Chosen One"" by the press, instead of a liar. Voldemort and the Death Eaters have begun to cause a lot of trouble and destruction in both the wizarding and muggle world. When Harry accompanies Dumbledore to recruit the retired potions teacher Horace Slughorn (Jim Broadbent), he becomes curious as to why this name-dropping man is so important. Despite all the recent bad news, Harry, Ron, and Hermione are excited about being 6th years at Hogwarts. Since Professor Slughorn has taken over the potions class and Snape Defense Against the Dark Arts, Harry and Ron now have good enough grades for 6th year potions. While first annoyed that he gets a ratty old book, Harry is stunned when he receives top grades in potions due to the handwritten tips in his text stamped ""Property of the Half-Blood Prince."" Meanwhile, Ron has joined the Quidditch team and become the boyfriend of exceedingly irritating classmate Lavender Brown (Jessie Cave). Hermione is feeling hurt and left out, often seeking comfort with an already stressed Harry. Harry is falling for Ginny, feeling nervous about Ron's reaction, and annoyed that Ginny is dating someone else. Harry also becomes fixated by Draco's odd behavior this year, believing he was inducted into the Death Eaters and has been ordered to do something nefarious. In order to defeat Voldemort before he gains too much power, Dumbledore has been reviewing memories of Voldemort's youth with Harry. He believes they are getting closer to finding out the secrets and weaknesses of Voldemort, and Harry must persuade Slughorn to surrender a missing piece of the puzzle that lies in his memory. Now on the cusp of adulthood, Harry must figure out what Draco is up to, the identity of the Half-Blood Prince, manage to cope with school, romance, and the knowledge that he must find a way to kill Voldemort—or be killed himself. I loved the fifth film so I had high hopes for this, but I don't like the way this movie was done at all. For some reason this tried to be a romantic comedy instead of a fantasy. There is way too much emphasis on the romance between Ron and Lavender, and Hermione's attempts to ""get back"" at him for dating her. It was very annoying, and the romance between Harry and Ginny was almost non-existent. Never have I seen a franchise that put more emphasis on the romance between the side characters than the main character. While on the subject of Ginny, I must say that Bonnie Wright is an awful actress. All of the actors in this franchise (even small roles) have been good, except her. She is so stiff and emotionless in both her voice and expression she can give Kristen Stewart a run for her money. She and Dan Radcliffe have little to no chemistry, and I feel no sexual tension or romance between the two of them. This film seemed to cut out all the important and interesting details Dumbledore and Harry discover about Voldemort's past, and fill it up with teenage drama. In the beginning of the movie Dumbledore even says that he will ""tell the tale"" of destroying the ring that blackened his hand, but he never does! The audience never even learns the true significance of the ring, nor how Voldemort came across it. The significance of the locket is also never mentioned—it's simply a locket. So much is left out about the horcruxes (and Sirius' mirror) in this film that they have much less meaning in this and the last two. I wouldn't be surprised if most people who hadn't read the book were very confused by the lack of explanation of these objects. That being said, this film is not without its strong points. While sparse, the memories of Voldemort's youth were fantastic. The two boys who played him at age eleven (Hero Fiennes Tiffin) and sixteen (Frank Dillane) did a wonderful job. This movie is worth watching for their scenes alone; they are sneaky, intense, scary, and even look like each other and Ralph Fiennes. I must say that I liked Dillane as a teen Tom Riddle much better than Christian Coulson in the second film because he looked/acted younger and creepier. As with the fifth film, this is very emotionally driven. You feel the annoyance, anger, pain and frustration of all the characters—even some of the less likable ones like Draco and his mother. Like with the fourth film, this has many flaws, but it's still Harry Potter. Despite the many annoying scenes and missing details, it's still enjoyable to spend any time with the great characters this series has to offer.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
264,arriva,Slow and boring,2,18 July 2009,"This is yet another blockbuster of this summer which has no plot and has no convincing actors play.At the same time you'll get a lot of meaningless and random talks which add nothing to the film, films events are not cohesive, you'll hardly feel any emotions about film characters, you won't be worried about anything since there are no discernible perils or danger.There could have been many love stories but they are not uncovered at all, and they don't seem plausible taking into consideration the young age of the film characters (yet real actors are much older than their characters - so, the whole affair looks ridiculous and unconvincing).And that's all going on for around three hours.

Oh, maybe it was for the teenage audience who are still all a-glee for some snogging. I had to go grab some popcorn and a drink to keep meself awake. The scenes were stretched, almost like a pause after every character speaks so as to make the viewers digest the consequences of such an action. The only piece of action you get my dear friend, is some more snogging. I wish they could have given some more of a role to Carter - what a waste. Once you come out, you can't help but wonder if the movie could have done without H.P. as he didn't do much expect what, a snog? And the H.B.P, well less said the better, as he was a Zero Blood one. So what is H.P. and the H.B.P. all about?

266,jasonpachar,Best Potter Yet,10,24 June 2014,"If you have not seen the 6th installment of the Harry Potter series of movies, then you need to see it again, again, and again. With the other 5 movies compared, this one outranks them. I have seen all Harry Potter movies on premiere nights and read all 7 books. But nothing compares to the sheer enjoyment of seeing it first-hand. This movie continues the story of the boy who lived and how he has to face to meet the sticky end and destroy one of the powerful darkest wizards of all time. Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint & Emma Watson give outstanding performances. My congratulations goes to JK Rowling and David Yates, especially to JK, she has poured her heart out over these books and my thoughts and prayers are with her as continues to write and tell her story the best way she could. When this movie comes out on DVD in December I will be getting it to add to my collection. I give this movie a 20 for great special effects and a great storyline.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
267,bramb600,"Good and Entertaining, not amazing.",8,1 August 2009,"To start off, I will address the common complaint that people are having with the film. They are saying that it's doesn't stay faithful to the book. I have something to say to the fans. As you may know, this is the first movie to be released since the series has been completed. With all the other movies they had tried to cram in as much information as possible because they never knew what would become important later. Now that they know, they're only going to keep in what's important and be a more entertaining movie. Once you're aware that not all story lines will be in this film you will have a good time.This is Harry's sixth year at Hogwarts and for it, he spends a whole second half of the away from Hogwarts. Yes, Dumbledore takes him on a quest to learn more about Voldemort's past and search for a weakness in order to defeat him. The performances are quite good in this film and you can always see the actor's improving their chemistry from film to film because they are just getting more comfortable with each other. I think the best one of all of them is definitely Alan Rickman. He is the best creepy villain you can ever get in a movie. If you haven't seen him in Die Hard, you should watch it because it's also a pretty awesome movie. What really worked for me with this installment was the surprising amount of comedy. This was the darkest book yet but the funniest film. Ironically, I wouldn't even say that it's the darkest movie and I would probably give that to 2, 3 or 4. Most of the humorous scenes were from the relationship drama that was present. Every major character was in a relationship and some were pretty unnecessary but it will probably set something up for the next movie. Yes, I realize that nothing from the book can be called unnecessary but because it was in there, there was a lot less time for the action. The drama was very good though.The special effects were extremely impressive in this film and I never thought that they looked fake. They were very subtle unlike what we've seen in Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen. The cinematography and the camera angles from David Yates were fantastic. Then film achieved a dark, gloomy look that's essential for a Harry Potter movie.To wrap it up I think that Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince is a good, but not great installment for the franchise but it was much more enjoyable then most of the movies that came out this summer.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
268,connor-macgregor,Great...but not the best,8,29 December 2009,"Ah yes Harry Potter is always a treat to watch because you know by now it is going to be entertaining.With this one i had that ""WOW"" factor but a few problems along with it.Lets start with the basic plot which everyone should know right now. Harry is still sad over Sirius's death in the last film/book/audio whatever you call it and is trying to get on with his life in peace.But now Dumbledore has an important mission for him that could help destroy Voldermort for good.So acting? its great as always.Radcliffe is still awesome as Harry.Rubert Grint is still amazing as Ron and dear sweet Emma Watson continues to play Hermione Granger so well.Michael Gambon is even better as Dumbledore in this film.Felton has improved from annoying to amazing Draco Malfoy and so has Alan Rickman who was sidelined in the past few films as Snape.Evanna Lynch i always enjoy as Luna Lovegood.Her performance is like ""Yeah we live in a bad place but still i feel happy"".Bonnie Wright's screen time increases and that's great too.One problem i have is the ending.In the book there was a massive fight but in the film there isn't much.Now i know the films cant always be accurate and that is fine but i just felt disappointed at the end that is all.So this film is just as good as the others and builds up the tension for the upcoming finale.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
269,praveen77,Dark days ahead...,8,27 July 2009,"I was quite surprised by how much I liked this one. Not that I didn't like the previous ones, but I was so in love with the books that I never felt completely satisfied by the movies. However, in this case, the book was actually my least favorite of the series, but the movie has turned out to be my favorite so far.Maybe because of the fact that I didn't like the book, I didn't mind the fact that a few parts were left out or modified. We see the trio(Harry, Ron and Hermione) are now entering into adulthood, and are now in the awkward stages of adolescence where they learn to recognize strongly their feelings for the opposite sex. There is a lot of unsaid intensity and attraction between Ron and Hermione. Ditto with Harry and Ginny. Quite a few scenes in this regard are handled quite effectively, and do leave a lump in your throat. But there are other things now to worry about. Voldemorts threat is now out in the open, and the fight between good and evil continues. Harry finds a book in his potion class which has the note ""This book belongs to the Half Blood Prince"". It helps him ace potions, even outdoing Hermione. But who is this half blood prince? One day, when the three are returning from Hogsmeade, a girl acts all possessed and is thrown up in the air.The death eaters are still carrying out sudden attacks. One of my favorite scenes in the movie was the attack on the Weasleys home and subsequent chase. As far as I can recall, this was not in the book. Another one is the scene where Dumbledore and Harry go in search of one of the Horcruxes. This is pretty chilling.All in all, the movie has taken a sort of adult fantasy tone, similar to (not as great as, though) Pan's Labyrinth. it is definitely darker than the rest, and I thoroughly enjoyed it for this.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
270,wolverinesforever,"Good atmosphere, great cinematography, and some fine performances overcome narrative troubles",8,17 November 2010,"The problem Steven Kloves had when he adapted ""The Half-Blood Prince"" was that the source novel doesn't contain a naturally cinematic story. You're not quite sure what everything is building up to. What is ""The Half-Blood Prince"" about? Voldemort's secret? That mysterious potions book? Ron making a fool of himself in romance? Alas, it seems Kloves had to make a compromise between various elements, instead of crafting out a strong narrative like he did with parts three and four. Thus, you've got some scenes that work much better than others. Watching Ron mess around with Lavender, while an effective running gag in the book because you knew oh-so-well that Ron should have NEVER done that, feels too inserted in this movie because Lavender's annoying personality has come into the story rather suddenly (though I will give Jessie Cave credit for playing the role with great gusto). Quidditch, while enjoyable to watch early on, now feels too perfunctory. There are several jarring scene transitions, a problem the movies haven't had since ""The Chamber of Secrets,"" because the various elements of comedy and dark mystery don't feel well-blended together.However, past the inconsistencies, many elements do work. It's Harry and Dumbledore's work towards unlocking Voldemort's secret that works best. As far as acting goes, Radcliffe continues to show good dramatic range, and even elicits some laughs when he takes a ""liquid luck"" potion (""Hi!""). Michael Gambon has also accommodated himself well into the role of Albus Dumbledore. In his interactions with Harry, he seemed more like a surrogate grandfather at times, and I also greatly enjoyed watching him become a man of action as he created a firestorm to ward of the creatures of the cave in the climax.Every ""Harry Potter"" movie seems to have benefited from new casting. This time, Jim Broadbent is a delight to watch as Horace Slughorn, bringing a perfect amount extroverted attitude to the role along with dark regret. Most of the ""regulars"" are pretty solid; we have come to expect nothing less from Alan Rickman as Snape, Maggie Smith as Professor McGonagall, or Emma Watson as Hermione. I do wish Rupert Grint had more to work with than just being an insecure, hopeless romantic (the next installment should afford him an opportunity to show some range). Finally, I must compliment Tom Felton for bringing an extra dimension to Draco Malfoy, revealing that he may not be able to stomach an evil act as originally anticipated. I have always found Felton to be the most consistent of the ""young"" actors in the Harry Potter series; he has been terrific as Malfoy.The cinematography by Bruno Delbonnel is nothing short of exceptional. Despite working with many murky tones (such as brown and faded green), he still manages to create countless images that are worth a million bucks each. He also perfectly sets up the atmosphere of the film. While Hogwarts is not the repressive place it was in installment five, it is clearly not the homely location it was in installment one. Looking back at the entire series, it's hard to believe that the visual interpretation of Hogwarts has morphed so much.Credit must also be given to director David Yates for not wavering from the darkening tone. Like with ""The Order of the Phoenix,"" he makes ""The Half Blood Prince"" very character driven. Since this story is mostly a setup to the finale, it's smart that he ensures we still remain with Harry and his companions on an emotional level, since not much will be achieved (in terms of forwarding the plot) by film's end. That's not to say he's only capable of quiet moments; in fact, the scenes with the most action or tension are frequently the best in the film.Many have complained that the last forty minutes of the movie are the weakest because they deviate from the book so much. Hogwash. They're the most focused, and made me forgive most of the film's earlier flaws. I've already mentioned how great Harry was under the influence of Felix Felicis. Watch also how Jim Broadbent starts letting down his defenses and reveals himself to be a deeply regretful man. The last interaction between him and Harry is somewhat heartbreaking. And the scene in the cave, my goodness, if you're nerves weren't tingling then you are a hard person to thrill! The lighting, the score by Nicholas Hooper, the disorienting editing... it was almost exactly how I imagined it in the book. And then you have a tense encounter between Malfoy and Dumbledore in Hogwarts, followed by a devastating denouement that left me feeling (appropriately) drained.Any last tidbits I'm missing? Well, let's see, there's Bonnie Wright getting far more screen time as Ginny, although I thought she was just okay. You've also got Nicholas Hooper returning for the film score (he also did number 5), and while it doesn't draw a lot of attention to itself, it's still subtly effective. And I guess if there's a consistent theme in this movie, it's ""trust."" How much faith do you put in your friends and mentors? Do you obey their orders no matter what? It's a question Harry must wrestle with in his relationship with Dumbledore, as well as with his obedience to Dumbledore's last (and questionable) request.Overall, ""The Half-Blood Prince"" mostly works, though it's a good thing we're about to begin the finale here. With the setup being mostly complete, it's now time for the payoff. That the entire cast, as well as so many crew members, have devoted the last 10 years to this franchise is very remarkable, and the results have been mostly positive. Now, let's hope David Yates can steer the tale of Harry Potter to a triumphant conclusion...",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
271,ghasl1,Worst Harry Potter of the Movie Franchise,1,17 December 2010,"If you read the book you know the story is stretched out the only good thing in it was Tom Riddle aka Voldemort's origins which came from the pensieve and how the black encrusted stone ring came to be. And how his mother woo his father etc. None of that happened which was the best detailed story of how he became evil leaving that out means the audience won't know why Voldemort became bad. The other major thing they left out was the battle at the end which was a letdown. All and all it was 2hrs 30mins, I would recommend to skip the 2 hrs and watch the last 30 mins where Dumbledore and Harry enter the cave because the rest of the movie is really boring and a waste of time. They just talk nonsense for 2 hrs.There was not that much magic and action throughout the whole movie I can only feel sorry for the kids that watch this.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
272,jeffreyhillen-364-945381,Made as good as possible,7,9 September 2014,"Once I read the book where this film was based on I knew immediately that this movie has so much potential to be great. There is so much in this story so I was really excited. David Yates is a director who is really experienced with the more political themes and Love themes. Mostly TV productions. It was an interesting choice to ask him back because he did a good job on 5 and I was sure he could do this.It is very obvious that the sixth film is meant to be a dark movie. You see that there is fear around Hogwarts and that is filmed beautifully. I am talking about Dumbledore's Speech. In his speech you see the fear with every student. The thought of Hogwarts being save isn't there anymore. It is a very strong scene of Michael Gambon and I think he is amazing in this film.I was very curious about the script of this film because there happened quite a lot. I think they did a very great job on the script, because this is a story about the present day story, it is not a spin off about Voldemort's life. Indeed you needed to add some memories but not everything. At first I was disappointed but later I understood what the point of showing those memory's were. The balance between the moments of romance and darkness was beautifully filmed. Because it is getting darker but at the same time they reached an age where characters started to fall in love with someone.Dumbledore's death was a point were a lot of people think Yates ruined this. But it was most important to show how the reaction was to Dumbledore's death. Not only by Harry but by the whole school. I think it was bad that the teachers and stuff just let it happen. The death eaters walk in and can do whatever they want. I think you could add a little fight like the book. But it was important to show how Harry felt after Dumbledore died so you must chose were you focus on. after all, I think Dumbledore's death was a special moment in this film. The moment when he died and the moment when people gathered around his body. It was only a little weird that they let it just happen.I think Tom Felton , Michael Gambon, Jim Broadbent and Alan Rickman and Hero Fiennes Tiffin did an amazing thing on this film. To me it felt like Tom could show in this film what he was capable of as an actor, and I was so glad that he got such a big part. He was amazing.Easily 9 out of 10 because of the very emotional scenes almost as good as in the book and the amazing performance by the actors but also because of the developing of the story.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
273,CSHaviland,Weakest Harry Potter adaptation to date,7,1 August 2009,"I should note that I stopped reading the Harry Potter books after the 3rd one, because as they started growing in thickness I had other reading to do in my library and preferred to finish the series when the series was finished. So as I watched the movie adaptations starting with Globlet of Fire they were fresh. That strategy did not work at all with this movie. It was about as exciting as watching a chess match without knowing all rules of the game. It is clear they are lopping out large portions of the books in order to tell a 2-hour story and this one did not translate to film very well.As with any movie, I'm judging the movie and not what it's based on. And this is the slowest, least interesting Harry Potter movie to date. I nearly fell asleep about two thirds in. Considering all the hoopla and secrecy surrounding the days before the release of this book, and the excitement afterward, I imagine the book is much better.With regard to the Harry Potter movies in general, I like 'em, I don't love 'em. I find the characters, situations and especially the environment interesting enough to move me forward and have fun. But I just didn't have very much fun with this one.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
274,he_who_leads,Surprisingly Good,7,28 February 2010,"Other Potter reviewsGolbet of Fire: 8/10 Order of the Phoenix: 4/10For Order of the Phoenix, I complained that in the quest to fit everything in, the film was hard to enjoy. It was simply racing through everything with nothing to savour. I swore I wouldn't watch any more Potter films but I watched this, and was pleasantly surprised. First, the negatives. By the sixth film, you would expect the three leads to share better chemistry, but they often seem uncomfortable around each other rather than best friends. Their acting is still wooden in some places, but it's not a huge deal. And they still have to work on laying out the exposition a bit better so all movie goers can keep up. Would it kill them to explain to people how Dumbledore found the cave? It's a one line fix. The positive. Scenes are still cut excessively, but this movie shows director, David Yates, putting his own stamp on the Potter world and making smart choices. The changes in plot and tone are often very effective. For instance, The finale, with the death eaters, is far less frantic and loud than the book, but is just as effective in a different way by being quiet and menacing. Overall, the new low-key and sombre tone is enjoyable because it fits so well. The film is also pretty funny in some places, something that the previous films have struggled with. The fact that the filmmakers are exhibiting confidence in their adaptation of the book bodes well for future installments. Kudos, also, to the splitting of The Deathly Hallows, which will hopefully give the Potter movies a proper, solid send-off.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
275,femaleanimefan,The best Potter yet,9,15 July 2009,"Book purists beware: if you expect every scene in the book to be covered here, you'll be disappointed. If you're expecting a fun, well-crafted, well-acted, exciting adaptation that captures the essence of the book, you'll be satisfied.This is by far the best Potter film since Prisoner of Askaban, and arguably the best yet. The visuals are terrific, the acting is wonderful, the editing is top-notch, and and the writing and direction are all pitch-perfect.Many fans have complained that the film spends too much time on comedy and romance than on the action. All I have to say is: did they even read the book? The novel didn't have as much action as the others, and instead focused on story and character development, which the comedy was part of. The humor was well done, and always funny.The acting has very much improved. Out of the trio, Daniel Radcliffe has most improved. He has wonderful comedic timing and real dramatic chops as well. Rupert Grint and Emma Watson have also improved, with Grint becoming more than just comic relief and Watson growing out of her occasional woodenness. Tom Felton has more to do this time as Malfoy, and he is positively mesmerizing. You really feel sympathy for the poor kid.The adult cast is top-notch, as well. I have finally gotten over the beloved Richard Harris, and I believe Michael Gambon was absolutely perfect as Dumbledore. Jim Broadbent shines as Professor Slughorn, making up for the drastic physical change with charm pitch-perfect delivery.I was not a fan of David Yates's Order of the Phoenix, but I am now convinced after this film that he is the one who will lead this series to greatness. I can't wait for Deathly Hallows Part I & II, and hopefully they capture the essence of that book there as they did here.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince

I never got into the books and the first movie just bored the hell out of me. So, since I'm supposed to be reviewing every movie in 2009, I dreaded having to see this. Luckily I got it out of the way rather quickly last night at a midnight showing (the theater was filled to the brim with ""Potter Nerds"").My friends dragged me to see this and I'm kind of glad they did. It wasn't a bad movie, I was just lost. I didn't understand the underlying hints, the plot, the characters, anything. And you know what? That's fine. I haven't seen the other movies, so I kind of had it coming.I can only give this a five because from an artistic point of view it was very well done, but from a viewer's standpoint, I just wasn't satisfied.

277,adam_uk09,Disappointing!,6,19 July 2009,"The sixth instalment in the internationally loved wizarding franchise has been perhaps one of the most awaited films of the decade; even more so considering the gruelling year fans have had to wait since it was decided to push the film back 12 months.David Yates is once again at the helm, which after the fifth film is somewhat of a surprise to many critics. With rumours speculating the return of Alfonso Cuaron as director, I breathed a sigh of relief, thinking perhaps we could get things back on track.Alas, it was not to be. After two disappointing instalments, a third would be disastrous, though unfortunately, it seems to be the case here. Yates' films just refuse to hit the spot, delving into unnecessary story lines that really don't progress the film further. Take for example the climatic finale of the book atop the astronomy tower; well it's been cut, replaced with an hour or so of non-stop snogging ridiculous? I have words much stronger than that to describe it, but yes, ridiculous can do for now.It would be silly to expect things to be perfect, but a little cohesion would have been welcome; to people who have not read the books, these films are starting to get incomprehensible and even to those that have, it still isn't an enjoyable experience. Remember the chapter where The Burrow blows up? No? Well that's because there isn't one, but it's been added, for explosions sake.The Dursleys are cut, Dobby – cut, Dumbledore's funeral – cut, Kreacher – cut, Bill and Fleur - cut, in fact most of the important things from the book; have been cut.Happily, there is a rather small pot of gold at the end of this murky rainbow. The acting from most is absolutely excellent, Daniel Radcliffe has grown into his role brilliantly and Michael Gambon seems to finally have chosen the right moods for Dumbledore and his character. Newcomer Jim Broadbent is superb in his role as potions master Horace Slughorn and Alan Rickman is as usual glorious and fully able to spread his wings in the larger role he has been given in this film. On the negative side, Bonnie Wright as Ginny Weasley hasn't developed into her role well, with her acting still being stilted; unfortunate, as her part is much larger in this film than the others.Unfortunately, just like the previous two films, Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince really hasn't hit the spot, it seems the larger books of the boy wizards saga have in reality stumped their respective directors, ending up as a complete mess. It certainly has its moments, though at 153 minutes it should have; but it seems the best film from the 8 has been made slightly too prematurely. Film number 7, come on down!",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
278,SebaZava,"Doesn't work as a standalone movie, but it's still great.",8,17 July 2009,"It was known from the start that die-hard fans would complain about the movie. After all, the book is gigantic, and a series of cuts have to be made in order to make the movie work. In general, I'm happy about the decisions Kloves has made about what to cut and what to keep. Granted, there maybe is a little too much focus on the ""hormonal"" part of the story - the kids falling in love and being jealous and so on. But I actually liked this. Not only does it make the movie more humorous and fun - most of the humour courtesy of the ""romance"" between Ron and Lavender Brown (Jessie Cave) - but it also develops the main characters and show how fast they have grown. Besides from cutting stuff, though, the filmmakers have made a couple of additions that also work. The film begins with an attack on the Millennium Bridge, which actually makes the presence of evil all the more palpable and imminent - the fact that they are attacking muggles is pretty disturbing. There is also an scene in which the Burrow - the Weasleys' home - is attacked. It is handled well, and serves the same purpose as the opening.The main problem with the movie, though, is that it doesn't really feel as an integral part to the overall series. Don't take me wrong, a lot of important events happen during the course of the film - Horcruxes, the death of a certain character - but most of the running time is dedicated to romance, problems between the characters and... well... hormones. Yes, it is fun, and yes, it is entertaining, but it didn't feel important. Like said before, I liked it because it further developed characters and made the film more fun to watch, but it didn't feel significant. In addition, the movie suffers from having neither a beginning nor an end - in short, it doesn't really work as an standalone motion picture. Those who haven't seen the previous installments will feel very lost during the entire runningtime, and those who expect the film to have a definite ending will be disappointed. It felt like a preparation for things to come - I'm sure that when the two Deathly Hallows movies are released, the sixth installment with feel more complete.Every performance is great, as usual. Of the main trio, the best are Daniel Radcliffe and Rupert Grint - the former makes Harry a great protagonist (complex and easy to root for) and the latter is fun and goody without being ridiculous. Emma Watson is OK - not bad, but she still tends to go a little over-the-top, especially during her crying scenes. Bonnie Wright is excellent. Had you told me four years ago that she would develop intro such a fine actress who could hold her own in a romantic scene with Radcliffe, I wouldn't have believed you, but that's exactly the case. She may not set the scene on fire when appearing with Radcliffe, but they do make a nice couple. (She is very cute.) As usual, the kids are surrounded by the finest group of British thespians, and they are all magnificent. It was particularly nice to see Maggie Smith having a little more screen time, and Alan Rickman was great as Snape, especially considering the character's role in the movie. Jim Broadbent, a newcomer to the series, was very entertaining as Professor Slughorn.If there's something that really disappointed me about the film, was Nicholas Hooper's score. His music for the previous installment was memorable and worked beautifully within the context of the film. Sadly enough, the same cannot be said about the music in Half-Blood Prince. Oh, don't take me wrong, it does work, and it never feels intrusive. The problem is it is the same darn music from the previous movie! OK, there are definitely a couple of new themes here and there, but I'd say 80% of the music in the film is exactly the same as in Order of the Phoenix. It wouldn't have hurt to compose to new themes, now, would've it? It is no secret I'm a big fan of John Williams, especially of his score for Prisoner of Azkaban, so I say: bring Williams back. I'm sure he would be able to compose awesome, beautiful new themes for both Deathly Hallows films. Hooper, I'm afraid, has disappointed, despite his solid score for OOP. I guess I'll have to buy the soundtrack in order to check if he indeed composed any new themes.Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince might not be the best entry in the series, but it nevertheless is a darn-good film. I liked David Yates' in-your-face style of directing - especially the hand-held cameras during the more tense scenes - and his visual style, which works perfectly due to the overall darkness of the plot. The thing is, although the romance scenes work - especially the very cute relationship between Ginny and Harry - and there are many important things revealed during the course of the movie, it didn't feel like a very significant installment. It will definitely help watching the last two movies - Half-Blood Prince is like a preparation for Deathly Hallows, and maybe that's why it doesn't work as a stand-alone movie. Still, because it can be hilarious at times without losing track of the plot and the darkness that's coming, and because it features very cool special effects as well as excellent performances, I was very entertained by the movie, and was left wanting more. If only John Williams had composed the soundtrack...",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince

He then finds an old potion book mysteriously marked ""This book is the property of the Half-Blood Prince"" and, with Dumbledore's help, begins to uncover Lord Voldemort's dark history.First and foremost, this is undeniably the most gorgeous-looking movie this year. Thanks to the graceful directing of director David Yates and the genius of the director of photography, newcomer Bruno Delbonnel, Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince gives us an outstanding visual effect and cinematography. With much control of the CGI and special effect, David Yates provide us a whole exceptionally new atmospheric world using bigger set pieces that actually help the flow of the movie without really showing too much that it was edited by computers and thus making it a total eye-candy. And Nicholas Hooper's score, consisting of orchestra and choir, really complements the movie and give each scene more emotion and a sense of nostalgia with the hint of the memorable sounds from Order of the Phoenix but amazingly enough, using only slight traces of the original scores by John Williams.Next, we can definitely see that the three main actors had grown up, not only physically but emotionally and also in the sense of acting skills. The story has to follow JK Rowling's increasingly mature and darker books, and so have the actors. The sense of longing and raging hormones, plus the tense feeling towards danger and death makes this a more adult movie in the Harry Potter series thus far. But the PG rating seems fair. In The Goblet of Fire, Cedric Diggory's death was shocking, but in The Half-Blood Prince, Voldemort is at full power, making us feel the constant presence of danger and evil and that anyone on screen could die at any moment (but don't fret; body count: 1).But the thing is, this movie does not only deal with the three actors like the films before it. They are a few outstanding performances. One, by the amazing Tom Felton (who plays Draco Malfoy) who shows true emotion and sadness in what he was forced to do. And then there's Jim Broadbent (who plays the new Prof. Slughorn) who could actually received an Oscar Buzz for 'Best Supporting Actor'. He plays the old yet loved professor effortlessly and did the best with his time on screen without having to overpower or drown the other actors around him. He's just natural.As for the action: yes, some action scenes were omitted from the movie, but those that were left behind are astoundingly thrilling. The most outstanding and chilling sequence is the cave scene where Harry and Dumbledore penetrate Voldemort's secret. It's layered with horror and sadness and not to mention top notch special effect. The extra 7-month post production did the movie good! And despite its long running time, over 2 hours 30 minutes, Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince seems adequate as David Yates pushes the movie to a cracking pace and some of us might even crave for more. But after entering the first two hours, you might already forget about the titular Half-Blood Prince. The mystery is gone and drowned by some needless fillers (hint: too much romance is never good). The storyline itself missed some key points that made the book such a masterpiece. If you see this movie as an adaptation, then, yeah, it's not good. But as a movie on its own, then Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince is a beautiful epitome of a true summer movie. Epic is definitely the word for it.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
282,Apemangalore,Easily the best film in the series,9,15 July 2009,"Having recently watched the first five films again, I have to say that I have slightly mixed feelings about the Harry Potter film series as a whole. The first three, while still solid films, are not nearly as ""amazing"" as I remember them being (though Prisoner of Azkaban comes pretty damn close). Goblet of Fire, however, is much better than I remember it being, and part five, while not as brilliant as its predecessor, is definitely among the series' best. So, despite being a huge fan of the last few books, I've never particularly loved any of the Potter films, with the exception of the fourthand now the sixth.Performance-wise, virtually everybody was terrific. The central trio, as always, captures the essence of their respective characters perfectly. Emma Watson has especially improved as Hermione, delivering what I think is the most moving performance of the three. As for Michael Gambon as Dumbledore, I wasn't a huge fan of him in films three, four, and five. In Half-Blood Prince, though, I felt he really nailed the character, containing that sense of power, wisdom, and a hint of arrogance all at once. Alan Rickman, as expected, was brilliantly chilling as Snape, and Jim Broadbent gives what it easily one of my favorite performances in the series as Horace Slughorn.One of the complaints that I've heard a bit was that the movie spent too much time on the romantic relationships, and not enough on the ""main plot"" centered on Harry and Dumbledore. Personally, I didn't really find that. Sure, I would've liked to have seen one or two more of the ""memories"" that were shown to Harry in the book, but for the most part, I felt that every key portion of the novel was translated very effectively to the screen.While the visual style is absolutely incredible, and the action sequences (of what few there are) are thrilling, this is very much a character-driven film, which is really what makes it the best in the series for me. The movie also has a nice balance in tone, from portions that are light-hearted and fun, to others that are dark and somber. It's a tough mixture, but I felt that they pulled it off extraordinarily well.Overall, Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince is a terrific film that, while delivering impressive bits of action and visual wizardry (no pun intended), finds the characters again. With incredible performances all across the board, a solid balance in tone, and a surprising amount of faithfulness to the source material, David Yates and his crew have put together what is my personal favorite of the six Potter films. As far as I'm concerned, the rest of the series is in good hands.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
283,jccwu,It's mostly just a bridge towards the final film.,7,15 August 2009,"The 6th installment of the Harry Potter film reminded me a lot like its previous movie, except that this story heavily focuses on the background of Tom Riddle (Lord Voldemort) and the sexual tension that our three main characters are experiencing in their mid-adolescence.I was shocked that this film is only rated PG, especially since the two previous movies were PG-13. There are some frightening images for younger viewers, including characters in peril and death.Like ""Order of the Phoenix"", this film doesn't have a conclusion. It leaves a lot of questions unanswered and it's a bridge towards the final book ""The Deathly Hallows"". Like most of the Harry Potter films, this movie is visually entertaining and it's refreshing to see the main characters growing into their emerging romantic relationships, emotional confusions and conflict resolutions of their teenage characteristic years. Although this film may get lost for being the 6th within a total of 8 Harry Potter movies.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
284,b_havag,Harry Potter and the Almost Absent Main Plot,3,17 July 2009,"If you are a big fan of the books, like me, you will probably watch this movie no matter what, as I have done. I'm sorry to say though that the biggest spoiler is doing just that. Lets take a look: I hated the whole Harry/Ginny-relationship. Firstly, Bonnie Wright is horrible. This relationship evolved through the book, while it was evident from the start here. This is stupid because when Harry came to the Burrow, he looked instantly in love with Ginny, despite the fact that there was no hint of even a start of a romantic connection between them at the end of neither book or film 5. Are they supposed to have fallen in love during a summer absent from each other? The relationship stays like this until Ginny kisses him late in the movie, on a point in the plot when they're together in the book, and Ginny instantly suggests to end it with that kiss. Why use all that time on this twisted portrayal of their relationship? The Harry/Snape-relationship is supposed to be immensely hateful, while in the movie they just ""slightly don't get along"". This counts for Snapes relationship with Bella DeMons as well.I've never really liked Michael Gambon as Dumbledore, but in this movie (probably more noticeable because of his extended, more important role) he reaches rock bottom. Rowlings Dumbledore is, how should I put it, a character who just SHINES of power, wisdom, kindness and natural superiority, all traits that are as lacking in Gambon as they were present in the late Richard Harris. This is noticeable from the very start of the picture and becomes even more painfully evident in the climax at the end.Bonham Carters Bellatrix DeMons is a performance that would be close to perfect if she was meant to play the poltergeist Peeves. Bellatrix is not a clown, she is an incarnation of evil, and to see Bonham Carter portray her like she was a character in one of her husbands stupid emo-movies is frankly a disgrace. The scene with her outside of the Burrow (which is absent in the book and therefore totally unnecessary ) is an example of this and should be cut to give space for more details in the important scenes.I liked the love triangle between Ron(Won), Hermione and Lavender (I found Jessie Cave's performance both great as itself as well as strengthening the character of Ron Weasley) but it got way too much focus next to what should have been the movie's main plot: The story of young Tom Riddle and his horcruxes. Too many scenes concerning this plot were cut, and those that were present were way too short and hurried, just to give space for material either twisted or absent from the book or concerning romance. Why they made such an amazing fantasy story into an average teenage romantic-comedy is beyond me, but I suppose it is all about what gives most profit.Horace Slughorn is an amusing character, but he is not the moron portrayed by Jim Broadbent.Why the heck did they remove John Williams magical Harry Potter-score?! And despite all these major flaws, they are nothing compared to the worst of them all: Harry Potter would NEVER just stand and watch Draco Malfoy, a bunch of Death Eaters AND Severus Snape alone with a weakened and wandless Albus Dumbledore! That is the single most stupid thing I have ever seen in a movie. Why on Earth wasn't Harry immobilized like in the book?! How easy wouldn't that have been to portray? And afterwards, the rest of the movie is one big flaw. The Battle at Hogwarts is simply absent, the Death Eaters just walk calmly out, the confrontation between Harry and Snape is beyond embarrassing, Hogwarts reaction to Dumbledores death is just weird and the end is way too short and simple.Many other similar but less serious flaws were also almost constantly present, but I can't mention them all. I think you get my point anyway.Why then, do I give as much as 4 stars? Well, there were some scenes I thought was well done, especially the comedy, the love triangle, the Quidditch and the scene where Harry got Slughorns memory. Special effects were as always enchanting, and apart from the characters and actors mentioned I was fairly pleased. I love the Harry Potter franchise and can't keep myself from liking it somehow despite major flaws. Also, I see that as a movie for anyone not familiar with the books and less critical than me it can be very enjoyable. 4/10.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
285,ozymandiaskingofkings,Easily the best of the series,9,15 August 2009,"Up till this point, I was always vaguely dissatisfied with the Harry Potter films, feeling that they failed to adequately represent the source material. They either cut out important bits, left in unimportant bits or were just badly paced or filled with mawkish sentiment. The directors chosen to helm previous instalments were a mixed bag. Alfonso Cuaron's darkly Gothic ""Prisoner of Azkaban"" was, till now, the best of the bunch, mixing a brilliant cinematic sensibility with great storytelling, while the others were a mixed back. Mike Newell's ""Goblet of Fire"" was very slick, but also very soulless, a SFX buffet sans wit, while Chris Columbus first two films are nigh on unwatchable, full of terrible dialogue and mawkish, cheesy sentimentality.With David Yates however, the unexpected choice for ""Order of the Phoenix"" off the back of the brilliant BBC thriller ""State of Play"", the series really hit it's stride, with Yates bringing a sense of realism and peril (largely absent in the previous 4) to the series and stripping down most of the tedious whimsical stuff that slowed down the films and instead crafting two rather brilliant fantasy thrillers. ""Order of the Phoenix"" may not have been perfect, but it was certainly better than the book (my least favourite, too long, poorly focused and, with the exception of the ending, rather dull) and it is my absolute pleasure to say that ""Half-Blood Prince"" is pretty much perfect, the books dark tone and horror/thriller elements matching Yates' style like hand in glove.The visual style and direction are quite astounding, a curious mix of State of Play style realism and Tim Burton-esquire expressionism, the bleached aesthetic giving an ever present feeling of dread and menace previously absent from the films. The muted rain drenched opening, with Harry blinded flashbulbs straight after his Ministry battle looks like something out of a 40s crime thriller, but the scene directly after, in which London is attacked by a group of death eaters brings us straight back to reality, a post 9/11 vibe permeating this scene and the whole film with Voldemort's evil now targeted at Muggle civilians and, ultimately, Hogwarts. There is no safety to the magical world anymore, it is now a place of death and destruction.Misery and Gothicism are piled on in the atmospheric mise-en-scene, from Tom Riddle's nightmarish Dickensian childhood in a crumbling orphanage, to the bombed out ruins of Diagon Alley and the scenes in Snape's house on a grim Northern terraced street, the sweetness and light of the earlier films has totally gone, the ever present threat of the Death Eaters handing like a cloud over the whole film. Voldemort doesn't appear, but his reach is felt everywhere, maniacal agents like Bellatrix Lestrange and Fenrir Greyback acting with Al Qaeda like fanaticism against the Dark Lord's enemies.The acting is, as usual, excellent. Regulars such as Gambon and Rickman become pivotal to the plot and completely shine, while newcomer Jim Broadbent is a joy to behold as eccentric new teacher Horace Slughorn, all cynicism and rambling anecdotes. The show-stealer though is Helena Bonham-Carter returning as Bellatrix Lestrange, filling the character with childlike hyperactivity, Gothic sensuality and outright insanity during the end assault on Hogwarts.As for the students, they are on the whole fantastic. Rupert Grint and Emma Watson are both very funny as Ron and Hermione, experiencing unwanted attention from admirers, while Radcliffe inhabits the character of Potter so much that, however weak his acting may be, it is impossible to imagine anyone else playing the character. Special mentions must also go out to Evanna Lynch, utterly enchanting as the eccentric Luna Lovegood and Jessie Cave, who is wonderfully soppy as Ron's unshakable love interest Lavender Brown.Without a shadow of a doubt, this is the best Potter film to date, tense, focused, brilliantly shot and directed, and filled with excellent performances. I eagerly await the final films as, with Yates, the franchise has never been in better hands.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
286,firefox2k,Highly disappointing,5,15 July 2009,"This film was quite disappointing and did not live up to the previous film that was done by David Yates. In the series of all the movies made from the books, this one was just slightly better than the horrible (Prisoner of Azkaban). The actor the chose to play slughorn was all wrong. Slurred speech, Uneven delivery, and just looked wrong for the part. The movie jumps from one chapter to the next going, by the book, where a full chapter is done in 1 minute in the movie. There were some parts and scenes that had nothing to do with the book, this confuses me. Why waste the time putting stuff in that isn't there, and leaving stuff out that should be? (Leaving out Bill weasley, dobby and Kreature, Minister Scrimgore, Fudge, and numerous other characters was unforgivable) Yes, i know, you cant do the WHOLE BOOK for a movie, but I made this movie, i could do a MUCH BETTER job, and maybe ad 10 minutes to the movie, and tell the story much better. The one bright aspect is that the main actors aren't the cute kids anymore, and have grown up to be wonderful actors. Had i know, i would have waited for this film to come out on DVD instead of paying to see it. I am sure it might do 230 million dollars, but they need to put that much money into the value of the writing and production of the film.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
287,omahonyjason,Magic for fans but won't convert non-believers!,5,28 July 2009,"HARRY POTTER AND THE HALF BLOOD PRINCE Director: Peter Yates Country: USA/UK Year: 2009 Language: English Runtime: 153 Minutes Rating: 12(A)Chances are you've made up your mind about Harry Potter. It's been impossible to escape the young wizard and his spell casting friends. The books are a global sales phenomenon with more than 400 million sold and the previous five movies have, collectively, grossed well over $4 Billion around the world. Success for this film, then, is guaranteed and true fans were never likely to be disappointed by the film. But is it any good?Voldemort, the evil wizard, is tightening his grip on both the Muggle and wizarding worlds and Hogwarts, Harry's school, is no longer the safe haven that it once was. Harry suspects that dangers may even lie within its walls but Dumbledore, the headmaster, is more intent on preparing Harry for the final showdown that is fast approaching than in worrying about Hogwarts. Together they work to find the key to unlock Voldemort's defenses and, to this end, Dumbledore recruits his old friend and colleague, the well-connected and unsuspecting bon vivant Professor Horace Slughorn, who Dumbledore believes holds crucial information.Meanwhile, the students are under attack from a very different adversary – teenage hormones! They rage across the ramparts and Harry finds himself drawn to Ginny who is also admired by Dean Thomas. Lavender Brown decides that Ron is the only one for her, only she didn't count on Romilda Vane's chocolates! And then there's Hermione, simpering with jealously but determined not to show her feelings. As romance blossoms, one student remains aloof. He is determined to make his mark, albeit a dark one. Love is in the air, but tragedy lies ahead and Hogwarts may never be the same again. Warner Brothers, who released the pic, held it back from its original date which was scheduled just before last Christmas. It released THE DARK KNIGHT (2008) on the same weekend last year and it was hoping that the latest Harry Potter would do similar business around the world. The movies share more than their release weekend with an undercurrent of unease running through both films.And while there's no getting away from the fact that THE HALF BLOOD PRINCE is not as strong as earlier Potter films, there's equally no getting away from the fact that it deliciously sets up the ultimate show down between Harry and Voldemort.The film plays a little long at over two and a half hours but the vast majority of fans leaving the theatre, both young and old, had huge grins on their faces and I heard more than one person say, 'I can't wait for the next film.' But is it any good? Well, yes and no. It's magic if you're a fan but non-believers will struggle to see what all the fuss is about.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince

289,jamesnicholls-58600,Funniest Harry Potter movie,10,18 April 2020,"I loved how funny this movie was, and in that regard it was an improvement over all the other HP movies. It was the funniest HP movie, but most importantly it didn't have too much humour either, so it was able to retain the dark and hopeless theme whilst also being funny in parts.This film didn't ever have a dull scene, I felt the entire film was good from start to finish. Outstanding consistency. Sirius Black is my 2nd favourite Harry Potter character and my 3rd favourite character of all time so I did miss Sirius a lot in the movie so that was a disappointment, however I really liked Slughorn so he almost made up for the absence of Sirius. Slughorn was a very cheerful jolly character which almost always made me feel very happy every scene he was in, he'd be a great person to have a beer and a laugh with, Slughorn drinks quite a bit during the movie so that's partly why I think this film is the best Harry Potter movie to watch drinking alcohol.I felt the film should've included the full Battle of the Astronomy tower though, in the books Dumbledore's Army has a little battle with some of the Death Eaters. They should've included this in the movie. So although the absence of Sirius, adult Voldemort and quotes about James Potter was depressingly noticeable, the film was the funniest, most alcoholic and most drug fuelled Harry Potter film which made up for the loss of some the best characters somewhat.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
290,ljsmith-25626,"Dark, Gritty and Atmospheric",9,13 May 2020,"I've seen a lot of criticism towards the producers for straying somewhat from the source material in Half-Blood Prince. So far the big screen adaptations have rarely included any scene or other that is not explicitly stated in the works of JK Rowling. I can see why a lot of hardcore fans of the books are disappointed in some of the decisions to deviate from the origin - I too am one of those fans - but to be wholly honest the movie is all the better for such scenes. The much maligned Burrow attack scene seems to have caused the most tears throughout reviews. I believe Yates and co. took the initiative to include this act as a device to shoehorn Bellatrix somewhere onto the screen, and as far as I'm concerned the more we see of Helena Bonham Carter in this role the better. So overall I am not critical at all of the producers' decisions to stray from the books, and thought a defence of these judgements was in order.The cinematography on display is outstanding and contributes a great deal towards generating a dark, foreboding atmosphere - from the first minute to the last. A lot of the shots involving Draco especially are impressive in showing him lurking around Hogwarts. Tom Felton gives his best performance yet as Malfoy, and in fact the acting across the board is head and shoulders above what we've seen so far in the series. Special mention must be given to Jim Broadbent, who is an excellent addition to the cast, and Michael Gambon for his compelling showing as Dumbledore in the final few scenes.As a film, the Half-Blood Prince is the best of the series so far and merits a way higher star rating than it currently pertains.

291,fred-kolb,"A respectable adapation of the book, but in the end only a prequel to the grand finale!",8,18 September 2009,"I always thought that ""Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"" was the weakest book of the series, because it just feels like a bridge between Book 5 and 7, that doesn't have anything to offer on its own. The whole plot basically centers around the romantic problems of Harry, Ron and Hermione, and Harry and Dumbledore traveling through memories that involve Lord Voldemort's past. The excitement factor was just absent for pretty much the first 3/4 of the book, and while the final was quite thrilling, it also fell short of some of the others in previous books. Now, with that in mind, I went to see the film with rather low expectations, and expected to hate it and be mad for a long time that they butchered the Harry Potter film series beyond saving. Well, it turns out I was wrong. All in all, the film was a pleasant surprise, and I have to say that I really enjoyed it. Was it the worst of the six Harry Potter movies? Probably yes. Is it worth watching though? Definitely! Well, as I said before, ""The Half-Blood Prince"", the book, as well as the movie, feel a bit empty. Considering that the book has 607 pages, and the movie is more than 2 1/2 hours long, there is just not enough exciting stuff to keep up the thrill for the whole time. One of the pluses is certainly the humor, and I can say for certain, that I haven't laughed as much in any Harry Potter movie since ""The Chamber of Secrets"". The hilarious, but often not too far-fetched romantic dialogue is so cheesy and ridiculous, that you just have to be amused by it. But like ""Order of the Phoenix"", the movie  has a very dark and claustrophobic atmosphere from time to time, especially the very beginning and the end. In between, you almost forget that there is an evil dark wizard out there, trying to kill our beloved main character. While the two elements, comic and dramatic maybe a little imbalanced, they are connected relatively well and for most of the time, the audience will definitely be on the edge of their seats, even if you have read the book already. But then, who hasn't these days? ""The Half-Blood Prince"", while still being a faithful adaptation of the book, makes quite a bit of changes, cuts and additions, so that there are even one or two surprises that you didn't see coming. Interestingly enough, for example, it was decided to completely leave out the battle between the Order of the Phoenix and the students against the Death Eaters, supposedly because it would distract from the upcoming Battle of Hogwarts in ""The Deathly Hallows"". Anyway, instead we get a thrilling replacement, namely an attack on the Burrow by the Death Eaters, and Harry and Ginny chasing Bellatrix Lestrange and Fenrir Greyback through the fields surrounding the Weasley family home.The movies have clearly become darker and darker with each new entry, but therefore we also get to see more fights and actions. What I really want to say with that, is that the demand for high quality special effects in the Harry Potter movies is now greater than ever. And the Visual Effects are quite stunning, with the Millennium Bridge in London collapsing after an attack of Lord Voldemort's death eaters, the Burrow exploding, or Dumbledore casting a powerful fire charm against a group of inferi, re-animated dead bodies. While especially the destruction of the bridge is simply there to open the movie with a bang, a couple of stunning scenes can't hurt a movie that is relatively slow-paced and for the most part relies on dialogue, rather than action. All in all, it should have been great practice for the upcoming two movies based on the seventh and final Harry Potter book ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows"".The performances are also great, especially outstanding are Michael Gambon (who finally nails his role as Dumbledore), Jim Broadbent (who is one of the comedy center points of this film as Horace Slughorn) and Alan Rickman (who really only has to be on screen and don't say a word, to scare the crap out of everyone) The thing about the Harry Potter movies, is that no matter how bad the review is, people will still go and see them, just because Harry Potter is in the title. But, while ""Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"" really is nothing more than a bridge to the final entry of the series, it is rather enjoyable, well-made and has some pretty good acting. (4/5) Even though the plot is not the most gripping one, the movie combines the comic and dark sides of the Harry Potter universe quite well and manages to entertain for most of its running time.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
292,adhipar,Lack of important details - so bored I fell asleep,4,2 August 2009,"Harry Potter's series were my daughter's favorite. We have them on DVD and she watched them a lot, over and over again. I too accompany her and even read all the books.Having said that, and the fact that Rowling has stated that it's finish on the 7th book, it's obvious & I understand that the 6th book/movie will become a prologue for the final episode. So, All the questions below : - Why does Tom Riddle become Voldemort? - How can Voldemort be killed once and for all? - How can Potter face Voldemort by himself if there still another great wizard? - What relations of Potter, the Weasleys, Hermione will become? - The warm-up battle before the final one.. etc are answered or at least have big clues in the 6th book. So the book itself is not as good & adventurous as previous ones but provide necessary details for the 7th book.However, those important details is not all covered in this > 2 hours movie. The pace was slow & dull even make me fall asleep for 10 mins (My wife wake me up).I mean, it's better to build Voldemort's motive than make audience watch a bridge collapse. Such destruction can be informed through dialogs than let important detail missing.Or, provide the ending battle to let the audience eager enough to wait for the 7th movie than watch Bellatrix trash Hogwarts.The pace can be speed up to put more details, etc.I really wonder how the director/team will make the 7th movie with minimum details provided in this movie.

From the war that is presumably going on, to the romances, to the potions professor, to Snape's and Malfoy's dilemma, the school days of the antagonist, etc., every theme in the movie is half-baked.The actors all know the script is crap; we have seen them capably execute their roles in other Potter movies. In this one, they seem to be stumbledoring over each other in bewilderment.It's as if the script were generated by some parsing software that only had access to every fifth page of the book, and one needn't have read the book to get this feeling.By the end, I was hoping all the characters, not just Dumbledore, would be consumed by some plague of Voldemortian excess. And incidentally, is anyone else tired of the unwarranted obeisance to Harry Potter in these books and movies as ""the chosen one?"" Shouldn't he have to crawl down off a cross or some-such before being deserving of such messianic worship? haven't seen anything equivalent justifying this character's godlike treatment by all the other characters.

295,IllusionOfLife,An Imperfect Adaptation but Still a Good Film,9,27 June 2011,"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince Rating: B WARNING: Normally I keep my reviews more-or-less spoiler free, however I am making an exception due to the fact that I will be making many comparisons between the book and the film, so... THIS REVIEW WILL CONTAIN SPOILERS, IF YOU HAVE NOT READ THE BOOK AND/OR SEEN THE FILM LEAVE NOW. So seeing as I've (hopefully) scared off all of those who aren't familiar with the story I'm going to skip my typical summary paragraph and get straight to the review. So I will start by saying that this movie was neither as brilliant as Order of the Phoenix or Prisoner of Azkaban nor as terrible as Goblet of Fire. For me it sits along side Chamber of Secrets in the dead center of my Harry Potter film line-up, oddly enough the movies are in the same spot for exactly opposite reasons. While Chamber of Secrets was extremely accurate to the book it felt like it was taking itself too seriously and did not allow the movie to be told in a fresh way; Half- Blood Prince on the other hand was given more artistic license and was in turn allowed to be much more fun, however they were a little too lax with the adaptation and some (I thought) crucial moments were deleted. Now I hate book-to-movie nit-pickers and I know, as a filmmaker, that certain things need to be changed in taking something from print to the screen and while many of my friends nit-picked Order of the Phoenix to death I found it being my favorite of the series thus far. However, the thing that irritates me most in adaptations is when the filmmaker takes time away from crucial moments by adding in whole sequences of story that never occurred in the original work. The attack on the Burrow in this film was extremely unnecessary yet remained in the final cut instead of other crucial pieces such as Dumbledore's conversation with the Dursleys at the beginning of the book and Harry's realization that Snape was the one who revealed the Prophecy about Harry to Voldemort. What it comes down to is essentially that the filmmaker thought that his work was more important than the original author's, and attitude which is extremely arrogant and completely foolish unless the new work is undeniably brilliant, which was not the case with some of the scenes in this movie. Another thing that irritated me was the lack of any commotion as the Death Eaters were fleeing Hogwarts. I'm not saying that they should have added another sequence showing all this because that would have been bad for pacing but to show glimpses of the battle between students, staff, and Death Eaters in the background as Harry was chasing after Snape would have made that scene much better, in the final cut of the film it all happened to quickly. After David Yates brilliantly delivered the emotion of Sirrius' death in the fifth film I was excited to see how he would top that with Dumbledore's but in the end I was disappointed. Despite the troubles that some of the more crucial scenes had the movie really shined in its portrayal of life at Hogwarts. These sequences were the heart and soul of the movie and were done very well. The casting was, as always with this series, brilliant and the drama between Harry, Ron, Hermione, and Ginny was done expertly. I'd wager to say that this aspect of the story was done better than it has been done in any of the previous films, and I was very pleased with the way David Yates handled this. However, the problem is that, while this aspect takes up the bulk of the book, it is not as crucial in the grand scheme of things as other, smaller, sequences that were not done the way they needed to be or removed entirely. I will give David Yates the benefit of the doubt because he has shown his ability with Order of the Phoenix and this particular story I'm sure is exceptionally hard to adapt. The fact that so much of the storytelling is focused on back story it must be hard to decide just what needs to be left in and what can stand to be removed. The biggest problem however was the fact that two sequences were added that were entirely unnecessary. I did enjoy this film and would be more than happy to give it a second go. For a story as tricky as this, it was done fairly well. I'm excited to see Mr. Yates' work with the next two films.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
296,jeffreyjets,It was OK,6,21 July 2009,"I am not a reader of the books. Might read them after the movies are through. Seems like the books just ruin all the movies.Unfortunately for a 2.5 hour movie, ""OK"" is a struggle to get through. The action seemed to be in the beginning and from then it was suspenseful and sophomoric teenage goofy ""romance"". My boys of 11 and 12 didn't like it at all because there wasn't enough action to make it interesting. I was OK with the movie although I expected more action and it would have helped the movie a lot.The acting and script were decent. With the books being such a hit and this movie being so so-so, it makes me think they don't choose the right events from the book to make a great movie. Such a shame.With the mysterious secret between Snape and Dumbledore, I think I already know what is going on with the ending, which should have/could have been so much more than what it was. If you are going to introduce events not in the book (others have said so), the ending should have been much more substantial.As coaches in pro sports seem to out coach themselves, I think that the film story people have ""out-storied"" themselves.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
297,parallel_projection,"Look at it as a movie, not a book",9,22 August 2012,"I realize that this movie, although it does follow the basic plot of the book, is completely different from it, but it is still incredibly entertaining and well-done. There are so many things that stand out in this movie, from the brilliant acting, to the masterful and toned cinematography, to the haunting, magical soundtrack, and the competent direction. Everyone seem definitely gave it their all on this movie, and it shows.The acting is simply the best yet, from everyone involved. The trio is fantastic--Daniel Radcliffe who has to take on Harry's even more complicated life, Rupert Grint does a does a great job making Ron truly love-stricken, and Emma Watson provides us with a smart, fierce Hermione who's heart is broken by her best friend. One of the standout performances, however, is Tom Felton, who finally gets a major part as an ambiguous Malfoy being forced over to the dark side. He doesn't have very many lines, but is spectacular to watch--you can just see all his torn emotions in his face. The veteran cast is simply amazing--Jim Broadbent is the perfect pick for Professor Slughorn, and is absolutely hysterical. Michael Gambon gives an amazing performance as a more vulnerable Dumbledore full of determination to beat the Dark Lord. Also, Alan Rickman is darker and more mysterious than ever, as his true loyalties are finally tested. Helena Bonham Carter, Maggie Smith, Helen McCrory, Mark Williams, and Julie Walters, too, all do a great job.This entire movie is a lot tenser than the others, and you can feel that everything is starting to add up and go somewhere, and yet it is by far the funniest Harry Potter movie. Many scenes are very comical--in fact, almost the entire movie is, except, of course, when it doesn't want to be. There are some very dark undertones, and the scenes in the pensive provide a haunting look into Tom Riddles past, although many memories were deleted from the film. One scene that is done to near-perfection is the cave scene. The set was absolutely stunning- -dazzling, dark, creepy, and mysterious at the same time, and everything seemed to just fit together. However, the scene that doesn't fit into the movie is the burning of the Burrow. It was not in the book at all, and I realize they wanted more action in the movie, but if they had put in the scene that's supposed to go there and introduced the Minister of Magic, it could've provided for a pretty tense situation. However, this hardly detracts from the film. Overall, although the movie is certainly more comical than the book, and many parts were changed or left out, this film is nonetheless highly entertaining and the perfect lead-in to Harry's last and final journey.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
298,LawrenceOfAlabama,Half-Blood prince=Half-A@# Movie fare!,5,17 July 2009,"I want to start by saying half a movie deserves half a score (hence the 5). I took my 10 year old son to this film. So I have the opinion of two adverse perspectives. From the opening scene I was in high hopes that this installment of the Potter franchise might actually be entertaining to those not involved in the page-turning melodrama. I was sadly mistaken.This film is Twilight with wands. I know I've scene this before; wait it came out last Summer. It also had Harry Potter in the title. O.K. I get it... Harry, Ron, and the chick are all growing up. Hormones are raging, they are getting awkward (in looks and persona) and we are along for the ride. Or at 6 movie approx 2.5 hours each It seems more like a stroll than a ride.No one applauded at the end of this film (we saw it opening weekend). Also my 10 year old son made an observation or two. Here they are: 1. Harry's glasses are like goggles in the water.2. For some reason they had to dispose of the ""Book Plot Device"" for no apparent reason.3. The characters did not evolve at all.I know I come off like a Potter Pouter but honestly I'm coming from a film/entertainment angle. Perhaps the obvious, ""The book is better"" statement holds true here. However with these films as the catalyst, I won't be turning any Rowlings pages in the near future.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
299,t-hf,Cant understand all the praise that this one got.,4,27 January 2014,"I can remember seeing this at a cinema while on holiday with my family in Great Yarmouth. I highly anticipated seeing as it had been two years since the last one. I grew up with the books and movies, and always got a fantastic experience and sense of adventure when I watched them. But Potter's 6th adventure is the worst of the series, considering that the book was pretty cool. I walked out of that cinema wishing that i'd spent my money on mundane arcade machines.To start off, the film has absolutely no plot whatsoever. In a nutshell, it concerns Harry's discovery of a book belonging to someone known as ""The Half-Blood Prince"", from which he learns new ways to make potions - that's it. Every scene in the film is completely unnecessary and even the action just doesn't have the drama of the other films and the books. I remember reading in the newspaper that the plot also concerns Harry, Ron and Hermione's first relationship experiences and teenage hormones. Well make no mistake, that is all you will get for two and a half hours, with the exception of its heavy, tonally shifted conclusion. What should be the next instalment in a fantasy-adventure saga, ends up being a feeble attempt at fantasy with high-school comedy undertones. The only real relevant plot line is Dumbledore's mission to destroy the source of Lord Voldemort's power, which he inevitably recruits Harry for in the film's final twenty minutes, once all the forced humour and awkward romance is out of the way. The film is basically an excuse for the filmmakers to take a ""lunch break"" before having to really commence work on the series' epic, two-part conclusion. The film just has a bizarre and generally distant feel to it, like absolutely no one on set enjoyed the book when it was first published. The only aspect that I found decent was the actors. Every actor plays their part as well as they have done in the rest of the saga, but unfortunately for them they're forced to carry this absolute cow pat of a story.As with any of my reviews, You must decide for yourself whether you like this film or not, but I was very disappointed and consider one of the weaker films in the series.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
300,michael-turner13,Getting Darker,9,4 August 2009,As I am a fan of the books and the films I was expecting something good. I can definitely say that I was not disappointed.What has kept me interested in the films is the fact that they have stayed true to the books unlike some other films.As with the last movies the acting is great. The storyline good as it stuck to the book. The fact that it has been getting darker as the series progresses is brilliant.My one complaint is with the soundtrack. It dose not seem to be as good as the previous instalments in the franchise. Don't get me wrong I thought it was good but not superbOverall a great film that can be enjoyed by people of all ages.,Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
301,jayz-55807,Weakest Potter Enty,10,14 August 2020,"Half-Blood Prince is the funniest film in the series. It's well-acted, nicely shot and Dumbledore is wonderful. But as I'm a Potterhead, and as an adaptation it disappoints. Too romance-focused and not enough focus on Voldemort, and it's unfortunate how Ginny is portrayed here.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
302,Cs_The_Moment,Possibly the best film so far!,10,16 July 2009,"I have just seen Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince today, and i was pleasantly surprised. Having seen OOTP (which, lets be honest, contained a few plot holes), my expectations for the smaller important details being put in was not high. However, the attention to detail in those big scenes of the movie was more than satisfactory.I will not go into any detail about the scenes in the movie, because i don't want to spoil your enjoyment of the film, but i thought that this film was fantastic. OK, so it wasn't 100% perfectly true to the book, but there was more than enough content in the 2 and a half hour adventure. Having eagerly anticipated this important instalment in Harry's life, as i'm sure many other fans will have, i thought that the film touched on the more ""emotionally delicate"" scenes, shall we say, with a sensitivity that almost matched that of the novel. I had heard about the couple of new scenes that were added to the film, and, although the comments had not been altogether that positive, i found the scenes to be fascinating action packed additions to the already thrilling tale. The best scene, in my opinion, was the cave scene. Accurately portrayed and heartbreakingly well-acted, it was a dramatically stunning build-up to the film's poignant climax.The style of the filming was lovely, with some amazing special effects, especially in the memories; and some lovely new sets, such as Weasley's Wizard Wheezes, that make a wonderful addition to the old favourites. Also, the addition of some new characters, such as Narcissa Malfoy and Fenrir Greyback, add a darker edge to the film. However, it was the performances of some of the old favourites that really captured my attention. Tom Felton, who had a much bigger role than in previous films, gave a stunning performance as a much more vulnerable Draco Malfoy. Alan Rickman was on top form as usual, although i think he was slightly underused, which was a shame. Daniel Radcliff, Emma Watson and Rupert Grint coped with their more adult, emotional roles wonderfully, and Michael Gambon's portrayal of the legendary Albus Dumbledore was possibly the truest Dumbledore we've ever seen, with more of his quirkiness showing through. And then, of course, there was fantastic performances from top actors such as Helena Bonham Carter and Dame Maggie Smith, to name but a couple. Also, it was wonderful to see the smaller side characters, such as Mr and Mrs Weasley, Lupin, and Tonks, getting some more screen time. Evanna Lynch, and newcomers Jessie Cave and Jim Broadbent, brought a spark of comedy which took the dark edge off a bit. I think most of the newcomer praise must, however, go to Hero Fiennes-Tiffin and Frank Dillane, who gave chillingly wonderful performances of the young Tom Riddles.Overall, i was throughly impressed with Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, and i would throughly recommend it to anyone, fans and muggles alike. It is the most engaging of the Harry Potter films yet, and i cannot wait to see it again.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
303,prashanta_guha,Finally!!!,9,20 July 2009,"The movies have finally matured... just like the characters and the books should mature.... it's about time people realize that you can't expect random wizard duels, useless spell throwing etc.... the sixth installment of the series shows the dark times that have finally arrived, which was dreaded by almost all the wizarding community... also the students have matured physically and mentally and enter into the world of relationships, betrayal, heart-breaks etc... a very well made movie... better than most of the previous ones... the 1st, 2nd and the 4th ones sucked badly... rest all were great... for those complaining about lack of action, go watch transformers.. you won't be disappointed and please don't waste your time and money and then crib or complain about it... true, mature audiences and fans will understand the worth of the movie...",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
304,Boromir28,Harry Potter and the Halfwitted Director,3,21 July 2009,"OK...so we're reaching the final chapter of the franchise, and the inevitable confrontation between the forces of good and evil are ever fast approaching.The sixth installment of the books really set up all the obstacles that were to be overcome in the seventh as well as giving Harry the necessary tools to overcome them.This crucial element is almost completely omitted from the movie leaving at the end, Harry with almost no clue as how to defeat lord Voldemort. The adaptation and execution of this book to film is appallingly bad. As someone so correctly wrote in here it DOES feel like the director only read the cover and decided to make a movie based off that.I still wonder why David Yates was chosen for the last four films - his constant insertion of pointless action sequences, omitting of crucial information for the development of the last films as well as his prioritizing the least important aspects of the books to extents that they are downright disturbing to the plot, makes you wonder if he has the WB executives and JK Rowling under the imperious course.I simply think that it comes down to laziness, an attempt to set his own mark on the franchise or a combination of the two. I can see the predicament of having to bring one of the most loved book series to the screen, being true to it as well as doing what a director is supposed to do namely bringing his own vision to the screen. On one aspect it is obvious that he has not understood the task he has undertaken, is in the characters. Perticularly Emma Watson, Michael Gambon and Alan Rickman aren't given the room to find the Rowling version of Hermione, Dumbledore and Snape.To start with Watson: Hermione seems through most of the movie shrill and not at all as daring though scared as she is in the book. This was a problem for her even in Order of the Phoenix and it seems that Yates has a specific idea as to how Hermione should be that Watson can't really show her true potential as an actress. I feel she showed better acting in the first four movies before Yates was invented.Michael Gambon was never properly introduced to his character and his acting is considerably hindered by it. Rowling's Dumbledore is a man of incredible humor and softspokeness and above all, he has a very academic approach to the world around him, meaning that he does not get emotional at all but remains calm and collected. All through this movie he seems scared and unaware of the dangers lying ahead as well as totally oblivious to the real magic behind Horcruxes. This is just wrong: Dumbledore knows all there is to know except the real memory of Horace Slughorn, which he needs Harry's help to retrieve. It gives the impression in the film that Dumbledore is losing his touch and this is further illustrated by Hermione's statement that people feel Dumbledore is getting old. He is not getting old...he is dying from a terrible long lasting curse that eventually will kill him. But his mind is as sharp as ever.Now for Alan Rickman...one thing you can't blame the man is for stealing the show as he hasn't had much screen time in any of the movies. With the title of the movie being ""HP and the Halfblood Prince"" you would think that the Halfblood prince would get more screen time this time around. However, the execution of revealing Snape's identity is done as almost an afterthought and has basically no importance for the plot in the film. Like Draco Malfoy being under severe strain so is Snape, and it would have been good to see some emotion in this regard. It feels like, however, that Rickman has been told to keep the same facial expression throughout the movie, making his two pivotal scenes at the end where he kills Dumbledore and again when he confronts Harry flat and pointless. He was supposed to be really upset and close to vomiting as he is made to kill the only real father figure he has ever known. Then was he supposed to become almost insane when Harry calls him a coward, as he at this point is near a total mental breakdown. This does not happen and anyone who has seen Alan Rickman in other movies, Robin Hood and Die Hard knows just how insane he can act, therefore it was sad to see the direction Yates has chosen for the last movies. The bottom line of this review is that Yates completely missed the point of the book and he has set up as many obstacles for himself as Voldemort has for Harry. One must also (amidst the Yates bashing) ask the question of JK Rowlings involvement in this. Has she given the director and screenwriter carte blanche to do anything to her story or is she simply so fed up with Harry Potter that she no longer cares for her amazing body of work? I give three stars for Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint and Tom Felton.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
305,mvpdom,"""You can tell me all about that tosser Harry Potter""",7,24 May 2020,"This my second time watching through the Harry Potter movies. And upon rewatch this was a lot better than I remember.
The biggest flaw in most of the Harry Potter movies is that they are too long. I believe if they shaved off 30 minutes of most of the movies they would be better.
Like all the Harry Potter movies the 3 main cast members are compelling and there interactions with other characters such as Dumboldor and Snape.
As the movies go along they get darker, and less humorous, but the humor in the movie lands.
Specifically this movie starting with the ending sets up the two part final chapter very well.
Dumboldor's death is very tragic and very surprising the first time, not for me I either had it spoiled or was asleep.
The relationship between Hemonie and Ron is at its strongest in this movie. Draco starts down largest part of his arc, when before he was a constant side character with little change.
Ginny and Harry are not portrayed as a good couple, according to my brother not done justice to the books.
I appreciate learning more about Voldemort and building up his master plan for the nexts movie, though it may not be strongest.
Though the most memorable part is when 100s of gollums attack Harry as they crawl out of a lake, them Dumboldore shoots fire.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince

307,stealth4933,Did not live up to the hype,5,26 July 2009,"I walked into the movie theater for this movie expecting a very good movie for a lot of reasons. One was the hype, it was one of the most looked forward to movies of the year. Another reason was the book, which was good and also seemed to be perfect to be turned into a movie. However, I left the theater a very disappointed Harry Potter fan. This movie did not push the plot the way I would have liked it to. I do realize that, having read the books, I am naturally inclined to expect the movie to be the same, so I try to go into movies such as this with an open mind. However, this movie did things that differed from the book, and I felt the book did a better job with. The first and foremost thing was the romance between Ginny and Harry. This romance was pushed and forced into our faces more than it needed to. The spontaneity of the book was lost, and I really hated what the movie did. It made it seem like a wishy washy teen romance instead of a realistic teenager in love, like the book did. Another thing I disliked was how it portrayed Slughorn. In the book Slughorn was definitely a man with faults, but he was also an obviously talented wizard that deserved his spot as potion professor. The movie made his seem like a bumbling old fool who was ALWAYS on the verge of tears. The final thing I will address on this review are the private lessons between dumbledore and harry. I felt this movie could have definitely compacted the pointless romances in order to put more attention on the relationship that is developed here. This relationship and the facts learned in their time together are very important in the next movie, and they either skidded over or completely left out huge parts of it. So this movie was anticlimactic and overdone. I would recommend Harry Potter fans to see it, but not to expect much out of it.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
308,tomdude0,The best Potter movie so far,10,7 August 2009,"I loved this movie. The opening sequence was explosive, especially in IMAX 3D, the storyline was dark (very), Draco Malfoy was even more evil, the acting was superb, the special effects were amazing--in other words, everything a Potter fan could hope for.After seeing this, I think that the PG rating was a bit too generous. The movie is very dark overall with fire, blood, death, etc. However, that just makes it even better. The opening sequence was genius because it gives the viewer an overall idea of how strong the dark forces are becoming, but the absence of Voldemort throughout the film sort of diminishes this effect. Also, the family that we love to hate, the Dursleys, are nowhere to be found. Other than that, the movie was fabulous.Even though the movie was great, it wasn't that much like the book. The beginning was changed, much of the middle was cut out, and the ending was changed as well. So if you expect a carbon copy of the book, you'll be disappointed. But the film still captures the overall plot of the book.The most powerful part of the film was the ending, which will leave you either sobbing or with your mouth hanging open in disbelief. If you read Entertainment Weekly's Summer Movie Preview issue, you will know what happens. (Unless you are not familiar with the dialect of the actor who plays Hagrid.) This was better than all of the other Potter movies. It's going to be extremely difficult to top this in the two-part Deathly Hallows.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
309,samuellickiss,Not for novel fans,5,18 July 2009,"I get the impression that the people who gave this film good ratings aren't fans of the books...and that the converse is true also. I come into the second category.Let me start off with the positives.The cinematography was brilliant. The special effects that they included (and they are somewhat limited in this film compared to others) are very well done. But maybe I shouldn't be hugely impressed, it is fairly standard now.The score was fantastic, but perhaps it didn't have quite the same 'epicness' to it that others did.The acting was very well done, the actors each did their best with the script they were given. Felton, Grint and Rickman I think deserve special applause.I get the impression that Yates was being lazy...leaving out the battle scene at the end...maybe it was too much effort? After all, he is guaranteed it to be a high grossing film, why spend more money on complicated scenes? It was a funny film and I did laugh, but it wasn't hysterical. The humour in it is fairly standard, nothing new. Unfortunately I think the humour did deviate from the darkness that the novels conjured up. Did I really get the impression that anything serious was going on? Not really, yeah sure, the dementors make an impression at the beginning, after that it is just teenage angst until the end when they make a half-hearted attempt at explaining the actual problem Harry has to face...and it's a pretty epic task! It was always going to deviate from the books, I accept that...but there is a limit. What they have included is very good, unfortunately they did leave out some fairly crucial stuff.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
310,tina-175,Boring!!!! And nothing like the book!!,1,8 August 2009,"I suppose most of my friends over here have said it already: this film has NOTHING to do with the book so I won't elaborate on that. What I will say is, it is BORING... in fact it has no point and the few points it makes, can be done in a matter of an hour. The film is over two hours long and it's filled with nothing but stupid jokes and very little actual facts. It also leaves a lot of questions that could only be explained if you have read the book and you know i.e. who is who and how they got together. Otherwise you are clueless and it feels like a bunch of scenes thrown together for ... no reason at all. The worst of all the films for sure... :(",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
311,Rafacus,Love is in the air at Hogwartz,8,15 July 2009,"With heavy emphasis on attractions to the opposite sex and the jealousy that comes with it, Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince is a transitional tale of both the children's growth and the breaking of light for darkness. The once lively halls of Hogwartz, lined with young children practicing their magicks and playing games with one other has been swapped for dark foreboding paths, barren classrooms and unnaturally looming darkness. The quirky professors of the lighter films, having scattered and banished since The Order of The Phoenix are no longer here to entertain us with their eccentric personas, goofy spectacles and comedic spells. No, this is a very different Hogwartz and Dumbledore's relationship with Harry Potter is more the focus than the raging hormones of he and his friends.Emma Watson, who has had as many haters as supporters of her acting in the past will no doubt shut these critics up by her performance in this one. For the first time we are given a convincing range of emotions by her as she cries when her love interest is with another and smiles warmly and at peace when he is finally hers (convincingly). You cannot help but feel sorry for her during certain times when her lineage is questioned and when the loneliness settles in. Some of the more memorable scenes for me were between her and Daniel Radcliffe in their strange friendship that seems more brother and sister than classmates. The entire Weasley clan is back providing laughs, cringes and at times sighs. This not being limited to the bumbling blunders of Ron who has somehow grown into quite the ladies man at the school.Though beyond the teens and their love stories and my wont for a Harry and Luna Lovegood romance, the main theme is always obvious and that is the choice of good versus evil. Nothing is as it seems and a cruel plot is hatched that forces Dumbledore to use Harry as a sort of spy to uncover a hidden secret. The comical Professor Horace Slughorn (Jim Broadbent) is introduced and replaces the spirit of the teachers we have grown accustomed to ""experiencing"" in the former films. He is a pleasure to watch as his every word is entertaining and adds a bit of light humor to an otherwise gloomy film. The sexual tension amongst the students, and the detective work of Harry takes up two thirds of the movie but by the time you hit the last third the dark tone becomes pitch black. By the time you make it to the last 30 minutes, you will experience a heavy tragedy and an explanation behind the title that is The Halfblood Prince.Out of the entire series, this one shines and falls well in line with the rest. To compare it with another movie I would choose The Empire Strikes Back in terms of the dark mood, the winning hand of evil and the feeling of ""to be continued"" that occurs when the credits roll. With beautiful direction, relevant cinematography and outstanding special effects, I find it hard to complain about anything. Outside of the alienation of a new viewer who may choose this to be their first movie in the Harry Potter series, the story and acting is one of the better in the 7 films to date.www.SpicyMovieDogs.com",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
312,jkysharma,Once again Harry,7,4 July 2010,"A common rant one is likely to hear about the Harry Potter films is that 'they are not quite upto the books'. The simplest of notions, understandable but a touch absurd really. When a view of this sort is expressed, it is essentially a feeling of disappointment at not being able to connect with the movie on the same level as the book. Absurd in that these are two utterly different forms of artistic expression. I needn't go into the differences, they are numerous - from the time period in which they are savoured to the nature of the sensory experience. If they are so different in the first place, why are they spoken of in the same breadth ? Nobody ever says of a song and a book that have the same roots that one isn't as good as the other. I think it's got something to do with the fact that cinema, for the major part, has been treated as a derivative form in that it needs a source material. In other words, all cinema is essentially an adaptation. We've loved stories for millennia and when the motion picture arrived, the realization was that this was a great medium for telling a story. Only it's not just that. It imparts sensory detail that isn't merely addenda but is capable of standing on its own.The Harry Potter novels add to the problematic nature of adaptations in that they themselves are 500 - 700 page screenplays. This makes it impossible to translate every event, conversation or stunt onto the big screen simply because there is a time constraint. This is where the complaints set in - this event was totally scrapped, this character had this great dialogue that ... and so on. If this reads like an exceptionally long introduction to a review (or too much beating around the bush !), let me get to the point. I've read the septet and thankfully, retain only the skeleton of the story and none of the deluge of detail. When it comes to the Potter films, I don't look for precision in narrative content or accurate translation of detail. If the sensory experience is satisfying, I'm happy with the film.The Half-Blood Prince scores with ease in this regard (Bruno Delbonnel, John Williams, Nicholas Hooper). Awash with grey, the visuals take us into a world low on happiness. The Quidditch scenes are the lone bright spot in a mist-ridden film. There are some brilliantly visualized sequences like the one with the Inferi, the duel between Malfoy and Potter, and the ambush at The Burrow. David Yates, who directed the fifth installment, is at the helm here too and clearly strong at fleshing out characters. Even with the kind of visual effects on display here, a near perfect cast becomes the film's strong suite. If any claims of cinematic success (BO receipts aside) have to be made for this franchise then they owe part of it to the casting. In keeping with the norm of using highly reliable actors, Jim Broadbent (as Professor Slughorn) joins the cherished ensemble. Yates gets the most out of Helena Bonham Carter (as a crazed and rapacious Bellatrix Lestrange) . It is probably safe to say by now that Alan Rickman knows Snape. One grievance from Goblet of Fire was Michael Gambon's over-zealous Dumbledore. Here he hits the right notes.Dan Radcliffe seems at ease with the portrayal and didn't come across as tight-fisted or wooden. Emma Watson has me in two minds - she adds to the movie experience (getting prettier still) but her teenage Hermione has, of late, been tailored to her box-office appeal. Rupert Grint nails Ron again. Either way, the trio are in top form when it comes to the comedies and trifles that result from affairs of the heart. As a consequence, Half-Blood Prince has a recognizable hilarity drive. All in all, Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince is easily the best acted film of the franchise and only marginally loses out to Prisoner of Azkaban for best of the lot.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
313,jacobcichy,A filler movie yet still entertaining,7,27 November 2020,"Good movie but its mostly a filler, setting up for the final two. The scenes are very emotional though and cant help but bring a tear to your eye.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
314,PizzicatoFishCrouch,Exciting and Surprisingly Dark Stuff.,8,15 July 2009,"16-year-old Harry Potter is now in Sixth form at Hogwarts. However, with Voldemort still at large, now with a growing entourage of Death Eaters out to get him, he could be forgiven for putting academics at the back of his mind. Danger is brewing aplenty, including a very ominous meeting occurring between Narcissa Malfoy, Draco's mother, and the ever-ambiguous Professor Snape. What's more, the teenagers Harry, Ron, Hermione and Ron's sister Ginny struggle with their feelings for each other, causing a complicated mess of emotions. Dark times, indeed.As with all five of its predecessors, Harry Potter VI is suitably pretty to look at, a masterclass in the art of gliding cinematography. Filmed in ominous navy hues, it lacks the strokes of life that the earlier films' bright colours evoked, though, with such grim themes as death, murder, power and hidden secrets, it seems about fair, and makes me wonder in what colours the final installment will be painted. Hand-held camera is employed in the odd scene and this gives the film a grainier edge, which is done well. At times, one wonders if David Yates fancies himself a bit of a Terrence Malick with the odd lingering shot too many, and on the whole, it contributes the the visual flair of the film, which is surprisingly sensual at times, yet harshly austere at others. One cannot fault the CGI, however, which intricately creates some of Rowling's best ideas - the dreams sequences are atmospheric and chilling, Weasley's Wizarding Weezes looked like a place that every child wants to go to. Sound also plays a big role in Harry Potter VI; in a few crucial scenes it is employed to create a menacing presence and the claustrophobic, nauseous sound effects, coupled with the images, do just that.The cinematography, however, is not the only reason I derived pleasure from looking at this film. On a superficial level, there are two other rather nice things to look at in Half-Blood Prince, and I do believe their names are Tom Felton and Rupert bunging Grint. Rupert Grint gives yet another stellar comedic turn; without giving too much away, a scene where he consumes something intended for Harry and bears the consequences is one of the funniest things you'll see in the cinema all year, and it is Rupert's impeccable timing that gives it such warm humour. On the other end of the spectrum stands Tom Felton. Rather, stands Tom Felton in a black suit, hair gelled back, an expression on his face that is both terrifying and terrified. In Half-Blood Prince the novel, I felt real pathos for Draco, no matter how nasty a person he was, and thankfully this has translated onto screen. Felton gives a terrific performance, in one vital showdown we see the side of him that has hidden behind the bullying demeanor for so long.Sadly, the rest of the cast are not so talented. Emma Watson, after many years, still has no clue how to act. It's very sad because in the books, I absolutely adore Hermione, and in the sixth book I found her loveliest, both caring and perceptive to Harry's feelings for Ginny as well as vulnerable in her own love for Ron, as well as completely oblivious to just how amazing she was, which of course made her even lovelier in my eyes. Emma Watson conveys absolutely zero of this, and instead spent the entire film giving her eyebrows free rein to dance. Emma Watson will be pleased to hear that another actress has surpassed her poorness in acting. Whereas Watson overacts to the point of incredulity, Bonnie Wright is so dull that she could put out a fire just by looking at it. Her lack of chemistry with Radcliffe is absolutely embarrassing. Daniel Radcliffe himself seems to be battling against the waxwork model of himself at Taussads for the accolade of being most wooden actor. There are some scenes in this film which require a level of emotional maturity and empathy, and Radcliffe just reverts to what can only be reading the lines off the autocue. Nice.Thankfully, in a world where badness is balanced out by good, there are some truly talented performances in Half-Blood Prince. Everything Miss Evanna Lynch touches is magic, her Irish accents only contributes to her sense of whimsical charm, and I thought it inspired for the filmmakers to kit her out in a lion costume pre-Quidditch game; she looked adorable. You can tell Helena Bonham Carter is having a whale of a time as Bellatrix, as she reeks havoc all round and generally brings the house down, and Jim Broadbent captures Professor Slughorn very well. The screenplay is a bit duff, the film feels too episodic and disjointed and as ever, too much of the novel has been omitted. However, the episodic nature is not totally bad; in a few scenes, we see Draco lingering around the sidelines menacingly, which is a nice little touch. The humour, when it comes, is welcome - Rupert Grint the court jester, and Jessie Cave, as Lavender Brown, his clingy girlfriend, is utterly hilarious. There are also moments which genuinely scared me. Therefore, I find myself saying what I always say when another Harry Potter movie comes out: I was entertained no end, I laughed and giggled, I fancied Rupert Grint and despised Daniel Radcliffe and Emma Watson. When all is said and done, however, it sits my favourite film of 2009 so far.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
315,Bunty-at-IMDB,"Beautiful, Funny, Dramatic and Dark... a complete film",10,24 July 2009,"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince is the sixth film in the Harry Potter series. It was delayed for almost eight months, and finally it is out.I'm writing this review in points. First of all let us see what are bad points -1. Not enough emphasis on the potions book Unfortunately this film does not put any emphasis on the potions book. There are only a few instances where potion book is present. 2. No explanation of 'Half-Blood Prince' and HORCRUXES The film's title is Half-Blood Prince. When we come to know that Snape is the Half-Blood Prince, it is not explained why he is called Half-Blood Prince. There is also no mention of what things are chosen as HORCRUXES, neither the film puts any focus on them until the climax. It feels all of a sudden when Dumbledore and Harry go to hunt the HORCRUX.Now, the following things are not really very bad ones, but they could have been better.3. Addition of the Burrow Attack Several extra scenes were added in this film. Some of them, in fact only the millennium bridge attack in the start made sense. The attack on Burrow was pointless, random and without any result.4. Focus on Romance However, it is not exactly a bad thing, as there is a lot of romance in the film, but sometimes it does feels that romance is a bit dragged, mostly in the middle of the film. Now the good points1. Flawless acting by all the actors This film really is a great step up from the previous film, the Order of the Phoenix. And I will certainly say all the actors, ranging from new member of the cast, Jim Broadbent (as Horace Slughorn, perfect) to Alan Rickman (as a bad guy he rocks) and Maggie Smith {always great to see her on screen) to Helena Bonham Carter (wicked!), have done near perfect job of portraying their respective characters. But I have to say Michael Gambon stole the show. He was just a delight throughout the film. Moreover, I'm sure all the people who always complained about his portrayal of Dumbledore will shut their mouths up. Young adult actors did also a great job. Daniel Radcliffe, did a decent job of accompanying him, and his performance of Harry Potter was, as usual, very good. But most improved was Emma Watson. She's now much more calmer, much better as Hermione. Rupert Grint, yet again lived up to expectations with his great portrayal of Ron. Jess Cave, who plays Lavender Brown, was amazing as a crazy and obsessed girlfriend of Ron. Evanna as Luna Lovegood, was great as expected. All the others were fine, in their respective characters.2. Beautiful Cinematography Can I say this film will win an Oscar? Certainly, this film is one of the finest cinematographic achievements of this year. Bruno Delbonnel, the man behind the camera, did an amazing job. His choice of color washes, steady camera movements, and unusual camera angles were just fantastic. Perfect!3. Great sets, music and visual effects The next thing which was near perfect in this film were sets - just great and breathtaking. Stuart Craig made Hogwarts to look much more different as compared to other Harry Potter films. The Room of Requirement's make-over was simply beautiful. The sets used for Orphange, Cave, Astronomy Tower were not only true to the book, but also very dark and great piece of art. Nicholas Hooper, did a bit different this time. However, the music lacked some themes, but I must say the music blended perfectly, and some themes (for instance, Harry and Hermione and In Noctem) were just great to listen. There was not much scope of VFX this time, but they did a fantastic job, especially with the Inferi and the Cave scene.4. Small Details However, I won't say the film was completely true to the book, but there were several small details that fans will love. Slughorn's Hourglass, writings in the Potion's book, Tom Riddle's treasure book and bunch of other details were very good. Things like Marauder's Map and Tom Riddle's dairy also made a come back. It felt very nice while watching this film due to all this stuff.5. Atmosphere during climax Again, I don't know whether to praise Yates or not, but I just loved the atmosphere created during the climax. It was eerie, dark and just fantastic. Also, the aftermath of Dumbledore's death was very touching and sad. The wand tribute given by all the students to Dumbledore gave me tears. Final words- Half-Blood Prince is certainly not a film which sounds complete noise - BOOM, BANG, and DASSHH! (like Transformers). But it is beautifully crafted as a film, and is a decent adaptation of the book. Some fans, as usual, will be complaining about the changes made by the film makers, and some of them will be disappointed, but the point is as a film it works. And it works so good that it touches your heart.10/10 (One point extra for stunning cinematography)",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
316,bmrao1980,Worst of the lot. Took all the fizz out of the book and served colored sugar water,3,27 March 2011,"I don't understand! What happened to the people who brought us those excellent first four adaptations (I was disappointed with the fifth one too but not as much as this one)!? Did they get themselves a lobotomy or something!? Perhaps the most darkest and excellently put together books of the Harry Potter series, turns out as a movie that is essentially about teenage hormones and unexpected laughs! What happened to all the key plot points that bind together to give us the excellent ending of the seventh series? Where is all the drama, the urgency and the action of the book? Where is the epic showdown within Hogwarts that gets Bill injured? Where is Bill, for that matter!? All the major plot points that add up in the seventh book and result in such an awesome closure of the series are omitted! It is completely mind boggling that so much information can be omitted when adapting the book. I think the filmmakers got complacent and lazy, right from the fifth installment onwards, but watching the level they have stooped to for this one, I am really not that enthusiastic about the seventh and eight movies at all.Heck, even what was included in the movie was so botched up! The best example is how Harry convinces Slughorn to divulge the secret memory about Tom Riddle. In the book, the interaction in Hagrid's cabin was so excellently done and the movie just totally made it a mechanical necessity. Same with how Harry convinces Slughorn to accept the position at Hogwarts. Same with the whole interaction between Harry and Ginny, as well as the final interaction between Harry, Ron and Hermoine. In the book, they promise to stand by him through thick and thin and in the movie we have Hermoine basically telling Harry that he needs them! I felt like smashing something when that scene was shown, to be honest! And, where on Earth was Dumbledore's funeral!? Instead of making such a crappy adaptation to such a beautiful book, I would rather they had left it out completely! All the main points are omitted anyway!",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince

When I watched this in the theater & rewatched it on DVD, I found it quite boring. It has its brief moments of fun or heartbreak but it's very boring to sit through this whole movie. I'd recommend watching YouTube clips of this movie rather than sitting through all the boring parts of the movie. Although it follows the book (which is also boring) it still doesn't mean it's a good movie. 4/10 is my rating for some brief entertaining moments that gets outweighed by boredom throughout.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
318,barryweir,A good piece of cinema,7,21 July 2009,"A Harry Potter film is never going to win Oscars. But that is not to say Rowling's material cannot be adapted into satisfying cinema. In my opinion that is what happened here.I have lead a busy life in recent years and Half-Blood Prince was the first book in the series that I had not read before seeing the movie. As such I came to the movie with a fresh opinion, and great anticipation for the first of the Potter stories that I didn't know the plot for.Now, die hard fans may be crying hell over the changes from the book to the film, but frankly what I am reading on here reminds me of Star Wars fan boys complaining about whether or not Han shot first. What many fans don't realise is that simply because a book is a rip-roaring roller-coaster of a tome, it doesn't mean that it will translate well onto the screen. Take the Da Vinci Code. A terribly cheesy, but fun book to read that is unquestionably a page turner. Once a movie it turned into a bit of stinker, despite its faithfulness to Brown's original book.From what I understand from the changes between book and film, much of what is left is exposition, such as Tom Riddle flashbacks. As it is, watching the film the first hour is very ""talky"" and makes for a different type of Potter film from the others. I feel that had the movie included all of the scenes from the book note only would it have been nearly 4 hours long but it would have become, frankly, a little boring after a while. In contrast what we had was a well paced, dark and adequately emotional build up to Deathly Hallows.....and I left the cinema eagerly looking forward to the final installments, and even frustrated that I have to wait until 2011 for the finale. Rowling succeeded in writing a good book when she sat down to prepare Half-Blood Prince, but Yates hasn't brought us a good book on screen. He's brought us a good movie, and that has to be his only task as a movie director.I very much enjoyed this movie and, if anything, it has prompted me to go and catch up with the books.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
319,tha_mongoose,The Harry Potter soap opera,5,17 July 2009,"Considering only actual readers of the Harry Potter series would ever have a chance of understanding most of what takes place in this film, and focusing one's attention on said readers, the film really only repeats what recent installments of this franchise have been doing to boot: the selection of about one hundredth of the story and the then almost robotic depiction of said portion in a 2 hour and a half long session.Yes, you get an in-depth look at all the romances taking place in Harry Potter and the Half-blood Prince, and these seem to be the epicenter of the film. What about the story of Lord Voldemort, his youth: the access the reader got to his family/childhood and clear growing thirst for power by any means necessary through Dumbledore's memory gatherings is secondary in the movie, whereas it was the focus of the novel.Yes, there are the usual lush scenarios keen to the eye; the beauty surrounding Hogwarts and Hogsmeade, as well as the cosiness surrounding Diagon Alley and the scary quality of its Knockturn counterpart. These, however, are old news: we have seen them five times already before this film. Harry Potter and the Half-blood Prince should be about more than the usual suspects, it's plot surrounds Harry (together with Dumbledore)'s unveiling of deep material central to the person of Tom Riddle (Lord Voldemort). Some epic memories are not shown in the film. This is a pity. One refers to that which takes place in the house of Voldemort's mother, or that which shows Voldemort at a later stage attempting to return to Hogwarts, this time as professor. A whole host of such defining memories are left in the cupboard, and what is chosen is perhaps an overemphasis on Lavender Brown's ""Ronron"" obsession and such trivial details. The book was clearly stripped of it's essence, and toned down for PG rating and consequent higher revenues. The end result catches the attention and love of young teens and children looking for a Harry Potter soap opera, but leaves the slightly older readers displeased.Even the better actors in the cast, such as Alan Rickman (Severus Snape), Jim Broadbent (Horace Slughorn), Michael Gambon (Albus Dumbledore), et alii get few chances to give the viewer any sort of clear character portrayal, because they are not given that opportunity. For example the complex inner workings of Snape's mind are left to be guessed throughout the movie. One is left uncertain whether he actually has remorse as he proceeds with his fatal task or not. The film substitutes character development and in-depth plot treatment for a focus on the silly meanderings of teenage love.Broadbent manages to deliver Slughorn's cowardly persona to it's very best. Him and the (too few) representations of the young Voldemort are perhaps the crowning achievements of the film. Not only does the young Tom Riddle certainly show mental instability, and a passion for the dark, Draco Malfoy was also a pleasant surprise. We certainly get to see (as the film allows it here) his struggle with what is certainly a daunting mission. What remains are the circus-show-like appearances of Helena Bonham-Carter and her crew of clowns, who do little more than pervert what was this viewer's idea of a seriously scary set of characters - the Death Eaters.A robotic portrayal indeed. Things happen and their meanings are left unexplained. Occurrences take on an automaton-like quality that deprives the viewer inexperienced in the Harry Potter world of any sort of proper understanding of events. This alienation of the average Joe uninterested in reading Rowling's masterpiece and inability to genuinely, honestly make a concerted effort to select the most important aspects of the story and not the popcorn-friendly ones thus being unsatisfying to the die-hard fan make the film a failure in this viewer's opinion. One would have thought with the time we waited for this film to come out that things would have had a less rushed look about them. Sadly this is not the case. It will certainly gross in profits, but it won't really satisfy readers or non-readers alike.5/10.

321,super16,Recommended,8,20 July 2009,"I like to read reviews of certain movies after the come out; this being one of them, as I read the first two or three pages of reviews on here and on other websites, it's striking at how many people dislike the movie (even though they did watch -- unlike some people who will merely give a move a low grade or even negative comments -- without actually watching the movie, but just to bring down it's overall score). The actual critics are generally very positive about this movie, saying nice things about. So are many on here, myself included (although my rating is actually closet to 8.5 than 9 but not low enough to just be an 8).Several folks on here have already commented -- and in great detail -- on what I think were the key things that work well in the film - the pacing was excellent, the best of all films to date, the adaptation was also one of the better ones, the cinematography, effects and music were superior to genuinely excellent, the adult performances were, as always, uniformly superb and even the three young leads were clearly maturing well as actors, particularly Rupert Grint as a comic actor. So I am going to comment a bit on my fellow IMDb reviewers: relax. Enjoy the films.Yes, there are things I see as missing; I think, in particular, whom the death eaters captured at the start of the film should at least been mentioned in passing and Lupin could have described a certain death eater as being his ""kindred"" of a sort, but some of the other complaints really are, as someone indicated, nit-picking. They are also choices we may not understand (Dobby/Kreacher) until we see Deathly Hollow one and two. I read Order of the Phoenix again, before I saw the last film but did not read the book to this film again, but will do so likely before I see the Imax release in about 10 days, and I suspect that this has something to do with the enjoyment of the movie more.I have read books I did not like as movies; that is the nature of the beast. They are different art forms. When producers make the choice of say simply filming a play, it can be very weak. It's not how the original work was meant to be; likewise, if JKR can be happy with the movies, I think some of her fans should accept them for what they are and enjoy them, or simply stick to the books and stop watching something that they are NEVER going to find acceptable.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
322,thefinisher_23,The least of the series,5,16 July 2009,"I haven't read much of this series. I have seen all the films and they have made me a casual fan. Upon glimpsing the PG rating for entry #6, I approached with caution. Isn't the series supposed to dive headlong into more perilous territory with Voldemort's return? This film refuses, and what we get in a stellar looking film with very little in the way of direction.We hop from serious goings-on in the muggle world and the wizarding world, right into teenage hormones and hesitantance, then back again to ending that seems only to be executed because the hour was getting late. The problem with the Ron/Hermoine and Harry/Ginny love stories isn't that they are in the film but rather they aren't genuine. When Harry and Ginny finally do act on it its far to short and cheesy, mildly laughable, very predictable then farmed for a crappy joke a few seconds later. Ron and Hermoine's interest seem to only be in the film because they are in the novel. Neither really elaborates on their attraction and I can't anticipate it blossoming given the way it's presented in this title. There is far more attempted humor in this pic than its' predecessors. Some of it is funny but that isn't the true reason anyone in the audience is here (see: Transformers II).The acting is stellar however. Rupert Grint seems to have a true future in any genre he wants. He embraces every line he has here. The addition of Jim Broadbent as Horace Slughorn is ingenious. He portrays need, cleverness, curiosity, and most of all shame in such a way that few can. Series regulars Alan Rickman (Snape), Michael Gambon (Dumbledore), and Maggie Smith (McCongall), all have upped the ante giving us more desperate and struggling characters. Kudos as well to Draco Malfoy who's performance is as heartbreaking as it is sinister. The whole cast tries to tailor to the script but there's only so much can be done with so little.So as a non-die-hard but certainly a follower I was disappointed. This isn't a bad film mind you but a sadly misguided one. I can understand the need to lighten the mood after the tragic and sometimes to solemn 5th film but you can't deny what is on the horizon for the Potter gang. Sadly this film tries to.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
323,h-rabbit,Yet Another Great Harry Potter Film,9,21 July 2009,"David Yates, in my opinion, is Harry Potter's best director, because his movies in this series are dark, more serious, yet still contain a bit of laughter and humour. I think this was quite a nice film to watch, very effective lighting and graphics, a script that was light and enjoyable, and frentic tension near the end.But I still think it has a few flaws. The beginning of this movie was slightly rushed, and people who have not yet read the novel may not understand it so well, but the rest of the movie flowed on quite well and those 2 and a half hours mostly flew by without me even registering it. There are also a few scenes, particularly at the end, that I would've liked, though.If you are looking forward to a great film to amuse yourself with, watch this one, for it is one of 2009's best summer blockbusters.And, I know people can complain about why a kid's film has become this dark, but you can't blame Mr. Yates. Because if hardcore Harry Potter fans started off watching The Sorcerer's Stone, they'd be much older by now to watch something that bright.By HowlingRabbit334",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
324,dgranger,A reasonably faith adaptation Blockbuster that meets expectations. There is a good chance Mr. Harry will meet Mr. Oscar.,10,15 July 2009,"This has got to be one of the best in the series. David Yates does an unbelievably great job of bringing this story to the silver screen. And he brings with a faithfulness to the book plus including Ron's story of overcoming self doubt in the Quidditch match that was left out of Harry Potter and The Order of the Phoenix. In fact, Quidditch match in the light snow shower is one of the better ones in the series. Director David Yates gives us a darker more realistic world of Hogwarts while filming it in a way we have not seen the castle before. The cinematography is gorgeous in this film. But the best part is the script. Knowles and Yates distills the story down to it's major plot points and throws out all that was unnecessary in the book. He hits every single major plot point in the story. He doesn't miss a beat. What he couldn't film or changed for dramatic purposes, he replaced with thoroughly satisfying substitutions that carried the same message in the book. Like for instance, instead of telling us that Deatheaters are attacking Muggles and kidnapping people, he shows it to us. He takes us on an emotional roller coaster ride to an ending that packs a stunning emotional punch. As the wands rise to defeat the darkness with light. He also packs a couple of good scares in the cave scene as a monster drags Harry into the water. My only problem with the story is that it drags a little in small parts, It doesn't fully explain the meaning of the term ""Half Blood Prince"" and doesn't properly set up the love potion poisoned box of chocolates intended for Harry that Ron eats. But truly, the story doesn't slow down as much as the trolls have been claiming. So don't listen to them. It fairly and evenly well paced.The acting is excellent. particularly Broadbent and Felton. You literally feel sorry for these two as they struggle with their consciences.

325,urbanlegend23,"Not the most action-packed of the films, but a worthy adaptation nonetheless.",8,2 August 2009,"As it happens every time a new ""Harry Potter"" film is released, there was a giant amount of hype surrounding ""Half-Blood Prince"". Add to the fact that it's obviously going to be popular due to the Potter phenomena that's swept the world over the last 10-12 years or so, the movie was met with glowing reviews - many indicating it was the best film in the saga yet.This I personally disagree with. ""Half-Blood Prince"" was never my favorite of the books - it was still very good - and the film definitely isn't my favorite of the movies thus far. It lacks the constant excitement of ""Goblet"" and anyone who was let down by the Department of Mysteries sequence in ""Phoenix"" will be gob-smacked by the fact that the entire Death Eaters vs. Hogwarts students/teachers battle that took place at the end of the sixth film is nowhere to be seen in ""Half-Blood Prince"". One of my biggest beefs with the film personally. Apparently Yates didn't want it to be too similar to the end of the final film, this isn't a good enough excuse for me. It was one of the most entertaining sequences in the book and should've been in the film. It felt a little too casual how Snape just killed Dumbledore and strolled off on his way. Thankfully the actual scene with Dumbledore getting killed was very effective, as is the touching memorial his students display around his body after the murder.For most of my friends and a lot other audiences, the film simply doesn't feel like ""enough"" is happening per se. The film goes along at a fairly slow pace which will put a lot of viewers off. Probably because Yates, director, focuses his energies more on the analysis of Harry, Ron and Hermione's teen angst than the action/epic side of Potter. Not such a bad thing for me as a viewer, because this is portrayed better than it has been in any of the other films. The dialog is sharp and witty, and the young actors are stepping up to their roles more. Watson, always strong, is really developing into a great young actress. Radcliffe too is at his best as Harry and he too has developed a lot as a performer since ""Philosopher's Stone"".Jim Broadbent is a welcome addition as Professor Slughorn and is very humorous and quirky here. He makes the character more intriguing than he was in the books and that is true credit to his performance, considering how detailed Rowling's writing is.I'd like to give special credit to the whole seaside/cave sequence with Harry and Dumbledore finding the first Horcrux (or do they?), this is the most well-realized section of the film. The movie really rockets alive during this sequence that was always the best part of the novel as well. It's displayed in such a perfect way that was personally *exactly* how I had imagined it in the books. The visuals in the sequence were truly spectacular and it was emotionally effective as well (containing one of Gambon's most outstanding scenes in the franchise).Overall, a strong entry into the Potter canon, but far from the best as a lot of the reviews are indicating. Perhaps one should stray from reviews and not read them before seeing movies they're anticipating so as to not be letdown, but it's hard for any movie-goer to do. Nonetheless, the movie is good and succeeds in leaving viewers on the edge of their seats for next year and the first part of the final Potter installment.8/10",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
326,laraemeadows,Harry Potter and the Half Ass Film,6,14 July 2009,"Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince is the sixth movie in Harry Potter film series. Too dependent on previous films or expecting the audience to have read the books, Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince fails to develop into a complete movie.Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) is whisked away by his professor and fellow wizard Dumbledore (Michael Gambon )to meet with Horace Slughorn (Jim Broadbent) to encourage him to return to his professorship at Hogwarts School. Harry and Dumbledore continue to attempt to find a way to defeat Lord Voldemort and prevent him from returning to the living world. Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint) and Hermione Granger (Emma Watson) dance around their feelings for each other and engage in typical teenage romance melodrama. Draco Malfoy (Tom Felton) sneaks around, waving his wand at bookcases in dark storage rooms, spiraling down an emotional whirlpool.As an added bonus for the audience, the director and writers have left bonus loose ends for the audience to enjoy. The extraneous footage includes destroying mystical stuff, a girl who has a crush on Harry, some broom related sporting events, potions, and curses. The cinematic loose ends fray long enough to braid and be sold as rope to climbers heading off for K2.Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince reminds me of leftover casserole. Leftover casserole is made by taking the remnants of a week's worth of food, layering it in a casserole dish and hoping it tastes good enough that your family won't run out on you. If you sprinkle it with parmesan cheese, it can look delicious, but it almost always tastes like week old, reheated donkey-butt stew. Director David Yates and writer Steve Kloves take a bit of left over the Sorcerer's Stone, covers it in Order of the Phoenix, slathers on Chamber of Secrets, dumps in Goblet of Fire and sprinkles Order of the Phoenix, bakes it with parmesan on top (the special effects) and thinks we will eat it.It shows a total lack of cinematic integrity to assign the audience required reading or mandatory viewing in order to understand anything that is taking place on screen. It is perfectly rational to expect a first time Harry Potter viewer won't get every mention but they shouldn't be completely lost. It is not too much to ask for a bit of recap, artfully worked into the story so new viewers can understand what is going on. It irritates me to no end that David Yates, and the production staff think we should pay full price for a half a movie. In one of the more ""intense"" scenes in Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince, Dumbledore says, ""Once again I must ask too much of you, Harry"" but I think it's the writer and director who have asked too much of the audience by hiding the casserole behind a smoke screen - literally.Smoke comes out of the water, goes into the water, is outdoors, is indoors, and seems to follow Harry and his compadres, regardless of their travels. Harry would be the alpha caveman of any cave based solely on his ability to attract fire to himself. Based solely on the beauty of the smoke, Harry Potter is a stunning movie.All of the effects in Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince shimmer almost brightly enough to make one blind to the disparities in the plot. Well lit sets are set against green-screen created backgrounds that seem to flow naturally into each other. While some of the scenes don't work as well as others, they all work well enough to suspend disbelief and make wizardry riveting.Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince has no beginning, nor an end; it is only a middle. With nothing to tell the audience what has happened up until now and an unraveling carpet for an ending, it fails to offer the audience a reason to sit through the film. It should be renamed to Harry Potter and a Half.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
327,barbara-364,A visual treat,9,11 August 2009,"I thought Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince was a real treat to watch. I loved the sets, the costumes, the props and particularly the way it was filmed. Visually it was beautiful, lovely to watch. I particularly liked the way the phials of memories in Dumbledore's study were lit up and stored in an elaborate Victorian font cover. I also enjoyed all the railway shots. It was quite long, but it seemed to go quickly. It was entertaining and amusing as well. Malfoy is getting more human and not just the enemy of Harry, it gives the whole thing a little more depth. Bellatrix is delightfully Gothic and over the top and Snape is getting enigmatic and now Harry, Ron and Hermione are poised for a quest.... I look forward to the next one and hope it lives up to the standard of this one.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
328,Xillx,"They tried to do better than the previous ones, but yet still failed miserably",6,18 July 2009,"The Book: Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince is the best and biggest book of them all. The drama in the story has had me totally convinced that J.K. Rolling was quite a masterful writer, which understood all the different layers and depth of the English language.The Movie: The movie is basically various sections of the book put together in all hope it would somehow make sense. While the directors clearly made an effort to fix the mess they were going to release last year with a few ""artistic"" scenes, all of those fit a very mainstream frame. Meaning that the imagination with which the the book has been transposed to movie is fairly limited artistically. For example, the music is so cheesy; it's all in C major and A minor, barely any sharps or flat. Where are the dissonances dude?!See, if you do not have the basic required intelligence to make a good movie and rely on patchwork and FX instead, then perhaps you should have left the job to people who actually have some artistic vision.Here we have one of the greatest story ever told in such a pathetic way that it's a miracle if people watching this still get a glimpse of the grandeur of J.K Rolling imagination.The moral of this film is: no matter how hard you try: if you have no talent at movie making, try doing something else. I cant believe they worked so hard for such a failure. Sadly, most of the failures are due to the directors, scripts and staging team: not to the actors. Still, Snape, the best actor, was the most unconvincing here (thanks to awful script and direction), and Harry Potter as unconvincing as ever (I mean wtf this is not harry potter - looks like a school nerd compared to malfoy).Yeah, it's a bit enjoyable, specially the first hour, but it's conceptually and artistically very limited, but it will probably please the mainstream public, which doesn't seem to realize how much better this should have been.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
329,mullaryn,Pleasantly surprised,7,17 July 2009,"I was very pleased with the way the series has continued with 'Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince'. After the (in my opinion) miserable almost-failures that the fourth and fifth films were, I expected no better of the sixth. But the sixth movie is energetic, funny, coherent, and actually sticks to the book fairly well. There are, however some deficiencies, so let me get those out of the way first.The first is the plot. I understand that it is impossible to make a 2.5 hour movie relay a 700 page novel accurately, but at the same time, the film left out some major events which would've not only increased the effectiveness of the film, but also contained some key points. Particularly at the end. In the novel, Dumbledore stuns Harry so that he can't interfere with his death, which is a crucial point in the novel. Also, there was a huge fight just below the top of the tower, which would've a) looked awesome on-screen, and b) also been pretty important in the novel. Also, the whole love theme, which was the funniest part of the novel and also fairly interesting, was relayed somewhat skimpily here.Dumbledore's funeral and in particular the character of Rufus Scrimgeour (yes, I can spell that correctly without looking.) were completely left out. This was extremely important in the novel, as it set relations between Harry and Scrimgeour. Once again, I understand that it is impossible to get every single detail into a 2.5 hour movie, but these aren't small details. And Jim Broadbent as Horace Slughorn... well, Broadbent is an excellent actor and he played Slughorn great, but personally, I think that that was a miscasting. Slughorn by the novel was an extremely fat, boisterous man with a gruff voice. Here, Slughorn isn't really fat, is very tall, and has a rather reedy voice.Now to the good points. Rarely, all of the acting in a movie is great, and this is one of those occasions. Every character was played exceedingly well, particularly Alan Rickman as Severus Snape and the two boys who played Tom Riddle. Both of them somehow managed to project something very sinister onto the screen, that made your skin creep a little. As for Rickman, he was unpleasant, reserved, emotionless apart from occasional frustration or malice, and arrogant: precisely what Prof. Snape was in the series.The movie looks great. There weren't actually that many special effects in the movie, which was what might have spoiled the fourth one. In the fourth movie, the directors went for the blow-away look and neglected everything else. Here, the work was more balanced, and as a result, an extremely decent movie emerges.I'd give it... a 7.2/10 Should you watch it? Well, just about everyone else is going to. Jump on the bandwagon, and actually, it's worth it, because this is a very nice movie, and a great way to spend the time. But if you haven't read the novel yet, I suggest just going on sparknotes or something, because there are some plot twists that you might not get if you haven't read the books (but who hasn't, by now?).",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
330,harpreetc,I suggest you read the book first.,6,31 July 2009,"Expectations were particularly higher for this version of Harry Potter for many reasons. It is based on the second last book of the Harry Potter series, Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, wherein Ms Rowling reaches a scintillating grasp over the prose she writes and her fans get various insights over the plot of the series taken as a whole. There is the utter darkness of Voldemort's past that is included in this book and though his current self as Lord Voldemort never features greatly in the book, the portrayal of his former self is more than enough to cast a shiver down one's spine – I mean who can forget the rabbit hanging from the rafters? But most importantly, one of the central characters of the book, the mentor, the guide, the teacher leaves the hero alone to face the most famous villain of our times at the very end.Therefore, expectations ran high. Did the movie live up to this hope? I would merely state that it was passable fare. Quite a few of the die-hard Potter fans would disagree, for they were left with a teenage love story and all of its angst and confusion. A sub plot of the book was taken and made into the chief plot of the movie. The love stories of Ron and Hermione and Harry and Ginny are meant as a balm against the darkness of a Marvolo Riddle and his subsequent grandson. Hermione casting the enchanted birds at Ron as weapons elicits a smile in the book because it circumvents the horror of Tom Riddle killing his father and framing his uncle. The movie merely shows one side of the plot and leaves all the rest to guesswork. I mean, what if you have not read the book? The movie does nothing to create the tension that leads to a suitable climax.David Yates has tried to recreate the furore of the Order of the Phoenix but he has failed in doing so, because in this instalment, he lacks a proper villain and so places most of the onus on romance and comedy. The movie begins well with the attack of the death eaters and the rise of Voldemort's power. The scenes that are worth mention are the ones in which Draco Malfoy displays the torment of carrying the burden of Voldemort's instructions. They are juxtaposed with the two memories that Dumbledore asks Harry to witness in order to understand Voldemort's past as well as the scenes in which Katie Bell (the Opal Necklace), Ron (the poisoned wine) and even Draco (Sectumsempra) nearly die; but they are not enough to withstand the barrage of the love angles the movie carries throughout. The scene in which Bellatrix, played by Helena Bonham Carter, arrives with Fenrir Greyback at the Burrow is completely alien to the plot. The two purposes it served were to cast some dramatic element in an otherwise bland fare, smack in the middle of the movie, and to broaden Ms Carter's role.Besides the gritty execution of Draco by Tom Felton, the performance given by Jim Broadbent was stellar. He brought Horace Slughorn to life and brought out the complexity of the character to the screen, either by showing his calculative side while arranging the Slug Club meetings or his compassionate side when he reminisces with Harry about Lily Potter. Daniel Radcliffe has certainly grown as an actor and carries his part with élan and comfort, as do Emma Watson and Rupert Grint. Alan Rickman's portrayal of Severus Snape exceeds expectation and one of the best scenes in the movie belongs to him as he makes The Unbreakable Vow or when he declares who he is to Harry in the climax. The acting then is not an issue, the screenplay is.The climax of the movie had much to look out for. The scenes of the Cave are well-managed. The tension is ripe as Dumbledore and Harry walk into it. The terrible drinking of the emerald potion shows the magnificent chemistry between Daniel Radcliffe and Michael Gambon, the presentation of that particular scene was superb and it elicited empathy for both the characters. The lasso of flames that Dumbledore uses to get rid of the Inferi was the highlight of the movie. However, the edge of the seat excitement created then failed to last once the scene shifts back to Hogwarts. The scene with Snape and Dumbledore is almost an anti-climax, especially since Harry is made to look utterly gullible, for he is made to trust Snape whom he actually hates and the Death Eaters (notice Ms Carter's role being enlarged here again) are allowed to merely saunter into the corridors of Hogwarts and up to the Astronomy Tower, without any opposition by a single student, teacher or guard.The premise of the movie, perhaps, is the assertion of the part love has to play in everyone's lives, whether it is between friends, or a boy and girl, or teacher and student, or mother and child – and Harry Potter and the Half-blood Prince clearly does this. What it fails to do however, is create sufficient depth for the motives of either hero or villain. By itself, it is, as I said, passable fare; but if you want to understand a character's intentions, motives or make-up, I suggest you read the book first.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
331,gollumsmeagolrocks,"J.K. is just buying for time, as are the characters, for what's coming...",10,7 July 2016,"The narrative of this entry in the series is somewhat thinner compared to the other entries, in the sense there really isn't one. Each entry to this point has a guiding narrative, and all the events of that entry still relate back to that narrative. The only problem I have even remotely with this entry is that the main plot of Draco having to do something horrible for Lord Voldemort is barely the center piece at all.But that creates the other confusing headscratcher, what does that as a main plot have to do with the Half Blood Prince of the film's title? The Half Blood Prince is even less prominent a figure in the film, having absolutely no affect on the main goal of the heroes and doesn't serve as an obstacle for them in any way. Although considering what he does when he finally appears and how it ties VERY directly to the plan of Draco, I think he means to serve symbolically that he's always provided so much pain and yet so much joy for Harry, providing a tense relationship between the two.And that's what this film is really about. Instead of another full-blown adventure, it feels more like 8 short narratives happening at the same time within the halls of Hogwarts for a year, a brilliant experiment on Rowling's part. Each one explores a relationship between two characters. There's narrative of Dumbledore serving as a father for Harry (which is the most compelling by far), the narrative of Slughorn's tragic friendship with Tom Riddle, which repeat itself as the narrative of the friendship between Slughorn and Harry, the narrative of the irrational hatred-fueled rivalry between Harry and Draco, the narrative of Hermione and Ron's romance, the narrative of Ginny and Harry's romance, and the flawless narrative of the relationship between The Half-Blood Prince with both Draco and HarryIt's just buying time to postpone the final entry in the saga, but it's brilliant how the characters are buying time in a way as well as they are trying constantly to keep the Death Eaters at bay until the finale of the film shows that's impossible and there's no more time left until the final battle.And I must talk about one character in a way that would be almost therapeutic for me, but I'll not imply who it is. This character suffers horribly in this film, which is unbearable for the viewer as the film-makers went out of their way to make it as excruciating as possible to experience. This stands as the only Potter film that was able to move me to tears, and it's because of this character. The fact J.K. Rowling is able to craft characters so real, that the viewer can't help but sympathize so deeply for them, makes her the greatest character writer of all time, bar none. No other film has actually managed to make me so heartbroken at the suffering of another character, especially since I related so much to this character and looked up to this character as an idol who has shaped me significantly as a person.Harry Potter And The Half Blood Prince asks too much of its viewers emotionally, but the yanks makes both a brilliant tragedy and a beautiful masterpiece.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince

335,cameron-burn,The best Potter film spoilt by a confused ending,7,19 July 2009,"Harry Potter and the half-blood prince is the sixth film in the HP series and is directed by Order of the phoenix director David Yates. After six films based on the same storyline I would expect to have been bored by now. However, Director David Yates has tried his hardest to make each of his films different and it is definitely clear here.Unlike the first two potter films in which Hogwarts is a light and happy place in HBP it seems to be gripped in an eternal winter which really seems to set the mood for the film and works really well. The script is as usual what you would expect from a potter film with comedy sprawled over it and it conveys teenage relationships quite well. There are a lot of bits from the book taken out of the film which die-hard potter fans won't like. And this is where HBP falls apart. I'd enjoyed it thoroughly until the last half-an hour. Dumbledores death is bound to be confusing to people who have not read the books and since there was no battle at the end like in the book there was virtually no point in the vanishing cabinet or the death-eaters coming to hogwarts.So, overall an enjoyable film except for a confused ending. The acting is solid, (especially from Alan Rickman as Snape and Jim Broadbent as Sliughorn, these two steal every scene they're in) the script is funny if at points confused and the effects, music and location are superb as usual in a Harry potter film. You can't miss it if you liked the books and even if you didn't like the books you should find it enjoyable if confusing.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
336,adam_evans14,not so bad as the haters have you believe,8,31 December 2009,"Having read the reviews of this film, its hard to write a positive review without expecting animosity from the majority. It seems to be more hated than loved thats for sure, and the main consensus is generally because of scenes from the book being omitted which people deem important.We'll start with the romance between Professor Lupin and Tonks all being discarded in this outing. Was this really important though in truth? Did anyone who hadn't read the books and only witnessed harry potter 5 even know tonks' name? Shes neither here nor there to audiences and thats possibly the best reason for her and lupins romance not being submitted. The characters of Bill Weasley and Fleur, were also omitted and much like tonks, i don't particularly care all too much, as i feel another subplot with their relationship would only distract the attentions of the audiences from what is essentially unimportant.Personally i feel the hate directed at this film due to missing components is unjustified, when considering the more important characters of ludo Bagman and Winky were cut from harry potter 4. Bagman is right in the mixer of things during the goblet of fire book, and who could argue his character is as much suspect as anyone else for who entered harry into the tournament, and yet with all his importance, hes not included in the film. Also no explanation of how Barty crouch Jr escaped from Azkaban (by trading with his sick mother) isn't mentioned, which was one of the more clever aspects of the book.However the hogwarts duels at the end of the film,the Dumbledore funeral,and some of riddles memories being cut, were important pieces which should have stayed. No film is perfect though, and in particular a 600+ page book would be hard to trim into a 2 hour film. The performances of the actors remain status quo, as to be expected with no dramatic alterations. Slughorn was badly cast i felt as he didn't fit the description given in the book which was a disappointment, and the narrative swayed more towards romances rather than the horcruxes subplot, which is an annoyance considering some of riddles memories are cut.Some have said they sat for two hours in boredom, but i find nothing slow about this film, with each scene true to something in the book. Just remember the dull tempo of harry potter 2, with every scene seemingly too long to bear(my least favourite film of the series) and draw a comparison to this and you'll realise this isn't all that bad. All in all i'm happy with harry potter 6 and feel there's enough true to the book to crown it an accurate adaptation to a fabulous book. 8/10",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
337,Sabrz,Does Not Do The Book Justice,3,5 August 2009,"I have been a fan of the Harry Pottter books ever since they came out. Having read all of the books and sees all of the movies, I honestly have to say that the Half Blood Prince is easily the worst of the Harry Potter films by a country mile.The main problem I have with the film is it does not follow the book at all. Only the scenes crucial to the plot from the book were included in the movie. What made it worse was that some scenes were left out in favor of others that had no relevance to the story! For example: while the battle of Hogwarts and Dumbledore's funeral are left out, we still get to see many scenes of the love/hate relationship between Ron and Hermione.Indeed the film seemed to be focused more on teenage hormones rather then the secrets of Voldemort. There are many scenes of Ron and Lavender plus Hermione expressing her feelings toward Ron. In addition there were scenes for the Harry/Ginny relationship. Overall all of these dating and flirting scenes grew tiresome.The worst part is the film leaves out many great scenes in favor of these love scenes. Here is a list of all the scenes that were left out for no good reason: The battle against the death eaters in Hogwarts. David Yates didn't add it because of the battle in the Deathly Hallows. Yet he worked in Hermione hiding from Cormac McLaggen.Most of Tom Riddle's back story and memories are left out. Only what was absolutely essential was included.Dumbledore's funeral was not included because according to Yates it didn't fit with the rest of the film. Yet Ron making out with Lavender was deemed essential to the plot.Several characters are left out. Bill Weasley, Fleur, and Rufus Scrimgeour don't appear in the film. Greyback the werewolf is barely included and does not look scary at all.Harry's touching chat with Ginny explaining why he couldn't be with her was also left out. That was a special scene but it was not included.The scenes that were included were changed for the worse. Dumbledore picks Harry up at a subway station and not at the Dursleys. Once the death eaters are in the castle, not one person notices them. They also calmly leave the place with out anyone stopping them. And am I really supposed to believe that Bellatrix can destroy the Great Hall and not one person hears it! I thought the acting was terrible as well. Michael Gambon shows little emotion as Dumbledore. By the time Dumbledore dies you have a hard time feeling bad. Daniel Radcliffe and Rupert Grint seem more interested in their dating problems rather then the war against Voldemort. Emma Watson delivers a lackluster performance as Hermione who is only worrying about Ron going out with Lavender. Overall the acting was far worse then any other film. The actors really didn't seem to get into character.So to sum it up what we get in this film is a boring film where you have a hard time getting into it unlike the other films. The movie leaves out important scenes in favor of others that were irrelevant to the plot. The plot itself is weak and the movie drags on for far too long. There is little action and no fear at all.If you are a fan of the books you will most likely be very disappointed in the film. The only people who might like the film are those who know little about the series.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
338,jhunt709,"Certainly not half-hearted, though possibly half a film...",8,29 July 2009,"After five successful instalments of the Harry Potter franchise, The Half Blood Prince follows suit with another magical extravaganza.In the sixth film (of course based on the novel by J.K Rowling) Harry and his Hogwarts friends return to the school amidst chaos within the wizarding community as the evil Voldemort's return to power swiftly gathers momentum, while between themselves the group face more ordinary personal issues as teenage angst and lust becomes more prominent within the story line.That the principal cast find themselves battling more against their own hormones than they do the dark forces of the wizarding world is both a blessing and a curse for this movie. While the character's feelings for one another was a major aspect of the sixth novel itself, I find it's dominating presence in the film questionable when there is the absence of several key plot points. While I understand that non-crucial elements of a story must often be sacrificed during the transition from page to picture, I can't understand why some of the more memorable moments from the book were swept aside in favour of scenes that play out in a similar manner to a teen rom-com. While this does not become a major problem due to these segments being (more often than not) laugh-out-loud funny, it is the area of the film that I have to lay blame on for the loss of more intriguing back story and sadly, a more spectacular ending. I understand that some viewers may be deterred by lengthy 'flashback' sequences but the fact is that had they been included, they would have undoubtedly proved beneficial to both those who have read the books and those who haven't. That a climactic fight scene was omitted to avoid repetition with the forthcoming end films is a lousy excuse when five movies so far have been a simple lather, rinse and repeat of a similar premise that has proved to attract box office success and critical acclaim. Though too late to dwell on, I do believe that The Half Blood Prince was also a legitimate candidate to be split into two films rather than one, more so than the seventh and final story that will be presented in two parts. The team behind the film clearly had the courage and ambition to create clear, brave differences from the book and while I certainly applaud this, it also in my opinion becomes the only stumble.Judging the film on its own merits as opposed to comparing it to the source material, I have to say that the film can proudly make its claim as a highlight of the franchise. Everything from the talented young cast, through the fantastic dialogue to the outstanding cinematography ensures this film entertains audiences from the enthusiastic fans to the movie buffs and film critics. The set pieces bear resemblance to how a reader might imagine them in the novel and there are no wasted opportunities when it comes down to special effects. Considering that the film is over two hours long, it never felt like it despite the amount of time devoted to developing the romance subplots. When the credits roll, you may find yourself thinking that one-hundred and fifty-three minutes of your life just skipped by.All in all, an outstanding effort resulting in an outstanding movie. Despite their status as blockbusters these films deserve the critical praise and are well-made films. It is only a shame that in this day and age of extended editions and director's cuts, where a studio can make the decision to split one film into two, that the missing plot was simply dismissed or at the very least filmed and not included with the intention of releasing it in its entirety on DVD.8/10",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
339,paulmg,May be the best Harry Potter movie yet,10,20 July 2009,"There is a story that tells when the great Fred Zinnemann, director of such classics as High Noon, and Walter Murch were editing Zinnemann's Julia. Two test screenings had gone disastrously, and cuts had to be made. They realized a certain sequence had to go. As editor Murch went to make the cut, Zinnemann spoke that when he read that particular scene in the script he knew he could make this movie. Murch froze. Was he about to cut out the heart and soul of the movie? Murch turned to Zinnemann and made a motion, as if to say, ""Well?"" Zinnemann nodded. ""Do it.""No matter how important a scene may be to you personally, sometimes you have to let it go for the sake of the film. The book is not the movie. It, by rights, should be different. It's a different medium, with different rules. It's important to be true to the spirit of the work even if not the letter. Half-Blood Prince is true to the spirit.As for two major changes that were made from the book, I'll address them both. I believe the attack on the Burrow was added for two primary reasons: firstly, it seems at this point that the attack on Bill and Fleur's wedding will be cut from the seventh film. I believe the attack on the Weasleys was moved here and placed under different circumstances. It also serves a dual purpose of placing the main characters in danger. Frequently in the books we see the heroes reading about other wizarding families under attack by Death Eaters, but here they've placed the main characters in harm's way. It's much more effective when it happens to people we care about than when we hear about it happening to someone else. A tertiary purpose of this is to further the relationship between Harry and Ginny, as she literally leaps through fire to come to his aid. She's no longer the little girl who needed Harry to rescue her from the Chamber of Secrets: she's now a very capable young woman who is not afraid to stand up against Death Eaters. Another big change is the lack of a battle at Hogwarts at the end. It's a basic rule of film-making: you don't do the same action scene twice. In Ben-Hur a lot of talk was made about other chariot races the title character had won, but you only saw him race in the one pivotal race, for that very reason. Therefore it's logical to cut the battle from this film, since book seven has such a large, epic Battle of Hogwarts. What's important is what happens before the battle, not the battle itself.Another change that I enjoyed was the different manner in which Harry and Ginny's relationship developed. Here it starts much earlier than the book, and as a result it allows the relationship to develop through the course of the film. There's an early moment where Harry spies Ginny through a window, and it's that classic moment where the man sees the girl he's known for years but as if he's seeing her for the first time. Harry's attraction to her is immediate, but unfortunately she's not only Ron's sister but also dating Harry's friend Dean. What's impressive about the way their romance plays out is that it's done almost entirely without dialog. A momentary glance carries a heartfelt confession, a single gesture moves mountains. One particularly great moment is during a dinner party when Ginny enters late in an elegant dress, and Harry makes the gentlemanly gesture of standing as she seats herself. Everyone at the table looks confused as to why Harry's suddenly standing, except Hermione, who sits smirking. It's not the first time she's seen him notice Ginny. And their first kiss, rather than a spontaneous, unexpected gesture on Harry's part, is initiated by Ginny, in a very sweet, romantic moment.It's this heart of the film that really carries it. There's a great deal of teen angst, as Hermione accepts her feelings of Ron, who still hasn't accepted his feelings for her and instead decides to prance around with another girl, which drives Hermione to fits of rage and tears. But amidst it all there is great humor to be found. For all the weighty events going on, and even for the devastating conclusion, this is probably the funniest Potter movie yet.Gambon has grown nicely into Dumbledore, eclipsing the late Richard Harris. Rickman is delicious as the ambiguous Snape: for six films now he's walked such a fine line between villain and good guy that you're still not sure which one he actually is. Unless, of course, you've read the books. Broadbent as Potions Professor Horace Slughorn is a delight. He's enormously funny, yet carries within him the great secret of a tremendous guilt. The moment of his confession is heartbreaking as he finally comes to terms with the result of a mistake he made years ago.Most impressive among the young actors is Watson, who perfectly portrays the heartbreak of losing not only a friend, but the love of someone greatly desired. It is also her moments of realizing what is going on between Ginny and Harry that helps to sell that other relationship to the viewer: it's a small thing, but successful movies are made of thousands of such small things.This is a much more mature Potter film than we've had before. The characters are struggling to deal with grown up decisions and situations in a grown up manner. As the characters have grown up, so have the movies. The result may be the best Harry Potter movie yet.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince

For someone that has not read the books, but have only followed the movies, this still seemed away too predictable and 'long in the tooth' Star Wars clone for most. I myself thought it so and most of the people I know that have read the stories found it well below the standards set by the previous outings. To me the only saving grace was the special effects that were amazingly 'state of the art'... fifteen years ago! I guess everyone forgot that the target audience got older and more sophisticated as time has passed but the movies have not...they still seem fitting for the younger child's mind but have left the matured mind of the original fan out of the mix. Such a pity for a very promising children's story to seem to have lost its way, for if the this is the way this storyline is meant to be going than only the small children that were hooked in the beginning could really appreciate it...but they were indeed left behind, for as I stated while that characters have matured, the story has not.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
343,simmmz,Satisfying...but several niggling aspects that drain the energy out of the film faster than a Dementor Kiss,7,30 June 2010,"Even before its release, Half Blood Prince had a dark mark against its name. I felt completely abused after Warner delayed the release. How could they do this to us fans? But when I gaze back into my Pensieve, I walked out of 'Half Blood Prince' satisfied...emotionally. BUT there is still plenty to go all 'Moaning Murtle' over....I wasn't a massive fan of David Yates' direction in Order of the Pheonix, and was filled with disappointment that he would be at the helm yet again...(and again, for Deathly Hallows). But he does a competent job this time round, proving capable of directing thrilling action...as well as some more 'intimate' moments. The opening Death Eater attack was expertly handled, and set the tone for the rest of the film nicely. But unfortunately, it quickly lags, as pacing felt slightly off beat in the lead up to Hogwarts fun and festivities. But when things settle, the film gets off to a 'fire-bolting' start.The biggest successes of Half Blood Prince are some of the soap opera elements, specifically, the Hermoine/Ron/Lavendar triangle. There is a great balance of romantic humour and drama, that works well in the franchise and will appease fans of these characters. Emma Watson gives her best performance yet. She's moved on from the 'huffy, breathy, p.m.essey school of acting', to display some genuine emotion. Once again, there is an awkward 'crazy hysterical laugh' at some completely unfunny dialogue (whoever decided to keep these moments in, is in need of firing). Rupert Grint is once again, the star of the show...and props to Jessie Cave as Lavendar Brown, who is hilarious.But whilst this romantic plot development is engaging, fun, and decently acted....we have a flip side; the Harry/Ginny saga. Granted, the source material wasn't great here....but Bonnie Wright plays Ginny as the ultimate dullard. She's blander than a Rune, and more wooden than the Elder Wand. The delivery of the line ""shoelace"" was nauseating, and the 'feeding' Harry mince pies was woefully flat. Her performance went down worse than a bogey Bertie Bott's every-flavour bean. There was more sexual tension between Alan Rickman and....well, every other member of the cast that he interacted with. Its disappointing, as a lot could have been made of this feisty Ranga. Daniel Radcliff wasn't much better. I actually wanted Harry and Ginny to apparate right out of there and leave it to the other players.But overall, I'm glad they spent time on the romance. This film acts as a bit of calm before the storm. However, the soap opera focus comes with the sacrifice of an adequate exploration of Horcruxes, and Tom Riddel's past. This is unsatisfactory, and is sure to confuse all those muggles out there that aren't familiar with the books. Surely, there was room to provide more fulfilling explorations? For example, the infamous Burrow scene: Whilst it was well done...it is given no context, explanation, or justification. It had no implications for any of the characters, and was merely pointless action. The Weasley kids could have at least made one reference, later on that their house had burnt down. But nay.The most thrilling part of the film is the cave sequence -- its one of the best in the film franchise -- fabulously creepy, and shows exciting potential for what Yates could do with Deathly Hallows. The Inferi look slightly Gollum-esquire, but this is forgivable. Key changes are made to the conclusion of the book, all of which assist with a nicely flowing, slightly anti-climatic, finale. But there is genuine tension here. Its not bombastic action -- its thrilling and dramatic. I was slightly moved by the ending, but cutting a 'big' HP moment was a bad idea for us die-hards. I went all Shrieking-Shack I realised this.The editing was problematic for me, with some extremely jarring transitions between scenes. Yes, I could fill in the gaps having read the books, but this choppiness effected the pacing and tone of the film. The cinematography was nominated for an Academy Award, and whilst it was stark, and at times striking, I found the colour pallet far too murky and obscuring. I felt distanced from action, and it got to a point where it just became dull. But the score is quite brilliant. Pulsating, evocative, but non-distracting, its one of the best from the series.Overall, Half Blood Prince captures the essential feel of the novel, and lets the characters breathe for once, with some nice moments in the halls of Hogwarts. That said, I really think that there is little to offer those who have not read the books. Although the experience is overall satisfying, there are several niggling aspects that drain the energy out of the film faster than a Dementor Kiss. Still not good enough for this promising franchise!",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince

345,jennaspivac,Good Potter Film,7,6 August 2009,"I am not a very big fan of Harry Potter let me start off just by saying that. I only read the very first book and didn't like it much but see why kids would love the stories. I have seen most of the movies and like them somewhat better than the book I read but still didn't enjoy them all that much, again I see they are more for the kids who love the Potter stories. This movie I took 2 kids to and I thought it was an enjoyable film, it seems like the actors are starting to ""grow up"" and they are given more grown up issues to deal with and stories to tell. Particularly good I thought was the girl who played Hermione she had some great parts in this movie. The story is darker which I like for the older kids and adults who go to see this movie but they don't go too over the top with it it is still a good story and ""believable"" at least as far as any story like this can be believable.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince

It wasn't important? there's no need to know why the bad guy is that way? And what about Ron's Brother? And what happened with the school's fight? it looks awesome in the book! Why did they do things like this? Why Dumbledore didn't freeze Harry? he looks like a coward in this movie. I guess that nobody read the whole book before start making the film, that's the only and possible reason to skip ALL THE IMPORTANT THINGS of the book. I just didn't like it. I hope they will fix some things now they have decided to ""split"" the last book in two movies... another reason to hate this kind of ""foreword"" to the last two parts. why?",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
347,jeannel2003-618-511281,This installment of the Harry Potter film series was phoned in.,5,26 December 2009,"Of all the HP films – most of which were on the money and the Prisoner of Azkaban a brilliant offering that could stand on its own (except for the disappointing omission of Snape's fabulous tantrum when he discovers that Black has escaped from Hogwart's dungeon) – ""Prince"" is the one that has been messed up beyond the pale. Certainly it is a challenge to depict a book in movie form, but a skilled writer-director team could capture all the salient details and charming nuances if they so desired. This hodge-podge makes me believe that this installment was merely a throw-away from the producer's, director's and writer's viewpoint. What a shame and a waste. Makes me wonder what they are going to do to Ms. Rowling's final masterpiece, which is coming out in two parts. My confidence has been shaken. Messrs. Heyman, Yates and Kloves owe Ms. Rowling and the fans of her Harry Potter books a huge apology for phoning this one in.Summary:Here are some points (WHICH MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS): Screenplay Deficiencies: 1) The opening, which was not in the book, portrays Harry in a light that deviates from his character, which tends to be shy around girls, by having him flirt and make a date with a waitress. This is the book that reveals Harry's romantic feelings for Ginny, so this scene hits a false, misleading and annoying note. The book's first scene with the muggle PM would have been more appropriate, or opening with the Dursleys, then into the Slughorn scene. 2) In the Slughorn opening scene, the movie (a) confuses the issue of the dragon blood, (b) overlooks the more important issue of the dark mark, (c) fails to reveal that Slughorn is a former head of Slytherin, and (d) does a poor job explaining how Slughorn is in a muggle house but all his things are there. 3) The movie spends too much time on the Ron-Hermione romance and gives short-shrift to the more important Harry-Ginny romance, which impacts the way he views his mission and future. This was a major mess-up, as the book emphasizes Harry's longing and Ginny's spunk and fire, all of which is lost in the movie. 4) The scene of the attack on the Burrow was very wrong and entirely unnecessary. The time that this scenes could have been put to use including the important points that were omitted. 5) The scene in which Hermione,Harry and Ron are leaving The Three Broomsticks depicts Hermione seemingly a bit tipsy - a totally false and shameful depiction. There are no references that I recall in any of the HP books that butterbeer is an alcoholic beverage; and, in fact, it is thought by many sources to be a non-alcoholic drink. But if butterbeer were an alcoholic beverage, the only ones who appear to be drunk on it are Messrs. Kloves and Yates, for their respective bizarre writing and careless direction. 6) The scene in which Harry and Ron exchange inane comments about Ginny's and Hermione's skin could have been eliminated in favor of a more meaningful scene to clarify Harry's feelings for Ginny and her relationship with Dean Thomas. 7) In no scene is a bezoar adequately explained, making the scene in which Ron is poisoned and Harry saves his life by using a bezoar perplexing and less effective than is should have been. 8) The tension among Harry, Ginny and Ron because of Harry's growing feelings for Ginny was both heart-tugging and comical, and was completely omitted from the movie in favor of extended scenes about Ron's infatuations. The Ron scenes were amusing, but a better balance should have been achieved. 9) The placement of the scene in which the agreement between Dumbledore and Snape is depicted was sloppy and obvious. 10) To eliminate Dumbledore's funeral at the end of the movie is unthinkable and unforgivable. This larger-than-life character and the impact his death has on the plot and remaining main characters is a key element of this installment. Direction Deficiencies: 1) The scene in which Katy Bell is cursed, the young heroes merely stand there looking like dufuses; in the book the three rushed forward to help, and finally Harry ran to find someone to help. 2) The scene in which Ron is poisoned in Slughorn's office has Slughorn looking like a dufus, just standing there as though a student were not writhing in death throes on his floor. In the book, Slughorn is paralyzed by shock – this did not come across at all. 3) There is no chemistry between Mr. Radcliffe and Ms. Wright. They are both better actors than their few paltry scenes together indicate; so, again, very poor direction. 4) The scene in which Harry is chasing Snape and attempting to hurt or kill him with spells from the Half-Blood Prince's spell book has Snape announcing to Harry that he is the Half-Blood Prince in the same tone of voice he might use to order a glass of mead at the Three Broomsticks. In the book, he is screaming at Harry in a mad rage that he is the Half-Blood Prince. 5) The fiery Maggie Smith sleepwalked through her scenes as the fiery Prof. McGonagall. Why bother caring when the director doesn't care?",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince

349,brendanmcc02,Solid adaptation,8,17 August 2020,"Saw this in a cinema. Good adaptation that focuses on the most important elements - character. Really liked the awkward teen romance, really fits the setting. Teens will always be romantic and hormonal even when the world around them is awaiting dread.At the start of the film it is very clear that there is a storm brewing. The sun never makes an appearance and the clouds are ever-present. Even at night, it isn't jet-black and the clouds hold an ominous greyness to them. I really liked how the film opened with the Death Eaters terrorising the Muggle world, it made the danger so much more threatening and real. The cinematography, one of the stronger aspects of the film, is very subdued yet beautifully photographed, contrasting very heavily to the days of lively colours in the first two films.One thing I absolutely revere about Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince is that it's so controlled. The film is not epic or grand in scale. Consider the previous two films: The epic Tri-Wizard tournament in The Goblet of Fire and the heart-racing Ministry sequence in The Order of the Phoenix. The focus in this film is not on the tense wand-duels or the exhilarating sequences. The focus is on the characters and the drama. You can count on one hand the amount of ""action"" scenes there are in the film. This film cares about the characters and the drama - which I thoroughly enjoyed. The rom-com aspect of the film was executed almost flawlessly in my opinion; a perfect balance of awkwardness and comedy. Just how the teenagers do it.Framed against the teenage romance is the storm that lays ahead. This is why the controlled and intimate approach to the film work so well. The film itself is an embodiment of the calm before the storm, and is a microcosm of the epic adventure that awaits. Director David Yates thoroughly understands this and doesn't make the film bigger than what it is.The film is not without its faults however. The first act is almost perfectly paced, never dragging and keeping the audience hooked. The film then starts to drag and I found myself losing focus until the scene in the cave as the film approached it's closing.Another fault I found was with some of the acting. Adolescent and child actors are always a mixed bag, but there are some great performances. Watson delivers a superb performance and Grint plays Ron very well. Lavender Brown was also well-cast. Radcliffe's acting was passable, but I'm aware that he suffered to alcoholism during the filming. Bonnie Wright as Ginny is the real culprit here. There is no chemistry whatsoever between Radcliffe and Wright, leading to Harry and Ginny's romance to be (unintentionally) awkward and devoid of emotion. The blame however should not just be placed on the actors, I found the script to be very lacking during their characters' encounters.Despite this, this is a well-made film and a welcome addition to the Harry Potter catalogue. The filmmaking and camera-work are impressive at times. As a whole, this is a strong film to act as the predecessor to the fantastic Deathly Hallows duology.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
350,eskdale56,I was somewhat disappointed,6,25 July 2009,"The movie title is barely explained--we don't know why the Half Blood Prince is important to the overall story--its never explained. Aside from the reference to him in the book and the revelation that it is Snape, we know nothing about the Half Blood Prince.Is Snape a traitor to Dumbledore or is there a twist to come? no indication.Dumbledore lead us to believe there were 7 horcrosses (sp?) but at the end of the movie Harry and Hermione are talking about finding ""it."" Hagrid and McGonagall were as good a furniture in this movie, just props.It was not clear to me that Narcissa was Draco's mother and Bellatrix refers to her as ""sister."" Are they sisters? Why did Lucius go to Azkaban prison? Since Draco failed did he die for it? I also was not thrilled at all the teen puppy love stuff going on...so they made it to puberty, great, on with the story.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
351,harrypup-28436,My least favourite hp movie,7,20 August 2020,"This movie focuses on the relationships too much and not the actual story.

352,alex1432,my least favorite HP movie,7,9 February 2021,"I still love this movie, but it's my least favorite out of all the harry potters. i hate how many of tom riddle's memories they leave out and how they leave out dumbledore's funeral. i also hate that scene they added where the death eaters burned down the burrow. it was SO unnecessary and added nothing to the storyline. also, this movie has a lot less action than the other movies, which isn't a big problem but at times it gets boring. i feel like they focused way too much on romance drama in this movie (i'm fine with a little bit, but there was quite a lot) and they should've used some of that time to add in a few more of tom riddle's important memories, like how he made some of his horcruxes. those were my favorite parts in the book.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
353,swissmanager,Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Movie - prepare to be disappointed !,3,4 August 2009,"I am not a Harry Potter fan, nor have I read any of the books. But my daughter, son and myself have seen several, though not all, of the films. Some have been more gripping than others, but all have been enjoyable and it has been great to have seen my kids grow up with Harry Potter.This film though is the biggest of let-downs... all three of us were really disappointed and this was the only HP film where I was bored at times, ( in fact, apart from some very good visual effects 3/4 of the film through, I found it boring for long periods ).Has the director changed ? HP's accent has changed. And the film progresses so much slower than previous films.Is the book so weak... this film does not seem to have a story-line nor an actual ending.No... the Harry Potter spell is broken and will not be captivating my family anymore.:-(",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
354,ryanh-00630,Dark secrets revealed.,9,24 August 2019,"In terms of the entire franchise, along side Chamber of Secrets, Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince is always looked at as not up to par with the rest of the series and one of the weaker installments. However, to me it manages to be one of my favorites of the bunch and one I constantly find myself always going back to.The film really reminds me of Prisoner of Azkaban, in the way that it's a somewhat small story and one that, while it does affect the overall story, it does have it's contained story and I simply adore that. It's about Harry growing up and everything a ""real"" teenager goes through. You have to remember Harry's only 16 in this, he's still growing up and still trying to deal with school. The film oozes atmosphere and emotion that results in it being super enjoyable.For the first time since the second installment, a director returns for the next entry with David Yates directing this and Order of the Phoenix. His direction continues to feel magical and mysterious that carries over from the previous film and he uses the idea of love and darkness to incapsulate the film in a brilliant atmospheric nightmare, of sorts. You see a huge part of growing up is falling in love. Presented here you have all characters, main or not, dealing with the pain and emotion brought from love and David Yates does this excellently. He also uses a pallet of fake colors to make the film so amazingly beautiful.Once again the trio chips in fantastic performances along side standouts such as Alan Rickman, Maggie Smith, and Michael Gambon's Dumbledore. But the regular crew gets pushed to the side line by two other characters: Draco and Slughorn. Jim Broadbent delivers a spectacular performance as Professer Slughorn. He just seems like a genuine guy and one I'd love to have a conversation with. But Tom Felton's destructive and emotionally moving performance as Draco Malfoy. For five films he is known as this jerk, school yard bully to Harry, and yet in Half-Blood Prince I feel sorry for him. He gives such a heart wrenching performance that shows his sadness and inability to do what he wants. To me his scenes are easily the best and easily his best portrayal of Draco.Also this film gets really dark at times. For being a mere PG13 the film deals with death, love, and darkness all around. It's cinematography along side helps the film to have that feel of darkness but I think it really helps by it's story. It flows and moves expertly well and transitional throughout without having one dull or unmemorable moment. It's savors the emotional outcry for help that continues until the final act which is done absolutely phenomenally. The score done again brilliantly by Nicholas Hooper brings the dark tone while still having that classic John Williams vibe that we all adore so much.Once again the Harry Potter delivers a fantastic film that not only is entertaining but technically brilliant as well. I wish people had more love for the film as it has no boring parts and an ending that is spectacular. Combining all the right moves of darkness, mystery, and above all love, Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince is a humorous and showstopping entry into a beloved franchise.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
355,whatsasriel,Better than the next and the last but overall still not that great,2,9 October 2020,"While nowhere near as bad as the order of the phoenix or the bloated mess that was deathly hallows, it still fails to live up to even the fourth movie in the series, in fact it almost feels as if it's a more boring version of that fourth movie.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
356,bankcello,"Not the content, but the presentation put me off.",3,24 September 2009,"Although I had read the book, my sieve-like mind had forgotten all of the details, so the differences between the book and the movie that bothered many other viewer didn't bother me.I guess that I enjoyed the plot, acting etc. However it was the technical presentation that put me off.We paid extra to see it in IMAX and 3-d. All I can say about that is ""Never again"". The problem with the IMAX was the absurd level of sound coming from all over the theater. I do not need to be jolted out of my seat with the sound effects. In an opening trailer the theater boasted about how many watts were available to the sound system. Most of them were not needed, but were used. If I wanted a sonic assault I would attend some sort of rock concert, and that is not about to happen.As to the 3-d. Thankfully, it was only the first twelve minutes of the picture. The combination of 3-d and rapid movement made for a nausea producing effect. If I wanted that I would go on a roller coaster. Again, that is not about to happen.Perhaps it is an age divide (I am 70), but I don't need high volume and all sorts of drastic effects in a movie. A decent plot and acting will suffice.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
357,VertigoOne,"Not just good, very good!",7,11 July 2015,"Masterful installment in the Harry Potter series and the only estimable work since Prisoner of Azkaban. Following two gloomy films, I enter Half Blood Prince skeptical, and understably so. Once again, the work is dark and brooding and Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry seems drearier than a nursing home. The storyline is clearly good, but the filmmaking must stand as an altogether separate work. And stand it does! Not since Chamber Secrets has the stylization so preferred things like storyline, characterization, dialogue, acting, and other actually important things. There is real pathos (despite the cliché love affair between Ron and some random blonde girl) and sustained intrigue - all in all, the film fosters a genuinely interested audience (that is not weary from bricks being thrown at them every so often). The atmosphere rarely slaps you in the face (my cheeks were sore after Goblet of Fire) and the cinematography has a pleasing blend of close-up and exterior shots. Yes, I love a brighter Hogwarts, but thanks to this film's addition of the color yellow, I had little to complain about in Yates' vision. All-in-all this film makes the series. Without it, Harry Potter could have been buried with Dumbledore (for all I care); but with it, I am excited to say that the audience stays with Harry to his climactic and exciting end in Part 2 (which, thanks to Half Blood Prince, becomes one of the highest earning films of all time). Jim Broadbent is marvellous as Slughorn and Michael Gambon became a Dumbledore whom Richard Harris never dreamed of being. Still not perfect, but a masterful piece of filmmaking.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
358,Biodigital_Jazzman,A far cry from the novel,4,26 February 2010,"From the opening of the film, it's obvious that this is no longer Rowling's story. There's a spectacular effect of the Millennium Bridge being destroyed. Then we find Harry for some reason in a subway diner reading the Daily Prophet. (Wouldn't he be more cautious in the Muggle world?) He then begins flirting with a waitress when Dumbledore appears across the tracks, stone still like a statue.The beginning of the novel has a lot of charm, with Dumbledore finally meeting the Dursleys in a fairly funny scene. But nice touches like that are few and far between in this film. Although Daniel Radcliffe once again demonstrates that he's growing as an actor, Michael Gambon as Dumbledore has regressed to delivering most of his lines in near monotone. His supposedly horribly damaged hand looks completely normal except for a little smeared makeup. The desperation and urgency of Rowling's Dumbledore is nowhere to be found here.The pivotal character in this installment is Professor Slughorn, described in the book as rather portly, full of bluster and sporting a handlebar mustache. Enter Jim Broadbent, whose portrayal is nearly the complete opposite. Broadbent's characterization is more like a doddering grandfather. He doesn't seem to have enough energy and charisma to attract and keep a faithful cadre of students near him.There are so many inexplicable moments in the film. Why does the Burrow burn down? It makes no sense, particularly with what follows in the final book. Why does Snape walk by Harry near the end and put his finger to his lips, and Harry obediently stand there? Why that almost laughable ""tribute"" with the students and staff holding up their wands like cigarette lighters at a Motley Crue concert? Those choices dilute the power of the original story.There are some fine moments, most notably from Emma Watson and Tom Felton. The scene where Hermione ends up attacking Ron with her missile-like magical butterflies is particularly moving. But there are so many missteps throughout the long movie, that moments such as that are lost. One particular annoyance is Helena Bonham Carter's campy take on Bellatrix, a portrayal so over-the-top it would be more suited to a cartoon.I had hope for David Yates after seeing Order of the Phoenix. The story there was hacked to pieces as well, but what remained was generally nicely done. I'm not sure how the Half- Blood Prince adaptation veered so terribly off-course. But I hope Yates can redeem himself with the upcoming two-part conclusion to one of the greatest collections of English novels.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
359,cre8toruk,Same old Same old,3,13 October 2009,"I was eagerly waiting to see this movie as I'd seen all the other five, and I had to resort to begging my children now teenagers to go to the cinema with me...Having been stunned and enthralled by the first 2 or 3 potter movies, I was left slightly let down by four and I couldn't wait for 5 to end so I was hoping that the latest instalment 6 would bring us back to the edge of our seats again. I have to admit at this point that I've not read any of the books that these films are made from so I literally don't know what to expect when I go to see them.I have to say I was again bitterly disappointed... the plot was terribly weak and the film neither at the beginning (where I actually had to watch again the last 10 minutes of HP 5) nor the end where presumably 7 will carry on, explains what the point of it's being is, other than simply a filler between 5 and 7.The acting by the once brilliant children is now becoming samey, under developed and the only real beacon amongst them is Emma Watson who plays the unrequited love card very well, not to mention that she's not bad to look at either... Danielle Radcliffe struggles to play the pubescent teen that he so clearly isn't and if Rupert Grints biceps get any bigger they'll be re-casting the part of Hagrid, if the ""kids"" aren't working anymore then surely the heavy weights can pull this from the fire...the one exception to an entire cast of people who simply now seem to turn up for the pay checks, is Helena Bonham Carter who is mischievous and at least keeps you interested.Where once the special effects were a wow factor they're now a bit tired and get in the way of an all too over complicated plot.I simply don't care about Harry Potter any more, I wasn't in the least bit sad when Dumbledore ""Dies"", and I find myself willing the dark lord to take over once and for all and for the plot to twist in HP7 to find that Harry is actually a really bad guy and that Voldemort is in fact the good guy....Robbie Coltrane must have wondered why he bothered turning up, he had about 3 words to say and 5 scenes in the entire movie... Again a bit like The Matrix 2, somewhere between here and no where, a money making exercise and like the movie, I just can't wait for this series to end.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
360,ronaldosievert,Sadly one of the weaker movies in the series,6,16 January 2020,"""Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"" was once again directed by David Yates. During his sixth year at Hogwarts Harry discovers a book that is ""Property of the Half-Blood Prince"", meets an old friend of Dumbledore, Horace Slughorn and learns more about the past of Lord Voldemort.What this movie succeeds in, is the last buildup required for the final entries. It expands the backstories of both Albus Dumbledore and Severus Snape and explores the past of Horace Slughorn and Tom Riddle. Most of this comes together in an emotional third act.Otherwise, I would consider this to be one of the weaker and for sure Yates weakest Harry Potter movie.

Comedy, and a lot of it. If not for the brief death eater attack at the beginning of the film, you'd hardly know there was a war going on. And the greatest parts, including Snape's interchange with Harry at the end of the book, are left out. Oh, and where in the book does the burrow get burned?

HoNESTLY THOUGH, just look at the whole picture,......., what was that all about, and then i realised...., that film was made to kill off dumbledor, the film just went on and on, and as i believe harry potter reached his prime in the other films. Of which, he is and always will be unable to fulfil again, and again, the movie lasted for 2 hours and 33 minute's, it is almost as if the movie was just being made because it needed to and not because anyone wanted it made. ------- the best part of that film was leaving the cinema----- and i hope i never see that dreadful, endless, and extremely boring film, ever, ever, again!. It would literally be torture.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
364,smiley_pat77,Here we are again...,7,17 July 2010,"Here we are again with an installment to this potentially epic saga that has produced another bittersweet result.The visuals are lush: Bruno Delbonnel's photography is impressive but yet pleasingly subtle, the art design (particularly that of the cave) is glorious, and the effects are admirable. Nicholas Hooper's score, though not as sweeping as John Williams' early work, yet again proves to be an elegant addition. The scene that takes place within the cave is incredibly engaging and is given the scale it deserves.As enjoyable as much of the film is, for those of us who know better, there is an unpleasant aftertaste that arrives when the credits come up. We know the source material. We know all the plot devices and characters. We know every line of dialogue and every intricate bit of action that's expected to occur. Yet we don't care about any of this as much as we care about the emotions that come with them. David Yates and his cast and crew do what they can with the script they have been given. However, Steve Kloves yet again (as he did particularly in installments 3 & 4) chooses to make undesirable omissions.My distaste for his contribution to this series does not stem from the exclusion of subplots and supporting characters or the supposed misinterpretation of what I think people and places should look like. I accept the film as its own entity. What I cannot remain ignorant to is when there are certain emotions that should exist that simply aren't there.When the climax of the film came I realized it had not been earned. There was simply not enough build. Here was a chance to explore what sent the ""greatest dark wizard of all-time"" on his descent into hell and we miss out on it. There is no sense of discovery and mystery on the past of this satanic character. All we really learn is the bare necessities to allow the story to continue.There is no speculation and curiosity, or even any thorough explanation, on the identity of the ""Half-Blood Prince"" that the film draws its title from. It merely becomes a matter of fact. There is no hint at the heart-breaking betrayal that occurs. There are no pains of weak desperation.Instead time was allotted on an unmotivated destruction of the Weasley's home that ultimately was never assigned any true purpose.Like all the Potter films, the core of everything is there and it will please and charm in many ways. However, there was a depth that could have been explored but was only glanced at, tears that could have been shed but merely lingered in the eyes, and a horribly dark horizon that could have been painted by the end but was only hinted at.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince

As for ron whesley, i love this actor but again he is the same he i bring nothing new to the role and is becoming predictable and boring!! as for the editing well i think have done as much as they could for the time they where given but again as all the others they have missed so much out so if you haven't read the books you cannot understand some of the little sub stories which are going on. i think i may just have to wait for the 7th installment to come and see how they are going to end the series.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince

The only funny part was when Katie had that seizure thing and Ron was on that love potion. :D I just didn't get how Harry just liked Ginny (sp). I mean, I may have missed something but for me it was just like he started liking her out of nowhere.Anyway, I completely have to disagree with the test screening reviews (even though the people at the test screenings probably saw something much different and complained to make it a much better movie, I'm guessing.)

369,tony-bell,Truly bad,5,28 July 2009,"I must say I really didn't like the film, it glosses over too much, it is visually stunning and some of the cinematography is beautiful but the story just isn't there, I have read half-blood prince twice and loved it and was really looking forward to the film but I must say it was a let down and a very anti climactic end.I watched it with a friend who hasn't read any of the HP books and he was left confused and didn't understand what was going on on some bits, such as when Harry looks into Dumbledores pensieve it didn't explain what it was, it didn't explain much about Dumbldores hand or the ring, a lot of stuff wasn't really explained and it was on for 2hours 18minutes so surely in that time they could have made a good story out of it but it turned out to be a mish mash of special effects and not a very coherent story.Little bits would have made it so much better such as Fred and Georges joke shop I loved in the book when Ron's parents went to visit when reading the book I actually imagines Julie Walters face seeing the shop, but the shop was just fleeting it didn't even explain who Fred and George were, I think David Yates is a terrible story teller I think he must take for granted everyone has read the book as he takes not time explaining or keeping the story going.I was very disappointed the first 3 films were great it went downhill from Goblet of Fire and this being the worst.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
370,monkey_kelstar,Worst in the bunch,5,10 July 2010,"As a huge fan of the entire Harry Potter series, especially the sixth book, I have to say I become more disappointed each time I watch it. The main focus of the director and screenwriter was to make it funny and entertaining, and so they let the overall point of the story fall to the wayside. They go through important scenes too briefly, leaving little room for character development, and spend too long on scenes that have no value to the story as a whole. The book was about the pending final battle with Lord Voldemort, and the funny scenes, and the parts dealing with the characters' various relationships, were added in as comic relief. The movie was the opposite. It was all about entertaining the audience, and the important parts were just stuck in randomly. They really overdid the romance and the consequential drama, focusing way too much on that aspect of the story.For example, when Ron gets poisoned, and he's in the hospital wing, Slughorn tells Dumbledore that the poisoned mead had actually been meant as a gift for him. However, further debate as to who is the actual culprit is cut short by Lavender rushing into the room, screaming ""Where's my Won-Won?"" And Lavender also interrupts an important conversation on the train about Snape trying to help Malfoy by drawing a heart in the glass. Oh, and not to mention the extra seven or so minutes taken up by Hermione crying into Harry's shoulder after Ron and Lavender kiss for the first time. Even when Harry does go to Dumbledore's office to learn more about Voldemort's past, Dumbledore wastes time asking him if he's dating Hermione Granger??? Stupid, pointless scenes like this waste important time that could have been used in moving the actual story along!And what, what, what was that scene with the fire at the Burrow? That took about ten minutes, and was completely pointless. In the time they use up doing pointless scenes like that, they could have been showing other memories of Voldemort, discussing other Horcruxes (how is Harry supposed to know what they are in the seventh movie?)Dumbledore could have been showing Harry what the prophecy really meant, why he and Voldemort would have to face each other in the end, how Harry had the power that the Dark Lord knew not of. Instead, time was wasted on scenes that won't even matter in the next movie. Also, if they wanted to include more action, why not have more of a battle at the end? In the book, the Death Eaters and Harry's friends put up a huge fight. Why not have that... instead of the stupid fire scene?Probably one of the biggest problems, though, is that now Harry won't even know what the other Horcruxes are in the next movie. Important time is going to be wasted figuring out what they are now, which means other valuable scenes could be taken out of the next two movies. This movie was definitely the weakest in the series and set the seventh one up for failure, in my opinion.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
371,MartinPh,"Plodding, illogical, overlong",4,9 August 2009,"I've never read any of the Potter books, so I watched HP & the HBP as a movie plain and simple, and found myself bored to tears. Of course the art direction and design are again spectacular, but the story is a loose patchwork of disparate elements that is far from compelling and often seems unacceptably random. Why, for instance, does Dumbledore need to drink the fluid that contains the horcrux? It is also quite galling that characters who possess impressive powers of magic never use them at obvious times. Dumbledore is able to magically transport himself and Potter to a desolate rock in the sea (though it's unclear why they would stop there except for creating a nice shot), but then when he has to cross the lake in the cave, he has to conjure up a boat? Logic is nowhere to be found; the Hogwarts management must be senile to keep allowing the obviously evil Malfoy in, and blind not to suspect Snape. And while Voldemort's cronies have ample opportunity to kill Potter, they refrain from doing so because Voldemort has to do it himself. Why are villains always so unpragmatic? Of course a movie about magic requires suspension of disbelief. But that doesn't mean the makers can get away with anything. And while there is much talk of the more serious, 'psychological' nature of this installment, it all struck me as pretty obvious and very superficial. It's all very well to turn Malfoy into a doubting, troubled youngster all of a sudden, but how did that come about? Nobody cares to explain that to the viewer. In all, this is an overlong, self-important offering that ploddingly drags along to an unsatisfying end. The Prisoner of Azkaban remains, by a wide margin, the best of the Potter films.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince

373,MydnightRose,Weakest of the bunch,4,25 June 2010,"I have been over Harry Potter for awhile and I feel the movies have been going downhill since the 3rd one; but Half Blood Prince made me realize that the previous movies were actually rather good. This movie had such mediocre acting, bad acting, (and what was up with the lighting) that I had to scratch my head wondering why nobody stopped this before too much money was spent. If I remember correctly Order of the Phoenix and Half-Blood Prince are around the same length, so why did the former movie seem to be so much better constructed than this one? This movie jumps all over the place and has a couple of really pointless scenes, and the writer/director makes the characters do some idiotic things. I feel sorry for anyone who has not read the books because this movie, unlike previous ones, will seem quite confusing if you had not read the book or finally decided to go see your first HP movie. Emma Watson has been the poster child for bad acting amongst the younger cast members since about Goblet of Fire; but she had a lot of company with this movie. Rupert Grint gave about a 3 performance, and honestly I think his character could have gone on vacation for all he added to the film. Daniel Radcliffe was so off and on with his lines and scenes that it was almost painful to watch. He has never seemed so stiff and out of touch with his character before; perhaps the writing caused him to not know what his characters motivation was in certain scenes. The actress playing Ginny Weasly was atrocious as was her character! How could so many people be involved in this movie yet nobody took the time to prevent the inclusion of Ginny tying Harry's shoe or feeding him cookies? Not only was Ginny written as a doormat but the actress gave her so little personality that she could have been scenery. Tom Felton's performance had to grow on me but he was definitely at the top of his game in this film, too bad he didn't give his co-stars pointers. The lines he had to say were pretty bad, but he gave it his best shot; and all around I would give him an 8. 3 other things were missing from the movie: Jason, Alan, and Helena. All 3 have an uncanny ability to steal every scene they are in and Alan and Helena were used too little in this film when Alan especially should have had much more screen time. Jason was expected to be absent but I would have made up a scene so he could appear because he is truly that good.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince

375,ucjtskl,This movie is being shown on TV,1,23 December 2013,"... and I'm on IMDb looking to see if I'm the only one who found this film tedious. Looks like I'm not!I appreciate Potter is a growing lad ...... and growing lads want to find a girlfriend ...But the opening scene looked like the superman 2 movie - with baddies flying in from the mist. That looked promising except the same baddies re-appeared somewhat later in a corn field and I had lost the plot probably because I fell asleep with all seeming to be very tame, uninspiring and boring.Maybe I should go and read this book - but then again I read the first first book and wasn't convinced - the plots need conjured coincidences to work - well the main characters are magicians - but then how do you put magicians in jail such that the can't just escape by waving a wand and uttering a few words? There seems little overall thought in putting the plots together in the series - I mean to say Voldemort is disembodied so he is not alive and he is not dead .. why is he the only one disembodied? Why are the prisoners of Azkhaban not disembodied too ... presumably if you can catch a wizard and stop him from teleporting himself from one place to another - then you might be able to contain the poor chap by disembodiment (whatever it means) ... give me the books and films from the Narnia series any day.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
376,mccormick632,"Boring, Boring, Boring!",6,5 December 2010,"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince flat out sucks! It has very little redeeming factors to it, its too long and its boring. I will never understand how the filmmakers turned what was actually an okay book into a film this boring. I read the Half-Blood Prince book, and I actually liked it. I liked the dark turn the books had taken (before f*****g it up with the Deathly Hallows), and the death of Dumbledore was actually dramatic and actually elicited an emotional response from me. It wasn't a great book, I felt that the plot delved a bit too deep into the relationships amongst the characters (or was that the Order of the Phoenix? Either way it slowed things down), and I also didn't really find the book that exciting until the ending, that is where things got good. The movie, on the other hand, was the complete opposite. Things did not get good towards the end, if anything, it got worse! The Half-Blood Prince is what happens when a book that had so much background to it that when turned into a film, the filmmakers need to keep things moving while still telling a good story and have it exciting. This movie didn't do that at all. It was boring, from beginning to end, nothing but boring, dreadfully slow scenes that nearly put me to sleep. Not only that, but the many scenes regarding the relationships were so bad that I didn't feel that the characters didn't actually like each other, the only reason they do is because the plot requires them too. For example: Ginny Weasley is supposedly going to be Harry Potter's girlfriend, but her character is so bland and the actress didn't really do a good enough job to make it look like she actually did like Harry. She stares at him with an uninterested look in her eyes, one that says to me, ""Why does the script require me to fall for this guy?"" Its painful to watch, and only serves to kill 5 minutes.The rest of the cast is hit-or-miss. Alan Rickman as Severus Snape, as always, is brilliant. He is the one cool character and I don't think it is because he is well written. It's because it's Alan Rickman! He is always fun to watch on screen! Whether it is Galaxy Quest, or...any of the other Harry Potter films, Alan Rickman always does a great job. However the rest of the cast is nothing spectacular. I already mentioned how bland Ginny Weasley is so I won't talk about her again, but everyone in this movie just doesn't work. Helena Bonham Carter as Bellatrix Lestrange is so over the top that she comes off as hilarious! I know she is meant to be psychotic and all that good stuff, but...look at her! Her character isn't subtle at all! She cackles and laughs manically whenever she is on screen and I found her more annoying and funny rather than frightening. The cast of this movie may have good actors/actresses lined up, but it's ultimately the characters that fall flat. They either are completely useless, or so obviously evil that whenever someone thinks they are not one of the death eaters I feel like shaking them relentlessly shouting, ""HELLO! HOW STUPID ARE YOU!? Look at this guy! He has no nose, no hair, no visible human traits aside from the fact he looks somewhat human!"" In case you didn't know, I was talking about the evil lord snake-face, I mean, Voldemort.Onto the plot, and trust me, this is where I REALLY started to loathe this film. It does so much yet succeeds at doing nothing at all. I watched this movie in a trance, trying to remember what happened and why. After some time I eventually just gave up, mainly because when I asked myself, ""Why,"" I realized that there was no reason why. Nothing happens in this movie! It was so boring that I almost couldn't believe it. What are they doing now? Oh, absolutely nothing. What now? Oh, they are trying to find this item for reasons I forgot about and didn't really care about in the first place. Why is this drink that Dumbledore is drinking making him progressively weaker? Why are there zombie-like creatures rising up from the water? What is going on? What are those things, why should I care? The answer to the last question is I shouldn't. Only hardcore Potter fans will truly know what is going on, the rest of us is left confused, or was that just me? What's going on now? Oh, the death eaters have invaded Hogwarts, oh no! That should be dramatic, but it really isn't. What just happened, oh wait, Draco Malfoy couldn't grow a pair and kill Dumbledore, he just stood there crying like a little b**** until the only cool character had to do the deed himself. This was the worst insult of all, Dumbledoofus' death wasn't dramatic, period. It happened, was incredibly boring, and went, and that was it.This is a movie that I just love to hate. I take great joy in ripping this movie to shreds because I feel that I must have revenge. Revenge against having a series of once okay books turned into movies that started off well, then turned to c***. It pains me to see a franchise that I actually once liked (contrary to my review of the Deathly Hallows Part 1 movie) be turned into this. The problem is that while I did like the franchise initially, it's the awful conclusion and the awful recent movies that turned me against Harry Potter. I wanted to like this movie, I really did, but, sadly, the movie failed. Harry Potter, I hate to say this, but you failed!",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
377,IndrajitGhosh,What rubbish!,1,27 September 2012,"Out of all the Harry Potter movies, I would have to say this is by far the worst. Not only does it not stick entirely to the book (none of them really do) but it is dead boring and does not seem to excite me in the way the other movies have.I cannot explain why, but the acting from the cast is absolutely appalling in this film, even from Alan Rickman, who I always believed was the best actor in the series.On top of everything, it annoyed me how much emphasis was placed on romance in this movie. It completely lost the plot when Hermione was getting overly jealous over Ron and Lavender Brown's relationship.Overall, this film is by far 1 of the worst I have ever seen, even though I am a Harry Potter fan.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
378,soul_scion,Hugely disappointing,3,15 July 2009,"The fifth movie set a high bar in my opinion because it so well done and well paced. The sixth installment fell flat on its face terribly. firstly the pacing was so unbelievably slow - it took forever for the narrative to progress because it was mired in silly 'teen angst/romance' moments, all of which were severely changed from the book - totally unnecessary. The only time it started to pick up was when Harry requires the necessary 'memory' - and you will have to wait like an hour and half for that. Secondly, the acting was utterly appalling. There is just such an odd juxtaposition between seasoned actors like Alan Rickman et al compared to the young cast - OK, no one is expecting academy performances but still...the script gave the cast absolutely nothing and Bonnie Wright utterly floundered in delivering any line credibly. Everyone else was hopelessly dry - Radcliffe seemed somewhat animated once he downed that luck potion but otherwise he could barely muster more than a bewildered stare. Watson looked in physical pain or as if her soul was being compromised. The cinematography though nice all around, succeeded in washing out any warmth, which I suppose was the point, but some of the cast just looked ghastly - which I guess was also the point. Action sequences were far and few between the plodding of scenes in which little was explained - HUGE, significant chunks of the story were completely not there; i.e Voldemort's thinking behind the Horcruxes, Snape's past in Hogwarts, the room of requirement - there was no build up for any of the really big meaningful moments so that most of the pivotal scenes were flat - even the climax, which was supposed to be deeply heart wrenching (why have Harry just witness from below in that random basement thing when the scene in the book was so much superior - why not capitalise on the drama that is already there?)I have no idea what David Yates was thinking, what the editor was thinking and what the execs were thinking giving the thumbs up to a hollow, hollow film. Even if I wasn't a fan of the books, I would still think the same - I was severely bored. To achieve that from a brilliant story is quite a remarkably awful feat.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
379,Skoveng77,This is utter CRAP!!!,2,22 July 2009,"There is no words strong enough to express my disappointment after seeing the sixth Harry Potter movie! I thought Order of the Phoenix was tragic, but as hard it might be to believe, Half-Blood Prince is worse!I'll just get right into the bad stuff: First and foremost; where was Scrimgeour? Where was Dobby and Kreature? Where were the Dursleys? Where was Fleur and Bill? And of course, where were all the scenes and details belonging to those characters? Not only were people, with their respectable scenes, left out, they left out scenes and details with people that were there too. Harry doesn't go and sit with Neville and Luna on the Hogwarts Express, he goes directly to the Slytherins. Tonks doesn't fetch Harry from the train, Luna does. There is no DADA class. There is no 'Weasley is our King' song, or any reference to Roonil Waslib' either. And the students hardy ever wear robes! Last time I checked, Hogwarts has a uniform code! That means that you must wear school robes! Dumbledore doesn't show Harry even half as many memories as he did in the book. Also, Dumbledore is not as much present in the film as he was in the book. It's like what was considered as the main storyline in the book has been just added in as a sideline story in the film. I'll even go one better than that; those who knows the book well enough will clearly notice that whole chapters have been take out the film to make room for other things. Steve Kloves and David Yates have completely gutted the book and put in their on crap! Thanks, guys, thanks for ruining Harry Potter for me. Can't wait to see how much you're gonna screw up the Deathly Hallows. In my opinion, the whole movie gives out a presence of low-budget, too-close-to-deadline, and lack of interest and efforts. The only people who does a good job in this film is a few chosen actors, which is Tom Felton, Rupert Grint and Jessie Cave. Tom Fenton gives a very strong and deep performance in this film, and has finally been given the chance to show that he can actually act. In this film, Draco is this eerie, dark figure that looms around in the dark corners and is constantly hurting. If I hadn't known better, I'd say this is a film about Draco, not Harry. Grint has always been one of the best British comedians of modern time I have seen, and now he has proved it yet again. He must've faced a much more physical challenge in HBP than in any other HP movie he's done before, but then again, the older he gets, the more is expected of him. Fortunately, he is more than up for the job. Jessie Cave was, in my case, the wild card. Never seen her before, but she so definitely filled the role as the love-sick Lavender Brown to a tee. Over-acted a bit maybe, but that's OK considering Lavender is quite the drama queen in the book as well. I have always loved the Phelps twins, but this time around they hardly got any screen time at all. (The only comfort I have as a Norwegian, is the James and Oliver came to Norway to party in Oslo on the eve of the midnight pre-premiere of the film.) I have never had too much interest in Daniel Radcliffe after Goblet of Fire, but he's never been a bad actor. However, a few moments of comedy is not going to same him this time. He just did his job, and that was it. This resulted in Harry not making very much of himself. This is a Harry Potter film, and thus should Harry Potter be more present on the scene. Luckily, the Harry Potter character was well supported by the Ginny Weasley character, which means that Bonnie Wright was given a great deal more screen time than before. In all the chaos of tossing the characters about, leaving out essential scenes, people, quotes and other details,they inputed two major scenes that is not in the book, but it would be a bit unfair to say that they are bad, because they're not. Everybody probably knows from the trailer that The Burrows gets attacked by the Death Eaters. This scene is spectacular, a true countryside house inferno. But unnecessary since it didn't happen in the book. This also means, they put in the attack/house fire to replace the Christmas holiday when Scrimgeour visits. The other scene is Harry and Ginny in the Room of Requirement. Harry does hide the Half-Blood Prince's Potions Book in the Room, but not at the time that is stated in the book. In this new scene, he goes up there with Ginny, so that she can hide the book for him. Something else happens in the Room that did happen in the book, but at another time. So, in other words, they took two details out of two different scenes to create this one. It's a good scene, but I've got to say that I'd rather have the original scenes. But two great scenes, three great actors and a massive hype cannot save this film. It is by far the worst Harry Potter film yet. They left out too much. You want Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince? Read the book.PS! Don't get me wrong, because Mark Williams is a good actor, but I want to state a fact here; Arthur Weasley is practically BALD! Why does Williams suddenly have LONG HAIR for the role?",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince

The book has two main focuses: Voldemort's back story and the setup for the war that occurs in Deathly Hallows. In terms of Voldemort's back story the movie does a fantastic job in bringing to life the memories that were included. The memory depicting the first meeting between Dumbledore and young Tom Riddle is just about perfect. And the way the memories of Riddle getting the information on Horcruxes from Slughorn. The portrayal of Riddle's hesitancy, casualness, and calmness that succeeded in attaining the information he wanted. It is a flaw in the movie that the memory of Riddle visiting the old lady with that unusual name I'd never heard of where Riddle first sees Hufflepuff's cup and Slytherin's Locket. While the story of the Locket isn't hurt that much in the movie because it's clear when it appears that it is a Horcrux the Cup is the bigger issue. In Deathly Hallows Part 2, viewers who haven't read the books will have had no introduction to the Cup and will be confused about the how and why of it being a Horcrux. When making the book to movie transition I would have cut out that retarded Ron-Lavender and Dean-Ginny stuff and instead included more Voldemort memories, especially the memory where he learns of the Cup and Locket. The memories that were well done and wonderfully brought to life but at least one more should have made the cut. As for the war setup this was pretty well done. This is the volume at which Harry Potter has truly become dark. Sorcerers Stone was charming and innocent. The next four movies were mixed with Chamber of Secrets tilting lighter and Goblet of Fire and Order of the Phoenix tilting darker. But Half Blood Prince is truly and completely dark. From start to finish the tension is palpable as one thing after another leads to serious tone. We start with a muggle bridge collapse, have Katie's tragedy, and climax with Dumbledore's death. The characters come off as hardened by what's going on around them. The last of childhood innocence is gone and everyone and everything has grown up. The acting is great as it always is in Harry Potter. Daniel and Emma are splendid in their main character roles. Love Evanna in her role as Luna. I'd have liked to have seen Luna have a bigger role in both the movie and the book but I tell you what, Evanna does a beautiful and memorable job with what she is given. And although he never reaches Richard Harris performance, Michael Gambon gives his best performance in the Dumbledore role in Half Blood Prince. And of course Alan Rickman is still deliciously perfect as the complex Snape. What's interesting here is that the significance of Dumbledore's death and the circumstances surrounding it and events leading up to it aren't apparent until you've either read or watched Deathly Hallows. This is largely a setup story but you don't really know what's being set up until Deathly Hallows. I like that the cinematography has gone dark to match the tone of the stories. This is well shot film with a fitting atmosphere and color scheme. Nicholas Hooper does a good job on the score but I'll always wish John Williams could have done the whole Harry Potter series. One thing I'd like to single out is that I much prefer how Dumbledore's death is treated in the movie than the book. The students wand tribute is much more genuine and heartfelt than the more formal and stately funeral in the book. The pacing is uneven. The first third and final third of this movie are totally awesome baby! But I do find myself fast forwarding quite a bit during the second third. I really could have done without the romance/sexuality stuff. More Voldemort memories would have been better. Nevertheless I give a full 10 here because this movie is greater than the sum of its parts. The relevant parts are beautifully brought to life. And the movie has an emotional sincerely about it, especially during the tragic climax. Due to darkness and emotional intensity this movie should only be people in middle school or older. The bridge collapse, Katie's tragedy, and especially Dumbledore's death are far too emotionally intense for elementary school children. I don't know why this wasn't PG-13. Also elementary school children will likely find this movie less interesting than the first five Harry Potter movies as it's slower paced with less action and more setup and has no child appeal elements. Overall Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince is a wonderful movie that earns its stripes. Faithfulness to the Book: 8 out of 10. Casting and acting: 10 out of 10. Special effects and visuals: 10 out of 10. Music: 7 out of 10. Pacing: 6 out of 10. Overall: 10 out of 10. Greater than the sum of its parts.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
381,BlackCat725,Too much snogging and not enough passion...,7,15 July 2009,"They cut all of the heart out of this movie. After reading the comments here, I'm even MORE disappointed in this movie, because I had rushed through HBP in order to read Deathly Hallows back in 2007. The movie, on it's own, is very good. But huge important scenes from the book were left out (Voldemort back story too brief), completely stupid scenes put in (the Weasley's house) and the ending was bland and anticlimactic when it should have been deeply moving. Another reviewer commented on the lack of applause at the end, I noticed that too in my theater. The girl behind me who commented (frequently) ""that didn't happen"" was somewhat annoying, but totally right. UGH, I'm SO tired of movies that could have easily been PERFECT but aren't.OK, ranting aside, Ron was wonderful during the Quidditch scenes and Harry was a total HOOT during the Felix Felicitas scenes. I will most likely see it again because my son wants to and I will find that the movie will grow on me like ""Order of the Phoenix"" did. But once again, I walk out of the first viewing sorely disappointed.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
382,Moragandjim58,Dull dull dull,3,24 July 2009,"This could have been superb. The book was by far the best of the series, but yet again David Yates has somehow contrived to rip the soul out of the story just as he did with Order of the Phoenix.I had high hopes that with the return of Steve Kloves doing the screen writing and with the resounding criticism of the Order of the Phoenix ringing in David Yates ears we would see a dark and sometimes chilling story. Sadly I was so wrong.Instead it felt in parts like an English farce with giggling girls, pubescent innuendo and an emphasis on 'snogging' (cue more giggling).Sections of the story made no sense as they simply did not occur in the book, and major portions, such as the Horcrux search and Dumbledores funeral had vanished. I cannot fathom how Yates justifies leaving the funeral scene on the cutting room floor, particularly given the public comments Daniel Radcliffe made on how moving that scene was. Instead he leaves in crass love scenes and teenage angst. If thats what he wants, go and direct a Hannah Montana movie.The appalling thing is he is doing the final two movies as well, so I presume we can anticipate tedium, and disjointed story lines because he can't resurrect that which he has chopped out in this film.Shame on you Yates for killing a superb story.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
383,centralbeerangi,Where is this movie's Horcrux????,4,15 July 2009,"Dude, ""Where is the Horcrux of this film??"" The film is soul-less. Warner Bros has successfully torn the story's soul apart and have hidden it: my guess as to where the pieces are?? How about in each of the $200 plus million bucks this movie is going to easily earn. That is the tragedy. The movie is an empty shell robbed of the richness of the original story and the characters. Make no mistake...the production is stupendous, special effects are a marvel, the music is suitably brooding and Gothic, and the actors shuffle about mouthing dialogue and play their parts. The suspense element, what little of it is on screen is also terrific. There simply isn't enough of the good stuff. By cutting out a significant chunk of the bad guy's back story and various elements charting the growing emotional and romantic relationships among the leads especially Ginny/Harry and perhaps reserving an important concluding sequence from the book for the next film installment, what had all the elements for a great movie is now simply a just another summer movie. Conclusion: a well made empty film that is going to earn a zillion bucks.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
384,jpach31,Best Potter Yet,10,16 July 2009,"If you have not seen the 6th installment of the Harry Potter series of movies, then you need to see it again, again, and again. With the other 5 movies compared, this one outranks them. I have seen all Harry Potter movies on premiere nights and read all 7 books. But nothing compares to the sheer enjoyment of seeing it first-hand. This movie continues the story of the boy who lived and how he has to face to meet the sticky end and destroy one of the powerful darkest wizards of all time. Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint & Emma Watson give outstanding performances. My congratulations goes to JK Rowling and David Yates, especially to JK, she has poured her heart out over these books and my thoughts and prayers are with her as continues to write and tell her story the best way she could. When this movie comes out on DVD in December I will be getting it to add to my collection. I give this movie a 20 for great special effects and a great storyline.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
385,camkid8,A good Harry Potter film but not as good as I expected,7,16 July 2009,"I saw this film expecting it to be great, even better then the Order of the Phoenix, which in my opinion is the best Harry Potter film. But it wasn't as good as the fifth one. I read the book which I thought was great but the movie just didn't live up to expectations. It seemed like the director focused more on love and romance then the darkness that is happening in the film. It wasn't until the ending of the film where the movie seemed to shift it's plot from romance to fighting Voldemort and the Death Eaters. The ending battle was cut out of the film because there will be one similar in the Deathly Hollows part two and I can understand that but the battle scene was really cool in the book and the fight between Snape and Harry was only a couple minutes long with little dialogue exchange and Dumbledore did not have his funeral but it might be in the Deathly Hallows part 1. The battle scene between Snape and Harry was powerful in the book but not to great in the movie. So this movie is good, but not great like I expected it to be.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
386,alvispotter-1,just outstanding!,10,22 August 2009,"I'm gonna start by saying i'm a huge Harry Potter fan, so i know every detail of almost every book.For example, i have read Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince 3 times, one before this movie came out.The book, as everyone will agree, is completely amazing from the beginning to the end. It's as dark as it can get and still JK Rowling manages to combine it with some romance, but of course the main topic is Voldemort's memories and Dumbledore's tragic death.The movie, well, it's completely amazing from the start. David Yates did amazingly good in the direction of this movie. The duration of the film is quite right and it has everything that had to be included from the book. Some may disagree about this, but i'm gonna explain you why.The disappearance of the Dursley in unimportant, because there's no real message there. They meet Slughorn just as in the book. Bill and Fleur announcement of getting married would have slowed the movie down, maybe they'll mention it on Deathly Hallows, maybe not, but it's not the biggest deal. Luna did amazingly on saving Harry at Hogwarts express, instead of Tonks, which i thought was a good idea. Everything Malfoy does to fix the Vanishing cabinet is perfectly done. It has an amazing romance plot, from which they didn't cut almost anything from the book. All about the potions book was successfully put on screen, as well as Quidditch.But to more important details: the darkness and ending of the book. The movie doesn't compare to the book's darkness, but that's because they had to remove some of Voldemort's memories in order to make a decent duration, one in which many people who hadn't read the book would maybe had thought it was too long. They put the memories that mattered most, and how they explained the Horcruxes was perfect, understandable for a non-reader. About the whole ending: the cave was INCREDIBLY done, as well as how they killed Dumbledore (even though Harry wasn't under the cloak, which felt more dramatic that he wasn't under it). Okay, i admit i also felt surprised they had cut off the final fight, but i started thinking and got to this conclusion: The movie was reaching the 2 hours and a half, AND IN DEATHLY HALLOWS THERE IS ANOTHER BIG FIGHT AT HOGWARTS, SO THEY'D BE REPEATING MANY PARTS OF THE HOGWARTS FIGHT WHICH IS MEANT TO BE IMPRESSIVE ON DEATHLY HALLOWS!!! Besides, it doesn't change the plot. And the funeral, well, i wasn't one who was so interested on this, so i thought they nailed it at putting them on the astronomy tower talking about RAB and all.But most importantly: the weird scene at the middle. I have to admit i don't understand why they did that, cause i don't think it was to add action. Maybe they want to cut off the wedding or something. When i see Deathly Hallows i will surely understand, but that was weird.Sorry it's been so long. I just loved it. And ALL the performances were amazing, specially Michael Gambon, Tom Felton, Alan Rickman, Jim Broadbent and Helena Bonham Carter. Rupert, Daniel and Emma also nailed it, giving their best performance. IT'S BEEN MY FAVOURITE POTTER MOVIE, and one of my world's favorites. I've seen it four time on theaters and can't wait for it to come out on DVD. And, of course, i'm impatient for both parts of Deathly Hallows, which was my favorite Harry Potter book.I REALLY RECOMMEND IT. You won't regret it; on the contrary, you'll love it. JUST OUTSTANDING! Well done Yates.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
387,buggyinthevolvo,Harry Potter and the Half fun movie,5,29 November 2009,"I have to say i felt a bit bored during this movie, about 3/4 of the film is about love, which was a lot of fun but uneventful and the history of Voldemort which basically builds up to pratically nothing ! there is no excitement at the end, and the last fight scene and death of Dumbledore was way too rushed. So to me this was one of the films that make me go... that is it ? But still this film had a few positives as well. This is was a more of a different but still unique harry film mostly about love and relationships. The movie spends a lot of time with that so it feels like there is no major threat even though Dumbledore makes it sound big, it lacks in the feel. But the visual effects of the film is outstanding and it is a pretty funny film, but not dark enough to satisfy me. the build up is the stand out point of the film, but the climax was just too short and unfinished.Enjoyed harry potter 1,2,3,4 and 5. But this one was disappointing.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
388,thechrisclarkblog,The Magic Continues To Mature,8,14 December 2009,"I have yet to see a ""Harry Potter"" film that didn't impress me; that holds true with ""Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"", the most mature of the lot and perhaps the best written. Continuing with the trend begun in ""The Goblet of Fire"", people will die, Voldemort's army of Death Eaters will make huge strides, and the courage of Harry Potter will be stretched to the limit. The result is another installment that continues to take this nearly perfect film franchise into darker and darker territory. The magical world that was once so whimsical and inviting has become home to unspeakable evils; on screen, this translates to a more realistic and gritty universe, drawing even more relevant comparisons to our own world than the previous installments. Some might be offended by the lack of the glitzy magic tricks that worked so beautifully before; I, however, believe that they would have felt out-of-place here. The magic presented here, more subdued and dramatic, is exactly what ""The Half-Blood Prince needs"". It is a clear sign of the series' maturation.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
389,Othy59,Harry Potter and the Half-Cooked Film,5,22 July 2009,"Like many millions of other people out there I have read the book of the Half-Blood Prince but unlike most I found the book to be a little plodding and too talkative, but with an action packed and exciting ending that left me, strangely, wanting more. Now that the film is out for release I didn't hesitate to go and see it because, quite frankly, I think the films are better than the books.But the problems arose quite quickly when I saw that all the bad points that I found with the book had been taken and *expanded* on for the film. What I got from this two and-a-half hour film was half an-hour of some exciting stuff happening and two hours of people blathering about relationships and so on with a bit of rampant teenage hormones thrown in for good measure.The developing relationship between Ron and Hermione being tested by the arrival of Lavender Brown was a nice little addition but I felt that it was too long and got in the way of the plot and characters (some who just made entrances and exits). They got in the way so much that they seemingly shifted Harry too far to the side lines. Even the discovery of Voldemort's heritage and family were cut down considerably to make room for more banter, more teenage hormones, snogging and other boring things that detract from the story.Gone is Harry's pain of loosing his godfather, gone is a lot of the story of Voldemort and what made him so evil, and gone is a lot of the mystery as to who the half-blood prince is. The end result is that everything seemed so snipped together and strange that when they finally got to the revelation to the thing about the horcrux (however it's spelled) I was just too bored to care.And that brings us to the lackluster ending, I said before that the ending of the book was exciting and action packed, well this ending had been so repressed I was just fed up by then because nothing about it kept me awake. Hopefully everything will be rectified with the last story (set in two parts apparently) and maybe then we'll have some excitement and we'll have some pain (emotionally that we can feel along with). The performances were still top notch from the young and older cast, there's still a great atmosphere of magic but it was just too ponderous, which is a shame because a lot more could have been done for the two and-a-half hours.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
390,athlbr3,A Very Well Done Installment in the HP Series,8,31 October 2020,"I'm glad that I saw this film in theatres for the first time last month. The directing is very inspired and I love the slow transformation of Harry and Dumbledore's relationship from a mentor-student one to a somewhat more balanced one. Also, this film shows once again that romantic relationship choices is not JKR's strong suit. Harry and Hermione have so much chemistry together (or at least Daniel and Emma)!",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
391,donna_lutze,The worst HP Movie,8,20 December 2018,"I don't hate that movie, but for a HP movie, the whole movie isn't really good...maybe because Dumbledore dies, I'm not sure...
The movie is still a good one and very important for the story..",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
392,Jossgod,Horrible!,1,21 January 2010,"It is shocking that a film can have such great material to work with and still be so bad. The book contained wonderfully rich characters, action scenes, romance, humor, realistic emotions, and a plot that managed to still make sense and hold up under intricate dissection. Why the writer and director deemed the original material unsuitable I will never know. They seemed to labor under the delusion that if the characters had the same names, and they recreated 5 percent of a few scenes from the book, this would be enough. It doesn't come close to capturing the magic (both the kind the reader feels and the wands and wizards produce) of the literary work. My only tip is: if you like the book, don't bother with the film. If you've never read the book, don't bother with the film.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
393,rsre4-1,Worst of the Bunch.,3,16 July 2009,"I've never felt compelled to write a review until now. This movie left me so empty that I almost walked out before it even really finished. To take the words from other reviews, this movie was soulless and anti-climatic. The movie makers chose to emphasize the wrong side of the story. It felt more like a teen love/sex comedy than a Harry Potter flick. The hormones were played up, while the Voldemort back-story felt more like an afterthought. Even the ""memory"" of when Dumbledore meets Tom seems irrelevant because it doesn't really explain much. It doesn't explain Tom's pain and awkwardness and doesn't really set the stage for who he becomes. We don't learn anything about his parents or his family, which, to me, is an important element in his becoming Voldemort.Many of the characters were basically useless and wouldn't have been missed if they didn't appear (Luna, Tonks, Lupin, Neville) and others are never really introduced (Fenrir Greyback)or included (Bill Weasly). Although I feel this was Michael Gambon's best performance as Dumbledore, the island scene didn't do enough to convey the pain Dumbledore was feeling, which sets the stage of what we learn in the next installment. In many scenes, there were ""awkward silence"" moments like the movie makers weren't sure what to do next, so they just had everyone stand around staring at each other a bit, then just moved on.And the total omission of the final battle was just plain inexcusable. I was so looking forward to the battle and to seeing Hagrid taking on Deatheaters. But..nothing. It was like climbing a tall slope on a roller coaster knowing the long drop on the other side, only for them to stop the ride when you reach the top and let you off. The Dubmledore death scene was not done well at all either. He didn't come across like a weak, helpless victim, but like someone who was ready to die. That felt totally wrong.Many attribute the shortcomings of some of the Potter movies to the studio trying to make the movies appeal to more than just fans of the books. THe problem is: if you read the books, you'll be very disappointed with the movie, but if you didn't read the book, there'll be many things in the movie that won't make sense.In the end, I almost wanted to cry at how disappointed I was with this movie. When I had read that writer Steve Kloves was back after being absent for OOTP, I was willing to give director David Yates a pass for the shortcomings of The Order of the Phoenix movie. But I can't do that now. The fact is he's just not the right director for this franchise. Unfortunately, since he's also directing Deathly Hollows, I fear I have two more Harry Potter movie disappointments in my near future.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
394,dorkyj2002,My lowest rating for an HP film,5,16 July 2009,"***Spoilers*** I had so many high hopes for this film. I loved movies 1-5, but I did stop reading during the 4th book. I always felt that the HP movies did the books great justice- probably the best book-to-movie adaptations so far. But this one was awful. Yes I do understand that the movies will never be as good as the book/the movies will always leave something out. But I never thought I'd give an HP film any lower than a 7/10. I gave this one a five.Because I haven't read the HBP (yet), I was completely lost; very little made sense to me. I've never had a problem with the other films, even if I hadn't read the books. It had been such a gap between when I read the books and saw the films, that it was almost as if I hadn't read them at all.I agree with a lot of the reviewers about this being along the lines of ""Twilight on steroids,"" except for the fact that this is a better quality film (and much more of a story, in my opinion). There was way too much focus on relationships and teen angst. There wasn't enough attention to the bigger parts of the plot, the more necessary ones. I kept waiting for ""the good stuff"" to come up, but as soon as DD is killed, I realized the credits were almost going to appear- and I was left there hanging by a thread. I didn't even cry for DD, but I cried for Sirius; that's unacceptable in my book. I should've been a wreck for DD (especially since I didn't realize that DD died in the 6th book). I guess I was so unsatisfied from the rest of the film. I was somewhat puzzled as to why the whole Quidditch match was about Ron. I mean I know he was the main point of the match, but it was too fast for what was shown without him. My husband and our good friend were listing all the things they missed from the book- and that was for almost an hour. There were maybe four or five really intense fighting-conflict scenes.But nevertheless, not all was lost in the latest installment. The acting was superlative. I was grateful for more Rickman screen time :-D. And Watson plays jealous and angry very well ha-ha. The scene between Radcliffe & Gambon in the cave was absolutely brilliant and heart-wrenching. Radcliffe still has a lot of ways to go to become the ""Man-Who-Lived,"" but he's certainly on his way. I truly hope they'll do better with the Deathly Hallows films. They are splitting that film into two, which I'm hopeful they'll do better with plots & details. At least there will be more action in the DH movies.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
395,Leopold005,Harry Potter and the Half-Baked Movie,1,10 August 2009,"Before I begin, I will say now that I've never so much as picked up a Harry Potter book. So all I have to go on is the content of the film; I have no idea what should or should not be in there. However, I've seen the size of the book, and I'm pretty sure there's more in it than this film conveys.The film started off promisingly enough, but then it became two and a half hours of unrequited love, teenage angst and the odd mildly interesting vignette. All of the original whimsy, speed and intrigue of the earlier films seems to have been washed away and replaced with this notion that making the films dark and moody is enough.I suspect David Yates has aspirations towards Tim Burton. He should stop. Now. One Burton is quite enough, in my view.This is not the worst film I've ever seen. But it runs a very close second.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
396,smithmjsjsmith,Pretty Lame,7,16 August 2009,"The Harry Potter franchise will only be remembered for its novels, the movies are horrible compared to the books. The sixth book was way too much different from the movie. The acting and movies were horrible once again. Snape and Malfoy in the book hated Harry Potter much more in the book than the movie. Characters that should have played a big role in the film should have been: the new Minstry of Magic (but he isn't seen or mentioned in the film). Romlinda Vane allows appears in one scene, and doesn't play a big role at all. Why does Tonks look so different, the werewolf played a much smaller role than the book (he doesn't even speak in the film). Some of the stuff in this film should have been rated PG-13, like when Harry Potter used the Sectumsempra spell on Malfoy. Slughorn in the flashbacks doesn't look any younger than the present time. Pretty sloppy acting, lines, and directing. I wouldn't waste your time seeing this. The book is much more interesting.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
397,lemurlou,"Great Movie, but the book is better",8,15 July 2009,"This was one of the better Harry Potter films. I thought the acting and character development was good, as well as the sets, costuming, music and other basics that make a film good. Alan Rickman (Severus Snape) is genius, as always, and Bonnie Wright (Ginny Weasley) is excellent as well.As for the storyline, the movie pales in comparison to the book – but then, when was the last time you saw a movie that was better than the book? That's to be expected. There are some major changes, including the addition of an action scene and the subtraction of another action scene. Also, they leave out some important information that Dumbledore discusses with Harry and a significant portion of the ending, but maybe they plan to do that in the next film. Even with the darker mood, they do manage to get some humor in there, which is one of my favorite things about the books.However, I did think the lighting in the movie was too dark. I realize that this is on purpose to set the mood, but I'd rather see the actors in a movie than have the perfect mood setting. I also thought there were some times when the film moved too slowly. I thought the foreshadowing was too obvious, but maybe for someone who hasn't read the books it wouldn't be.I think the movie would probably be confusing to people who haven't read the books. I started reading them after becoming confused by the 4th movie, and the movies, I assume, have just become considerably more confusing each year. These films, also, are part of a series and are not meant to be watched alone any more than one book in a series is meant to be read alone.

Almost every Harry Potter film I've seen have gotten better and better than the last one. Although the Goblet of Fire is my favorite one out of the films, this one runs pretty close to replacing it. I love how Ron and Hermione's relationship begins to grow stronger and I almost cried when Dumbeldore dies at the end. I think that the Deathly Hallows will be just as great as the other 6 films and I cannot wait for its release this November.

When I look the mechanics of the film, i would say it is just okay because there is no special addition, i think there could be more creative camera angles etc. I give one zero but i can't so give 1.

Little action, much comedy, and staying very true to the book gave me mixed feelings. i didn't think it was my favorite. I saw it again because I thought I needed too, and let me just say, bravo. It has such a good story, a lot more action than I thought, and some very funny scenes. The cave scene was exactly how I imagined it. The only little problems I had were the flashbacks- they're weren't enough! I don't see how they can do some things with the 7th one without them, but who knows.

401,ThePeruvianPost,The Worst HP Movie !,6,11 July 2019,"(A POTTERHEAD'S REVIEW) ""It seems, despite your exhaustive defensive strategies, you still have a bit of a security problem David Yates, because you have demonstrated with the sixth instalment to unconditional fans how a great book could end up being nothing more than a basket-case film"".It caught me by surprise when I watched the movie, because every single HP film predecessor had an enormous impact on me and, technically, most of them received a respectable mark. However, when you take a look at the Half-Blood Prince, you will spot there are so many things missing which, actually, made the saga enjoyable and mysterious. We do not know the main reason why the theme seemed to turn darkish and way too serious, my theory is that director Yates wanted to reach the climax in order to fully understand (emotionally) the Deathly Hallows. It is not a strong argument, though. Because, it subjects the audience to more than 120-minute film with no laughs, charisma and our beloved trio-interaction whatsoever. The film tries to bring a Dark-Night theme without needing to because there are so many creative ways where you are able to impress and impact on someone, just glance over The Order of The Phoenix and suddenly, you will realize it is some of the most balanced flicks of the franchise. By the same token, the sixth instalment showed how terribly wrong emotions work between lovers. The reason? Constructing relationships at the last minute, in order to add what was supposed to be added during the past seven years, take the example of Ron-Hermione and Harry-Ginny. If you are a Harry-Potter-bookworm guy, this was some of the heaviest flaws ever presented in the franchise, because it took time to be emotionally willing and prepared, I am confirming this because David Yates (and previous HP directors) disregarded the sensitive impact. Finally, but not least, it is crucial to mention the book's plot and important events which were not taken into account as some of the most thunderous battles ever told, the Dumbledore's Army subplot, Snape's struggling past as a kid and Voldemort's aspirations. It would be extremely simple to look on the bright side of the film because basically, every single HP director provided remarkable visual effects and impressive shoots at some landscapes, visage expressions, etc.I left the theatre overwhelmed by what I have watched. It just felt terrible. The worst HP movie is here! (58/100)",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
402,korppoolainen,Severely lacking plot and fluidity,4,3 January 2011,"Rather than watching this movie and complaining about how much they left out from the book and saying how annoyed I am that they let me down. I choose to look at it from another perspective, at least I have read the book and I know the full story, if they leave bits out (which they have, in droves) then I know the actual story so I can fill the blanks (which there are many!) with the information I acquired from the book.So in my opinion, I feel sorry for Harry Potter fans who went to watch this and have not read the book, because there is so much more going on, there are so many more tales to tell and much more information given to the reader than this movie portrays. And I mean, A lot! To the movie itself, it would seem all the finances went into the effects and not much else because the plot is wafer thin (as mentioned most of the important information from the book is discarded), there is no fluidity throughout the film (it's very stop start) and there is no character cohesion like in the previous movies. It seems like it was cut and edited in a hurry and a lot of scenes were left out that could have gel'd the movie together much better.I mark it 4/10 in my unbiased view of the movie. Otherwise I would mark it 1/10 due to the complete abomination it has made out of the book. If the movie makers wish to use a books title to sell movies, they should really be forced to use 90% of the books contents.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
403,Aj_Cheema,A middling adaptation,6,19 July 2009,"Though I was rather disappointed with the tiresome attempts to make a optimistic yet serious book into a 'comedy for the family', and the pathetic acting in the initial stages of the film, and the fact that the filmmakers left out so many essential sub-plots and events that would otherwise render the movie incomprehensible to a non-reader; I was impressed with the special effects and the terrific latter half of the film. Even though the filmmakers chose to compress a lot of the core of the book in just a few moments, it's still executed well enough to warrant the 153 minute run-time. For once, a Harry Potter adaptation does not feel rushed and incoherent, though it does feel awfully truncated.My particular gripe with this film is the exclusion of Dumbledore's funeral, which was probably cut for being 'too heavy'. Overall, though, its a summer-movie worth the price of admission, which in the time of 'Transformers' and never-ending sequels, is saying a lot. Verdict:7/10.PS: do read the books if you haven't already, they have more depth, are infinitely more entertaining, and you will have improved your vocabulary if nothing else.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
404,sharmari1,Absolute Rubbish! They changed several parts from the actual book! Disappointing!,2,18 July 2009,"I have purchased all the Harry Potter movies thus far; however, this one I will not bother to purchase. It is not worthy of my collection. Harry Potter followers waited a long time for this particular movie. We all know that there was trouble with production, as well as fatalities, and this is what we get for our wait?! Absolute Rubbish!I believe a number of people mentioned that the book was better, and that they left a lot of bit out of the movie. If only that were the worst thing they did. Sometimes it is necessary to cut certain parts out, as and entire book could end up making one very long movie. So that I understand.However, changing the content of the actual book/ story, was what murdered this movie for me. The producers of this movie actually did exactly that. They changed part of the actual book. I didn't know that they could do that. Perhaps the writer gave them permission, but it was a huge mistake. Having said that, even if you had not read the book, the movie was total rubbish. The worst part for me, was the extra bits they threw in that were not in the book, just so they could give the retarded & ugly Helen Carter more parts in the movie. Please do not misunderstand me. Bellatrix from the book is a fascinating woman. I cannot say the same about Helena Carter, who is absolutely grotesque in every way. In the book, the Weasley's house never burned down, and the idiot character Bellatrix was no where near the Weasley's house at Christmas break ...or any other time for that matter! Neither was Bellatrix present at Hogwarts when the Malfoy let the Death Eaters in through the cabinet, or any other time for that matter! It was bad enough having her in the previous film, but to make-up parts that were not in the book, just to give the annoying woman extra parts was totally unforgivable!!! In fact, the only part that the character Bellatrix had in the entire book, was the part when her and her sister visited Snape at his home. And, even that part was changed from the book. Indeed, so many parts were changed from the actual book in this movie, that I can honestly say that they took very little from the actual book to put this movie together. Please, do not pay to watch this movie. It will be a total waste of your money. On the other hand, if you are an air-head who like any kind of action film, even if they have no rhythm or reason, then by all means go for it. :-) In truth, that is the only sort of person that could enjoy this movie! If you have a bit of imagination, the money is burning a hole in your pocket, then do yourself a favor and buy the book instead. It is so much better, and I wager your imagination can do a great deal better than the idiot producer/ directors of this movie!The only part of the whole movie that I quite enjoyed, was the part when Ronald Weasley thought that Harry had slipped him some of his luck potion, followed by some terrific moves in their Quidditch match. They even managed to ruin Harry and Ginny's first kiss! Not to mention, it was Hermoine that saw Harry, when he pretended to slip Ron the luck potion, not Luna. Also, it was Tonks that found Harry on the train after Malfoy froze him and broke his nose, not Luna with her goofy spectrespecs. It was Tonks that fixed Harry's broken nose with the Episky charm, not Luna. In fact, Tonks was was more of a main character in this book, and she was barely in the movie. All in all, it was the most disappointing, and the worst of the Harry Potter movies thus far. To the producers ...it was not worth the wait!!! I am certain that many Harry Potter fans agree with me, when I say, I sincerely hope that they get a different producer/ director for the Deathly Hallows. The plan is to split the book into 2 movies, because it is such a long book with a great deal more content than previous Potter books. So, come on people! They are suppose to be the last of the Harry Potter movies. Don't disappoint us by giving us more of this sort of rubbish! Having said that, it will be worth it to see Molly Weasley kill Helena ...I mean Bellatrix. :-) That is, if the idiot producers/ directors do not decide to cut that part of the book out as well ...or worse ...change it!",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
405,jhobbs123,Best Harry Potter Book and a good movie,8,23 July 2009,"""Half-blood prince"" is my favorite Harry Potter book and the movie was pretty good. The movie left out a lot of key details but that's not something to worry about because they can't put everything into the movie or the movie would be 12 hours. So, if you want to watch a 12 hour Harry Potter movie you might as well just read the book. I liked how well detailed the memory scenes of Tom Riddle are done and there is a lot of humor added to this movie. I thought it was hilarious when sexual jokes were made in the movie and everyone was laughing except for the 10 year olds and under. I thought it was hilarious that they didn't get the jokes and was shocked that the movie got only a ""PG"" rating because it does incorporate a good bit of suggestive material.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
406,jasleen_kaur,"Emotionally Stimulating, Dark, Hilarious...AMAZING!",9,15 July 2009,"Being a huge fan of the books, I tend to be a critic when it comes to weighing out the book and the film. I have noticed with the Harry Potter series as the books get bigger, the films generally get worse excluding The Goblet of Fire.This time, I WAS NOT LET DOWN. Despite being quite a large book, this film SURRENDERED to the book as much as it possibly could in the space of 2 hours and 33 minutes. Every single actors' acting has vastly improved and matured, especially Tom Felton's (Draco Malfoy) and Michael Gambon's (Dumbledore).There were moments that made me laugh hysterically, weep suddenly and jump as if I were having a heart attack.The opening of the film was PERFECT, despite being different to the book as it set the tone perfectly for the entire movie. Hormones did definitely rage in this film but they were not taking over the film and I felt we needed a good amount of hormone rage to balance the darkness with the good old Hogwarts atmosphere.Finally, the movie as a whole introduces fans of just the movie to the extremely deep darkness of the final two movies with the death, sadness and violence as well as a sense of the destruction of Hogwarts near to the end of the movie. It creates that sense within the person watching that the series is coming to an end and good sometimes doesn't always triumph.In terms of ranking, this was really up there with the first two movies and I know no Harry Potter film will be able to be compared to the ingenious of the last two as even without following the book, you could not fail to make a masterpiece.The bottom line is, this is only the tip of the iceberg: wait for the next two!",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
407,aid_h6,Meh.,6,26 July 2009,"I am not a big harry potter fan, and I would not rate any of the series more then 7 out of 10. Definitely not good enough to top either The prisoner of Azkaban or The Goblet of Fire. Ranking third in the series, I can say I was alright with it. Sadly enough, I was depending on this one to detour a little, to cover some of what was missed in the Order of the phoenix. Guess what? Didn't happen. Missing even more then the 5th one despite the 2 1/2 hour length, this will leave the people who did not read the book scratching their heads. So now I understand why the deathly hallows is being split into 2 parts; they have to fit both have the 6th book and almost all of the 5th book into it through either flashbacks, very tricky writing, or using the time travel magic again. Overall the action was weak, only the climax providing some ""HOLY CRAP"" moments. To answer a question, there is more quidditch, however not measuring up to the quality of the first or second movies. 6/10-Renter",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
408,koojaho13,Something is missing but the movie is definitely 'half-full' and not 'half empty'.,7,22 November 2010,"I've seen countless of reviews just listing things that was not in this movie. The film and the book are separate. They work differently and have different ways to tell the same story. Do not expect everything in the book to be in this film. I think we said goodbye to that when the Goblet of Fire was over 500 pages long. A movie CAN stay loyal to its source material without leaving out everything. The Half Blood Prince works that way just like any other previous installments did.This one starts out with a great opening. It's right where we had left off in the Order of the Phoenix. It's also like we're seeing something from the previous film that we had missed. Cameras flash, Bellatrix's voice echoes, sad choir music as the title comes forth; fantastic opening. It starts with a dark tone and is immediately followed by a disaster in London.If you thought the previous two movies were dark, wait till you see this one. This one is so dark that it needs comedic breaks every once in a while. Yates smartly adds the comedy here and there. And it's good comedy. Teenage romance is a big part of this film and that's what causes sympathetic laughter. The well developed characters allows this to happen. We seem the students of Hogwarts constantly growing even in this installment. We get to see more school life in part six rather than building tension to a climax. Quidditch is back and some might dismiss it as a waste of time but to me this was a refresher.To be honest the ending is disappointing. The Battle of Hogwarts is not there. But this was a great decision. Yates has saved that part for the seventh film and so you can think of the Half Blood Prince as a prelude. This is going to allow us to experience the great adventure that awaits us in the seventh film without feeling any repetition.The Half Blood Prince, while it does disappoint in some ways, is a great refresher as a whole and leaves the audience wanting more; a true accomplishment. It's a matter of whether you see this film as 'half full' or 'half empty' and I saw it as 'half full'.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince

When i got it on DVD i enjoyed it a lot more abd understood the stoyline a lot more. Some scenes were comical and Romantic. Sadly it's one of the underrated ones, i don't think it was as entertaining as the first four i certainly was quite impressed from the outcome and a big improvement from the last Harry Potter. It was quite a dark film and i thought the last 20 minutes were brilliant and action packed. It was good to find about Horcruxes and it was sort of the beginning of the end.

410,spencerallred,great movie with stunning visuals!,8,26 November 2014,harry potter and the half blood prince is the sixth installment in the franchise and to be honest with you this is probably one of the best harry potter films in the franchise it is probably 2nd in best looking film next to deathly hallows part 2 and they did a tremendous nice job with the special and visual effects it should have received a academy award for this movie is pure beautiful and the directing in this movie is wonderful and it hits you hard with deep satisfying music and art direction and again the acting is great as always but it seems like it has gotten enhanced up to this point in the franchise so in my opinion and reaction i would say that this movie is a great movie that will be enjoyed but there are some flaws that could get in the way of the movie when viewing but at times it can be ignored it depends on what type of person you are so i would give this film a low B+ to a high A-,Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
411,lastdomino,My thoughts . . . .,5,19 July 2009,"I will start by admitting that I prefer John Williams' music and I am something of a purist when it comes to the story. I went to this film with low expectations and my expectations were met.While I know that some really enjoyed the emphasis on the teen hormone thing, I felt like it was at the cost of other bits of the actual story. To fill bits that had been removed, new bits had to be written that were not in the book and in several cases, completely out of character for the ... character.There is too much book to have a scene by scene movie - no books can ever be done that way without becoming tedious. I feel, however, that if the characters are retained in all their purity, any necessary story revisions can be dealt with. That is where I saw the most frustration with the movie. Harry of the book, the introvert boy who needs to become a hero, is not the extroverted Harry of the movie. Nor is there a flamboyant Dumbledore in a purple suit to go to an orphanage to meet Tom Riddle for the first time. Minor bits, I suppose, but they were meaningful to the true color of character. Those losses tainted what should have been an OK film. I didn't expect good or excellent but I did hope for ""OK"".",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
412,fivesaints,Finally! A movie with some fiber :),9,24 July 2009,"Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince...After the screening, I had to sit back and let this movie sink into my brain because every single second of this movie was brilliant magic that keeps me so intrigued with the Harry Potter universe.Secondly, this movie was directed brilliantly with superb acting, but there are the avid book lovers that sometimes slander this film for its diverse path from the book or omitted details that they would have loved, but taken that only one person could direct the movie and not the entire fan book club, one must realize that a movie cannot be made to accommodate a full 600+ page book in an already long two and a half hour screen time.Personally, I love the whole series and it has been a tremendous success and compared to the other wastes this summer has offered with no direction and idiotic acting. (ex. Transformers 2) , this movie shows integrity and fiber and holds itself at a different caliber than just some ordinary cliché teenager movie with magic spells.In this movie, there is an abundance of character interaction and more than seen in previous harry potters, but I believe it was necessary to show strong character development as a culmination of Malfoy's change and Snape's allegiance with Dumbledore and confusion as a death eater etc...The direction for this movie regains the viewers emotional connection with these characters rather than they be shallow and underdeveloped. Overall there are some amazing scenes of friendship, love, and integrity that is all surrounded by the looming evil that is cascading upon the wizard world and Hogwarts.Overall...Great acting, great direction, amazing visuals, great character development, great script, and great story. This is just a great movie! One of the best movies this year. Two Thumbs Up! Rating ** 9/10",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince

Obviously these people have a learning disability.The two and a half hours flew by when I watched it. That's saying a lot considering how little action there is in this installment. At the end you finally feel like you learned something about the characters. That they are ""real"". That you can relate to them. Despite all the teenage Angst, Harry and friends are maturing.

I didn't expect it to be lifeless, colorless, stupid & idiotic. Let me describe my experiencemaybe that way we'll b on the same note.The movie started; slow. I thought there'd be a buildup. Then there were a few scenes that were deleted in the start. Then cut – Horace Slughorn. Yeah, I forgot to mention the beautifully decked death eaters who got like five minutes in this three hour long movie.Hogwarts seemed like some public school from the backyards of Bombay – no life at all. I didn't see any magic in the movie and don't even get me started on how they've wasted the performances.Snape? I mean, how can you waste an actor like Alan Rickman? They portrayed DD as some dumb old oaf (The inferuis scene was all visuals and no emotion) – I prefer the mines of Moria and the fires within. Daniel Radcliffe was wasted; Emma looks really beautiful and could've been used better. Rupert was playing his part. Ginnywell I thought she is dating Harry and not kissing her kid brother ""Sweet dreams."" There are a few good things such as Helena Bonham Carter (Oh my god !) She simply is super excellent. Weasley's Wizarding Wheezes is fun. Sets are good and the cinematography is technically good, but we've seen a lot of it in LOTR and it didn't quite fit the movie. The camera work is pathethic.And I must mention the editing: it's what a kindergarten kid would do. It's all scene – visual – music - cut. No linger, no fade and David Yateshaven't you heard of the word montage? Terrible Direction ! Please don't watch this insult to Harry Potter and let it live in the books. And allow the fools who have no clue about the story go and awe at the big fire and dead people in big cave and give this movie a high rating. For me I'm giving it a 1 / 10.

417,vivee003,Harry Potter & The Half Blood Prince - Spine-Chilling Fantasy Thriller,8,16 July 2009,"Just back after the FDFS of one of the most awaited movies of this year, the sixth installment of the Harry Potter series where Harry starts his sixth year at the Hogwarts school, in IMAX format, my first experience in this format...First of all, I haven't read any of the books in this series, so for me it was a very satisfying follow-up to the mediocre fifth installment with lots of surprises n shocks ! And to watch it in IMAX is an absolute privilege and it turned out to be a fascinating experience which provided many breath taking scary moments.The quality of picture n sound are also a revelation in this format....Now coming to the plot of the movie, as the death eaters and Voldemort are creating havocs in the muggle n wizard worlds, professor Snape joins in the mission of the Dark Lord while Draco Malfoy gets orders from Voldemort for a job... Later in the sixth year of Harry's schooling he discovers an advanced potion book which belonged to the ""Half Blood Prince"" which had more improved techniques in creating potions, scribbled by the owner of the book..At the same time Dumbledore lets Harry know about the dark childhood of Voldemort through memories, to find out how they can defeat the dark lord... Can Dumbledore n Harry stop Voldemort's job designated for Draco Malfoy, And who is really the ""Half Blood Prince"" forms the rest of the story...For me this is the second best installment in the series preceded by the fourth installment ""Goblet of Fire"".. Those who haven't read the book, you are in for some shocking n surprising elements during the penultimate moments which is more of an anti-climax... The twist at the end elevated the movie to another level IMO... The light moments in the former half really tickles your ribs...Acting : Almost everyone excels in the part.. Daniel Radcliffe came with a matured performance.. Rupert Grint's comic timing was commendable.. Emma Watson did a decent job with portraying Hermoine's emotional vulnerability... Tom Felton as Draco Malfoy n Bonnie Wright as Ginny did their parts well.. Actors who did the part of Snape and Dumbledore as usual came up with a masterful act...Script : Pretty good one, still had many potholes n confusing elements for those who haven't read the book...Direction : Good.. David Yates did entertain and maintained the pace throughout the movie but the love tracks in the former half was portrayed confusingly... Executed the penultimate seq with gr8 elan...Graphics/Visual Effects : Excellent... The first sequence of the movie where the death eaters attack a city contains some brilliantly executed CGI works... To experience the maximum beauty of this dept. you need to watch it in IMAX 3D atmosphere...Cinematography : Beautiful.. The first sequence, quidditch matches n some outdoor seq are really well taken...BG score & Sound Editing : Two thumbs up for this one like all others installments in this series... In IMAX atmosphere, its really a spine-chilling experience..To sum it up, a matured n tragic character driven installment to the Harry Potter series, that is what ""Half Blood Prince"" offers to you unlike previous happy ending fantasy rides, but stands a bit below ""Goblet of Fire"" in presentation...Verdict : Good..A definite summer blockbuster.WOM : As I said b4 those who have read the book doesn't seem to be satisfied with this.. Others like me are seeing it as good effort generally...Rating - 7.5/10",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince

I was never interested in the books, nor movie series, yet after reading a pretty snazzy review for the film in the paper, I thought that I might as well check it out.So sitting in the crowded theater with my friend Charlie, after an endless amount of trailers, the opening credits begin. A little more than 2 Hours, at least 5 death eaters, 20 broomsticks, and one dead Dumbledore through the movie the credits begin to roll.Wow, I thought. I exited the theater more quietly than usually, with one simple thought. Wow.Long story short, a week later I had finished all five of the other movies, and just yesterday finished the second book.

419,michyh1,It's Not Bad But Not Great,6,21 July 2009,"I think we need Alfonso Cuaron back & maybe another screenplay writer. I always liked Lawrence Kasdan's work. How about him? (If he's still alive, that is). If he isn't, bummer.The books are great & I've read them all. The only Potter movie I've liked was Prisoner of Azkhaban. The rest I saw once & filed them away to memory. This movie is like that....I don't think I'd want to see this twice. But I keep hoping....we have 2 more left. I hope they get those right.At the end it felt like I sat through a 2 Hour plus movie. I checked my watch twice. It's not like ""Lord of the Rings"". I saw all 3 multiple times & the time flew by...In general, I'm glad everyone has grown up & I think the acting has improved. The beginning held promise but I think they wasted a lot of time on some non-interesting segments. It's like a pieced together soap opera. Special effects are wonderful, though.There isn't THAT much kissing in the movie (thank goodness, I was prepping for the cringe feeling but luckily it wasn't too bad). However, nobody had chemistry in this one so I found myself not caring for who liked whom. Hermione likes Ron? I honestly couldn't see the reason for the attraction.....Luna Lovegood was interesting. Give her Harry instead.......oh wait, that wouldn't be following the books, sorry.Anyhow, if you want to waste some time or cool yourself off in an air-conditioned theater this summer, go for it.

420,rainbowpoet,Always A Dull Moment from Layabout Yates!,1,17 July 2009,"First of all, this film removes even more from the book than any of the others did from their books. While, as others have said, it is impossible to include EVERYTHING from a book so long into a movie so short, there is something to be said for the presence of loyalty in a big-screen fantasy story adaptation. It's only positive aspects were the performances for Ron Weasley's and Slughorn's characters.Detractors:Detractor Number One: The film focuses on love stories that are mostly footnotes in the book, and it doesn't even get the details of those stories right. How pathetic is that? The love arc between Harry and Ginny doesn't even exist in this, and that was one of my favorite parts of the series! It is altered into an awkward, laughable teenage disaster. First of all, Harry wasn't in love with her or even attracted to her for the whole book. He fell in love with her in the middle after realizing his jealousy over her relationship with Dean Thomas. He also spent quite a lot of time struggling with the possible ramifications of his feelings toward her, especially where his friend and Ginny's brother Ron is concerned. In this film, he shows interest in her from the beginning, completely derailing the rhythm of their story. He also doesn't seem to care at all about how this might jeopardize his friendship with Ron. This elevates his character's narcissism and undercuts his likability, making him come off as an inconsiderate snob. There are also moments between him and Ginny (and, occasionally, between them and Ron) that didn't even exist in the book, and those seem nothing but a waste of time. There are also key points from the book that Layabout Yates was too lazy to include, like the moment when Harry tells Ginny that he will have to leave her for the next year to fight Voldemort. Oh, and I forgot to mention that Ginny's relationship with Dean ISN'T EVEN SHOWN, NOT ONCE. They never show or even hint at Ginny and Dean's breakup, which not only makes her kiss with Harry seem underhanded, but it just comes off as utterly despicable storytelling. Furthermore, to move on to the other love story, Ron and Lavender dominate the movie! I'm fairly certain they show EVERY scene depicted in the book between the two of them, never showing the same consideration and attention to detail when dealing with ANY OTHER PLOT POINT IN THE BOOK, including the most important element, Tom Riddle's past. They must spend more than an hour detailing every curve down the winding and distracting path of this inconsequential arc. While that does add to the comedy of a few scenes, it mostly just steals focus from more important details. And, as is true with every Harry Potter story, ""The magic is in the details.""Detractor Number Two: Bill and Fleur, along with any mention of their relationship and engagement, are left out of the story entirely.Detractor Number Three: Dumbledore is, once again, portrayed without an ounce of grace or poise by the actor who took over for Richard Harris.Detractor Number Four: This is, perhaps, the biggest problem I have with the movie: THE BATTLE IN THE ENDING WAS OMITTED! What was Yates smoking when he had the mental breakdown that led to that decision? Does he realize that the movie would've attracted A LOT more viewers with that scene included? Not only that, but that particular sequence is vital to explaining parts of the next book (which Yates has proved conclusively that he's not talented enough to do justice to).Detractor Number Five: Voldemort doesn't even appear in the entire film, NOT ONCE! Now that I think about it, I take back what I said about Detractor Number Four (the absence of the final battle): THIS IS THE MOST REVOLTING MISTAKE OF THIS FILM! How is it possible to have a film based on the book 'The Half-Blood Prince' without even having Voldemort appear once? Wow, David Yates has outdone his own stupidity! I didn't think he could possible screw up this film as much as he did the fifth one, and I was right: he screwed it up even more!Detractor Number Six: Dumbledore is shown to be able to apparate in and out of the castle, as is Harry. In the books, neither can happen, as nobody is able to apparate within the grounds of Hogwarts. Not only that, but the only explanation for this is Dumbledore's completely unrelated words, ""Being me does have its privileges."" Give me a freaking break! Madame Rosmerta's role wasn't even touched upon. It seems there is no detail too large or too small for Layabout Yates to mishandle.Detractor Number Seven: Alan Rickman's portrayal of Snape in this film does what it never has before: it becomes lame. He actually looks bored every time he's on screen, including the uncharacteristic ""Shh"" he gives Harry while Harry hides below like a coward and Snape goes upstairs in the Astronomy Tower and kills Dumbledore. Snape even looks bored killing Dumbledore!Detractor Number Eight: There is almost no magic whatsoever. It's as if Hogwarts is merely a set for the characters to flirt in. It seems like the whole school year, at least in the movie, was a waste of time for everyone.Detractor Number Nine: Oh, screw it with the rest of the detractors! I've mentioned enough for you to get the idea. This movie disgraces not only the entire Harry Potter franchise, but Hollywood, Warner Brothers, and everyone else involved! How could a literary genius like J.K. Rowling, possibly the smartest and most detail-oriented fantasy writer alive, allow any company, no matter how much money was involved, to hack up any one of her works of art like this? I'm completely appalled!",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
421,bacarine,"Way better than OoTP, Yates, but you still have A LOT to learn...",6,13 November 2009,"If the human history is divided by the AC and DC periods, the HP's movies can be divided by the AY and DY periods.In the AY period, the worst vote that I give to a HP movie was to CoS, 7. In the DY period, this is the BEST vote that I give. I don't know what happen to J.K. Rowlling to approved this.Anyway, HBP is not a bad movie, way better than the weakness OoTP, but cut the Dumbledore's visit to Harry, almost all of the memories and the matches, the battle at the end and the Harry's relationship with Ginny is most unforgivable than the Avada Kedavra.The acting is good, but not exceed expectations ( by the way, why cut the letters with the Nom's results ? The scene of McGonagall conversation with Harry was confused for who not read the book because of this, don't you think ? ).Outstanding just for the Visual Effects. And why still change the books at this way ?There's no way to love this movie if you read the books.6/10 - try harder, Yates...To do this, follow the instructions bellow :I'm already waiting for the first DH's movie.By the way, the book divided on 2 movies is already a hope.But, since we have a year before the launch, Yates, please...don't forget the reunions of the death eaters and of the Order of the Phoenix at the beginning...all the kisses ( Harry/Ginny and Rony/Hermione )...the wedding...Godric's Hollow and the Nagini's attack...the Gringotes Assault...Dumbledore's Brother...the Snape's Memories...the final battle...the ending, 19 years later...and if you still want to change the book, at least, surprise us and show how Rony and Hermoine entry at the chamber of secrets.Regards from Brazil",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince

This was the most disappointing of all the movies so far and I was SO looking forward to it...If people can't bring themselves to read the books (they are large and time consuming), listen to the audio books, especially Stephen Fry's version which will bring so much more to the stories than these movies.

Good with capturing sound visuals .The first half was good to with some humor all those memory thing to find out . It was nice but it looks like movie lacked some thing someIt looks like the director is hiding some thing to be told in the end or in next parts more depth should be put on may be a lot of to tell and need to be shown which would be in the next part its good idea that warner willmake the next book into two parts cause now is the time to tell the whole story in more depth .Good movie not a disappointment complete as a movie but not as a book,Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
424,zereshk,3 hours of soap opera,3,20 July 2009,"I went into this movie with almost no prejudice. I hadn't watched trailers, hadn't read reviews, hadn't talked to anyone who had seen it. And I really wanted to like the movie. After all, I still remembered how excited the previous movie had left me and the sixth book is perhaps the best of the entire series.And then I suffered.Almost no scenes were the way they were in the book, some of the characters were altered - flattened down - so much it was hard to even recognise them and the scenes that had been added didn't fit the storyline at all. I mean, I don't have anything against mixed-age couples but why does Harry have to catch the eye of a woman twice his age in the beginning of the film? Which point does the director want to make by including this? Harry's overwhelming attractiveness? His maturity? Same goes for the burning-down-the-burrow scene. Why would Fenrir and Bellatrix waste their time chasing 15 year olds around a fen and setting a house on fire (after luring all the inhabitants out of course. Setting the house on fire with all the blood-traitors, mudbloods and chosen ones still in, no, that would simply have been too... intelligent!)So they include some pointless action, fair enough, perhaps films need that more than books. The 5-minute ""Attack of the Psycho Tree"" (aka Whomping Willow Workout) scene they put into the third film seemed rather random too, after all. But why then did they leave out the ultimate action scene in this book where the DA and the death eaters fight in Hogwarts? I liked the way they introduced the Vanishing Cabinet, different from the book, but since I knew they would never include a 5 minute dialogue between Dumbledore and Draco anyway, I liked the idea. All the more disappointing then that in the end, Draco went through all this effort just so Bellatrix could burn down Hagrid's hut.But the ultimate unforgivable scene was the way they ruined ""the flight of the prince"". I'll sum up the end of the film.Harry: Fight back you COWARD! - Snape: He called me coward? Mmh, I don't really care. - Harry: SECTUMSEMPRA! - Snape: Alright, let me explain this very calmly to you. You may not use my spells against me because I'm the half blood Prince. - *in the background Hagrid's hut is burning down but Hagrid and Fang are apparently too fast asleep to notice* - Snape:*walks into the forest* - Harry: *looks at the stars, surprised*later:Harry: It's a shame Dumbledore's dead. I kinda liked him.Hermione: Uh-huh. BTW, Ron says it's OK if you're with Ginny.Harry: k, thx. I never noticed how beautiful Hogwarts is.This leads me directly to the thing that disturbed me the most about the film: the complete unwillingness on the side of the writers to stay serious for even one single minute. At every turn, some trite joke or shallow reference to clichée teenage drama has to be inserted and this robs the film of all its dramatic potential. I have no idea why anyone would call this film ""dark"". I've seen Disney films that were more serious and adult than this one. The film is a dumbed-down version of the book, suitable for audiences who previously fawned over Twilight.And the clichée doesn't stop there. The portrayal of Bellatrix irritated me greatly. Isn't it about time we do away with this stereotype that an evil and powerful woman *has* to act hypersexual, speak with a sensual voice and creep around the men she's threatening? It was really annoying, especially in the scene in which Snape swears the Unbreakable Vow. It looks cheap and doesn't fit at all.Also: - Ginny would never tie anyone's shoelaces. - Harry can use his invisibility cloak, it doesn't count as cheating. Especially if it keeps you from climbing random roofs just to get a glimpse at Draco - Dumbledore's funeral isn't a rock festival. - So Voldemort's Horcruxes could be any kind of object? Good luck breaking random things in order to defeat him then, Harry. Looking forward to seeing you stomp across rubbish dumps in film 7, crushing ""hidden"" old bottles that could be magical.One star for the wonderful performances by Tom Felton and Alan Rickman, one for the beautiful Quidditch scenes and one for the soundtrack.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
425,southsidepopper,Where was all the action?,6,4 August 2009,"I went to go see this movie with very high expectations. I just finished reading the book 2 days before I saw the movie. And from the book I was expecting a movie that had a lot of suspense with an ending of total nonstop action. But instead I found a movie that tried way too hard to be funny left out many major key plot points that I have no idea how they will convey them in the seventh movies. One of my least favorite parts of the movie was that they rated it PG when the book could have been rated R if they made it into a movie. I think in order for it to be rated PG they had to take out the whole last scene of the fight in the school, which in my opinion was the best part of the book. The movie also didn't even mention the ministry of magic, which played a decent part in the sixth book. So overall they spent too much time trying to develop all of the characters relationships, and in turn left out a lot of action. Other than that it was a great movie, great cinematography, followed the plot fairly well, and explained a lot of what needed to be known for the seventh movies. The movies are what got me into reading the books, but this is the first movie where I would have much rather just read the book and gone without seeing the movie.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince

Hugely disappointing!! The plot and the story line are Sooooooooooooo slow at one point I fell asleep for 20 Min's on the sofa and when I woke up it was as if I hadn't missed anything the plot was still dragging along at a snails pace. Very little action but lot and lots of deep meaningful 'we are so big and popular now we don't need lots of action' drivel.I think to enjoy this film you HAVE to be a massive Harry Potter fan then maybe you will love it, I found it boring, tedious and plain hard work.

428,cinemaniac_x,By far the worst Hary Potter film,5,28 December 2010,"The trailers advertised the new Harry Potter film as even more exciting, mysterious, and humorous than the first five. An eight-month release delay built up the hype even more. But as with many heavily marketed and highly anticipated movies, Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince fell flat. Not only did it not meet fans' high expectations, but it is by far the weakest installment of the series.The film takes too many liberties with the book, removing significant events – the darker parts of the story – and relegating them to a very thin subplot, instead focusing on endless teenage angst and shenanigans. While this fluff is entertaining, it adds nothing to the overall series. And it is not just that the movie is mostly about the students' relationships; these romances are underdeveloped and for the most part so unlike the book that they are ridiculous and awkward.Although the acting is superb, the script does not work to the actors' advantage. Familiar characters such as Hagrid, Snape, and Lupin have little screen time, while others – Draco Malfoy and Luna Lovegood – appear flat. Harry, the great hero, the Chosen One, is portrayed as a coward who does not even try to stop the plot against Dumbledore.The all-important Horcruxes are barely explained. The mystery of the titular half-blood prince is glossed over in a sentence. And even after Harry learns important information concerning Voldemort and his past, he does not share it with Ron and Hermione, so for the first time in the film series, his best friends play extremely ­insignificant roles.The cinematography is one of the few strong points of the film; there is a visually stunning shot of Harry and Dumbledore standing on a rock jutting up from the crashing ocean as they are about to enter the great cave. From that scene on, everything is suddenly serious and urgent, leaving the viewer feeling empty and cheated out of a pivotal film that could have served both to reveal secrets of the past and set up the epic series' finale.With the upcoming two-part Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, director David Yates has two more chances to correct the tone of the Potter films and bring the series back to quality.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
429,robin_rubin,Ending makes no sense - what's with the Death Eaters?,5,19 July 2009,"Spoiler alert.OK, I understand that a film adaptation of a novel generally requires that plot elements and other details be left out. That means choices. It's the director who makes the choices, and different directors make different choices.A different director from David Yates -- such as Alfonso Cuarón -- would probably have made choices more in keeping with the spirit of the books.More to my liking, anyway.Others commenting here have pointed out that Yates chose to emphasize the Ron Weasley/Lavender Brown romantic subplot at the expense of more important story arcs -- such as Harry's speculation over the identity of the Half-Blood Prince; or what items Voldemort used for horcruxes; or Tom Riddle's ancestors; or Harry's inheriting Sirius's property, including the house-elf Kreacher -- and I agree with them. He also chose to add a totally gratuitous scene of the burning down of the Weasley home -- but chose to omit the CRUCIAL battle between the Death Eaters and the Order of the Phoenix/Dumbledore's Army.But if a director is going to omit the battle at the end, the battle that is necessary to drive the Death Eaters out of Hogwarts, which they want to take over, and keep them from killing or kidnapping Harry, then the director should find some other way to explain why the Death Eaters vacated Hogwarts without doing any damage to anybody, and what they were doing there in the first place.It seems the worst thing the Death Eaters did while they were inside the grounds of Hogwarts (not counting killing Dumbledore because that wasn't the Death Eaters) was breaking the glass in the Great Hall and burning down Hagrid's hut -- hardly worth all the trouble that Draco went through to get them inside Hogwarts. The Death Eaters weren't there to help Draco, they weren't around on his previous attempts to kill Dumbledore.After Snape kills Dumbledore and Harry chases after him, Bellatrix points her wand at Harry, but Snape stops Bellatrix from killing Harry, saying, ""Save him for the Dark Lord."" Then Snape, Draco, Bellatrix and the other Death Eaters just run away -- without even TRYING to capture Harry and take him to Voldemort. These are Death Easters, Mr. Yates, not mischief-night pranksters or execution-hall witnesses. They would not simply depart Hogwarts unless they were driven out! Without the final battle, it would have made more sense to omit the Death Eaters from the ending completely, and just have Snape take over for Draco in killing Dumbledore.Or drive them off some other way, if you are so determined not to show the battle.This is the worst adaptation so far.I understand Yates is currently filming Bill & Fleur's wedding scene for the next movie. Where will the wedding be held now that the Burrow is gone? What an idiot Yates is.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince

431,kenneththaarup,Harry Potter becomes an immature teen movie!,2,18 July 2009,"The movies starts out with Harry visiting the Weasley's, where he's attacked by Death eaters. They play around with some fire and some bad special effects, burn the house and runs away. Probably the best scene in the film. The next 2 hours, the film focuses 100% on Potter wanting the Weasley girl, but she's dating someone else, and Granger wanting Ron Weasley, but he's dating a weirdo, and everybody starts hating each other cause they all love each other. I do not know how it's possible to destroy the entire concept of Harry Potter and the magic world and having it made in to a teen movie where the people who're in love with each other can't say it cause they're too immature, but they succeeded doing it! I sat there for hours, wishing for the movie to end so I could do something less stupid with my time.The movie is called The Half-Blood Prince, and the only thing the movie has to do with the title is that Harry gets a book that belongs to the half-blood prince, which contains some usable notes. Oh and the 10 second long scene with the prince revealing himself by saying ""Yes, I'm the half-blood prince!"", and nothing more is added to that.The ending scene where Dumbledore is making Harry make him drink the elixir is the only place where you see the slightest bit of suspense, and even that scene was cut down to a 5-minute sequence to make room for more boring love-elixir-scenes. After this, death eaters attack dumbledore, but instead of doing something, they stand there for 5 minutes talking.I have never been this disappointed after going to the cinema, and I'm certainly not going to pay money to see the next Harry Potter movie!",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince

In the books, action proceeds logically (according to the rules of her magical world) and the characters are fully developed and fascinating.ON THE OTHER HAND, the movies are gibberish. The movies seem to move from one CGI event to the next, with no rhyme or reason for the progression. The nuance is lost. Characters are underdeveloped. The movies are a travesty. Just a few examples (SPOILER) - how in the heck do Dumbledore and Harry get from the rock into the cave? How do they get back from the cave? WHy is Hogwarts empty when the DeathEaters show up, but suddenly full after Dumbledore dies? Why the choir all of a sudden? Why no funeral ceremony?Would anyone have seen this movie if the books had not been written. No. Would this movie even have been made without the book? No. Does this movie stand alone as a story? No. Can you understand this movie without reading the book? No. I can't help but think that this movie was made only so that they could someday make a better version of the movie.

At one point, for whatever reason, Harry is very jolly. He does it well and is hilarious in the process. In the hospital Hermione shows a range of emotion and it was quite convincing and rather touching. Of the three main characters Ron probably matured the most. A great job done by all. - This movie was very dark which is appropriate giving the ending of the prior movie - There was a ton of character development in all of the youths. - This was the funniest of any of the movies thus far. - The last half hour changed the relationships that some of the key characters will have with the others in the following movie(s).The Bad: - The actors, especially Ron, look much older than 16. I suppose that's unavoidable and will be even more prevalent in the last movie(s) in the series. - While I'm confident that the last movie(s) tie everything together I can't help but feel that the previous movie had very little connection with this one. I'd like to get more specific, but we'll say that many of the main themes in 'Order of the Phoenix' are completely omitted in this film. - There is a bubbly chick with a lot of screen time that does very little to further the plot. I suppose that she does supply some comic relief, but if your endgame is Harry defeating Voldemort she appears to me to be completely irrelevant.The Ugly: - I'm sure people that read the books saw the ending coming, but I for one did not. I won't go into any more detail, but it was very disappointing. - This movie, more than any other, focused on the interest in the opposite sex. It is a major part of the film and again, if your endgame is the conflict between Harry and Voldemort, I would have preferred it being done away altogether. If she's feels it necessary for the characters to show an interest in the opposite sex because of their age, it should have been scaled back considerably in my opinion.Overall a good experience and a very good movie.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
437,animalz619,Brilliant,8,17 July 2009,"There are a lot of things I would like to press in this review, but I'll try to keep it to a bare minimum. First off I knew that from the beginning that the tone of the film would be more darker and serious. And I loved that, as most of the previous films hadn't captured that. Yates brings his skills to the screen directly, and with Kloves writing, everything worked out great. The acting seemed more solid, a credit to Yates and I would like to name a few who I believed were tremendous, Felton as Malfoy, Radcliffe as Harry, Gambon was much much better, Rickman was superb and Broadbent pulled off an excellent Slughorn. The visuals were excellent, particularly the cave scene where Dumbledore casts the fire. And most importantly, it was very close to the book. Although It would have been better if more scenes closer to the plot were added, such as the battle at Hogwarts, but reading about why it was cut, I felt it was a good enough reason. So all in all, I was still happy with the end result. The score really did bring out the emotion in the film, particularly at the end. I believe that it was the combination of Kloves's writing combined with Yates directing, as the previous HP film had a different writer, and there was a different atmosphere. Overall, a great film that stuck close to the book and will very likely thrill the audience.8/10",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince

Maybe, if you can find a plot in this no-brain wash. Well, I thought it could be weak, but I went because of the kids, I thought I could be at least funny. At the end they didn't like it either. I've not read the books (the bestsellers), they are too fat to be valuable, and I think, if you don't know the story you would not understood anything either, no way. I am almost sure, the book could be more interesting, but a movie is not a book and if you try to make it like the book, you lose with no mercy. The movie is an endless cliché and boring to death. The person who plays Harry is the weakest actor I've ever seen, with approximately 3 or 4 grimaces, that's all. There are some freaky teeny love stories, which are laughable, I would prefer ""American pie"" instead. Accidentally I've seen the movie in original, but it was not something adding a value.

By 3:00AM I walked out of the the midnight showing tired, but happily entertained. This series is built for success from the start and this film carries it along just as well as the book did. There is so much to like about this film from the witty humor, suspenseful action, thrilling adventure, and breath-taking cinematography. This particular episode of the saga seems to be rooted in the real world (or Muggle World) rather than solely in the world of Hogwarts and Wizards. This gives the movie an excellent sense of drama and works well since the fantastical feel is kept alive throughout.While the story and adventures are exciting and revealing it is really the characters and our love for them as viewers that really pulls in the audience. Once you're willing to go along the ride of their life with Harry, Ron, and Hermione (wonderfully portrayed by their rightful actors as usual) then you will find yourself truly sucked into the incredible events that are happening to them.The movie clocks in at 2 hours and 33 minutes, but by the end the length shouldn't matter and the dull ache in your rear from the stone-like chairs at your movie theater should be put to the back burner due to the fresh story-telling of this movie.

441,Cannibully,The Best of the Series *SPOILERS*,9,6 September 2009,"**CONTAINS MAJOR SPOILERS** This might very well be my new favorite HP movie. It had a few WTF moments along with a few answers. I have not read any of the books, so I have no basis of comparison there. That being said, I intend to speculate on some things in this post. I am only speculating according to what has occurred on screen up until this moment. Obviously, I have to start with Snape. He's been a very ambiguous character throughout the entire series. There was always that question in the back of my mind as to whether he was actually still a Death Eater or not. After seeing the Half Blood Prince I've never been more sure as to the answer to that question. Snape is most definitely NOT a Death Eater. I had my suspicions about his motivations early in the film. Once I saw the brief glimpse of his conversation with Dumbledore I was pretty certain. He told Dumbledore that he was asking for too much. I wasn't sure right then exactly what the headmaster had asked of him, but I suspected it was something that would not be easy, but would be for the greater good. Obviously, I was right. When Snape raised his wand and performed the forbidden death curse on Dumbledore I knew exactly why. He was protecting Draco, and probably Harry in some way that will be revealed later. Speaking of Draco, Tom Felton absolutely owned this movie. He brought a depth to Malfoy that has simply never been there before. Throughout the series he's been little more than an annoying nemesis for our hero. He's so much more than that in this movie. He is truly an isolated and tortured soul. He is following in his father's footsteps because he has to. The consequences to him and his family would be quite severe if he chose to just be a normal student at Hogwarts. Harry catches a glimpse of the normal kid that Draco could be when he finds him in the bathroom. Of course, Draco ruins the moment by attacking Harry. Again, he feels he has no choice. He doesn't hate Harry like we have always been meant to believe. It's just what he's been conditioned to do. Then, of course, Harry makes the mistake of conjuring a spell that he doesn't understand which nearly kills Draco. This is truly a beautiful moment in the movie. Harry is horrified at what he's done and poor Draco is just a kid who took things too far and is now dying on the bathroom floor. Professor Snape honors his vow to protect Draco and intervenes just in time to save his life. Which brings me back around to Snape's motivation. Everything Snape has done throughout the series has been part of a much larger plan. Snape is like the double agent that you never really know which side he's on. It obviously caused him great personal pain to kill Professor Dumbledore. As Slughorn said, ""Murder tears the soul apart."" I can only imagine this is amplified when one is forced to murder someone they care about. But he did what he had to do. He had to protect Draco from that very fate. Had Draco actually done the deed himself there would most likely be no turning back. His tortured soul would only become more twisted and hateful. Snapes murder of Dumbledore was nothing less than act of compassion for Draco at Dumbledore's request. Dumbledore even pleaded with Snape in his final moments. This could easily be seen as an old man pleading for his life. But Dumbledore knew he was about to die one way or the other. He pleaded with Snape to do what had to be done to spare Draco any further pain. I'm sure that in the next two movies it will be revealed how this all leads back to Harry. Anyway, I definitely loved this movie. I wasn't terribly thrilled with the Order of the Pheonix. This film has definitely put the series back on track.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
442,kayper54,Unfortunate Title,6,15 December 2009,"It's unfortunate that the title of the book is ""Half-Blood Prince,"" because, really, given what the story is really about, that part was sort of a ""B"" story-line. The ancient textbook was important for the first potion-making scene (Harry HAD to win that Felix Felicis) but after that, it could have very easily been dropped from the storyline. Snape's original ownership of the book, his half-blood parentage, even the Sectusempra spell could all easily have been dropped to make room for more important details, since none of these figure prominently in Deathly Hallows. From the film makers' standpoint, that must have been annoying.Like all the films, important details were disastrously dropped from this one and I could hear each one shattering as it was brushed carelessly off the table. The teenybopper romance theme took soooo much more time than it should have. It needed to be there a LITTLE bit, but instead it dominated the whole picture. I liked the Quidditch, always my favorite scenes in any of the films, but it just didn't need to be there this time. YES, I know things have to be cut. I understand that it would have to be a six hour film to put it all in. But the Horcruxes were CRUCIAL and they were little more than an after-thought here. I've read the reasons why the film makers decided to cut the battle scene between the DE's and the DA at the end, but I completely disagree with those reasons. The fact that the battle is missing at the end was sad enough, but the fact that Harry was NOT immobilized at the end yet did nothing to help Dumbledore is an appalling oversight.This is not the worst adaptation. As JUST a film, it's good. If you think of it as only ""inspired by"" the book instead of ""based upon"" it then it's much easier to forgive what's missing. If you've never read the book at all (or only read it once in '06 and don't remember most of it like my husband who I know will read this) you'll really like it a lot. I LOVE the introduction to Harry; it's completely made-up for the film but it was an inspired idea. The SFX are, of course, fantastic. The score is the very best yet; I downloaded the soundtrack from iTunes just as soon as I'd seen the film. The dialog is very good and very funny in places. Dan and Rupert Have really grown as actors and Gambon has finally aged enough to look as old as Dumbledore is supposed to be. All in all, I'm not sorry I bought the DVD.One last thing. I can't imagine why Snape would have ever let that book out of his sight in the first place.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
443,Jurguens,Not as good as it should have been,5,30 July 2009,"The movie seemed half baked. The acting, the cinematography, the art direction, were all excellent, however the movie lacked a clear direction. Worse still, the antagonist for most of the movie is Draco Malfoy which is a bit of a downer when you had Voldemort before.It was interesting to see the relationship of the characters grow, they were given space to breathe, and attention was given to their adolescent love relationships, but the lack of high adventure and action hindered the movie.It's a shame because this was actually my favourite Potter book, but the news that the last book is going to be made in two films is actually quite exciting.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince

I think they were just trolling us very successfully. For example, I can't make any sense of the scene where Ginny tied Harry's shoes. Why there is a moment like that in this movie?

Before watching the HBP I knew Dumbledore would die in it and yeah I already know Harry will beat Voldemort in Book 7, but after HBP i thought ""What the hell was that???"". The whole plot is totally out of balance. One unrelated scene after another combined with poor dialogs. The first 90 minutes are complete soap-opera. Horny teens are running through a pheromone-fogged Hogwarts. No development in the story, simply nothing to gather momentum. Complete boredom. At this time i noticed a few people leaving cinema(first time i watched that on a HP-Film!). It seems the director David Yates was over challenged. No sense for dramatic scenery, the right pace and the correct emphasis. When Dumbledore was killed by Snape. A 3-Minute-Scene, no funeral...nothing. As if Dumbledore was a supporting role. The disappointment was complete. And not forgetting Harry himself. Yates and/or the disastrous screenplay(should get a razzie next year for 'worst adapted screenplay') direct HP like a helpless coward. In every duel Harry's enemy do one magic spell and HP lies beaten on the ground. After the movie was over I thought ""So, this is the chosen one? This is the one who will kill Voldemort??"" After that episode not by himself!! Maybe Voldemort sees Harry and says:""Oh boy, you're such a loser. It's beneath my dignity to raise my magic wand. You win!"" Please Mr.Yates do us a favor and pass the directors-chair to somebody else. PLEASE!!!",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
447,maryfabuk,Definitely a must see,9,28 July 2009,"I'm not going to make any comments about the directions etc on here, all I want to do is tell you why this film should be seen! I went along to this film, not with the greatest expectations, as the other ones have only been average, but I had had a pleasant surprise. This is easily the best of the Harry Potter films so far.The characters all seem to be easier in their own skin now and there is no child-like feel to this film, like there was in the previous ones. It's much darker and more intense, but it is broken up really well with humour. Rupert Grint is especially good as Ron.I would definitely recommend this film to anyone. You do need to know what happens in the books though, as my husband who came to see this with me was a bit confused at times as to why things were happening the way they were etc.All in all, if the last 2 films are as good as this one, then it'll be worth my money.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
448,kemallory340,Possibly the best one yet!,9,15 July 2009,"They pulled out all the stops for the latest installment of the Harry Potter series and you won't be disappointed with the end result. As a fan of the books and films, I was truly impressed with how The Half-Blood Prince turned out.The nature of this Harry Potter is supposed to be dark and mysterious, which I admit it is in some places but it seems like they loaded this one with more humor than the rest. Sometimes subtle, other times just outright hilarious, I guarantee you will laugh. That's not to say there's no action though. There's plenty of that to go around. Not to mention the new romances that are a constant source of the humor.The returning cast did wonderfully as well as the newcomers such as Jim Broadbent acting as Professor Slughorn. Broadbent really got into character and I believe he is exactly like Rowling describes in her books. Other newcomers Dave Legeno as Fenrir Greyback and Helen McCrory as Malfoy's Mom have smaller parts but portray their characters well for how much room they were given. One thing I have to say is I was surprised at Rupert Grint's level of acting in this one, I don't know if was just being held back or if he just improved that much but it's obvious he's going places.The fans of the book series won't be disappointed either. They managed to stay very true to the book while keeping it a reasonable length and filling in all the information you need. But I daresay that if you've never read the books you may be surprised and saddened at the ending.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
449,ekbatani14,"Exciting dark style, but lacking in variety and story",6,15 July 2009,"After being severely disappointed by the fifth movie in the series, the Order of the Phoenix, I can easily say that my expectations for this movie were very low. The third and fourth movie were by far the best in the series, and unfortunately this sequel could not meet those standards. However, after watching it, I was surprised by the way the movie was conducted. At most points in the movie it was very dark, but there were several funny moments that all types of audiences found humorous. The main objections I have with this movie was variety of the plot. I understand that every single element of the book cannot be incorporated into the movie, but there very important events from the book that were not even mentioned. First, the new minister of magic. I mean come on, not even a side comment about him? Or how about what happens to Bill Weasley? Doesn't he get attacked by the Greyback? I was expecting much more actions scenes from the Greyback, not just a couple posing scenes. As for the soundtrack, the same repetitive music from Order of the Phoenix was used, which was an annoying jolly tune that does not at all go with the entire movie, but the music was better for the more darker scenes. Also, there was too much emphasis between Slughorn and Harry. However, I was quite impressed by Daniel Radcliffe's acting, although his emotions could have been portrayed better as he got over tragedies too quickly. I strongly believe that David Yates is by far the weakest of the multiple directors of this best-selling series.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince

451,warhead_2003,Irony and Tragedy Of Half Blood Prince,4,18 July 2009,"As an HP fan Im greatly disappointed, this is probably the worst interpretation of the whole series which for any true fan is tragic. But ironically for casual movie-goers or 'movies only' fans seem to have enjoyed the movie.I think so Mr. Yates should stick to directing TV Shows, cause believe it or not the acting is jittery just as the plot and the way the climax ends leaves so much confusion, and I hated to see it end in an anticlimax way, which of course is not what the book describes. Also you could clearly figure out plot holes such as Hermione developing premature feelings for Ron and the sudden romantic bond between Harry and Ginny while she is shown dating Dean Thomas and haven't broken up with him. There are so many things which really makes the film look like a shame to the series, and I could go on and on. But the real reason why average or 'movies only' fans may have liked the movie would possibly be because it was more of a comedy rather being more dark and tragic, and also was quite visually appealing.I think so Chris Columbus should return because he was probably the best director in the series in terms of interpretation and being more faithful to the book. Is it sad to think that many people have started giving more emphasis to visual qualities of a movie rather than its script and plot?",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
452,ankitj-pec,disappointing...an average take on a brilliant story,6,17 July 2009,"I expected Harry potter-the half blood prince to be the thriller, with all the history Voldemort's life and the dark world. Sadly, its just turned out to be an average take on the JK Rowling book, with Lavender Brown getting more frames than even Hermione.Okay, they wanted to make the movie interesting for the audience, but the trade-off has been really frustrating for the harry potter fans. Most of the movie has been shot about romance in the air and teenage life of harry and his friends but the people expect a thriller from a HP movie. Not a casual take on teenage love with some magic involved.The plot just unfolds in the last half an hour of the movie and the lead characters of the novel have not been given their due while the supporting ones (Lavender Brown etc) are just used for no reason at all. Poor screenplay, poor direction and some really breathtaking scenes reduced to a flash makes you wonder that is this the adventurous harry potter series like the other movies ? The scenes at Hogwarts are usually filled with 'snugging' teenagers and one wonders why weren't harry's seniors been shown 'snugging' in the corridors in the other harry potter movies and they just had to keep on emphasizing the fact that love was in the air ? With just 1-2 spells in the whole movie, no wand-fight for the matter, the story just reduces to showing the main focus of the book, i.e. introduce about Horcruxes. The storyline is with lots of loopholes and direction is all the while poorer. Snape has not been given his due while the movie also lacks the male protagonist's optimism. Harry is shown to be afraid of Draco in the opening scenes at Hogwarts which makes you wonder if this is the boy who is the chosen one in the final blockbuster. A opportunity missed, i'll say the least. For those who've read the book, you can give it a miss. For those who haven't, probably you like the movie.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
453,BarbaraEvans,Why is everyone so furious? IT WAS GREAT.,9,20 July 2009,"I cannot stay quiet while all you ""fans"" are putting bad things about the movie. You know what my family used to tell me after a Harry Potter film? My dad was like: it's OK. My brother literally slept. My mom didn't even get them. Now it was all different. They all told me it was great... and it was the premier. So tell me about it. They enjoyed not being in bed until 4 o'clock. That was when I realized that even thought they left many things aside (like DD's funeral, like the Dursleys, and the amazing fight we all missed) it was AWESOME. We all laughed and enjoyed the movie (especially me, who didn't sleep for 2 nights remembering every single part of it) because it wasn't exactly the book. Yes, what you'd read. We love to see an adaptation just like it is. But this was beyond everything we have imagined. Maybe that's the problem: perhaps we expected too much. But at the minute I started to forget the book (because books and movies are DIFFERENT) I realized it was freaking amazing. Dialogues were great, the course of the story was enjoyable (not tiring) and there were so many clues that really satisfied what we didn't have. Perhaps the only thing I didn't like too much was the ending because it was confusing (like Hermione telling Harry Ron was OK with his relationship with Ginny when there was only a kiss and some flirt), but keeping that aside, it was one of the best movies of the series. Really. I'll be one of those ""freaks"" with Hogwarts robes when the DVD (or should I say Blu-Ray?) comes out. So what are you all waiting reading this?

454,hunnix,Where is the magic?,4,21 July 2009,"When memory of the book evades you, you read it again if you have the patience or if it's so popular that it's been adapted for screen you best head to the theatre to rekindle the fervor, the anxiety and the nail biting experienced while turning the pages. Harry Potter and the half blood prince, while attempting to live up to the hype sorely misses the action, adventure and magic that are necessary to pace a fantasy movie. The sixth book was to be a ""tying up loose ends"" and a proper narrative to explain the raison d'être and readers uncomplainingly accepted the adventure devoid installment. I don't wish to vainly criticize the writing prowess of Rowling but a screen adaptation is an entirely different ball game. There are no stirring words to evoke emotions; the audience expects visuals alone to do their bidding. You feel deceived when the movie doesn't match cut with your imagination and have no choice but to endure. For two and half hours I had to endure the vacant expressions of Mr. Radcliffe. He packs a happy face, sad face, angry face all into one wide eyed stare at the camera, clearly conscious of its presence while mouthing the lines. He should be taking acting lessons from (the computer generated) Smeagol who floored us in with his effortless performance. The sidekicks have delivered what was asked of them and in contrast have evolved from the awkward camera shy veneer to donning a confident screen presence. Teenage romance has been exploited to generate humor. It failed miserably not even drawing a chuckle from me. It dragged on for a good length of time proving quite a test of my patience. Does finding toothpaste/ milk smudged on the lips of the opposite sex equal 'attraction' for teenagers? Why is it repeatedly used in the film? Did the screenwriter run out of ideas? Perhaps it would do me no good writing on an impertinent point when so much else was out of place but it's just something that demanded an answer. On the note of romance and performance I would also like to mention the genuinely funny scene when Harry finds a love potion struck lightheaded Ron mooning over the moon! Rupert Grint does well with his comic timing. The CG offered nothing new than what I had seen in the trailers already. It chagrined me gravely that this was all a world of witchcraft and wizardry could offer. However, whatever little was conceived warrants commendation. The heart stopping introductory scene of 'taking down of the bridge' by the death eaters as they swoop through the city at lightning speed, Harry dipping his head into a sea of memories in the pensieve, the setting of the dark and forbidding cave against tempestuous rough seas lapping at it, all linger in your mind for days after watching the movie. Call it the Potter effect! So if you have the read the book it wouldn't harm you to watch the movie but to have expectations would be asking too much. The book served well its purpose of setting the backdrop for Deathly hallows but the movie with the slip shod editing and poor acting performances appears to deflate the enthusiasm you approach a Harry Potter movie with.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince

Rickman is suitably understated and NEVER overplays his character.The photography and CGI is used beautifully, and many scenes seem straight out of a painting.

It's dark and I was disappointed in some parts, such as Sirius Black being murdered. He was my favorite character. Anywho, this was the most entertaining Potter Film I've seen.

And they succeeded in that. The final scene with Dumbledore's death is perfect. Well done! We are shocked, in disbelief and full of anticipation. That's the effect of a good movie. Thanks JKR for the great character of Dumbledore. We will never forget him. I made this event as a first part of commenting on this piece of Harry Potter because that's what I've been waiting for a long time. Announcing the news that a spectacular finale of this saga awaits us in the best and most striking way possible. The evaluation of the characters has been raised to a high level, the mystique and darling are dominant throughout the film and the wizarding world we are used to is finally more realistic than magical. The insertion of the mystical Half-Blood Prince whose identity is later revealed is masterful. The scene of the entry of Lord Voldemort's followers after the assassination of Dumbledore is great and spectacular. Lots of good scenes and action. Just keep it that way because this movie deserves it. wrote a great book and set a difficult task for the screenwriters and directors to shoot it. I like the plot of the film because it keeps me in suspense and on the other hand it pulls me to think about how this saga could end. There is no need for me to comment on this part of the film in more detail because it is commendable and I want it to remain so because I feel that I will need the strength to comment in the next, final, parts of the film.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
459,sylvanian,From bad to worse,4,25 July 2009,"I find it hard to trust IMDb ratings nowadays. The only way for this movie to get almost 8 stars is to get a lot of reviews sponsored by the producers. And if you look at many positive reviews, they really look artificial, just like advertising.The movie is not horrible, it is simply mediocre, but I rated it 4 instead of 5-6 because it is much worse that it could be. HP5 was an easy book to make a nice movie. It is not Tolkien's Two Towers. Just get a set of most critical and interesting episodes, chain together, and here we are. The problem is that one HP film after another, the selection of episodes is getting worse, moreover, as if there is nothing happening in the book, the screenplay suggests more and more things, which never happened in the book. And these ""extras"" looks not only alien to any reader, but mostly plain naive and stupid. Like burning of the Burrow in this movie. I guess, to match the quality of added episodes, the screenplay selected many less interesting episodes (leaving out many really important ones) and, in addition, tried to play down the excitement replacing it by cheap attempts to catch some laughter in the audience. So, it looks like the centerpiece of this movie is Lavender-Ron romance, which gives both actors a lot of chances to look stupid and to catch some laugh. And to make sure that everyone will get it and can laugh, it is filmed in an oversimplified comic way. As a result, the movie become not just a set of illustrations to HP5, which is interesting, but only makes sense as a book companion (if would not be that bad), but rather mix of fragments, caricatures, and plain fantasies. Why all that? It could be such a nice movie... I do not know whom to blame. This movie has the same author behind the screenplay - the one who gave us excellent HP1. I guess, the director has to be blamed, but it is too late to do anything about it. Most of the actors play really well, camera and effects are also good. But nothing can save the movie.So, if you are a book fan, do not come to this movie in theaters. I guess, you will still need to see it, at least to have a chance to write a bad review.

The storyline followed the book as loosely as the movie writers possibly could muster. in fact, the Half Blood Prince, which dominates so much of the story in the book, only appeared as a sub story in the movie. The Half-Blood Prince story went about something like this:""Half-Blood Price?"" ""I can't find anything about it!"" ""I'm the Half-Blood Prince""The real storyline in the movie was debatable, as it seemed evenly told with the sub stories. The story was about the romances, Malfoy's box, Horcluxes, and the danger in the wizarding world.It leaves a person who doesn't read the books with a skewed view on the real story.If you are a fan of the book series, this movie is not for you.

462,alessiovezzani,Avada Kadavra!,1,19 July 2009,"The last episode of the Harry Potter's saga confirms the unwritten rule that in the magical battle between Good and Evil only the odd numbers of the series are good. Now, being Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince the number six, fears of its not standing with the right side were high, but the result proved so unflinching in its loyalties to the bad ones to even lead them as the worst HP movie ever. True, the entire production is increasingly burdened by the fact that as time goes by not all the children chosen at the beginning have matured into good actors, nor have their features blossomed into a face the camera is in love with - see Rupert Grint for reference. Many of these shortcomings could have been overcome by virtue of good screenplay and direction, but this is where the movie's own outstanding demerits begin. Neither David Yates - director - nor Steve Kleves - writer - seem to know the formula to produce on screen such magic essentials as lightness, surprise, eeriness, danger, that feeling of scary ease wherein lives the charming freshness of Rowling's creation. The outlook is as if Albus Dumbledore had taken hold of the story at the start and then dragged ceremoniously arm-in-arm with it straight to the end: everything is so slowly-paced and unwinds so evenly that well before the first hour has passed you have no curiosity left for any waiting twist ahead. To shake some dust from the awkward predictability of a plot they have curtailed down to an archive research into Voldemort's past, writer and director deemed necessary to lag whenever possible on Ron's love labours, and here again everything is so heavily handed and contrived - juvenile spirits reduced to an overlong sorry joke - that one is led to envy those who never knew love. But the gravest flaw of the movie - a real gaping hole - is the way it depicts the development of Harry's character. It is as if the authors' own incapability in dealing with magic - which led them to substantially drop it - have awaken some hidden distrust in occult arts lying at the core of the saga, revealing a worrying obsession for safety: knowledge is dangerous and ought to be kept under control, and those who dare to know what is forbidden must be rejected and fought. Stripped of all magic such suddenly seems to have always been Hogwarts ground mantra, and you realize that in the name of security the only diversity allowed by the institution is goofiness. One of the poisoned fruits of this supposedly concealed school mission is that Harry is encouraged to grow into a cop: Dumbledore himself invites him to spy on his teachers. And we are saddened by the view of a young wizard renouncing his risky talents to hide behind walls to listen unseen to conversations, sneaking, creeping and peeping instead of bravely confronting his enemies with his wand. For an affectionate viewer this is the most perplexing plot revelation possible, and as Good and Evil begin to exchange fields in the disastrous twilight, one welcomes Snipe's nerve with some relief: the sage is gone.

My only little emphasis here: Do Watch It. I found it really great after being disappointed by a line of mega budget movies- Wolverine...Angels & Demons...Terminator Salvation and Transformers 2. Well about the Half Blood Prince: If you liked all other HP movies, you'll certainly like this one too. If you are a faithful reader and used to find faults in the movies, you'll find some here too. But the point is that if you, for at least a minute, think about the hard work and dedication it must require to bring this thing onto the silver screen, with all its charm and ideas intact, you'll find it inevitable to appreciate the team that makes it possible. And I believe they'll be holding at least half a dozen golden statues in 2012, if not sooner. LOTR had its three years. HP has its decade!Because though we know it's a huge business for some, ""Harry Potter"" is undoubtedly one of the greatest fictions ever created.

464,josabby,From Huge fan of the books with positive and negative thoughts on the movies,8,17 July 2009,"Overall, I enjoyed this movie. I've always felt that Daniel Radcliff does a great job playing Harry. He has very expressive eyes and as Harry is a character who internalizes a lot, that is a great thing. I think I'll start out with my gripes and end with the praises. The two major gripes I've had with the entire series are the way that Kloves throws in many elements from the books, but never explains their significance (like all the clues in PoA-the map, Crookshanks chasing Scabbers, the shrieking shack, the ""grim"", etc but never explaining how they all tied into the truth of Sirius), or putting Rita Skeeter into the GoF movies but never explaining that she was an beetle. Throwing in so many elements without explaining their significance has made the films feel rushed and confusing. The other gripe I've had is that I've often felt that the filmmakers try to imitate similar situations they've seen in movies (particularly particularly teenage issues) rather than seeing the deeper meaning in the source material. Emma Watson seems to overact quite a bit and the filmmakers praise her for it. I often feel like she is imitating someone else rather than reacting to the situation in any given scene. One example that comes to mind in this film was her laughing at the joke about Dumbledore's age. She laughed more than the moment called for. The filmmakers also misinterpret Harry and Hermione's friendship and give the shaft to how close Harry is to Ron. The final scene of this film is a prime example. They have Harry and Hermione having a very intimate discussion while Ron is just sitting off to the side. I wonder if Kloves even likes Ron because often Ron just sits there; in the books Ron is a very active character who has certainly had a few arguments with his two best friends, but is fiercely loyal to them. I didn't like the scene where Hermione was crying over R&L; she talks to Harry about his feeling for Ginny and hers for Ron. They have never had a discussion like that in the book. Harry always trusted Ron and Hermione with his life and would have gladly sacrificed himself to save them, but he felt uncomfortable talking to them about more personal issues. He related better to Ginny, Neville and Luna on the issues because they had gone through dark times in their lives he could relate. I feel the filmmakers miss foreshadowing opportunities. They missed the ministry turning on Harry and Dumbledore by only touching on Fudge's attitude in GoF, they didn't put in the chocolate and the scene where Ginny reminds Harry about the fact that she was possessed by Riddle in OotP (which would have been a good set up for the romance in HBP, and they did not mention Dumbledore's Army, the diadem in the RoR or Hufflepuff's cup to set up the student rebellion or the hunt for Horcrux's in the final film. I wish they could hire Peter Jackson to adapt the fantasy aspects and Richard Curtis to adapt the relationships. The over doing the close friendship of Harry and Hermione while shoving Ron off to the side feels like the filmmakers pandering to what they think an audience would like rather that trusting the source materials loved by millions around the world. It's like the crappy romance between Susan and Caspian. About the infamous attack on the Burrow: it could either be an attempt at gratuitous excitement or be there to foreshadow something in the final film. If it was there for the first reason, than it is pointless and idiotic of Kloves and Yates; it had nothing to do with the rest of the film and the time the scene took could have been filled with a number of great scenes in the book. If it was there to foreshadow the final showdown between Bellatrix and Molly Weasley, it was potentially genius. They focused a lot on Molly's reaction to the burning house. Now, on to the things I liked. For the most part, I think the acting was terrific. Daniel Radcliff is really growing as an actor and I think he will have a long and successful film career once the Harry Potter films are complete. I thought he did a great job showing his fear that Ron would die in the poison scene. I also got a chuckle when he came from hiding the book in the RoR and kissing Ginny and Ron asking him if he and Ginny had done it. I also see Rupert Grint having a long career. He has great comic timing. I was laughing hard when he was under the influence of love potion. Both Daniel and Rupert have priceless facial expressions. Evanna Lynch is terrific playing Luna. Her delivery is awesome ""I often sleepwalk in this hallway that's why I wear my shoes to bed."" Classic!!!. Bonnie Wright is doing well capturing the feisty Ginny. Despite the fact that the Harry/Ginny first kiss wasn't as exciting as it was in the book, I was impressed with the kiss itself. I also enjoyed the Ron/Lavender moments more than I thought I would. They were very entertaining. I say fire Emma Watson and her bulging eyes, over active eyebrows and over acting and do some make-up on Cave and have her play Hermione. Lavender is a silly Character in her relationship with Ron. Cave could have easily overdone it and been extremely annoying, but she captured the character perfectly and I was entertained by her performance. I also have to compliment Gambon and the improvement in his portrayal of Dumbledore this time. I thought he was terrible in the previous films, but this time he seemed to capture the demeanor of the Dumbledore in this film. There were a lot of good moments and performances in this film, I just think the filmmakers need to tie everything together better.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
465,saurabh_dashora4091,Authentic Work of Pure Art,9,19 December 2009,"HBP is an authentic work of pure art...that is saying a lot for any movie of the grand Harry Potter franchise. Director Yates has done a remarkable work and has transformed the children-friendly series into a dark political-based thriller revolving around the theme of the wizarding world. And what's more, he has done this momentous task by staying remarkably true to the source material.The stellar cast that has been developed over the course of 5 movies has delivered their best performances of the series...Daniel Radcliffe has matured into a terrific actor and has portrayed the character of Harry Potter to perfection. Emma Watson and Rupert Grint are solid as usual although they had very less part to play in the scheme of things. This movie revolves around three characters most of time--Harry, Dumbledore and Tom Riddle aka Voldemort--and it is these three characters who make this storyline into a gripping suspenseful thriller right till the end. The link between these characters was portrayed by Jim Broadbent (Horace Slughorn the Potions Master). For Broadbent it would be only fitting to say that after COS no other movie has introduced a new character into the Harry Potter universe so seamlessly. It seemed like Broadbent belonged to the Harry Potter series from its very beginning.However, what made the film special for me was the environment that Yates was able to generate...the dark brooding wizarding world facing the eve of battle was shown with chilling realism...the opening sequence of the Death Eaters ravaging the muggle world was a master-stroke. It set the tone for the entire film. For the first time, the Death Eaters commanded such terror. This was very well thought out by Yates. Harry Potter movies have revolved around Harry so much that sometimes it becomes frustrating to remain locked in the mind of the central character all the time. However, in HBP we get to see what the wizarding world is going through from a perspective other than Harry's. This makes the movie authentic in its own right. Yates has used his brains to analyse the situation in the book and provide his own version very much like what Peter Jackson did with the LOTR trilogy.***MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS***In the end, I felt it was a complete movie that could stand without the books also. I feel compelled to take one point off for making the ending a little silly. I couldn't see the reason why Yates didn't show a battle at Hogwarts as was written in the book. It felt that Draco invested the efforts on the magical wardrobe to bring a few Death Eaters into the school castle just to break the crockery in the Great Hall. I can't understand what Yates was thinking about. Apart from that, Dumbledore's pursuit for Voldemort's horcruxes could have been pictorially shown creating greater impact and terror about the whole affair.However, this is still the best movie in the series--the most well shot and directed...",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
466,sergage,It don't get any worse than this!,1,5 August 2009,"I'm speechless. This film was simply awful, worse than 'Phoenix'. I watched it with my younger cousin and it was hard for both of us to try and keep paying attention (I've read the book twice and he dozens of times). The whole movie was dull - dull acting (words can't describe Radcliffe's horrible acting (or should I say moaning, cause that's all he's good at)), dull story (screenplay to be exact), dull 'action scenes', dull villains and dull everything. Key elements from the book are cut and replaced with new lame and unnecessary scenes, such as cheesy jokes and everybody's favorite 'hormones'. Music was out of place - BRING WILLIAMS BACK! And while I'm on it - GET RID OF YATES for god's sake (but of course not, they've already signed him on for 'Hallows').Overall bad, very bad, worse than Transformers 2, and I thought I'd never see anything worse than Transformers 2. At least Transformers 2 was, in a way, amusing. In fact this was so bad I've decided not to see the final two movies.I keep asking myself why they keep doing this. Why not just change the whole cast and crew and come up with something that is not a complete insult to those who have read the books? And immediately I come up with the answer - why make a better movie if the bad one sells just as well. It's only business isn't it? It's all about money, always has been. Selling sex and violence to kids has always been profitable. (And I'm only 23 and I've never been political in my life).Do yourselves a favor and skip this one.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
467,alexthomas28,Weakest Harry Potter Ever!,2,2 August 2009,"This movie is all wrong. It is really a shame. I suspect Steve Kloves must have been drunk or just plain bored with writing another Harry Potter script. I just cant seem to explain how he left out everything good about the script. Remember, he adapted Goblet of fire which was quite good. Whats left is a detached, muddled, boring representation of the book. The movie has none of the excitement, romance, suspense.....to put it plainly, the movie is a terrible waste.David Yates must have forgotten how to tell a story. Steve Kloves and David Yates are both back for Deathly Hallows, and it is going to be Part 1 and Part 2. Given what they have done to Half blood prince, I wouldn't allow them anywhere near a Harry Potter movie.Bring Mike Newell, Alfonso Cuaron or Chris Columbus back.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince

469,rhett_black,Harry Potter & The Half Blood Prince Film Review By Rhett Black,7,1 March 2010,"Darker, stronger & more magical. The Harry Potter Film franchise continues to get better with each installment. Forget the fact that the movie is never as good as the book. You can't get much closer than this. Books are 700 pages long & whilst virtually impossible to quote the book word for word, The Half Blood Prince takes the best from the text & puts it onto the screen with a bang. Harry & Dumbledore finally adventure together as a team in attempt to defeat Voldemort whilst the School Of Hogwarts is under attack by his army. Possibly the best of all six films so far & will be hard to top again surely. Explores Tom Riddle well as a boy but could have used Ralph Fiennes in some form during the film as Voldemort or earlier. Maybe next film??",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
470,ElvenNights,More suitable title would be The Awkward Adventures of Ron Weasley and the Snogfest from hell..,7,24 March 2010,"The scene in the theater following my viewing of Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince was like most of the other film's conclusions. People were clapping. However, I soon became aware that this was not a complementary applause but a condescending spattering of relief that the film was finally over. This became most apparent when someone said out loud, ""Yes, it's finally over!"" The sentiment was solidified when the exiting throng muttered their own forms of agreement to this statement. This was coming from a crowd whom one would believe to be the most avid Potter fans. A reasonably intellectual, slightly alternative group of adolescents and young adults who most likely read the entire series. Sadly to admit, my take was not far off from the pack. Please stop trying to reinvent the wheel.Too much was left out. The most important elements of the Half Blood prince and the most enjoyable for me in reading the books were the pensieve interactions with Harry and Dumbledore. The ability to get a glimpse of the Gaunts and the young Tom Riddle carrying out various subplots of dastardly deeds was most interesting. Not only are they vital to the story but would have been visually stimulating. Harry Potter books are all about the details, the back stories, the relationships, and most of all the magic. I was very much looking forward to the scenes with Voldemort's mother (now there's a more believable love story), Marvolo, and even Ogden out of the pensieve. Also missing was the ever so important memory of Voldemort getting his first glances of Hufflepuff's cup and Slytherin's locket from the old witch when he was buying objects for Borgin and Burkes. Preposterous! Not even present was the grown Riddle requesting the Defense Against the Dark Arts job from Dumbledore, being denied and subsequently cursing the position explaining why no one lasts more than a year. Lets sort some of this stuff out people. These instances are how Harry finds out what the horcruxes are and Voldemorts inner thoughts. Imagine if you will how cool and slightly creepy it would have been to see the transformation of Riddle through the years. Instead we're left with a reject from the Rushmore set as the teenage Voldy. Hardly intimidating. Where's Scrimgeour (rumored to be a vampire) and the sacked Fudge? These items are not mentioned, barely touched on, or inaccurately represented. Try explaining that. So, what, is there only three horcruxes now? No Diadem of Ravenclaw, no cup? What's next. If even two of the aforementioned memories were implemented the movie would be immensely more credible. Up until I saw the ending that is. But more of that in a bit. Are we going to have to waste time rehashing in the upcoming movies, distorting the storyline even further? This was the most disjointed and poorly acted Potter of the six. The beauty of the Potter books is the organic feel and smooth flow of the plot. Take the first film. I watched it every day for a month because it's virtually the book come to life. I can't even get through the Half Blood Prince when I attempt to rewatch it. Tell you something? The films are supposed to be dark and ethereal, not clumsy and irritating. The Lavender Brown character was so poorly overacted and unbelievable. Momentum killer.The ending, atrocious. The entire plot was reduced to Lestrange kicking a few dishes off of the house tables and running out of the castle. You lost me. Harry doesn't share the Felix Felicious (spelling?) with his closest DA buddies, there isn't even a real battle sequence. No suspense at all. Where's the thrill? A couple of Hexes get thrown and everyone runs for it. Seriously? Dumbledore doesn't have to restrain Harry from attempting to stun a couple of Death Eaters and Draco when he could kill them all before he was even spotted? Just lets Albus get taken out in his weakened condition without a fight? Come on. Another thing, I know that the final scenes of the six and seventh book are slightly the same with battles taking place at Hogwarts. It didn't seem to bother me or the other millions of dedicated readers the countless times we read it or listened to the audio books (which I seriously recommend for a change of pace),but now it's a problem? That's all the more reason to go over the top and really make these sequences epic, not water down and distort them leaving the viewers feeling jilted with a substandard ending. Grow a brain! The end is the most thrilling part. Who dies? Who becomes a hero? New inventive spells! Give it to me! What a rip off. After cutting so much relevant plot and story information from the movie the ending really was the last straw. The wand lighting scenario to erase the dark mark came off looking cheesier than a 90's concert event. There's a reason people don't spark up lighters at music shows anymore. At the very least give us a Ghostbuster stream of light works from the wand tips. As Beavis and Butthead would say, ""These effects aren't very special."" That's all we want. A relevant storyline and a healthy showering of colorful magic vapors from wands. Is that too much to ask for. I should hope not. It took you long enough to release the finished product and that's all we get. I waited 10 years for this? The promise of something magical was not delivered. Especially when the movie could have easily been saved by adding a few pivotal pieces. Unsatisfactory. Is it just me, or was Daniel aka Harry a lot more likable when he was younger. He seems to be always either hopped up on a speedball or having a bad attitude. The biggest problem with movies these days is a lack of character development and substance.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
471,Donovan1,"Not bad, but left us flat!",7,15 July 2009,"I am not a book purist, but I do feel the movie should at least try and keep the story on track.The opening scene had our audience stifled. It felt like everyone was sitting there asking what the heck is this. I personally feel that adding this stuff to a good story cheapens the feel of the story by making Dumbledore sound like he cares about the cheap love life of Harry in a negative way, even if that was not the case. It made Harry look like he was going down a spiral path that was not indicated in the books. This was a poor addition and waste of film time in my opinion. I'm not sure who talked JK into this part, (and I am really wanting to love this film and not be rude) but shame on you.The Weasley characters and locations like the shop and home were good and the funny parts of the love stories were great. The love potion part of the film was the only portion of the film I really enjoyed and remembered the most at the end. It had great humor and showed some development between Hermione and Ron. But how the love stories ended up and how the Weasley twins end up in the story was a really flat and it felt very empty. If the love stories were your main focus, (as it seemed it was) why would you not build them up and leave the relationships barely surviving at the end of the film. I understand the idea of leading the relationships somewhat subtle and hoping the audience is begging for more. However, I don't think that ever came close. It was more like an exclamation of, ""That's it?!?!?"" BIG SPOILER HERE: Not having the battle scene by filling so much more with the extra ""unnecessary"" fluff that was added was the biggest let down of any of the films so far. This was what everyone in the audience seemed to be hanging on for. We all wanted to see our heroes become brave and strong. We expected to see some development in their characters like Luna and Longbottom did in 'Order of the Phoenix.' That was such a let down in this film that This is the first time I have not rated a Harry Potter movie as a 10 since the series began. I sadly hit this one as a 7.I loved the scene with the Inferi. The ""Golum"" like creatures were fantastic and the adventure of this portion of the movie was great. I missed the smart dialog that came in the book where Harry kept convincing Dumbledore to drink. This seemed important at showing how smart Harry really can be. I am not sure why that was left out since that scene went on long enough to add it without length change to the film. There are times where it seems that when making this movie, there is no care for keeping such great writing dialog that already exists in the books. This sometimes seems a bit disrespectful from a viewer's point of view. Again, I am not a book purist, but if there is some good writing, why not use some of it.The end was as dull and flat as any movie that had almost no budget at all. Talk about leaving you feeling unfulfilled. I truly hope that since this director and writer are doing the last film, that they take some time to listen to how people felt about this one. I would hate to see the end of this series end this flat.The last thing I need to mention, even if you disagree with everything I have said, this is proof that the movie was less than all the others. We have gone to the opening night of each movie. This was the lightest and almost non-existent applause by the entire audience we have ever heard. AND instead of waiting for all the credits to roll, people left as soon as the director's name appeared.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
472,ANewLeaf,The focus is on the fluff.,6,16 July 2009,"This is the review of my favorite book of the Harry Potter series and unfortunately the weakest movie of the series to date.Spoilers will be present.Much of the focus on this movie is relationships. Snogging and jilted love abounds for the first 2/3 of the movie. Action takes a very small back seat and seems rushed, while any chance to further a emotional moment of jealousy is focused on to the point of boredom. Despite this focus the actual emotional payoff between the characters going through this at the end of the movie is somehow missing.The last 1/3 of the book is an amazing ride of action, tension, and despair. The movies shift to this moment seems very rushed, it is Harry all of the sudden being made aware of hoar cluxes and wisked away to find one in what seems to be within a whole 2 minutes. The scene of getting the ""hoar crux"" from the cave which was explained in great detail in the book was rushed.Probably the worst change from the book, and truly a critical flaw, was that Harry is NOT immobilized by Dumbledore before his fateful confrontation with Malfoy and Snape. In the book Dumbledore knows that Harry would not simply stand by a watch as he is killed, but in the movie this is exactly what he does. He is not immobilized, forced to helplessly watch as Dumbledore is slain. In the book Harry is given no chance to attempt to save Dumbledore, in the movie he has the choice to attempt to save him but chooses not to. This changes the critical scene of the entire book in a huge way. Harry loses complete control at the death of Dumbledore, his enraged attack on the Death Eaters at the moment of his becoming unfrozen, his realization that the breaking of Dumbledore's spell means he has died. This is all destroyed via Harry NOT BEING FROZEN.The subsequent battle between Death Eaters and the schools teachers is flat out removed, Snape's struggle to remain sane and in control while being called a coward by Harry after his sacrifice he had to make only moments ago. All of this stuff which was critical to the book is flat out gone.For the amount of fluff this movie focused on it is amazing how many critical aspects of the storyline were rushed and I cannot believe the crucial changes to the story that take place from the time Harry and Dumbledore return to Hogwarts until the end of the movie.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince

You wait and wait for the beat.. a pulse... a sign of life... and instead you get a big ol_____________________________________flat line. No excitement to be found here I'm sorry to say. Besides not including a lot of the elements essential to the story line. They just didn't progress the story very much at all. We know Dumbledore is dead, Harry, Ron and Hermione are going to search for the horcruxes , and everyone is in love. It is a truly sad interpretation of the book. I agree with an earlier poster...We need a redo! Call it a Mulligan and try again. If this is what Yates has in store for us for DH part 1 & 2 then this will be a really sad ending for what started out as a great effort to bring such a wonderful series of books to life. Being loyal fans we deserve more. The characters, the actors and JK deserve more. Much much more than this lame attempt by Yates. I read some poor reviews of the movie before seeing it and just did not want to believe it. Well I can tell you it's all sadly true. Of the series this is by far the worst!

476,scattering_like_light,David Yates - a man responsible for single-handedly ruining Harry Potter.,1,6 August 2009,"David Yates has had at his disposal for this film a gargantuan budget, a selection of fine British actors, an amazing story to work with, and some of the best and most inspired technicians and creative minds working in film today. How then he has managed to produce 'this' defies belief.Anyone who has read the books will feel consistently let down, all over again. If you thought he did an appalling job of OOTP, he really outdoes himself here. A quite staggering lack of understanding about what is important in this instalment will leave you feeling confused, frustrated, and angry that so much misjudgement has gone on, and been allowed to do so by people that really should know better.The cinematography is stunning, and the VFX equally so, but Yates has once again chosen to focus this creative brilliance on the most irrelevant and unimportant parts of the book, disregarding some of the most crucial scenes and setups for future storyline for reasons best known to himself. He has once again played up the small comedic elements found in the books, and so much so in this instalment that it could almost be a Rom-com about Ron and Lavender. Like Phoenix, again we see Yates's tragic misunderstanding of what the book is about. Once again, I am forced to ask myself why someone with such a failure to grasp the essential storyline has been put in charge of so much of it.Acting-wise, we all know what to expect from the main trio (not much), and subtle improvements do find their way in somehow (mainly Radcliffe), but you don't have much time to notice - you are too busy wondering where your favourite scenes from the book went. The best actors in it, Maggie Smith, Robbie Coltrane and (to a lesser extent) Alan Rickman are again under-used, and reduced to sideline periphery, as is the central plot about horcruxes. Michael Gambon as Dumbledore seems slightly improved from the hopelessly inappropriate performance he gave in OOTP, but it is still maddeningly obvious that he hasn't actually read any of the books, and has little or no understanding of his character, its history or motivations. Very very disappointing. And of course Yates is in no position to tell him how to do it - he clearly doesn't know either.And so to the biggest, and most criminally disappointing aspect of the film, the woefully poor ending. An absolute departure from what should happen, and for no good reason that I can see, Yates has seen fit to butcher this out of all recognition. This is a lesson in how to turn what should be a highly emotionally-charged and tense, exciting moment into a horrible pastiche that gives you little more than the general gist, explains nothing, and features not one jot of the pathos and emotional resonance of the book's proper ending. He has simply done his own thing, and his own thing is a p*ss-poor imitation of the original.This is an epic failure on most levels. It is saved to some degree by its visual impressiveness but ultimately, so much of the book has been ignored, rewritten or just made up as he went along, that anyone who has read the books cannot come away from this feeling anything but disappointment, frustration, and like they have wasted their money.David Yates, in my opinion, has wasted everyone's money. Again. 2 films done, and 2 films ruined, and now they're going to let him ruin the last 2 as well. It's really not looking good is it ?

So when we got to see all the actors we've been watching for years, finally start playing the field- we loved it! But I think we all forgot that the book wasn't meant to be portrayed like this. It's a dark world and this has a dark storyline. They completely cut out every fight scene and any other negative stuff and replaced it with romantic garbage. This book was powerful and you really got the sense of how horrible things were getting for Harry and the rest of the world. I remember my heart breaking when reading the book because Rowling portrayed so well how angry, lonely, scared, and doubtful Harry was having just lost some of the most important people in his life and knowing the fate of the world rests completely with him.

478,john-3047,Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince Good special affects but Disappointing Harry Potter Movie,5,17 November 2009,"Up until now the Order of the Phoenix was my least favorite Harry Potter Movie this one has now taken that position. I know it is difficult to compress a large book into the time frame of a movie deciding what to leave out and how to close the plot holes created. This one however deviates further from the book than its predecessors it not only leaves a lot out as expected, it has added scenes that are not in the book and appear to have been included only to enhance the 3D effects in the cinema, make things difficult for the next director to stick to the original story line (e.g. The sequences at the borough) or like the scene in the railway café for no logical purpose; and is out of character with the book. Each new director has understandably put his own stile on the movie, but at some point I ask is this a continuing story following the lives and adventures of a group of teenage wizards over a seven year period, in which case there should be some consistency and continuity throughout the series, if so Hogwarts and locations and objects within it should not change from movie to movie. If on the other hand the movies are not meant to be a continuing story but separate adventures that just have the same character's then this movie OK, but there were so many inconsistence's and contradictions to the books and the other movies that I found it very jarring to watch as part of the Harry Potter series and as such was disappointing.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
479,samuelroberts-45076,"Very good, Yates' finest",8,6 November 2018,"Half-Blood Prince is good enough to warrant the praise and to put the idea in my head about whether to call it a masterpiece. The tone is perfect, the laughs are many, the darkness is charcoal black. One of the many things i love about this film, is its ability to be a comedy film, with many laughable moments and also a dark, gritty stage of the series. One of the reasons it works so much is Delbonnel- the brilliant cinematographer behind the camera. So many moments linger in my mind due to the beauty of their composition and use of their environments to stay interesting and exciting at all times. Visually, you cannot be bored. It just goes to show that it is never the director alone, but also the team he or she brings along. The cinematography is excellent, blocking is used superbly and the close-ups are astonishingly good. The acting is superb as usual, but it's Jim Broadbent as Slughorn who steals the show. This one works better at retaining more subplots and not stripping it quite so bare. Subtle hints are planted so no long winded exposition is needed to make us, as an audience, feel stupid and lectured to. Instead Yates and crew allow us to show our intelligence and ability to use our eyes and memories to piece things together, making the experience more enjoyable as we believe we are solving the mysteries and not the director who is skilfully guiding us through. To me, this is the most memorable film in the series, and one of the best, with one of the strongest plots.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince

482,slytherins_queen2,Here's the thing...,9,15 July 2009,"Is it the book? No. But by god it's a fantastic movie! Not since PS/SS has a HP movie captured the essence and magic of the books, and is there ever magic! Although some things may be confusing to those who haven't read the books,the movie appeals to all sorts of people, old or young. With a perfect balance of humor romance and darkness.Gambon gives the best performance so far of his in the HP franchise, he finally perfects Dumbledore, and the scene with potion in the cave is absolutely heartbreaking.Tom Felton shows us his real talents turning Draco Malfoy from smug bully to evil baddass, with surprisingly more layers then one may originally thought. Being an avid fan (having devoted many hours to fansites, fanfiction, podcasts, merchandise) I must say I was hesitant about this film but really, it's awesome. In the middle it gets a little shaky but only a little, on the whole it's a fantastic film, almost perfect.Hero Fiennes-Tiffin is defiantly someone to look out for in the future, like his uncle he seems to possess a quality about him that draws you in.Some stand out scenes for me where when the Burrow gets attacked, Sectumsempra, Ron being poisoned by the love potion, Felix Felicis, The cave scene and the tower scene. The only real qualms I had with the film were that Evanna Lynch and Matt Lewis (Luna and Neville) were underused. Also in times it was cheesy, but what can you do?! XD Other then that- fantastic! Go see this film!",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
483,markjellis,Slow and Dull. Richard Curtis Lite,3,4 August 2009,"This film was so slow it almost stopped. The plot took an age to get going and was OK thereafter, but not until near the end.The good points: Visually impressive with gravitas added by the British elder ensemble.Otherwise as well as above the 'romantic' element seemed to come out of a bad Richard Curtis film (and that's bad). Cheesy clichés performed by New Labour Luvvies, except they are teenagers of the type that has not existed since before Rock and Roll. I was even expecting to see Hugh Grant making a cameo.And what time period is this film set in? We see the Millennium Bridge destroyed yet the rest appears to be from somewhere between a Dickens novel and an early 20th Century public school. Trust the Brits to come up with something popular that is also so 'out of time'.Apparently this film takes a lot of liberties compared with the book. Really? Certainly took liberties with me, by calling it entertainment.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
484,janeathane,Ehh.. Nothing Special,6,19 July 2009,"As with every movie that I've seen this summer, Harry Potter and The Half-Blood Prince was hit and miss. Though I believe that it is the first one that had more hits than misses.First off I was glad to see that Steve Kloves returned as screenwriter for the film. I thought his adaptations of the novels were very well done, and was dumbfounded when they called on Michael Goldenberg, some random I've never even heard of to adapt the fifth novel for the screen, my least favorite of the movie series. So at least the screenplay had that going for it. New character introductions were done well, as was the progression of the story, which brings me to another downfall, the story.I never read the book, so I don't really know how much was left out, however it seemed that it was missing quite a bit of events. For a 2 1/2 hour movie I would think that it would spend more time building up the stuff that matters, such as The Half-Blood Prince and Tom Riddle's backstory, rather than unnecessary romance. I also felt that the Lavender Brown character should have been thrown in the Disappearing Cabinet, never to return again, seeing as the movie would have been better without her.The film did have its moments. I was glad to see that the series is beginning to take a more serious and mature approach. The entire film had a different feel to it, a very dark feel throughout. Even the annual train ride to Hogwarts was dark, the usually beautiful landscapes were no where to be found, foreshadowing the events that were about to take place. The score was also spectacular as always. But if there is one thing I am always impressed with in all of the Harry Potter movies, it's the casting. Each new character eases in very nicely to the story and the acting is great.I could not write a review on the movie without expressing my feelings for the ending. In a way the end somewhat followed the dark mood of the film as it did not end with happiness like the majority of the other films, and no house points were awarded. But it could have been so much more. As I said, I didn't read the book, but I know for a fact the story didn't end as abruptly as it did in the movie. I was expecting to see a badass showdown, but all I was given was credits. I sat there speechless for a little bit wondering what the hell just happened. The lack of build up on what I suppose would be called a twist (though it was hard to tell if it is even considered a twist seeing as it was only one line) left me feeling pretty disappointed in the film. I can understand why it was done this way though. The bad guys can't always lose, the end of the movie was a chance for them to have their moment. I believe it was also to gets fans amped up for the next movie, seeing as it is going to be one hell of a battle, I just don't think that the excitement will last for another year, its charm will wear off. I can tell from this movie that they are trying to milk Harry Potter for all its worth. Splitting the last book into two movies? Why, when they could have taken the romance one of HP6, swap it with the battle, and finish it off with one more movie.All together I enjoyed the film, but I don't agree with the majority of the people saying that it is the best one so far. Don't let anything I've said stop you from seeing it if your into the other movies because it is still much like the others, it just could have been better",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
485,hrstar24,A great improvement from the previous movies,9,15 July 2009,"The problems with all of the Harry Potter movies so far have been that the director hasn't had complete control over the project because not all the books were out, so the complete story wasn't known. That meant that should a detail that becomes important at the end be left out, massive problems could be caused. This gave the Potter films a very rushed and very complex plot, which alienated audiences. Half Blood Prince is the first movie out since the final book was released, so director David Yates had complete creative control, and let me be the first to say the improvements are incredible.Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) is entering his sixth year at Hogwarts, and now that Lord Voldemort has announced his return to the world, war has broken out. The movie starts with the Death Eaters (Voldemort supporters) attacking a muggle (non-wizard folk) bridge, killing many people. Harry then returns to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry and must struggle with two different things: Malfoy (Tom Felton) plotting something against Hogwarts after joining Voldemort, as well as what all 16 year old boys struggle with, women. Harry and Dumbledore (Michael Gambon) also explore Voldemort's past in order to try and find out his weaknesses.The main improvement made to Half Blood Prince is definitely the writing. Writer Steve Kloves returns to the series with much improved dialogue and this time around the jokes are actually pretty funny. The characters are much more real this time, for example Helena Bonham Carter as the cynical Bellatrix Lestrange seems much creepier this time around since she has more screen time. Yates uses his creative control as he shifts the focus mostly onto the love triangles and adolescence instead of Voldemort and Malfoy like the book did. This isn't a bad thing at all, since Yates has added scenes to really flesh out every character which causes the audience to actually care about the story. While the pacing faltered a bit at the ending, it did succeed in producing a similar feeling of hopelessness and mystery which reminded me a lot of Empire Strikes Back. Let me warn you now, not that it's a bad thing, the movie ends with a big TO BE CONTINUED? Michael Gambon also makes a dramatic improvement to his acting in Half Blood Prince. His last attempt to play the quirky but brilliant headmaster was a disaster, as he failed to capture the lightheartedness and warmth that Dumbledore conveys in the books, fans went as far as dubbing him Angrydore. Gambon is in much better form this time around, as well as all the other actors. Unfortunately Radcliffe gets overshadowed in most of his scenes, but it's hard to shine with a cast like Gambon, Helena Bonham Carter, Alan Rickman, and newcomer Jim Broadbent who plays the new Professor Slughorn. The special effects have also improved with this film as the spells and magical objects look even better, and when our characters explore the Weasly twins wizard joke shop the visuals are astounding.While many of the flaws of previous Harry Potter movies were fixed, like the plot is actually understandable to non book readers this time, Half Blood Prince is not flawless. Most of story that Yates changes or leaves out are great improvements for the movie, there are a couple that he definitely should not have touched. The climax in the cave is brilliant, but instead of leading to an even bigger climax like the book did with an epic battle, the movie completely leaves this part out. There was a lot of build up for a massive battle, but it seemed to be for nothing.Overall Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince is leaps and bounds ahead of all the other Potter films, but what stops it from true greatness is the anticlimactic ending. It is ¾ of a great movie, which makes it still worth while. Since the next and final Harry Potter book is being split into two movies (which allows more time to connect with characters and subplots), I expect more great things from David Yates with this series.7/10 + 2 for trolls = 9/10",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
486,jednumber2,Best One In The Series,10,23 August 2009,"OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG Harry potter and the half blood prince is one of the best harry potter movies in the entire series, this movie has such a great story with great casting and suspense, this has a great ending but I'm not going to spoil it but let's just say that the movie has a Sad Sad ending The Cast Daniel Radcliffe is just the beginning of the awesome cake, his supporting cast Emma Watson and Rupert grint are great as harry's best friends, Alan rickman plays the teacher Snape. HUGE SHOCK AT THE END OF THE MOVIE The Story This movie has a great and intriguing story that has you being pulled in for the entire thrill ride that never lets go of you when you're on the ride, if you have read the books this will be a great movie The Action Sequences Don't get all fanboy on me, i love this movie to the heavens but the one problem with this movie is that there is not many action sequences but when there is action, it is so intense you feel like you are harry potter Verdict On my scale of 1 out of 10, i am not surprised with the rating that I'm going to give it, 10 out of 10 this is a epic masterpiece of cinema that you must see on the big screen, it won't have the same feel on DVD",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
487,dslowen,Ehh... it could have been better.,5,26 July 2009,"I will start with something positive. The acting was definitely first class and the spats of hormonal humor was funny, and reminisce to the earlier years at Hogwarts. First of all who is saying that Quidditch is back? All we saw was Ron blocking a few shots. It was the start to many patched scenes.This movie left me with one major question.. what was the editor/director thinking? There were no transitions. It was a flash of brief scene after scene, stringing together multiple plots, leaving it choppy and lacking consistency. The jump from underdeveloped plot to underdeveloped plot broke the fourth wall, jolting you to the next scene with a lack of storytelling and pace.A key element to the magic of the other films, the musical score, was unimpressive, absent, and sorely missed.The growth of Harry and Ginny's relationship was poorly shown. Their kiss was done in the same angle and fashion of Harry and Cho's kiss from the previous, giving no sense of importance. This tells me that the director has no creativity or innovation. This should have been a special moment and it was demoted to mediocre. A lot of the scenes were too long. A joke or funny scene was held on to for too long, as if the director was saying, ""Here's the joke, now laugh."" It made you painfully aware of watching a movie, making the humor awkward. And why, oh why, would you add things that weren't big in the book, attack on the bridge and the burrow, and omit important information like Voldemort's past? Don't add extra stuff, when there is already so much to work with.My greatest disappointment was in the end. The one thing I was looking forward to and that was promoted in the trailers, was the death eaters attack on the castle and the battle with the students. Perhaps the greatest action scene out of the story and it's glazed over, resulting in a few crazy Belatrix yells and trashing the great hall. The very final scene, where in the other movies the audience was left with a feeling of completion, value, and lead to the next story, was in this movie interrupted by Hermione giving a crack about Harry and Ginny. The childish comment totally wiped any sincerity that they have truly grown up and matured. Way to lighten the only moment that needed weight to it... I don't think if you hadn't read the books you could possibly understand what fully happened. I could go on, but i have a lot of little critiques, through out the movie. And I'm trying to focus on the main problems As a warning to those who haven't read the books: I was greatly disappointed in the last book and will not see it in the theater or otherwise, and I advise others to do so. Spare yourself from the agony and disappointment. It's better just not knowing. There are no words for the sense of betrayal I feel towards that book and the warped plot and characters JK portrayed.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince

489,teeleigh417,"High school movie, with a little Harry Potter mixed in",7,16 July 2009,"Now don't get me wrong, I did like the movie a lot. However, I think their focus was on romance too much and not on what really matters in the big picture.Firstly, the Half-Blood Prince is titled as such because Harry, Snape, and Voldemort all have much in common and Harry slowly realizes this as he becomes more obsessed with his Potions book. Sadly, this doesn't really come into play except for Harry carrying it around all the time. No one really discusses what it actually is or means, it basically provides Harry with ""Sectumsempra"" and that's the end.Secondly, I don't think the history of Voldemort was explored NEARLY as much as it should have been. There should have been at least the memory including the Gaunt family (and Peverell ring), and Voldemort coming to apply for the DADA job. Without these, Harry and Dumbledore are clueless when it comes to finding the Horcruxes.Speaking of Horcruxes, how is Harry supposed to find them???! The whole plot of the seventh book, and thus the next two movies, is finding the Horcruxes and destroying them! But they hardly even addressed the diary and ring in this movie. They will have to stretch pretty far in order to get information to the audience about them, which really only upsets HP fans more. When in doubt, STICK TO THE BOOK! However, there are many redeeming qualities to the movie, one of such is acting. Most everyone did brilliantly, and I give special dibs to Daniel Radcliffe, Tom Felton, Michael Gambon, Helena Bonham Carter, and Alan Rickman for exceptional performances. The only anti-dib I give out is to Bonnie Wright (Ginny Weasley), who was so blank-faced she probably made a wooden plank cringe.Overall, Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince is well done in all cinematic respects. But when put in the big picture, the writers and David Yates will have to kind of scramble to get everything essential in, since they left it out of this movie. That is why I give this 7/10.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
490,soniya-ahuja,A must watch for fans and not so much the fans of Harry Potter,9,19 July 2009,"The first thing I said to my friend after leaving the Theatre was that after the Sorcerer's Stone, this was the perfect adaptation of a Harry Potter book. The direction was awesome and it captured and accentuated the key plot points. The cinematography was superb. Throughout the movie various color schemes have been used - right from vivid sunny colors to obscure tints of reds and blues - all these create just the perfect ambiance.One character which was personified perfectly was ALBUS DUMBLEDORE. I believe that I had lost faith in the director after I watched Dumbledore yelling at the top of his voice in ""Goblet of Fire"". But after watching this movie, I just couldn't be less satisfied with a portrayal of Dumbledore. Michael Gambon plays the character with just the perfect emotions, aggression and humility.Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson and Rupert Grint play their characters very well. The chemistry between Harry-Ginny and more between Ron-Hermione is brought out very well. The tension, love, tenderness, jealousy and irk are outlined beautifully with subtle scenes. The director has made actions speak a lot - I liked that! The character of Severus Snape remains just as obscure as ever. Alan Rickman portrays Snape perfectly with just the right blend of notoriety, suspense and a character to hate. The one important scene which marks the fate of Dumbledore, Snape and Harry could not have been manifested better. I was crying even though I knew what was about to come. All because of the marvelous performances, cinematography and direction.All in all - the movie would bring gratification to HP fans who can understand that the movie has to be shorter than the book and would be glad that the key points are not missed out.The movie is probably the best way in which a plot as varied as HP Part VI could be encapsulated and to a person who does not read the book - the plot could not be explained in a more lucid manner.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
491,sourav-dey06,"Awful, Disgusting, A complete nightmare",1,18 July 2009,"i saw this movie today and i was compelled to write a comment. SFX and publicity gimmicks don't make a great film and anybody who are going gaga over this movies are pathetic losers. this is probably the weakest harry potter movie of all time. i expected the film to be bad, as the story was far more complicated than the previous ones, and the scripting crew did a disappointing job on the fourth and the fifth installments, but at least it could have been made better had the director had vision. i don't know why they are continuing with David Yates. by far azkaban was the best potter movie, and will be the best of the franchisee. if one rates the book as 10 on 10 then this movie should be rated 0.01 on 10. from the very first scene it was boring and the most pathetic was the dumbledore's death scene. it was rubbish. for many parts of the film lacked detailing and if anyone who hasn't read the book would end up guessing as to why things were happening. if this is the case then i guess what will happen to the final film!! please WB change the director and bring back Curaeon instead.after reading so many comments i was forced to write a bit more. i was wondering as to why people are loving this movie? first, dursleys are missing from action, second, harry is saved by Luna( GOD!!) and not tonks, third, pensieve is missing, fourth, ministry is missing, fifth, voldemort's family background and his love for collectibles of great men are missing, snapes's character is not shaped, and the big fight at the castle is missing, as if the death eaters just ran into hogwarts and made a fun of it...man o man.....how are these things missing, all these are necessary for the final part of the film!!! don't Yates realize that he is playing with audience's love?? i don't know whether people who have not read the book would actually hate snape for his act in killing dumbledore and when they find out in the last part that he was actually obeying dumbledore's orders, they will love his character. this was the film where snapes's character should have been given that shape as the biggest villain after voldemort, then only people could have cried when he dies in the deathly hallows.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince

Harry must *spoiler* destroy the Horcruxes that allow Voldemort to never die *spoiler*. The movie becomes even more dark and omnious with the death of Dumbledore and the ever-foreboding Severus.Harry's 6th year is refreshing and has it's share in laughs.

493,akgill,I was numb throughout the adventure!!!!!!!!,10,24 August 2010,"As always I'll start with what I didn't like here. The pure exclusion of Marvolo, Merope and Morfin. I was particularly excited about the scene where Harry gets a glimpse of Hufflepuff's Cup but that didn't happen. Ralph Fiennes'es superb acting could've been exhibition-ed more if they had shown that exchange about a job b/w him and Dumbeldore. and then the absence of Ravenclaw's diadem in the movie.But all of that aside, understanding the limits of a move I conclude this Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince is an immensely enjoyable joyride filled with beautiful people (you know what I mean :p). Alan Rickman and Tom Felton have proved that their acting skill if of the highest class. Personally I compare Tom to Elijah Wood in Sin City (very slight resemblance) and Alan Rickman's style is just incomparable.No need to emphasize on the rest of the cast as they all are amazing down to the last uncredited person used in this movie. The newest member Mr. Jim 'Fenoglio' Broadbent does not diminish the legacy of all newcomers(initiated by the genius Gary Oldman).O yeah one last thing that waitress was really cute.

Dumbledor (Gambon) persuades Slughorn (Broadbent) back from retirement so Harry can find out a memory that will unlock the secret into beating Voldemort.This is the 1st potter film i have seen, when i have read the book first. The previous films i went and read the book after, and i would advice anybody to do what i have done previously. By watching the films first i got to enjoy the film with out knowing what was going to happen and then got to read a much more detailed book leaving me enjoying the film and loving the book.In the early books they were short enough not miss anything or nothing of any importants out of the film, but as in the last film, in this there is so much missed out, or scenes that didn't go into any detail that you always left thinking why haven't they done this or that.Possible spoilers - As an example to anybody who has read the book, one of the scene, or collection of scenes that I felt need a lot more time or even just a few minutes of screen time as it played a very important part of the plot was the death of the Hagrid (Robbie Coltrane) spider. In the book there is a lot of references to how the spider had died and that he would like the 3 students to come the funeral, but harry (Radcliffe) and Ron (Grint) hated the spider and didn't want to go. In the film harry and Slughorn(Jim Broadbent), just happened to appear when Hagrid is mourning over it.Also they left out the entire fight between the teachers + DA vs Deatheaters and most of the back story of Lord Voldemort. -Possible spoiler end That's aside the film wasn't a bad watch, but it never made you leaving cinema thing wow and i must see that again. When watch the Prisoner of Azkaban & Goblet of Fire, i felt that this was must get DVD when it came out.The special effects and the Cinematography of the grounds and castle were excellent as ever.The acting in my option like the last 5 films from the three leads was average, but on a good note Alan Rickman who plays Snape, is out standing and worth seeing just for his performance. He plays the character brilliantly as the evil, cunning sly teacher (really should give him an Oscar nomination).In short the film missed far to much from the book and I'm glad seeing on the size of the last book they decided to split the next film into two.

As the movie is part American I would say the one responsible for all the nonsense (apart from the producers of course) is the screenplay writer :Steve Kloves. This being said, this film seems to miss all the essential notions from the book. Although adapting a book is never easy, this film shows no effort at all has been made to bring the real story to the audience. If you do not know the story from the book, you may even sit there wondering what it's all about because there's hardly anything that's explained properly at all... The only true nice scene is the one from the quidditch game... well choreographed. The rest is a total waste.

The books grew bigger as the series went on, and in fact the last book in so big that they talk of releasing 2 movies to cover it.The movie stands very well on its own and it is really well done. The only thing that bothered me was the lack of action concerning Drako and his mission and how it drags to get to its resolution.The effects are quite good and the tone of the movie is excellent.I would not recommend to bring very young children because the movie is very serious and they will get bored.Thumbs up for this really good movie.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
499,tac-15,Poor adaptation of a very good read,4,28 September 2010,"This long awaited film was truly a disappointment and I won't go into detail of the many things omitted since they are well elaborated in the reviews of others on this site. The acting was very good, the visual effects interesting. But for those who have actually ready the books, one is left at the end with: is that ALL there IS? and What happened to...? etc. In every Harry Potter film up to now, there have been significant moments and persons left out. It catches up with the film makers now more than ever with the adaptation of the sixth book and, I would surmise, we shall see how this continues with the adaptation of the seventh and final book. It already has been proposed in two parts and so I could only wonder whether or not this is meant to be more ""faithful to the text"" and/or the film writers/directors/producers are finally now going to fill in all the gaps left along the way. Yes, readers of the books OUGHT to take issue with this film and its very superficial adaptation of a very fine read. I can only wonder what author J. R. Rawlings thought of this and how much input she is given for the film productions. It is noteworthy to say here that, when filming the ""Lord of the Rings"" movies, Peter Jackson and his people were very sensitive to those who had read and loved Tolkien's novel (yes, it really was one book). What I see done to the Harry Potter books is nothing short of great insensitivity to the reading public. The film's story line reminded me of the work done by a rather lazy student who had a book report to do and had only skimmed the text. There is little depth, many unanswered questions, characters whose development was left wanting. As I got to the end of the movie it occurred to me that someone watching this who had never read the book would be nearly clueless as to what was actually transpiring.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
500,dante_feditech,"A middle, middle, and a middle - and a disappoint middle at that.",3,18 July 2009,"I enjoyed parts of this film, an I wanted to give it a higher grade, but I just couldn't make myself. I've never read the books and have never wanted to until now - and the *only* reason that I now want to read the last book is because this film just leaves you hanging, without satisfaction, closure, or ending. It reminds me of the first Lord Of The Rings. I could even hear, ""I'll come with you Mr Frodo!"" in the closing moments. ""And you can have my sword!"" ""And my shield!"" ""And my bow!"" And a quest of all things? I'm sure it'll be a very good and interesting quest. But from this series I kinda expected something a little less . . . mundane.It's fairly obvious that Dombledore (If that's spelled wrong - I told you I hadn't read the books) was manipulating everything from behind the scenes. Which makes his death at the end a glorious and convoluted suicide. I *assume* the whole point was to give the death-eaters a massive and undeniable victory on a silver platter and thus prompt the wizarding world into action. And while that is brave and noble, in it's own way, it doesn't make me care about him, or Harry, or or anyone else in their little club of X-Man... Sorry, wizards. (I swear he was channelling Professor Xavier when he first met Tom Riddle.) Except Snape. Him I feel genuine pity for. Forced to be a spy, forced to kill a good friend, forced to become a pariah to everyone he's ever known, and living with people who would kill him in a second if they ever learnt the truth. Those are emotional scares he will never get rid of. I feel really sorry for him.Oh wait, I'll amend that. Snape and the hogwarts security guards, who were presumably trying to honestly do their best - despite Dumbledore deliberately leaving two massive gaping holes in the grounds magical protection. Or possible more holes? How desperate was he to hand the death eaters a victory? (While protecting Harry.) How many security guards was he willing to lose to accomplish his goals? How many children? Okay, a war is coming, and people need to be galvanised, but if those same people find out what Dumbledore really did, it would kinda undermine everything he seemed to be doing in this film.And about that Mr Potter... His growing maturity is one of the highlights of this film. The moment in the cavern when he forced that horrible gunk down Dumbledore's throat was genuinely creepy, and obviously deeply unpleasant for Harry as well, and yet he did it anyway, because sometimes adults are required to do deeply unpleasant things, even when they really don't want to.But this is mostly just a tiny part of the film. The revelation that Vordormort has split his soul to enhance his own survival was, erm, interesting. It made sense, and sounded strategically sensible. But the idea that were supposed to be shocked that this required murder? Or that Mr V might have killed *Gasp!* SEVEN people! No! Seriously? He's killed more than two people? I didn't know that! I thought he stopped at just the two and his failure during the third attempt made him turn over a new leaf. (Okay, I'll stop now.) And the whole 'murder is a crime against nature' nonsense. I know Dumbledore probably only has a vague notion of what a television is, and has probably never watched a nature documentary - but I still expect him to have some vague knowledge of reality. Murder is a part of nature, a vital process of the food chain. Pretending that killing a human is fundamentally different from killing any other animal (outside of the law books and our collective opinion at least) is nothing more than egocentric psychological masturbation. Anything else reeks of creationism...Other's have already complained bitterly about the very large amount of time wasted on the romantic subplots. So I'll leave that alone. And instead finish off by complaining about the lack of muggle backlash. If this was some kind of 24 affair, then that might be excused, but the story takes place over a period of several weeks at least. So when will they get involved exactly? I mean it's already Word of God (from Rowling herself) than a muggle with a shotgun will beat a wizard 9 times out of 10. Of course the wizards that need doing in aren't exactly part of the fat and lazy 90%, but then again muggles have *slightly* better weapons than shotguns if needed. So if a war is coming, why has not a single wizard even mentioned (even in passing) the thought that it might possible be a good idea to think about maybe involving the muggles at one point? Okay, last time I amend this list I promise. Snape, the security guards, and the poor bastards killed on the Millennium Bridge. I feel more sympathy for all of them than Dumbledore.Most of these complaints are about the tone of the whole series, rather then the film in specific. But I'm sure sure that matters. The themes of this film are the themes of the series, so I believe the complaints still stand. As I've said this film has made me (somewhat) want to buy the last book. But the thing in, I've already brought four £7 cinema tickets so far, and paperbacks aren't that expensive. So given that I've paid over the odds I think JK owes me a free books, and might just download a pirate copy instead.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince

For young viewers, the death of a beloved character can be extremely upsetting. Other characters are injured, kicked and cursed in frightening ways, and a very intense climatic scene involving frightening, demon-like creatures is guaranteed to frighten young children. There are also some upsetting scenes and violent attacks. Some of the students are almost adults (16 years old), so there is a few romantic moments between boys and girls, but kissing and hand-holding is as far as it goes. Though Harry and the main characters continue as positive role models, characters continue their evil plans.

502,Pillalamarri,Harry Potter and the Half-Baked Plot,2,14 July 2009,"The problem with the Harry Potter books is that the books are too long, the twists are too sudden and convenient. Is Snape a god guy, a bad guy, a good guy, or a bad guy? Rowling makes him to be whatever fancies her at the moment, continuity and consistency be damned.One problem with the movies is that the books are too long. Another is that they rely on people having read the book. Or else, things don't make sense, because, even at 2hr 35mins, they have to cut scenes from the book, and the result seems to be a disjointed hodge-podge of scenes, with a bushel-full of inconsistencies. People are disappearing, so they say in one scene, but other than that lone statement, things are going on jolly well the rest of the time. On the one hand everybody can do magic, on the other hand, they act surprised at each other's stuff. Draco is supposed to be fiendishly clever, but neither he, nor the eviller Snape has no idea of being followed by Harry.The trouble with this magic stuff is that one can be as lazy as one wishes to be in plot construction, as at any given time, you can change things around to what you want them to be, just by waving a wand.Emma Watson is the true star of the show. Maggie Smith is in the movie all of perhaps two minutes.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
503,enderbean29,Good addition to the series,8,17 July 2009,"I went into this movie expecting not to like it because of all the talk of what they cut out of the novel. I was wrong.The plot moved a good pace. There never seemed to be a scene that was wasted. The movie was starting to hit a lull but then the scene with Fenrir and Bellatrix attacked the Burrow seemed well placed (it wasn't in the book.) The acting of the Harry, Ron, and Heromione has improved greatly over the series. Each time they get a bit better. The addition of Jim Broadbent as Slughorn was a great choice. He fit the part right, except I imagined him to be a bit more obese. But it didn't seem to matter.I was disappointed that they didn't include the battle of Hogwarts toward the beginning of the book but I am glad that they kept the ending the same. Very sad. I hope they have the funeral in the next one.Even though I was disappointed at what was cut (mainly the other scenes delving into Voldemort's past), I was impressed. I walked out satisfied with the end product.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
504,cernan,A Fine Adaptation For What It's Worth,9,19 July 2009,"After witnessing the disaster also known as ""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix"" two years ago, I had pretty much written David Yates off. ""Half-Blood Prince"" is not only a more challenging novel to adapt to the big screen, but it also remains my favorite book in the series. Initially I had low expectations for ""Half-Blood Prince"", but after watching a couple of movie trailers and several clips online, I was thoroughly impressed and steadfastly awaiting the release of the film. The scourges of positive reviews calling it the ""best one yet"" only heightened my anticipation. I walked into the theater with lofty expectations, but in the back of my mind I feared for the worst.All things considered, ""Half-Blood Prince"" is the best in the series. When you're adapting a 600+ page book into a two-and-a-half hour film, it's inevitable that certain things will get cut. Over the years we have come to expect that. Creatively speaking, I do not agree with nor do I like many of the decisions that the producers of the film and Yates made. But then again, what they did works! ""Order of the Phoenix"" was a plot less, awkward, jumbled up mess. There was absolutely no effort on the part of the director to link the scenes together. We jumped from one place to another, from one event to another occasion without ever so much as a hint as to WHY we were doing this or HOW we were doing that. Now in ""Half-Blood Prince"", this ""scene skipping"" still occurs, but to a much lesser extent than in the previous film. There is actually a plot. Though it is buried underneath numerous love triangles, there is a plot.The cinematography in this film is simply breathtaking. Bruno Delbonnel (of the French film ""A Very Long Engagement"") does an outstanding job. When Oscar Nomination time comes around, I fully expect him to receive a nod.The strength of this film lies in its cinematography and its acting. Compared to all previously films, the acting in ""Half-Blood Prince"" is top-notch. I was initially very worried about what Michael Gambon would do to Dumbledore this time around. I much preferred Richard Harris, and so far Gambon had been nothing but a huge disappointment. This time around Gambon is much, much, much better than before, but I still do not think that he gives an accurate portrayal of Dumbledore as the readers of the books know him. In certain scenes I thought that I was even seeing Gandalf. Not Dumbledore through and through.The trio was good as usual. Daniel Radcliffe is much improved, coming off of his stage debut as Alan Strang in ""Equus"". His delivery in the comedy scenes is brilliant, while his acting in the more emotional scenes has improved a lot from a certain rather cheesy scene in ""Prisoner of Azkaban"". I've always found Emma Watson to be rather over the top with everything that she does, but she definitely drew the back the reigns a little bit in this one and pulls off the role nicely. Rupert Grint was brilliant and hilarious all throughout, though his character seemed to be forced into the role of comic relief.Jim Broadbent does a marvelous portraying Slughorn with just the right balance of ambition, arrogance, and fondness. He isn't given too much room to shine, but he makes the most of every scene that he's in.Alan Rickman is once again wonderful as Snape. Rickman's Snape does differ slightly from J.K. Rowling's Snape in that the Snape in the movies is more calm and in control than the Snape in the books. It's not a bad thing; it's just a different interpretation which works out beautifully.Now the real gem in the cast is Tom Felton. He picks up Draco Malfoy's expanded role in the film with incredible ease and truly delivers. He steals every single scene that he's in. It is astonishing how he has managed to pack so much feeling and so much emotion into a mere glance. Felton has really taken Draco as far from the arrogant snob that he was in the first five film as he can. The Draco that we see in this film has lost that air of arrogance and is instead thirsting to prove himself, to show that he can be Harry's equal. There is an aura of vulnerability as the wall that Draco has built around himself finally comes crashing down.""Half-Blood Prince"" is infinitesimally better than ""Order of the Phoenix"", and if Yates can continue this rate of improvement, then we are all sure to be in for a treat when ""Deathly Hallows"" comes out, for ""Half-Blood Prince"" is most definitely the best so far.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
505,raden-17267,An adaptation that captures the spirit and charm of the book well,9,18 May 2018,"It's witty, yet still dark. While it does have to leave parts of the book behind, it captures the essence that made this book great. While Order of the Phoenix has some kinda lazy VFX, I felt this movie did an excellent job utilizing the effects in new ways. Tom Felton and Michael Gambon make incredibly standout performances here. I do have a considerable bias here considering this is my favourite book in the series.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
506,jkok-4,Not a good adaptation,5,18 November 2009,"I have never had any problems accepting detours and storyline changes in novel adaptations when I can clearly see the point. The Half Blood Prince, however, seems to suffer from not deviating enough from the novels storytelling to work properly as a movie. Rather than being a whole and solid story which could in theory exist and stand on it's own as if the book had never been written, the movie felt to me like a chain of key events from the book vaguely linked together. I felt like too much attention was put into preserving the original story and keeping die hard fans as happy as possible, all at the expense of the story falling apart on the screen.Many of the scenes and key elements included in the movie I felt were poorly justified, like the skirmish in the field and the burning of the Weasley house, both of which I thought were useless and contributed nothing to the story. Some key elements in the story were also not given the appropriate attention, like Draco's mission, the Half Blood Prince's potion book and Dumbledore's death, the last of which lacked the emotion I had hoped for. A funny exemplary note about the potion book was the realization of the Half Blood Prince's identity. Nobody in the movie, in any line or any other incentive, had implied that we should be wondering who the Half Blood Prince might be and then, at the end, there's Snape going ""yes, Mr. Potter, it's me!"" No real surprise there, though I should take into account that having read the book I already knew what was coming. Nonetheless, if it's a known fact, it should be emphasized even more, otherwise it will make no impact.That said, I enjoyed what the movie was good for, which means that it was visually great and it's always fun to watch a book come to life in such a way that the Harry Potter series have. I've also enjoyed the story adaptations, though sadly only so far. This particular novel seems to have been too complex for a two-hour movie. This movie would have benefited from bigger and bolder decisions in screenplay writing. Of course, there's also the possibility to make the movie longer to be able to include everything, but I don't really see that as an option. I'm not that big a fan. Yawn.All in all, I hope for the last two movies the screenwriters have the courage to deviate from the story where they see it's needed, rather than sticking to what the fans so badly want.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
507,pgtmatrix,"As a movie it's the most well crafted of the series. But as an adaptation of the book, it was by far the worst.",8,19 July 2009,"Let me say this. Half Blood Prince as a movie alone was very good. It stands it's ground as a film better than any of the others of the series. But only as a film. And only because there are so many parts to a film. This installment obviously stepped everything up a notch: the cinematography, the special effects, the darker score, the improved acting, etc... But the key element which was boosted this franchise into world-class fame, is the story. And in this one, it's just not there. As a fan of the books and having had no SERIOUS gripes with any of the other films, I must say i HATED the screenplay for this one. Everything that made the book amazing was ripped from the film, and instead replaced by annoying large quantities of romantic subplot. Yes, there is romance in the sixth book but not shoved down your throat. JK Rowling masterfully crafted a novel that was perfectly balanced. The romance was there although it didn't detract from the main plot and at times was intertwined with the larger goings-on at hogwarts. In the movie the romance takes up most of the screen time. Not to mention the ending of the film was brutally butchered.So much time could have been detracted from the silly romances to focus on more important things which were completely ommitted or deliberately changed. The ending is extremely anti-climactic and once it's over it'll leave you in your seat thinking ""it's over?""My final gripe with this movie is that it really should have been PG-13. If you've read the novel then you know the subject matter is MUCH darker and the story would have been done greater justice with just a higher rating(and a better screenwriter, yes i'm looking at you Steve Kloves).Overall as a movie i'd give it an 8 out of 10.But as a HARRY POTTER movie it gets 4 out of 10. And that's pushing it.Well heres to 2010 to see how they screw up the finale. Oh wait, they already did. I didn't know there were 8 years at hogwarts...",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
508,ChasSaur,"For an adaptation of a 650 page 6th of 7 book, it'll do",8,15 July 2009,"First - not a raving Harry Potter fan. I don't find JK Rowling's writing style timeless or overly literary, but she spun a great story using great imagery and created characters you cared about. I consider the books entertaining and well-crafted, but I'm not a rabid HP fan.Now, in the grand scheme of things, this is the 6th book of 7. We're speeding towards an overall climax here - while this book is probably my favorite, I have to admit that it had to be hard to mount into a single movie. There are things that are important to the next book that have to be left in, but there are so many, it was probably hard to prune.Many critics have complained there's ""too much snogging"" - I actually liked that part. The fact is, the interpersonal relationships between the three main characters (+ Ginny) are a big part of the next book - it had to be addressed. I actually thought it was necessary and well done - sometimes I think those bonds have been downplayed in the other movies.The two young actors who play the young faces of Voldemort were both wonderfully, suitably creepy and off-putting. I only wish they had thrown in the memory sequences directly related to the Horcruxes. Not only were they some of the best parts of the book, I think Riddle's experiences with the individual Horcrux items will otherwise be difficult to explain for the last two-part movie, and I don't know how they are going to have Harry and crew know which items to look for.For critics who claim it's repetitive of the other movies...um, it's based on the book series. The books themselves are not more than a little repetitive. It cannot be avoided - though they tried by pulling out the final fight at Hogwarts. I hear that Yates did that to avoid supposed duplication in the final movie, but I think it was a real loss. After all the build-up about protecting the students, that the Death Eaters came in merely to assist in the killing of Dumbledore (instead of random killing and mayhem, as in the book) - their appearance felt unnecessary and a letdown. That was a great climax in the book, and the way it plays out in the movie simply feels hollow.Also, revealing the vanishing cabinets early on was disappointing. That was such a ""oh !@#$%^&*!"" moment in the book and it simply seemed matter of fact in the movie (though Tom Felton was EXCELLENT as Draco). They probably could have swapped a few fixing-the-cabinet scenes with memory scenes and created an easier-to-follow plot line.But I think so far, this is probably the first HP movie in a while where I've left the theater and felt like I had really enjoyed myself. I know enough about Harry Potter that I could follow the plot and was pleased at the world presented. It's one of the better visually prepared movies of the series, for certain.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
509,huzaifazahidmalik,"Just as a movie, Weakest of the Entire Series",6,6 May 2020,"As someone who is vaguely familiar with the books, and an admirer of the movies this was a major disappointment. Not saying that the movie is bad by any means but this is a case where the movie really crumbles under the weight of adaptation. Not everything written in books is translated well to film. And it feels like a lot of details that should be included are not and things that shouldn't be included are.
A pretty huge chunk of the movie feels like a series of disconnected scenes that you could change the order to and it wouldn't make any difference. Plus a huge setback is no narrative thrust, there is no goal that we are supposed to care about.
But on the upside, the last 40 minutes is one the best climaxes in history. That is what elevates the movie and increases rewatchability.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince

Broadbent (His name alone qualifies him as a Hogwarts professor!) is the perfect cast for Slughorn.But what's really phenomenal about this film is the music. Truly exceptional!I've read the book, but I don't mind the differences between book and film. Maybe one or two scenes more about Riddles past would have been better.

511,clarkson_fan,"While Lacking In Some Places, Over All It Surmounts All The Other Movies.",10,15 July 2009,"*WARNING, MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS!*The most disappointing thing for me in this film was the Harry and Ginny kiss. It was barely a kiss, if that. It should have been longer, and more special. I thought the scene was cute, but i greatly prefer the way they kissed in the book, with Harry kissing her as she runs up to hug him and all these people are there. It's like they did that with Ron and Lavender in the movie, making their kiss like Harry and Ginny's. But, that isn't that big compared to the whole picture.Given that this is a long book, i know they couldn't fit everything in. Two and a half hours is long, although i wish they could have at least left out the Burrow attack and put in like Bill and Fleur. While the attack was cool and stuff, i thought it was kind of unnecessary and wasted some time. I loved the almost kiss between Harry and Ginny before the attack, it was cute.While this things i did not like, overall they didn't make the movie bad. I loved it. I loved the laughs, i loved the sadness, like when Dumbledore died. They show him falling toward the ground in slow motion and that made an impact on me. It was really sad. They got my heartstrings pulled with that. But why didn't Ron have any lines in the last part? He just sat and stood there. Lol. But that's not important. I know this movie isn't and can't be as good as the book, it was still really well done and showed how bad things have gotten and the whole movie seems dark and different than all the others, even the 4th and 5th ones, where things really start to get dark. They'll have to include a lot in these last two movies, but i think the sixth movie was well done and made a good ground for the movies to come.I will definitely be buying this on DVD when it comes out.

512,stijntje44,I now know the feeling op disappointment.,8,24 July 2009,"I've been waiting for this movie for a long time since book #6 is my favorite of the series...Never have I been more angry or disappointed after watching a movie. I feel like Kyle (southpark) did after Indiana Jones came out. I feel like the HP series just got raped.In some miraculous way Yates succeeded in leaving out every single great scene from the book. And the ones he did put in the movie were less than shadows of how they were written. Thinks that wouldn't even take up more time were changed and ruined. I had heard the Gaunts had been taken out of the movies and I wondered how you could ever justify such a change but it was just the tip of iceberg wasn't it? You managed to make every scene lose its power and make a mockery out of the characters and the story and the logic.Harry Potter movies are supposed to be like riddles, you get subtle hints and in the end everything is supposed to come together but there was nothing like that here, you just threw it all out into the open. I can't even begin to name al the mistakes you made since my mind is trying to suppress the memories but I'll try to write some down all the same.1: First scene, totally unnecessary, the way it was written in the book could have easily been shortened to the needed length but you made an entirely new, useless scene. Why not just a quick scene at the Dursley house?2: Getting Slughorn, the entire reason Slughorn came back was left out, they could have added 3 more lines about how everyone could find slughorn when he was on the move but no, who needs a decent motive? If bringing Harry along was enough, then why go to the loo at all?3: Fixing the room, why not a short shot of the wizards back to back like in the book, would have been nice to see that at least 1 thing of the book came back in the movies and it wouldn't have taken more time.4: Horace Slughorn is supposed to be smaller than Dumbledore, and have a beard, and he was head of slytherin house, not some teacher. Why change this, didn't save time and now we have him saying that certain students weren't his students...which was ridiculous, one line about head of slytherin house could have fixed this.5: Why wasn't the Weasley house protected? and why was the house attacked at all? Useless, illogical scene, they could've used that time for more important matters, matters that were actually IN THE BOOK.6: Ginny's kiss, I will murder you for this one day Yates. That was supposed to be passionate in the heat of the moment, not some slutty move while she was still with Dean. That scene and all the scenes surrounding it were utter crap.7: no explanation to who Gave Katie the necklace and how Slughorn came by the mead, that was part of the riddle that you were supposed to solve but your lame ass movie didn't have any of that did it?9: Dumbledore's torture scene, weak weak weak, didn't have a bit of emotion in it, and missed the point entirely of what he was reliving.10: Dumbledore's death, changed for no reason, doesn't make sense, acted out badly.11: The worst one...You left out the battle in Hogwarts? Are you insane you little prick. The movie didn't even have an ending. Well I guess since you screwed everything up that lead to that part you might as well go for broke. Seriously, did you even watch the movie?I see this as one of the worst experiences of my life together with my favorite uncle dying and my first love leaving me. I don't know which of the three is worst.I want my money back since I paid to see the movie adaptation of the halfblood prince, not some random movie that has characters with the same name.2/10 for pretty effects, which is all this movie wasI hate you more than Hitler.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
513,fishstep,Note quite a 10 .... SPOILERS,7,15 July 2009,"Other folks have made many comments already with which I agree, so I would like to restrict myself here to a few things that really bothered me, and kept me from giving this film a higher score. When the bridge collapse was shown there were people running on the bridge, kinda towards the camera, in a close shot. Next long shot, as the bridge twists and falls into the Thames - no little CG people can be seen. Where did all they go? Not to nit-pick, but an otherwise spectacular sequence was spoiled by this oversight, as I was jolted from the magic of the film. Think of it - you are watching Titanic sink and in one shot suddenly the decks are devoid of screaming, sliding-to-their-death victims. WTF? This had the same effect. My teen noticed it too and commented on the lack of victims after the film, so I know it is not my tired old eyes deceiving me.Harry being told by McGonagall that Slughorn will take students with only an E in Newt-level Potions. Then was it my imagination or was that (supposedly stupid) Crabbe and Goyle in Potions??? Along with half the Gryffindor class? The Burrow under attack - what the ??? Deatheaters show up just to partake of a bit of arson? No murders? After Bellatrix taunts Harry out into the field, why did she not summon the big V? Not to mention (ok, I am mentioning it) the protections supposedly around the Burrow. Hope the Weasleys have good Magical Insurance to rebuilt before the next film!!! Harry not petrified by Dumbledore and instead just standing there like a ninny during Dumbledore's death scene.Another , to me, jarring note - Snape TELLING Harry at the end that he is the H.B.P. I understand how a book has to be altered to make a film (thank you Howard Suber for all those classes at UCLA on just that topic back in the '80s) but this seemed pure lazy writing, a cop-out.On the other hand - kudos to the ""kids"" (hardly feel I can still refer to them as such) for great performances. Grint is developing into a fine comedian, Watson was truly touching as lovelorn Hermione, and Radcliffe has come a long way from the squeaky ""frog"" (his word, not mine) of the first films. His Harry high on the lucky potion was a crack-up! Wish there had been time to use Neville as more than a waiter - didn't mind Luna being substituted for Tonks in the train scene as any excuse to use Luna is fine with me.Now, you lot, hurry up and make those next two films!!!!",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
514,Dr_Lector,Captures the Spirit of Rowling's Original Novel,8,18 July 2009,"Let me preface my remarks by saying I am an avid fan of the Potter books, and my review cannot help but be from this perspective. David Yates latest film installment is perhaps the most significantly different film adaptation, yet it retains the spirit and characters of Rowling's beloved novel. For the first time in a Potter film I found myself feeling the same roller coaster emotions that were produced upon reading the novel. The film captured moments of laughter, angst, fear, jealousy, conflict, and despair. Although in many places the details deviate from the novel, it is the spirit of Harry and his friends that remains the same. I can only imagine that the plot and the characters may be very hard to decipherer to movie goers not already familiar with the series. Fans of the books will immediately notice many plot details missing (some of which are key to propelling the final installment). I can only guess that the movie producers will use the 5+ hours of the final films first and second part to explain or set up some of the missing bit. Indeed the entire film seems to serve as a set up for the series conclusion. But if the fans of the books can get past these points they will find that the essential story of Half-Blood Prince is told, and it is told quite well. But almost as important as the story is the characters and the relationships between the characters that are portrayed here. In this film I feel we are truly able to see the intimate friendships and relationships that are truly the spirit of the series. We see the loving interaction of Harry, Ron, and Hermionie, the growing mutual affection and respect between Harry and Dumbledore, as well as the budding romances. The typically superb ensemble cast ensures that in no way are Rowling's characters betrayed. Radcliffe, Watson, and Grint are at their best. Radcliffe and Grint both show some displays of wonderful comedic timing, which has not been seen before in the series. Jessie Cave provided for some very funny moments as Ron's snog obsessed girlfriend Lavender Brown. Both Bonnie Wright as Ginny and Tom Felton as Draco take advantage of more screen time and are clearly at their best. Wright has developed a subtle way of demonstrating the combination of confidence and tenderness that Harry needs, while Felton does a wonderful job showing Draco's inner conflict. Of the adult actors Gambon shines brightest and has at last delivered a performance worthy of Dumbledore. In this film he is able to display the quirkiness and the power of the character, although he does not emanate the calm and controlled majesty that Richard Harris' Dumbledore evoked. Another bright spot is the addition of the wonderful Jim Broadbent as the power hungry Horace Slughorn to whom social status and creature comforts are of the utmost importance, but harbors a dark secret that only Harry can persuade him to reveal. Broadbent and Radcliffe seem to have a particularly good on screen report in their shared scenes, which typically of this film shift abruptly from silly humor to deadly seriousness. Coltrane as Hagrid and Dame Maggie Smith as McGonagal as ever appear as if they were born to play these roles, and were excellent in the little screen time they had in this film. The most disappointing performance was the usually unshakable Alan Rickman as Snape. I came into this film expecting coolness with a depth and conflict from Rickman, and I'm sorry to say that the coolness and confidence were not there in places where they needed to be, instead it seems very obvious to the viewer that the character has hidden motivations. And when called 'coward' what should be for his character the ultimate insult, he seems to take it too mildly. This cast and this film truly provide some wonderful comedy. These moments grow to be more than mere 'comic relief' and become the very heart of the film. They show the heart of the character relationships, which in turn show everything that is worth saving and worth fighting evil to maintain.Yates direction is absolutely stunning. From the opening title sequence all the way through to the climatic cave scene this film provides the most stunning visuals, making use of quick cuts and hand-held camera shots whenever appropriate. The movie also contains some wonderful wide angle shots which seem to scream BLU-RAY! Production design and set design (save for a cave which bizarrely looks more like Superman's fortress of solitude) are also superb. After 4 Directors in this series Harry Potter has at last found the man capable of delivering the epic scope needed for the series conclusion. To me the films biggest shortcoming is that in certain places the intensity needed was a few degrees short, indeed it sometimes felt as though emotions were kept at bay just below the surface when they should have been in full force. A quiet kiss should have been a full out cathartic snog. A low and desperate mutter of 'Kill me' should have been a wailing scream. And when called 'coward' Snape (and Rickman) really needed to lose his famed cool in a violent fit of rage. Despite these failings Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince was a highly enjoyable film, and perhaps the best of the series so far. Even with several plot deviations and omissions it retains the intangible spirit of the original novel.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince

We all waited SO long for this installment to come out only to be completely crushed by the end result.If you are a fan of the books, then don't see the film. They totally butchered it. Just do like me and read the books all over again. The images you form in your mind are so much better than the nonsense up on the screen this time.The only redeeming feature of the film are the actresses who play Hermoine and Ginny. They're both seriously hot!Apart from that though, everything was dreadful. Hated it from start to finish.

I didn't read the books, so my judgment is based only on a movie with a plot, characters. This movie has nothing with the fact that it is too long for nothing. I kept on straggling just to understand what is going on, which was nothing. For more than an hour and a half, no major progress in the plot, it was only a love story which didn't seems to fit in. You cannot sense the emotions and the whole part was some silly jokes just to make sure that you don't fall asleep. I was amazed to see the number of people leaving the theater. Eventually, it was my part to leave because I felt I am wasting my time because economical report on CNN seemed to be more entertaining!!! I didn't witness the ending, and after reviewing some other comments, I believe it was a correct decision.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince

Yeah like many says HARRY POTTER AND THE HALF BLOOD PRINCE is the best book in potter series. We read it, imagined it, cried,laughed, got thrilled n etc. But this could be great adaption turned into a joke. Yeah a joke. The genre of this movie should be a ROMANTIC COMEDY because it hardly focused on the soul of the book. Apart of burning the burrow to create a fake ectasy, they would have been focusing on at least adding a single 2-3 minute memory of Voldemort's but sorry potter fans, they wouldn't.. Coz they was trying to create a ROMANTIC COMEDY..I am disappointed coz last five movies was promising and used to leave us in questions for the next one but this movie even couldn't handle that.No Dumbledore funeral, i wonder how they will gonna use this facts in deathly hallows.No explanations for horcruxes.. HOW DUMBLEDORE PUT HIS HANDS ON THEM? WHAT KIND OF OBJECTS WAS THE KEEN INTEREST OF TOM RIDDLE? NO KILLING SEQUENCE OF THE RIDDLE FAMILY?? Mind me this could be the best and disturbing sequence of the movie where we could actually see a menace.NO HUFFLEPUFF CUP? NO DOBBY? NO BILL AND FLEUR? NO DISCUSSIONS OF SERIUS BLACKS'S WILL?

518,timebarrier,Teen Crushes vs the Darkest Magic,7,16 July 2009,"Its been a long wait for this film especially after the postponement of its release date from November 21,2008 to July 15,2009. One thing that the postponement was successful in accomplishing was increasing the excitement and the expectations for the movie. And I could never afford to miss the premiere show of HBP in India. All the previews had been indicating a darker side and a hormonal rush at the center stage of the film. Although I did welcome the darker side, but didn't like the sound of hormonal rush so much. And sure enough, you would notice that the movie at multiple places, looks more like a teen romantic comedy with crushes and love triangles and silly irritating girls pouncing all around the Hogwarts castle. As for the darker side, I do appreciate the feel of the movie in that regard. Draco did emerge as the main villain in the movie with Snape not lagging far behind. But Voldemort was absent from the film. Though Bellatrix was brilliant but Fenrir Greyback did not get a chance to show his mettle as a werewolf. The movie starts off very well with the screenplay juggling between dark scenes and light anecdotes and the scent of love staling in the air even with the dementors around. But as the movie progresses, the familiar Harry Potter touch is lost with barely one classroom scene throughout the movie and it being difficult to decide whether the movie is revolving around good versus bad or the infatuations or lack thereof among the characters. In spite the fact that every inhabitant of the castle is a wizard or a witch (or a squib), there is definitely a deficiency of (good quality) magic, if I may. But I must admit that the film made use of its last opportunity of showcasing Quidditch quite extraordinarily and the few Quidditch scenes are simply brilliant. Another exciting scene was the one with the Inferi and it was very successful in hooking the audience to their seats. Though I fail to reconcile with a specific scene where the Burrow is burnt down and can't seem to find its importance in the movie. Again, the film forgot to lay appropriate emphasis on the should-have-been central aspects of the film like Lord Voldemort's past and the Horcruxes. Strangely, the Horcruxes appear almost at the end of the film and no detailed discussions are depicted on the topic, considering their importance. One huge disappointment was the absence of the Hogwarts castle fight at the end. I strongly feel that if they had included that amazing fight with all the special effects that they are capable of, instead of some of the romantic scenes, it would have made the film extremely fun and exciting to watch. Just to wrap up with some mention of the characters in the film - Harry clearly got a lot mature and had a very good eye for beautiful girls! Ron still doesn't know that Harry did not add any Felix in his cup before the match and it was he all along who made those excellent blocks in Quidditch. Both Ron and Harry got their hands full with girls. Hermione was not the most brilliant student anymore, at least in Potions (the only class that the trio attended in the film) and she herself had a lot of admirers, though not the one she desired. Ginny did not get a chance to show her magical skills but did get to kiss Harry near the end after many futile attempts throughout the film. Lavendar was shown a silly ""dumbo"" who's overly passionate about her boyfriend Ron and did not really play any other part except at snogging him. Luna was brilliant with her eccentricities, as always. Dumbledore directed Harry throughout the film and the film did justice to his role. Fred and George got a small share, in their own shop - the Weasley's Wizard Wheezes - which has been created vividly with lots of details.Before I close, I must admit that I was a bit skeptical of the film considering how high my expectations were. At the end, I would just say that in spite of all the shortcomings, it is still a brilliant Harry Potter film and definitely worth visiting your nearest multiplex and I would not miss a chance to watch it again.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
519,samudra-dasgupta,Disappointing,5,18 July 2009,"It is possible that being the 6th movie in the series it is unreasonable to expect a lasting impression. But I think the movie has been very sloppily made - the dialogs poorly written, the narration badly organized, the ending too abrupt (even though I concede it has to follow the book). While i did not get bored (the game of 'quidditch' alone as usual makes it worth watching), I felt the movie left a lot to be desired. I have not read the book but the plot seems very weak. I hope the last part is being made with more care and less hurry. Given people's expectations and the sure money earner that it is, why cant the movie director be more thoughtful in his presentation and not give it a 'commoditized' feel.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
520,ecimir,Not better then the last one,3,22 July 2009,"This movie is weak. I heard rumors that it is great, but I was disappointed when I saw it. Again, much of the story has been cut off, like some parts vitally important for the sequel. Voldemort's flashbacks which are the most interesting thing in the book has been seriously reduced. We didn't find out nothing about Voldemort's family and very little about his personality. Snape, who is very important character in this sequel was to little used and some of them like Moody and Scrimgeour were not used at all. Action scene at the end has been cut off and Dumbledore's end badly changed. Harry's relationship with Ginny is not long enough developed and badly presented. Young Riddle is acted badly, Alan Rickman casting Snape is to old, Ginny is not pretty at all ,as well as Lawender Brown. I don't know why Harry Potter movies can't be longer, at least 3 hours long, most of people wouldn't have problem with that. At least they should put extra part on DVD.Fans will not be satisfied again. Maybe amused for a while, but not satisfied.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince

But when i watched the movie First day first show. I was far more satisfied by it. The series has come a long way from only fantasy movies to the movies which contains emotions, drama, tragedy, romance & comedy also. This movie as according to many people is considered the best in the series(including me also) & worst by some. But i want to ask those people who considered it worst? That they are screaming hard that many points have been removed in the film. The reason is simple & straight that the movie is not only created for us fans but also general people who want some entertainment. If whole of the book was copied from scratch the i will be afraid to say that the movie may not have done that well as it is doing now. I agree that i also was baffled by the end but the same time my eyes turned moist. So i request first & foremost to all Harry Potter fans that please support this movie to the fullest and give it high ratings. Because it was worth it.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
522,cissycatwoman,"Wonderful sizzling darkness, but too much teen romance.",8,19 July 2009,"I went to see HP and the Half-Blood Prince on Friday night. I did enjoy it, seeing it in a crowded cinema, with many teens and kids in eager attendance. I think it's the best movie in the series so far, and the director David Yates is certainly a competent man. The start of the movie is spellbinding as dementors ride through the West End and whoosh over the Millennium Bridge. It's simply exhilarating. Also, later, there are some fantastic, dark scenes, all of which Helena Bonham Carter as the evil Bellatrix Lestrange steals. She's like a black cat, hissing and dancing away, an electrifying performance. To see her hiding and leaping in the cornfield, and destroying the venerable dining hall are cinematic moments to treasure and remember. Alan Rickman as Snape is also better than ever, expressing so much just via the pauses in his speech, and slight altering of tempo.But, some parts of the movie are just too slow, and too boring for a thirty-something viewer such as myself. I could hear the teens in the audience giggle and sigh as the various teen romances advanced and faltered, and I know much of the book's about the youngsters' budding romances, but sheesh, it just goes on and on! Less would have been more. The movie's also much too long, so I'd say less smooching, and more action, or even dark brooding. Sometimes it seemed to me as if I was watching two different films: one gorgeous, dark and thoughtful, and the other like the British public school version of Dawson's bloody Creek! Anyhow, the young actors all do reasonably well, and Dan Radcliffe as Potter finally shows his immense talent when under the influence of Felix Felicis. Suddenly he becomes relaxed, expressive, funny and interesting. They should definitely keep Radcliffe on the stuff for the rest of the franchise. Rupert Grint's Ron kisses throughout the film and is at his comical best, while Emma Watson's Hermione is competent, but not really any different from what she offered us in the previous films. She's cute the way a little hamster's cute, and sad when cheese (Ron)'s snagged away.However, Tom Felton's Draco's starts delivering better than before, and he does very well, bringing complexity to a role that before this was simply one of a nasty, upperclass school bully. His mother Cissy (one of my favorite actresses Helen McCrory) is wonderful in the few scenes she's given, expressing his worry and love for his son who has a dark mission. Also, the kid who plays Tom Riddle as a child is truly eerie and perfect for the part -- no wonder, as he's Ralph Fiennes' nephew Hero Fiennes-Tiffin (and that's a Potterish name if any!) All in all, the film's enjoyable, but mainly in the moments with the dark forces at play -- Narcissa, Bellatrix, and Snape. But it's overly long and with way too much teen romance at Snogwarts to be truly effective or exhilarating. Still, I'm hoping the last movie, cut in two parts, will be more concise and with some more of that delightful, sizzling darkness.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
523,u992491,By far the best book; by far the worst movie,1,16 July 2009,"I've been looking forward to this movie since 2005. The novel is characterised by a darker, more mature mood - fitting considering it's the penultimate book in the series; Rowling does a good job setting the scene for the final battle. This was also the very first book I read the series - and got me reading the others.While I'm not a massive fan of the movie franchise, the earlier films have been roughly true to the books. But the Half Blood Prince isn't even a HP adaption. I don't know what it is - other than crap.Key scenes are scrapped. Dialogue is lazy and stilted. Characters have changed their personalities, and non-existent scenes are added that don't even add to the story.Everything about it looks bored and tired. Only Draco remains truthful.I hate this film. The 1/10 rating is over the top; it deserves negative.Won't be watching the last two films. No longer see the point.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
524,nhtothehoop,"It wasn't bad, but it wasn't good.",5,17 August 2009,"I liked the book, and in fact, the book was not meant to be a movie. This one was more of a talking book that had plot. This adaptation left me looking at the floor. During the middle of it, i found a piece of popcorn more interesting. But it got better as it went on. The acting was phenomenal. Michael Gambon gave the performance of his life. The only character I dding'tbelieve was ginny. This was a good movie if you hadn't read the book, and it would've been good if it dding't have a middle. somewhat disappointing, but somewhat pleasant.

525,ephoratus,Almost Perfect,9,26 December 2010,"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince is in my opinion the best movie of the series so far (yes, I think it's better than Deathly Hallows; Part 1). And yet I was very disappointed when first watching it. Basicaly I missed just two things: A – there could show more Harry's brilliance at potions classes (although the one scene that did show it was really good) and B – the memories regarding Tom Riddle; the one at the Gaunts, the one at Hepzibah Smith and the one with Voldemort and his uncle Morfin. I feel those memories are crucial to the story (ironicaly Dumbledore said something very similar) and would also be really interesting. This is in fact the one thing that's keeping this movie from being the best one of the series. I was hoping they included those scenes in the Extended Edition and I was disappointed again when I realized they didn't. I find it perfectly logical that not all scenes from the book can be in the movie. Those of you who are making lists of what was in the book but wasn't in the movie are a little bit, forgive me, ignorant. It's quite obvious that not ALL scenes can be in the movie. In fact of course lots of them can't and won't be. Where you do get confused is when they make scenes that not only weren't in the book but are completely irrelevant to the story. Nevertheless this movie NEEDS to be watched. 9 out of 10.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
526,dlevin9416,Bo-ring,2,22 December 2009,"My favorite review about this movie: ""It's boring, nothing happens, and Dumbledore dies in the end."" Pretty much wraps it up.I never got into the books (though after seeing this movie I almost want to), but man, even I knew they were cutting stuff out of this one. The massive jumps in time and plot and logic were just so random it was clear that huge sections of the book must've been whacked for it. This would have been fine, IF SOMETHING HAPPENED ONCE IN A WHILE! We were subjected to yet ANOTHER quidditch segment, which we've seen IN EVERY MOVIE SO FAR. WE GET IT - IT'S THE SPORT WIZARDS PLAY.We get some action in the beginning (with no logic behind is), and then are left to more or less nothing until the end, where even less makes sense. Why is Snape being the Half-Blood prince mean anything, other than HP has a cheat-sheet for potions? Why does he even tell him, since HP has done virtually no searching of the character in the entire movie? My last criticism is of the series as a whole, not just the books: OK, so Voldemort is the embodiment of evil. I get it. He wants to rule the world maybe? I'm not quite sure what his motivation is. I do know that we don't even see him in this movie, despite seeing him fight Dumbledore in the last one, but I digress.It's established that the Wizard world has a governmental structure, what with leaders, governments, and prisons for that matter. The system is huge, given there's a ""Quidditch World Cup"" and the Tri-Wizards tournament had schools from Romania and Sweden.And yet, despite all that largess, does the Magic-using world rely on the skills of an ancient school principal to fight against the ""Dark Lord"". Are you kidding me? This is like letting the Dean of Sciences at NYU lead a vigilante group against John Gotti. Where's the police force? Where's the military or something to that effect? Where's - you know - ANYONE ELSE? Further, OK, so Tom Riddle was looking at magic in the library in the Restricted section. WHY WAS HE LOOKING AT STUFF IN THE RESTRICTED SECTION? IT'S RESTRICTED? YET THE PROFESSOR HE WAS TALKING TO HAD NO ISSUE WITH THIS? Jesus Christ, the entire magic community is made up of a bunch of bumbling retards, no wonder Voldemort is able to corrupt so many and do so much damage.Ugh. Crap movie, crap series.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
527,sgolz,The 6th Installment really splits HP fans down the middle...,6,17 July 2009,"Harry potter fans around the world really fall into 2 camps. Those who grew up reading the books then watching the movies; and those who opt just to watch the movies never reading the books. Never before has a Harry Potter film divided these two camps, as is evident from the reviews, so dramatically. If you are a book fan you will be left ultimately disappointed at the lack of loyalty to JK Rowling's original story - especially at the end scenes. However if you are a film fan and have no prior knowledge to the story then I think you will be perfectly content.This film under the directorship of David Yates (who also directed 'Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix') looks and feels the most polished of the series to date. Yates has done an admirable job bringing to the big screen what is regarded as the most boring of the books from the series. The main plot focuses on the raging teenage hormones amongst our central characters and, under Yates, sees Daniel Radcliffe and Emma Watson put out arguably their best performance to date. Rupert Grint is as always entirely patchable. This year we have the addition of Jim Broadbent who succeeds in bringing interest and feeling to one of JK's most under developed characters. The film feels unrushed cohesive and the visuals are astounding. The Hogwarts shots are inspired and a new musical score does the trick nicely.Where the film fails to deliver most notably is in the lack of on screen time for the series peripheral characters which considering their formidable acting skills boggles the mind. We have seen careful character building for the last 5 films only to see a sixth film that all but abandons them. Bit parts for Hagrid, Snape, Neville, McGonagal, Sprout, The Weasleys, Lupin, Tonks, Fenrir, Bellatrix and omission entirely for Bill Weasley, Fleur, Kreacher, Dobby, Sheamus, Moody, Fudge and Scringmour. The real villain of this movie (scriptwriter Kloves) seems to want the audience to somehow know intuitively that Tonks and Lupin have finally hooked up. Also we are apparently meant to accept that Fenrir Greyback is a trusted deatheater now without any back story concerning his werewolf lineage. By the distinct lack of cohesiveness of our heroes – The Order of the Phoenix, the Faculty and the DA and in fact any resistance thereof against Voldemorts attacks throughout the film we are left feeling the good guys have no real power.The real controversy of this movie though is in the re-writing of the story from JK's original, especially the end scene. What has been a thoughtful and slow paced but atmospheric movie drawing good acting from all central characters inexplicably breaks down into an ending that comes across as though actors and director alike just didn't care about those last 30 minutes. What should have been the climax of a slow burn movie is ruined by inexplicable story lines, character assassinations (What Harry is made to do at the end results in him looking cowardly) and a dismal lapse in Radcliffes acting ability at the most essential point - essentially proving once again although he is comfortable with light hearted comedic moments he lacks the depth of ability required to bring real emotions of loss and love to his character.It is a crying shame to end an otherwise engaging and entertaining film with such a poor ending - however as Yates is signed on to do The Deathly Hallows in two parts lets hope he can learn from these mistakes.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
528,hellosunshine,By far one of the worst!!!,1,23 July 2009,"I am a huge fan of the books and I found myself thinking ""what the hell is going on?"" throughout 90% of the film. The worst book to film adaption ever!!!!!!!! Yates and Kloves should be fired and J.K Rowling needs to take more of a hand in the creative choices because these films lately have been lacking. I hated OOTP and I've also not liked GOF but this was a complete and total wreck. I will not waste my precious time and money to see garbage. In todays economy you cannot depend on media hype and good teasers/trailers making a film come off as good by choosing the high points and then showing a complete crap in it's completion.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
529,Semaj3,A Great Book Deserves a (Much) Better Movie,1,28 August 2009,"In Steve Martin's ""Bowfinger,"" we see him looking at index cards thumb tacked to his bulletin board, the traditional way screenwriters note and arrange and rearrange the scenes of the movie they are writing. The trouble with most novels is that they have many more scenes and parts of scenes than can be included in a 2-hour (or even longer) movie, so scenes and story points have to be omitted. The trick is to capture as much of the story and the essence of the novel as you can while still making an interesting and even magical movie.For all of the Harry Potter movies but the first two, I have felt that the directors/writers have done a less than adequate job of the difficult task at hand. While every scene on the screen at any time may be well done, when the whole is assembled together, the results have been far less successful than they should have been in order to do justice to the marvelous books.""Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"" rivals the third movie (""...Azkaban"") for the dishonor of possibly being the worst of the Potter movies. The other reviewers on IMDb have done an excellent job of detailing the many, many important scenes that should have been in the movie but are not. Chief among these surely is the huge battle in Hogwarts that is the emotional climax to the novel, followed by Dumbledore's funeral--I still expected Dumbledore to come back to life somewhere in the final book! The movie seems to have been created this way: take the index cards with the scenes and story points that are in the book--which would come to, say, 300 to 1000 cards. Number them chronologically as found in the book. Shuffle them like a deck of cards and deal out the first 30. Rearrange them back into chronological order, and shoot your movie. The problem is, this method ignores what is most important! It's just scenes without real plot, without real tension, without real emotion. Yes things have to be left out of a book when making a movie, but not the essential story line. And the viewer had to supply that for himself and herself, because the director of this movie failed to do so.I am so glad for Jim Dale and the audio CD versions of the books.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
530,The_Crys,"In one word, mediocre (minor spoilers).",6,5 September 2009,"This installment of the series felt very similar to the fourth part, ""Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire""; plot was sacrificed on the altar of light entertainment.The problem with all book adaptations is that unless the book is very short, there will be many elements missing from the film, and that's perfectly understandable. A screenwriter and director's job is to be able to overcome this issue by keeping a balance between plot, characterization and anything else that defines the book in question.""Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince"" fails to meet this goal, which is a shame seeing as this book is far less complex than its counterparts. The story is straightforward, with very few important subplots, so I would have imagined that translating it into a film would have been easy. What's even more baffling is that although in previous films any chance for some action was milked to the last drop, in this film a very important fight scene is missing entirely, only to be replaced by another, which doesn't even appear in the books. Very odd and unnecessary change.THE BAD: Only two memories of Voldemort's past were shown, which begs the question as to how Harry will have any knowledge of what to go after in the next film. Steve Cloves (the screenwriter) is back, so fans of canon Ron can kiss the lovely ""Order of the Phoenix"" characterization goodbye; Ron is once again in comic relief mode. Even the titular storyline, that of the Half Blood Prince, is so underplayed that when we do find out the identity of the mysterious person in the film's climax, it doesn't leave much of an impression.THE GOOD: Excluding all the above (which is no easy feat seeing as they're pretty important), the film is very enjoyable. I loved Slughorn's depiction and nearly every scene involving him was executed very well (the Felix Felices scene in particular was a delight). The romantic scenes were, at times, highly entertaining, but overly abundant. The scene where Harry and Dumbledore discuss Horcruxes includes a very nice touch which is both a wink to the previous movie and foreshadowing for what's coming next; you'll know what I mean when you see it.In conclusion, the film had some good moments, but it ultimately fails to deliver the important aspects of the book. It's very hard to satisfy fans, but I'd like to think I'm not asking for too much when I say: Less fanservice, more plot, please.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
531,Prince09,One of the better Potters!,9,24 July 2009,"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince is a good film, but suffers from the problem the other Potters have: it just can't strike the same chord as the books, especially the conclusion which, while thematically faithful to the book, didn't feel as emotional on the screen.The plusses first: The huge plus is that, it runs far more smoothly through its runtime of about 150 minutes, and the choppy feel of the last two movies is gone. (It doesn't feel that long as well) .. The romance, done well, acts as a good offset to the other dark threads of the movie. The balance of the romance and other threads will be debated: but I think they got it nearly right. May be a little more of those creepy memories, but nearly there.The acting from the central trio is solid and adequate, but two huge improvements from the older movies are Tom Felton's Draco Malfoy and Michael Gambon's Albus Dumbledore - I guess it has to do with the more meaningful role accorded by the screenplay. Potter debutant Jim Broadbent does a great job as Horace Slughorn, while Alan Rickman steals all the scenes he is in. Seriously, these movies can do with a lot more Snape-time! The Prisoner of Azkaban is still the most stylish and best-adapted movie of the lot to me, but this movie feels in that zone too .. Having read the book, its very hard to enjoy the movie on its own terms - I know that they have cut out a whole lot of information regarding Voldemort and his horcruxes, and am looking forward to see how those crucial pieces of info shape up on the screen in the next movies ..",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
532,x_mahyar_x,Harry Potter and the Missing Plot,6,17 July 2009,"Okay I'll try not to be too harsh because I did enjoy the movie. I enjoyed it because it was entertaining, funny and not boring. And I liked the special effects and the acting was also good. Now here's the problem. The whole film was done brilliantly except for the most important parts.It seems like David Yates forgot what the title of the Book/Movie was. Whatever happened to the Half-Blood Prince? It played almost no significant role in the movie. My brother had not read the book, and towards the end when he found out Snape was the HBP, he just went: ""So?!"" It's like, nobody actually cared about the HBP. Another important part: Dumbledore's death. There was absolutely no emotional build-up to that. And straight after when harry ran after Snape, that was such an anti-climax. The other very important part: Harry and Ginny's kiss scene. Absolutely terrible. The camera angle was ridiculous. The actual kiss had no emotional essence. Luckily Hooper's music saved the scene from becoming one of the worst kiss scenes in Hollywood. And there was some other key parts missing from the plot. Such as lots of Voldemort's past scenes, the fight at Hogwarts, etc. Okay I said I won't be too harsh. Overall, if you haven't read the book, the film was okay. Most of it was well made and brilliant acting by Michael Gambon (Dumbledore), Alan Rickman (Snape), Helena Bonham Carter (Bellatrix), Jim Broadbent (Slughorn) and I also quite liked Rupert Grint's (Ron) acting.It was entertaining and sometimes funny. I enjoyed it. But I was still annoyed!",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
533,minamizaki,"Best HP movie yet, almost",9,23 July 2009,"I really liked it. I don't understand why people keep moaning about how it's different from the book, if you want all your favourite parts from the book, just read the book. About the exclusion of back stories, you do realise the back stories are recounted using the pensive, that means Harry is only a bystander, you wouldn't even see him in the scenes. If they put all the back stories in, you would get 30min of Voldy and his dear mummy, daddy, grandpa,and uncle, Snape, his folks and a young Lily. And it would means 30mins less of Harry and the trio. I don't think the non-readers audience are OK with that, I believe they'd rather have 30mins of RomCom of the trio. From a commercial point of view, I think they've made the right decision.I'm giving it a 9, it's on par with the prisoner of Azkanban. POA has better transition and better story arch. But HPB is more difficult to adapt, I think David Yates has done a great job. Plus: huge improvement from the trio in terms of acting, having said that, if you have played the same role in 6 movies, I think it's really time to get into character....VERY impressed with Tom Felton, it's a very difficult part, he doesn't have a lot screen time or dialogue, nonetheless he makes every scene counts, especially the last scene, his performance was intense, yet controlled. The young actor who plays 15 year old voldy was amazing, charismatic and chilling at the same time. Jim Broadbent's Slughorn was a bit different from the book, he's more likable and seems totally harmless, I like it. the fish bowl addition was wonderfulQuidditch was excitingStop listing the things that didn't make it into the movie, I think people get the point.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
534,dieselboy1986,First time i've wanted to walk out of a cinema.,1,16 July 2009,"And I did.. for about 20 minutes. My bathroom break was far more entertaining. If it wasn't for my lady friend (she fell asleep) who wanted to watch it. I've not read the books. I don't want to. I watched the first movie, did nothing for me. And this? This? RUBBISH... someone has to say it... absolute rubbish. How can it make so much money, be so popular, have great actors & still be a pile of rubbish? There is nothing to help an outsider.. nothing to help you understand what's going on. I don't think there IS much going on. I just think it's rubbish... ""wands on high"" .. laughable.The only redeeming factor was a couple of attractive girls on screen.I was an hour in and I was just wishing, wishing for time to pass, it was 12:20 and I was begging for 2:30.. I thought I might enjoy it, quality production, special effects. Sorry, but its just plain rubbish, I don't understand it.Happy to be out of the cinema and not watching it.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
535,Hanneth,"Great beginning, disappointing execution on the ending",7,15 July 2009,"The film started out with what was brilliant with the essence and soul of the book... That is up until the bathroom scene where the soul was ripped from the movie very jarringly only leaving an empty shell of what could have been.From that point on things veer quite drastically from the book. Sure the main events are there, but no Order of the Phoenix and Dumbledore's Army trying to defend the castle, no time spent letting Harry have his moment of happiness. Unless you call a couple of fleeting seconds enough of a moment. In the book I had actually cheered for Harry.Was making Draco more of a sympathetic character really necessity? Tom Felton did an excellent job and I thought was playing the character well, just the writing, or editing, I thought was off.What probably should have left me feeling sad, left me feeling empty, like I'd been cheated.I still liked the movie and will probably see it again, especially with how well the first part was done, just it had the potential to be a great movie and it fell a little flat near the end.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
536,ZeroCorpse-1,All The Least Important Parts of the Book in Movie Form.,6,15 July 2009,"This film has possibly the worst ending of any HP film, and wandered the furthest from the books. If you are a fan of the books, this is for you: Remember that cool battle at Hogwart's at the end of the book? It's not here. None of it.Remember the important plot setup with the tiara? Not here.Remember all the background and memories about Tom Riddle? Not here.Remember Bill Weasley? Not here.Remember Bill getting wounded by a certain werewolf? Not here.Remember Fleur? Not here.Remember Snape's important parting words to Harry? Not here.Remember the funeral? Not here.Remember the touching conversation Harry had with Ginny at the end? Not here.Remember Scrimgeour? Not here.Remember the Burrow burning down? No? Oh, because that IS here.In short, this film is great if all you took out of the book was the romance and funny bits.

537,galadriel3562,Bloody Brilliant,8,13 July 2009,"I'm aware this is one of the most highly anticipated blockbuster movies of this summer and with those kind of expectations disappointment is almost inevitable. And yet the latest instalment of the HARRY POTTER genre manages to impress.There is a distinctly different tone to the story, compared to the previous movies, though there are still threads of humour the overall tone is sombre. This is reflected in both the decor, which is often nearly colourless or shaded in either grey or brown with wonderful highlights such as Malfoy's white hair. But also the make-up and wardrobe of the actors, sober outfits and pale, wrinkled faces. It provides the perfect build-up and background to the finale.There is one particular scene where Malfoy leaves the infirmary to invite the Death Eaters into Hogwarts where his black suit and white hair separate him beautifully from the other students in the corridor who are living their lives with no idea of the struggles that either Malfoy or Harry must face.Another feature that must be commended is the growth shown, both in character and actors. There are a few flaws, hiccups in story line that might provide the true fan with a moment of irritation but overall the story is fluently told and almost flawless executed. In short definitely worth the hype",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
538,shermanchee,"Might have fall short, but nonetheless enjoyable",7,18 July 2009,"I do think the love romance comedy in the middle could have been shortened to make room for more plot development of Tom Riddle and his death-eaters. That said, I really enjoy the cinematography. I think throughout the movie, especially at the end, the feeling of gloom, darkness and evil times is always there. I don't suppose this will appeal to the younger people who would have preferred more actions. Finally, the Half-Blood Prince is a long book after all. I think a lot of people are unhappy with the lost of content, but I think the director only has 2.5 half hours of screen time to make the movie, and have to decide if rushing the movie for more content is worth the sacrifice. For me, I think the movie's pace is just right. I enjoy the movie, much more that the previous blockbuster Transformer, and so i think it deserves a 7",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
539,jamesrobertfreeman,Great film but key plots from the book missing,8,17 July 2009,"Like all Harry Potter fans I have read all of the books and seen every film so far. I would have to say that this film is not my favourite so far and leaves you feeling that some vital parts of the book are missing. However this is worth watching and I feel this will only disappoint the most hardcore Harry fans! With all of the films you can notice that the acting is improving with the maturity of the characters. You can tell that there is a close bond between the actors of which all pull of their roles well. The directing and visual effects, like all of the films to date does not disappoint. In all a great family film, a pleasure to watch and I would recommend this film to most people. I am glad that the final film will be split into two parts, to be honest they could have done it with this film! *** For people who have never seen any of the films or read the books I took my friend with me who has not seen or read any of the books and he was completely lost throughout the film (Although he still enjoyed it!). If you wish to see this I would recommend you need to see Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix first. Otherwise you may find this film a little confusing.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
540,sergiogarza_834,fans will be disappointed,4,17 July 2009,"i am not a harry potter fan, but i really like the series, iv'e read every book and i find them pretty good. i have watched the other 5 movies too, and i always find something that i dislike, whether it is poor acting, bad casting or parts from the books that get chunked out. i had my expectations high for this one. i saw the trailer, and i thought ""oh, finally, a true harry potter film!""... i was terribly wrong.i bet that most of the users that rank it 8 or higher are people that have never read the books. in that case, fine, watching the movie from that perspective will get you a great experience, with excellent acting, special effects, and story. hmph..now, as a person that has read the book several times, you will get disappointed. lots of things were left out. where was that big battle at the end, order of the phoenix vs death eaters?? and, as you remember, key points happens there, like bill being bitten by greyback. they just killed dumbledore and left! what was the point, then, of bringing in the death eaters?? snape and malfoy could have done the work themselves and escape, nothing else! big, big, letdown. i heard that the entire fight scene was left out to bring in the part were the burrow is set on flames. that was never in the book!!!! what was the point of that? now, where will bill and fleur get married?? (btw, no bill, no fleur, no scrimgeour in this movie) i thought scrimgeour took a great role in the story, trying to recruit harry for the ministry, but then again, i guess they thought that wasn't needed. wrong choice. oh, by the way, really really bad ending. dumbledore is killed, and it practically ends there. no funeral. i think the funeral was the most important part of the book, an emotional blow, a sign that dumbledore is REALLY gone and that he won't come back. why? why did you do this, Yates and fellows?they screwed up, really. they made a movie just for non-readers of the book. and i can't believe Yates is directing the 2 parts of deathly hallows( i find it unnecessary to break it into 2 parts, but oh well), so let's say i'm not so excited about it. well, at least they have more screening time to fit it all in.go watch this movie anyway. in spite of all this, you may like it. but don't go with high expectations as i did, because you will be disappointed.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince

542,the-angry-cubist,Story is king. But not in this movie.,3,22 July 2009,"As has been said before, this is a really bad Harry Potter installment. Just viewers can throw away Star Wars-Episode I and not miss anything, this Harry Potter film does not have to be purchased and you will not miss anything.This is actually the first movie that I have ever been to where a person near me was actually SLEEPING through most of the movie. Yes, SLEEPING. And snoring. It became actually funny and it slowly sunk into my mind that this movie was a huge load of crap. If you have never read the book, you would be totally confused; If you HAVE read the book, you would not only be totally confused, but you would be really angry that all of the MAJOR PLOT POINTS of the book have been left out.This is a very important lesson for you aspiring filmmakers and screenwriters. Story is king. Story is king. Story is king. Let that stew in your brain before you ever write anything again. Now I don't want to totally eviscerate the screenwriter, Steve Kloves. He has been the screenwriter for most of the series and, so far, has done a pretty good job of converting huge novels into entertaining scripts, so the fault has to lie with the director, David Yates. HP:OOtP was his first HP movie and, at the time, was my worst one. I thought then that the book has been done a disservice. Now my fears are totally realized when this steaming heap of crap came out. It seems to me that David Yates took the screenplay, and said, ""I want to compete with all of the other teeny movies out there, so out go major plot points (teens don't go for all that plot and thinking stuff anyways) and in goes more moody swoon y teeny pablum. After all, I AM the director."" And there, dear aspiring filmmakers, is the when someone needs to take a good piece of hickory and break it across the front of your face, leaving a ""Louisville Slugger"" logo imprinted across your face. Because, YOU screwed up.Now that we have the same two teaming up again for the last movie, get out the Pepto.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince

I have been enthralled with HP movies before, and this movie started off beautifully - darker than ever, and the special effects were rendered very well. I was ready to watch the best ending ever. I was expecting an extraordinary war or battle. All I got was disappointment.Dumbledore's death meant nothing to anyone. The killers killed and just walked away. And the ending -- God -- that was not the ending, now, was it? All that they can talk about is how beautiful that place was, and how Harry can 'snog' Won's sister. Pathetic.

544,MovieMan66,Unbelievable schizoid con-job--Worse than a really bad Hindi movie!,1,19 July 2009,"This is nothing like any of the previous movies. The first 20 minutes of the movie gives you the whole plot outline. And this is without my having read the book or knowing the storyline. The 133 minutes remaining is unmitigated tripe. No need to see any more as the rest of the time is just a meandering tedious journey to the inevitable end. Reminiscent of juvenile play-practice or a really bad Hindi movie where the script is written on the sets just before shooting the scenes.The script seems to have been written in sections by totally different persons writing almost unconnected episodes and scenes. The only speculative entertainment in the movie was, trying to guess what were the mind-bending substances of choice fueling the bad trip schizophrenic screenplay.You could have walked out of this movie and not missed anything--except for the outstandingly powerful performance by Jim Broadbent as Horace Slughorn, professor of Potions. Sadly, his character's involvement is allowed to trail off towards the end of the movie and one wonders why. As for the rest--Wimpy characterizations, tedious dialogs, no surprises, no engaging twists, turns or drama, no drawing of the audience into the story, no fun. No magically interesting events. Occasional heavy handed juvenile jokes and farcical romantic comedy pass for humor. I see that although many commentators hate this movie, yet they have given it better than 4 or 5 stars--it only speaks to the positive emotional bond they have for the HP brand and does not reflect a true rating of this horror of a movie. A right sorry spectacle of self-conceit by Warner Brothers, treating the audience as a jackass who will swallow anything from brand Harry Potter. A shocking wreck of a once brilliant and intelligently developed concept.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
545,alikhanrider,The perfect Harry Potter movie to date,10,8 July 2009,"This is by far the best of the six. The acting is great, the CGI is just as good as Transformers, and there's much more to it. The film's also emotional, but nothing is overdone, everything is perfect. Michael Gambon as Dumbledore was one of the greatest things about the movie. The romance was very good, better movie than Twilight. The story and choreography and music is great. Quidditch is a very exciting scene in the movie, and is perfectly shown, 100x better than the previous movies. The frightening scenes are going to give you goosebumps also, and the memories shown are perfectly shown. Also the cave scene at the end is very well done.The ending will make you thirsty for a sequel. Definitely worth the money, and a definite blockbuster must-see. Go watch it.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
546,Azy_Zimmer,What book was this again?,5,31 August 2009,"You may find yourself wondering that very thing if you watch this movie and are a fan of the book series.I am a huge of both the Harry Potter books and movies. Like most fans, I'm attached to not only the characters but the story arc itself. I can only say that after watching this movie I felt...awkward. It didn't feel like Harry Potter and I found myself wondering what I was doing there. I enjoyed certain parts of this movie, to be sure. But there was so much missing that I hard time remembering which book this was based on. All the backstory that sets up the next book and the character development wasn't present.However, I could've ignored all that. It is hard to adapt such an in-depth book into a movie that people can sit through without needing sleeping bags and a port-a-potty. What has bothered me the most with all the movies, this one in particular, was how different the sets are in each movie. The Burrow looked nothing like it has in other movies, not to mention the fact that is was on fire in a story arc that I couldn't figure out the point of. Why does Bellatrix come to the Burrow to attack Harry? We don't need to know she hates him, it was established in the last movie. Setting that aside, she's a Death Eater, it's inherent that she hates Harry Potter. My biggest problem was Molly Weasley. By no stretch of the imagination could fans believe that she would be one to keep the kids from Hogwarts(which seems to change through each movie, even more so in this movie).All in all, it was a decent movie if you ignore the fact it was supposed to be a Harry Potter movie.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
547,Rommaik,Hogwart's Magic Lost,2,18 July 2009,"The magic that is Harry Potter and Hogwart's is completely missing from this movie. There is no suspense in watching it. One should never be watching a Harry Potter Movie thinking about their laundry. I did though. The actors did fabulous, but the story is completely flat. Most our your favorites will be lucky if they get a 15 second cameo. There is no climatic ending. I was actually grateful for the ending, it meant I got to go home finally! The movie is far too long for as little content as it has. I do not mind changing a novel to make it's leap to the big screen, but at least leave enough to remind of us of the original text. This movie kept the names and the places, but very little else. The magic is gone. Let us all hope they find it again before the last two come out.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
548,karenluvesfudge,Loved it! Definitely the best HP movie so far!,9,16 July 2009,"Personally, I absolutely LOVED this movie and it is definitely the one that follows the book story the most.However, I was still a little bit disappointed with a few things, like completely taking out the Apparation lessons and stuff (I know it's not really important to the story, but I think they would have been funny scenes) and how they didn't mention that it was Ron's birthday when he got poisoned. They probably did that so that they wouldn't need to bring in the Weasley family, but still. I would have liked for there to have been more time in Weasley's Wizard Wheezes as well. The burning of the Burrow was pretty much pointless. I mean, we got some action out of it, but there was absolutely no point to it. They should have spent those 5 minutes on some other important part of the story. And where was Neville during the movie? We saw him like all of two times! Come one now. And I honestly don't think that they did the Sectumsempra scene justice. Where's the blood and the gore? Draco's chest was supposed to be slashed open by the spell! How are they going to explain George's ear being sliced off in DH (if they bother to include it) and more importantly, why didn't Snape even say anything to Harry? Harry just like ran out and we didn't hear anything about it again. Which leads me to the Room of Requirement scene. Honestly, that scene was a little awkward. Why did Ginny have to take him there? I wish there had been a bit more passion in their kiss, it was more like a peck on the lips. And we didn't even get a flash of Ravenclaw's diadem, how is Harry supposed to figure out where the Horcrux is? *How* is Harry supposed to even figure out what the Horcruxes are? They didn't stress their importance enough in the movie, and Dumbledore made it sound like they were portkeys when he said they could be anything and anywhere. I'd like to see how they make up for that in DH. And the one thing that really bugged me was that when Dumbledore was about to be killed, he told Harry to wait downstairs, and Harry actually listened. Seriously, do you honestly think Harry would have listened and just stood by while he was killed? OK, that probably made it sound like I hated the movie, but I didn't. That aside, the movie was absolutely brilliant! The acting was damn awesome in this movie!Tom Felton was fantastic, as was Alan Rickman. I think this was Michael Gambon's best performance yet, at far as Harry Potter goes. He did a really great job, much better than when he started in the 3rd movie. The cave scene was pretty much perfect, it was so suspenseful! When that hand popped out of the water and just grabbed Harry it made me jump. (lol) I think that was one of the best scenes in the movie! They got Aragog's funeral right. That pincer thing Harry did when Slughorn was gonna get the poison was pretty funny. Haha. I think this also had like the most joking around and stuff. Ron did the poisoning scene perfectly. it was hilarious. And I loved Slughorn's party :D Overall, I'd give this movie a 9/10",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
549,pratikgreat,A Worthy adaptation and portrayal,9,16 July 2009,"With the last two installments the harry potter franchise has lived up to the ingenious storytelling genius of J.K.Rowling. The half blood prince has an added flavor of humor to it which was the only characteristic missing from Rowling's novels. A brilliant adaptation of the book adds some scenes and deletes some of them but still does justice to the plot. The effects are awesome and though the ending lacked in intensity compared to the order of phoenix, there isn't a dull moment in this 2 nd half hour long movie. Alan Rickman as Severus Snape easily steals the show with other actors portraying their characters with equal finesse. A Must watch for everyone. Highly recommended",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
550,d_girl,What the Bloody Hell,1,15 July 2009,"Just went and saw ""the half blood prince"" with my partner. I was disgusted with the movie, if id wanted to see some romantic bullcrap i would of watch twilight. I went to see Harry Potter you know magic, the dark lord all that, instead all i got was some pea brained directors half assed attempt at a movie with scenes not from the book added and import parts of the book completely ommitted. I've spent most of the night after the movie trying to explain the movie to my partner who didn't understand why it jumps about so much, why cast are doing certain things (which are previously explained in the book) and why a movie that was meant to be based off one of the best books of the series was so awful. As a loyal Potter fan i hope the final book lives up to the standard of previous movies. For final words id just like to say to David yates (aka the director) Im not angry with you David just very very Disappointed.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
551,ChadFeldheimer,Harry Potter meets 90210,7,14 July 2009,"Okay, so the first thing you should know is that the plot of this movie at once consists of no more than what was seen in the trailer AND will make no sense without a firm knowledge of the other books and/or films. The bulk of the picture is made up of Ginny Weasley making strong sexual advances on Mr. Potter, and Hermione Granger being pi$$ed off at Ron for some reason that only women seem to understand, making for one very long soap opera, with the occasional bit of magic. This seems to be the movie in the series where they take a break from advancing the plot in any meaningful way (with the exception of Dumbledore's well reported moment) and concentrate on the difficulties of being young and in love, and somehow it works. This may be my favourite HP pic thus far (although Fiennes' turn in 4 gives it a good run for it's money) and it is definitely the funniest, and it's only rarely unintentionally so. Props to Jim Broadbent for carrying on the long standing tradition of lending some emotional weight to the series, and almost making it seem as if the younger members of the cast can act. Almost. This movie is pure filler before things really get going. If you like HP you'll like this, if you don't you won't, simple as that.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
552,BJHunnicut,A beautiful and grand set up for the final journey,9,15 July 2009,"Definitely worth the two year wait. HBP wasn't my favorite of the Potter books but the translation to the screen was one of the best and most accurate in the series. The novel truly came to life. Though the novel and film aren't as action packed as OOTP, Harry Potter 6 features some of the best acting to date in the series despite having one of the weaker stories in the series which might confuse those not familiar with the novel.Michael Gambon, Jim Broadbent and Alan Rickman all deserve praise for their nuanced performances that really brought the characters from the novel to life. Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, and Emma Watson have come nearly full circle. This is the first film where I can actually say that the three young leads didn't look like they were acting. Their performance flows so naturally it's hard not to get caught up and concerned in the live's of JK Rowlings three heroes. Kloves screenplay despite some obvious cuts and rearranging is remarkably accurate to the novel. Some aspects are only briefly mentioned or quickly mentioned but for those familiar with the book, you shouldn't feel lost. For those who are unfamiliar, the story is still coherent enough to stand alone or to fit into the modified film continuity. Special praise goes to production designer Stuart Craig and director of photography Bruno Delbonnel for their stunning sets and shots respectively. Yes, Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince feels like and essentially is a grand set-up for the forthcoming Deathly Hallows, but that doesn't mean it isn't a fantastic film in it's own right. David Yates has found his groove in the series and the finale should be safe in his hands. Kloves is a welcome return from Goldenberg's severely abridged screenplay to Order of the Phoenix. Overall, despite a few pacing issues, Half-Blood Prince is a splendid summer blockbuster and one of the best, if not THE best entry into the Potter film series.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
553,jaw-5791,Sexist - Stereotypical - With a flawed narrative and cinematic lacking!,1,15 July 2009,"I have never used the phrase 'what a waste of my life' – ever! But here it is ""what a WASTE of my life""! Firstly, I will refer to the above statement and 'obliviously' label the film as SEXIST. I will now accuse it for portraying unfair stereotypical views on teenage-culture.To elaborate, the film (even with the role of smart-backed EMMA WATSON) depicted a very narrow (sexist) view of girls verging on becoming young women. The 'love-potion' triggers a very vague 'feminine/girly' response from the young women in class. The film is flawed in the way that it depicts the actors (Harry/Ron) to be surrounded by; not one, but multiple partners. It promotes the stereotypical view of teenagers obsessed with sex/love affairs and issues which (to be quite frank) young girls/women should not be concerned with. It lacks the traditional scenes which exhibit importance in the classroom, education and the library. Instead it focuses on elements of the moon, or the skies, romantic views – romantic relationships! AND THIS WITH THE DARK – CINEMATOGRAPHY JUST DOES NOT GO (DAVID YATES!).Admittedly I haven't read the book, but after watching the first half of the film, I had an instant disliking. To say the least, Daniel Radcliffe played a very unconvincing role (AS USUAL), furthermore – Ron seems to have evolved in to a very 'passionate' character.The film even goes as far as insinuating SEXUAL INNUENDO! It shocked me – when in one scene GINNY'S character 'kneels down' to tie-up Harry Potter's shoe-lace! Not such an issue, until you consider the high-angle shot which suggests something far less amusing (Not just me! I heard HOOTING and LAUGHS in that crowd!). I mean come-on!? What was the point of that anyway???!!! Other than all that, the film really lacks the dark element it so playfully tries to achieve! With half of it filled with cheesy-'trying to be Hollywood' romance, there is really pretty much nothing else left to enjoy. The film was as endless as the previous sequel, and had nothing to offer.THE COMEDY – oh how it made people 'force laughter' to keep their fandom-filled caps fooled in to believing it was actually funny! IT HAD NOTHING FUNNY ABOUT IT! And the clapping and the hooting as Harry-Potter (Daniel) engages in on-screen intimate romance, was unnecessary, because it just made me cringe.And finally – the shock/scare. Nothing much to type here – pretty-much-just-don't-exist.Save yourself the time, effort, cost, life, vomit and all the other things we don't like to deposit – and JUST DON'T WATCH IT.The only characters who were best acted out were A) Malfoy B)Bellatrix Lestrange C)Snape - Not I'm not just picking out the Villains here, it's just true.And for all you Potter fan's out there. Get this; Stop Pretending – Because you're only fooling yourself in to thinking you enjoyed it! I mean seriously? And for all the women who felt the film presented a positive 'gender' portrayal and really made use of the ridiculously high budget, 'WAKE-UP and SMELL that COFFEE'.This is not just a review. It's also a complaint. DO GO TO SEE IT THOUGH! (For the sake of educating yourself) Maybe write a review? Let others know how terrible it was! Writing this review was a very angry process – after considering the film already had wasted enough of my life",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
554,annabeljames68,This film simply missed the point - contains spoilers!,4,25 July 2009,"I was really disappointed in this film, even more so than the previous ones. It left out really relevant and important plot points from the book, confused issues and was so disjointed in places it simply didn't make any sense. Why were Bill and Fleur left out of the film altogether? Why not say that Greyback was a werewolf and responsible for Remus' condition? Why bring in Bellatrix? And why dumb down Dumbledores death scene so much it became meaningless? You were given no idea whatsoever of Snapes torment at what had to be done because of the desperate situation he had been placed in, nor of Harrys frustration of being genuinely immobilised and helpless (and invisible under his cloak) because he was none of those - just lurking in the shadows (which of course not one death eater bothered to check - yeah, right!) As for burning down 'the Burrow', well, my hopes that the final films would somehow redeem the series and pull everything together plummeted completely. Also, I've read the cast list for the films to follow and they leave out some very important characters indeed, which doesn't fill me with optimism. When they announced they were making films that would be true to the spirit of the books, it sounded good. The end products have been, at best, disappointing and this chunk was by far the worst yet. They've tripped it of everything that made the books so readable and ought to have made the films watchable - they are simply heartless, commercial, bland, blatant. cynical money making exercises which takes a well known phenomena and uses it for its own ends.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
555,avwilson-2,a great refresher for any book fan,7,20 July 2009,"I've been watching Harry Potter Movies for like seven years now, and each one has disappointed me. I keep thinking that they aren't so much movies, as visual presentations of the best scenes from the books. I keep thinking you just really couldn't follow them if you hadn't read the books. But then who hasn't read the Harry Potter books right? Well my wife for one. She'll read Twilight, but not Harry Potter. Okay okay, I'm not here to complain about my wife's reading habits. I wish she had never read the Twilight books, but then I bought them for her because I knew she would enjoy them. ANYWAY, I thoroughly enjoyed the new Harry Potter, Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince. I think this was because I really enjoyed all the scenes they chose from the book, and I really liked how dark this one started to get. I thought it was a pretty good example of the how much things change from about the ages of sixteen to eighteen, how you really start to lose that last bit of childhood innocence. I also thought this movie worked pretty well as a moral allegory for the moral choices that start to emerge at the close adolescence. As you lose that last bit of childhood innocence, you really have to start admitting that your choices negatively and positively impact the people around you. You start to create your own sense of morality, you start to decide what moral guidelines influence your decision making.For rest of review, visit www.tickleishpickle.blogspot.com",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
556,OldeTurtle,A cure for Insomnia,4,9 April 2010,"I was surprised to see how far these films had fallen. I absolutely could not stay awake through it. I tried rewinding several times to regain interest and finally gave up.It somehow seemed rather disjointed. They characters themselves seemed to wish they were not there.The acting seemed to me to be dispirited (no pun intended).Maybe the actors are growing too old for the stories and the plot does not fit anymore. maybe I am inured to the special effects and happenings.Whatever it may be, it is sad, like outgrowing an old and dear friendship.See it if you are a major Harry Potter fan, but otherwise, this is one to skip.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
557,mihirviveka,One of the worst films ever considering the story from which it was created,3,23 August 2009,"Before dismissing my conclusion please read the review. There are three aspects we should consider when talking about this film. 1. How good it is a film by itself.2. How good it is as a part of the series. 3. How good it is as an adaptation.BUT all these three cannot be considered separately because the story in the films is the story in the books. I am not talking about the various differences from the book in the film. I am talking about the gist of the story(emotions and philosophical concepts and story concepts) that are changed or misrepresented because of a lack of understanding and creativity, thereby ruining the story(and its potential)and turning the films into another cheap summer blockbuster which everyone forgets by winter. A story is nothing but an emotion or emotions. We feel a particular emotion and then weave a story to convey this emotion(s). We create characters to feel and make feel these emotions. But the purpose of a novel or film is to elaborate these emotions and show them in a detailed manner with more anticipation and more effect. Even if we think that these films are not adapted from any novel, even then the film is pretty bad. Let me explain it clearly There are 4 main emotional aspects in this story. 1. The extraordinary fantastical and wondrous things(Like Voldemort's history, horcruxes and search for them, The order, the ongoing fight and mainly Harry's relation with them all). These are the things that are uncommon and extraordinary even in the wizards world. 2. The escape from real world things(Like such close friends like Ron and Hermione, such a person and headmaster like Dombledore, Such dangerous people like Voldemort and all these things). Normally we do not come across such exceptionally good, great, bad and evil persons in real life. In any story these things are exaggerated to fulfill our fantasies. Like a bully like Malfoy does not really turn out to be linked to people like death eaters and attempt to kill a person like Dumbledore. In real life they are almost as normal as other people. The same goes for Snape(We all have a teacher we hate but when do they turn out to have such a history, character and connection with us in real life? In real life such teachers are just boring dung. But this is a fantasy), Dumbledore, Lupin, Sirius and all other characters. We just wish that the people we interact with and ourselves are really such extraordinary people and we are some kind of Harry between them. 3. The magical element. The magical world and the strange possibilities that can exist in it. 4. The school element. For everyone school and early college years are very memorable whether good or bad. Our wishes that the school and the people there be something really extraordinary is fulfilled very nicely in these stories. All these fantasy elements are mixed with each other. The last two items are the basic settings in which the story takes place and in it this escape from real world situation theme is present. And in such an extraordinary setting the events the events and aspects of the first theme(or point) are even extraordinary. But without the basic three(lats three) things the first point is definitely pointless and not so exciting even though it is the main part of the story. It is the icing of the cake. But the icing is only special because we have the cake beneath it. And above all there is a philosophical discussion about death(mainly) and also about love and selfishness in the story(although not as great as in stories like War and Peace, LOTR).But look what the film has done with this great story. Instead of enhancing all these elements and making them even better and wonderful look what they have done. a. They have destroyed the heart of the story by taking out the school element and they tried to make Hogwarts look as normal as possible not by showing the children, teachers, classes, studying and petty rivalries etc., but by making their dresses etc., just like those of muggles. b. In a similar way they destroyed the magical element by not showing us the daily life of students and wizards and how they contrast with muggle lives and just how wonderful they are. c. They have destroyed the escape from real world theme by assassinating the characters and turning them into parodies of their original selves. d. Finally they have destroyed the extraordinary fantastical things because of the above mentioned points and made it all look dull in a strange way.To who come in the defense of the films: I am not saying that the film is worse than a C grade film. But it looks just like one of those light comedy, adventure and action films and stories that are released every year. BUT HARRY POTTER'S IS NOT JUST ANOTHER SILLY COMMERCIAL STORY. The film should have been made like a legend like LOTR. Not just another ""Yeah enjoyed all the glitzy and puffy and gingo things and then ate some stuff in a hotel and slept like a log"" film. For one week(or at least 2-3 days) one should constantly dream about how good the film was and how nicely you felt the emotions and relish remembering each moment like after one eats a great feast. The story has such scope.This all is due to the lack of understanding of the producers, director, script writer and their vulgar and cheap imagination.So in this the way they have mutilated and butchered the stories. Even as the series progresses the films are getting worse and worse. The first two films at least felt good because they did not try to change everything ugly, plastic and unnatural.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
558,glitteh,The best movie yet!,9,23 August 2009,"I see a lot of complaining about how this movie strayed to far from the books, and that's very true, but I still loved it. They took out a lot of things and inserted a lot of things too (the opening scene is awesome) and that was why this movie was able to positively surprise me even though I read the books.Everything looked beautiful, they made Ginny's character a lot more likable and the things I found most important were still there.You could feel the actors loved to be there, and everything was full of enthusiasm. The teen drama balances on the verge of annoying, but is welcome relief from the darker scenes. Altogether I really liked this movie.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
559,mariesun,After all the OOTF disappointment...,9,6 January 2010,"I really liked it, but I gotta say that David Yates (or maybe Steve Kloves) has failed about crucial details, especially in the Room of Requeriment scene (with that AWFUL kiss, that I'd have done way better if I were that close to Daniel Radcliffe), when Harry or Ginny HAD to see Ravenclaw's diadem, even if it was just for a second. And where the hell went Harry's chemistry with Ginny? All Ron's jealously has gone away. It just looked like Hermione was crazy about him, and he could care less.I really like their (trio) acting, especially Daniel's in the Felix Felicis' scene. Hilarious, cute, and with a little help from Jim Broadbent, who really made this film funnier and funnier than I thought. Tom Felton is awesome, and so are Helena Bohan Carter and Alan Rickman as death eaters. Shame that Ralph Fiennes haven't appeared, we all remember his epic scene at HP4. All the Voldemort memories, especially when he came asking for a job, were just forgotten. I wonder how Kloves and Yates will make it happen...Anyway, Michael Gambon made me cry. Dumbledore is the deepest character I've ever seen, and Micheal knows how to transmit all his intensity to the film.As a huge fan, I always wait for the best. Not 10/10 (I hope DH with be), but yet very good.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
560,Da_Playboi,Harry Potter & the Love Potion Number 9,5,15 July 2009,"SPOILERS (not many or that big) AHEAD As much as it pains me to say this, but this movie was not that good. Order of the Phoenix ends with Harry and the others maturing after the formation of Dumbledore's Army and the death of Sirius Black; but this film is just too bogged down by who's ""snogging"" who and other juvenile plot points that serve no purpose to the overall story. And hour or so in, you're left to wonder (if you can even remember) why is this movie even called the Half-Blood Prince and why should I care? As far as the story (or lack there of) in this movie goes, it might as well be called ""Harry Potter & the Love Potion Number 9."" Because of this, the big reveal of who the Half-Blood Prince is, hits home with a resounding thud; upon finding out it was Snape, my reaction was not the gasp that so many Muggle readers had, but more of an, ""oh.. that's something.""But my biggest problem with the film overall is that nothing happens. I could have dealt with the fact that the film spent way too long seeing who's ""snogging"" who if it just went somewhere. If it would have perhaps told me more about young Tom Riddle that I didn't already know, or made me remotely care about the Half-Blood Prince. But after 2 and a half hours all that is learned is what's a Horcrux, and Dumbledore's dead... and oh yeah Snape did it. That's it, I just summed up 2 and a half hours for you. This film is the epitome of a segue film, nothing more than bridge between Order and Deathly Hallows; comparable to eating a bag of tofu, in the end you're sustained for the next meal, but you basically got nothing out of this one.And to all those defenders who have and will say to me, ""well that's what happens in the book, it's a set up for Deathly Hallows."" Then that's a bad book too, and an even worse movie if it's just to be used as an appendices to another. As someone who doesn't know what happens in the end, I wanna be entertained by each film, and not just prepped for the next.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
561,sixdayssouth,"Very anti-climatic, very disappointing.",6,15 July 2009,"I'll keep this short and bittersweet. While not without its merits, the sixth film in the HP series was very much a let-down for me.First of all, I'm a die-hard fan of the books, but I absolutely didn't want or expect the movie to follow the book page-for-page. In fact, some of the creative liberty taken in the film was quite good. One scene in particular was very good, where Bellatrix and Fenrir Greyback attack the burrow, leading to a showdown in the marsh between Harry, Ginny and the two Death Eaters. Or at least it had the potential to be very good. In fact, much of the movie was very anticlimactic. That scene, among many other crucial scenes, fizzles out when nothing happens. There is a short duel, and then the DE's leave. The same thing happens in the end of the movie, which was the biggest let-down of all the films so far. The battle through Hogwarts at the end of the book was the big climax, leading up to Dumbledore's death. In the film, the whole battle is cut out, replaced instead by a very short and mawkish scene in which Snape gives a quick Avada Kedavra, and then everyone goes on their way.In short, the lack of appropriate emotional content and the lack of any real climax anywhere throughout the film just makes the whole thing a bit lackluster. Bringing David Yates back into the picture was clearly a costly mistake.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
562,captbeefheart6,ho hum,5,16 July 2009,"It would be a reasonably sure bet that if someone has seen the prior films they will be seeing this one. In other words a sure-fire hit. As such you might expect they'd relax some of the requirements forced upon a big budget film - i.e. less emphasis on action and focus on the story. But alas not. And to rub salt into the wound is the nature of the action. The opening and that rather chaotic somethingorother in the middle at the Weasley residence is really quite forced and uninteresting; another would be the inclusion of Quiddich-why do that when its involvement in the development of Ginny & Harrys relationship is cut? Speaking of that, there is no development it just sort of muddles along through a series of disjointed events and is whittled down to a lone kiss. No actual relationship. Development indeed.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
563,adrianh-4,"Should be titled ""Harry Potter and The Warner Brothers Licence to Print Money""",4,7 August 2009,"Dear oh dear oh dear. Haven't the bean counters at Warner Bros yet realised that HP fans WILL come and see the films no matter what? If they haven't then they should check the box office receipts. If they have, then why ""... in the name of Merlin's pants ..."" can't they get a decent script writer and a not-full-of-himself director to make a faithful visual representation of at least one HP book? There are lots of comments supporting this film as a good version of the book. To all of you who feel this way, please stop short changing yourselves and go back and read the book again (this time pay attention). There are so many inaccuracies - the film starts with one on the London Underground for instance and where David Yates got the idea for blowing up The Burrow is beyond me. I still don't know why the idea of Death Eaters being able to fly without broomsticks was ever allowed, seeing as how it is a major Voldemort only development in book seven! And as for the way Snape kills Dumbledore (good riddance to Michael Gambon I say) its an absolute joke. Plus, no funeral. Yea Gods what was everyone thinking about? Again so much story, particularly the back story about Riddle's upbringing is skated over. Yes the film is darker, even #5 HP & OOP is darker. But you have to be darker in the right way. You need to take time to build up the story to create the darkness, not simply lower the lights on set.I know its not possible to put all of a huge book into a single film, but then why not make more than one film (or at least make an extended one so those of us interested can buy it on DVD - seems the bean counters have missed a trick here). And before anyone shouts me down saying that the films are only based upon the books that just won't wash. Any company who has a franchise so successful that just six films outstrips the highest grossing franchise of all time (James Bond 22 films), owes it to their audience to do more than just show a bunch of stuck together highlights and Director's ""interpretations"".Of course I will see the seventh film, I am human so hope is all I've got!",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
564,blackpranther,"Really Good Movie! If you haven't read the books, wait until the movies are finished though",8,16 July 2009,"The Harry Potter movies towed the line of the book for the first 3 films and then from there, as the size of the books increased the less the feature length adaptations resembled the source material. This unavoidably is a disappointment to anyone who has read the novels beforehand, because the books are so intricate, well thought out and well written. That being said, this movie continues in that direction by abandoning J.K.R.'s weave of subplot and distilling the book into a PG- rated teaser trailer of the book. HOWEVER, as a movie, this movie has accomplished keeping both continuity with it's own character development arc, Is visually stunning, and is probably the one of best things to come out all summer. This is hands down the best acted of the series, and very enjoyable to watch. If you've read the book, avoid walking in with a checklist of things you expect to see, and don't allow the ""missing"" plot points to distract you from the great ride you should get watching this film. If you've been able to avoid reading the books thus far, wait until after you see the corresponding movies and I promise you'll love them both.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
565,mandar_cyberfun,Amazingly brilliant.....Worth waiting the whole year for!!,10,18 July 2009,"OK...i know everyone's gonna start having hissy-fits about the rating I gave, But come on....Im a die-hard potter-fanatic and after a whole year of excruciatingly painful wait (I actually kept crossing days off the calender *gulp*) I was more than satisfied!! This movie beats every other summer movie that was released including the not-so-watchable Transformers sequel and a mildly funny Ice-Age 3(saving grace....of course scrat and scratte!!) :/ To start of with, the visuals are as usual mind-blowing and very well-placed...Unlike some movies (*cough* transformers *cough*), it doesn't over-kill with the CGI. The music composed by Nic Hooper stands out and the Weasley Twins theme just gets stuck in your head!! The direction is quite brilliant considering the time constraints in making a movie outta 600-page odd-book, however its been nothing short of spectacular!The key points are well-set-up and unlike some comments i've read (*cough* guy from MN, USA *cough*), I totally rebuke them!! The stellar cast is nothing short of spectacular...and Tom Felton as the ""timid boy made to stand-in as a brave one"" steals the show. His expressions and words reek with the inner turmoil and anguish, Im hoping for his BAFTA nomination for outstanding performance in comparison to stalwarts like Jim broadbent, Alan Rickman and well...Michael Gambon (*cough*).Another special mention must go to Mr. Alan Rickman, who always manages to steal the show right under everyones nose!! I cant imagine Severus Snape as someone else ever....kinda like imagining Rocky without Sly!! The other kids like Danny, Rupert and Emma give their very best, unfortunately are over-shadowed by the rest of the cast. Bonnie wright has come into her own in terms of acting, yet she doesn't come across any better than a piece-of eye-candy! Lastly, The climax is very moving and although its very difficult for a guy like me to admit, yes, my eyes welled with tears....and anybody who says they didn't feel a thing are lying or just hypocritical!! Once again, A must watch and now i cant await the next one!! Thank you David and J.K....you've made millions of people happy with just 2 hrs of narration!!

567,azarn-valo,"The worst entry yet. A ""filler"" and waste of time.",4,15 July 2009,"Spoilers abound below.I've never read any of the Harry Potter books and as such am just basing this appraisal based on the cinematic experience. I didn't really enjoy the first two films in the cinema and therefore didn't bother to see the others. However, I picked up the entire boxset of 1-5 during the HD DVD fire sale and came to find that Potter 3,4 and 5 were MUCH better than the first two and were films of genuine quality in their own right.As a result, I was eagerly looking forward to HBP and attended opening night.But frankly, this film was a massive let down. The direction, acting, cinematography, visual effects and to a lesser extent, music were all of a decent to high quality. Yet the film was, in my opinion, a dull experience.Ultimately, this film was filler in every meaning of the word. There was virtually nothing in this film which couldn't have been detailed in Order of the Phoenix in some way.The film was 75% about absolutely inane teenage romances. Now, I know these films are about teenagers and the romances are a key part of the story. But the fact that SO much of this film was dedicated to light hearted teen frolicking completely ruined the tension and action beats that have been built up in the last two films.Let's face it, we spent the last half of Goblet of Fire and virtually all of Order of the Phoenix watching the reveal of an epic final battle between Voldemorte and Harry. Phoenix even ended on a very effective fight scene and dozens of sentiments of ""this is it! It's go time!"". Remember that great line which ended the film on a level of biting tension?: ""He's back...""One of the first rule of story telling is never lower the stakes.After 2 films of tense buildup, the audience (especially those who DON'T KNOW THE BOOKS) is expecting a release. If you want to spend a THIRD movie building up to the finale, OK, risky, but it might work. Yet this film BARELY did that.The majority of the romantic subplots are simply elements which could and should have been implemented or handled earlier in the stories. At this point, near the end, we just don't have the time to be dealing with these subdued, lighthearted plot beats. We want Voldemorte!Whenever we're not dealing with these romances, we're spending time trying to wrangle the details of the Horcruxes out of Slughorn. This plot line was just lazy. He says he's not willing to divulge information about his conversation with Tom Riddle for fear of ""ruining his reputation""... THE WORLD IS AT STAKE! It's absolutely absurd that he would remain tight lipped under the circumstances when everyone KNOWS Voldemorte is back and means business. Furthermore, HE HAS ALREADY retired!!! The amount of time we spent meandering over Harry trying to learn the secret was precious time wasted. Furthermore, the only way he did learn the secret was through that pathetic Deus Ex Machina ""success potion"", which itself lead to that bizarre and wasteful ""spider funeral and wake"" sequence. What the hell is going on here?! I'm paying to see Wizards having epic duels!!We finally, after two hours, learn the nature of the Horcruxes, Dumbledore bites the dust (in an ineffective death and funeral sequence that left me cold) and we repeat the generic ""End of Harry Potter where the three leads stand together and state upbeat platitudes which lead into the next film"". But we essentially spent TWO HOURS learning one fact: Voldemorte split his soul into seven trinkets. Now we gotta find them. THAT. IS. ALL. This could EASILY have been included in the previous films and we could already be underway in the search. What a waste of my time.Other slight problems:Why, after Harry cuts down Draco, do all his friends demand that he lose the HBP's book? Wtf? What does that have to do with anything? (Ok, we learn later that Harry's offensive spell here must have been a dangerous spell he learned from Snape's book, but we don't know this at all at the time. Everyone I saw the film with was confused by this.)Furthermore, what the hell IS the Half Blood Prince? Sure, I know it's Snape, and yes, I'm sure it's explained in the book, but what IS IT? I still don't know.Another thing: Where the HELL IS Voldemorte? In the last film his plan was clearly on the verge of application, but here he doesn't even show up? What is he doing? Relaxing at his home base while his mortal enemies spend A LOT of time solving his mysteries and discovering his weaknesses?Ultimately, the fact remains, in simple terms, this film had virtually no story. Yes it had PLOT; a lot of events HAPPEN, but it BARELY advanced the emotional engagement we have with the characters and circumstances. It was a waste of time and didn't accomplish anything an extra ten minutes in the previous couldn't have.A.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
568,rachelmann,Let the film speak for itself,9,15 July 2009,"There is so much to enjoy in this film. The humour quotient has been upped, the budding romances are both amusing and, in Hermione's case, affecting and it is one good looking film. However, as a passionate fan of the novels there were moments - not least the violent events at the Weasleys' home at Christmas - which jarred. I wanted to shout, 'but, but, but that's not in the book!' So, there is a health warning for book nuts like me - let go of your need for this film to be faithful to the details of the book and let it speak for itself.

569,malaria2888,...Where did they go wrong,6,18 July 2009,"This movie is good...for a movie. But in the Harry Potter franchise it just doesn't cut. Most of the movies haven't. I am an avid reader of the books and I go to every midnight showing. I read the books at least once a year. When I saw the trailer for this movie was super psyched. It looked as if they had finally gotten one right. It looked brilliant. I came out of the movie not knowing what to think. I know that it's not possible for them to put everything in...but not to put some stuff in and then add some completely unneeded scenes is just upsetting. The burrow scene was useless.All the movies have had one great thing about them...and that's the cast. They have all been perfectly cast. Almost every actor captures the character they are portraying. I had some reservations when I heard that Jim Broadbent was going to be Slughorn, but I have to say that he was great. Helena Bonham Carter is terrifying is Bellatrix. Rupert Grint is the perfect Ron and the same thing goes for Emma Watson. Daniel Radcliff doesn't always capture Harry in my mind, but he is such a difficult character. Richard Harris was the all time perfect Dumbledore. He had the voice that seemed calm but seemed to have this electrifying power behind it. I was so sad when he died. Then Michael Gambon steps in...I didn't like him. That is until this movie. I think he started to finally get Dumbledore right. Alan Rickman steals pretty much every movie he does. He is one of the best actors out there...and he knows how to pick his roles. Severus Snape was written for Alan Rickman. It feels like the character is part of his essence. It's brilliant. truly.The movies have the cast...just not the script. I can't believe that JK Rowling lets them do this to her work. They needed to be more true.

570,tsk1979,A big disappointment!,4,17 July 2009,"The movie looked from a stand alone perspective is okay, but when you compare it to the book, its one of the worst executions. Many interesting parts from the book are missing, with useless parts from the book added. The director has chosen the easy route, and at the end of 2 and a half hours you feel the movie is incomplete. The scenes which should have been the longest are short, and lot of effort is given to the sub plots, which could have been skipped. In the whole movie nothing really happens, it just drags on.Moreover, at the end there is a sense of incompleteness. The book made you want more, you wanted the last part tome come out quickly, but with this movie, its just ""poof"".Direction is good, but editing is not, and character development is not very good.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
571,darkorion69,Simply Confused,8,15 July 2009,"This movie was excellent. The acting, cinematography, special effects, and the pacing were great. As in any novel adaptation though, far too much was left out for my tastes.The real problem with leaving major book details out imho, is not bad service to hardcore fans of the HP novels. The true losers on what was cut...are the people that still refuse to read any of the novels despite having seen 6 of the films! They are going to be mystified on the reason behind many scenes and situations.I am simply shocked that people could watch any of these excellent films and not find themselves in a bookstore shortly after. But I do not want to cast aspersions on people who prefer movies to books...so I will leave it at that.There are many people these days that favor action and adventure over angst, romance, and character development. Those kind of movie goers really should skip Half Blood Prince and go see Transformers 2 instead. A stranger I spoke to after the film said it was 'romantic garbage' that never seemed to end *sad panda*Half Blood Prince is 75% angst, romance, and character development. If you (like I) find such things compelling then you will enjoy this movie. If you are a die hard fan of the book, you can enjoy HBP if you can let go of what was left out.

Where were Nearly Headless Nick and Moaning Myrtle? Crabb, Goyle, and Nevile Longbottom ? Sure the movie advanced the overall Potter plot and helps set up finale. But it seemed to be a bunch of individual scenes loosely connected. It was great to find the primary cast intact, but as noted above some important characters were missing. A weak effort.

574,yulek,a missed adaptation,6,15 July 2009,"disclaimer: not a fan of the books although this was the one i enjoyed the most - plus the adventure of seeing it at midnight with my wife and son made the experience fun.the film was very well made and for once the kids do an excellent acting job.however the plot of the book, intricate to the point of absurdity as it was, is practically ignored in lieu of the oh so humorous teenage romantic antics of ron, hermine, and harry.too much of the film was spent on high school sexual awakening giggles and slughorn's parties and too little on the half blood prince and tom riddle. the potion book was hardly featured, the entire investigation of the half blood prince's identity completely ignored, and the final revelation almost an after thought as a result. the suspense that was so prevalent in the book was on a bathroom break in the film.in addition, some of the most interesting pensieve memories of tom riddle's life were utterly dropped. where were the memories of the riddles and the gaunts; we never get to see what made the book so dark - why voldermort became who he was. going by the film, he simply was a boy with an evil streak; the complexity of the character lost. we don't get to learn anything about the horcruxes or their purpose; again a key point in the story.i suppose you can get away with making such a weak interpretation of the book for the following reasons: 1. the film *was* very well made, entertaining, and with interesting visuals 2. it's doubtful anyone in the audience hasn't read the book and therefore there's not going to be much scratching of heads 3. people will see this film no matter what so there's no reason to *really* try and i'm sure it'll rate high on most reviews - hurray for mediocre adaptationsa reminder, i'm not a fan of the potter series - i've read them all (to my son over the years) and enjoyed portions of them. i'm not some fanatic of the series demanding absolute purity in the silver screen interpretation. it's not all that important for me that the book's plot was so completely ruined. i'm writing this because that's the honest truth. the half blood prince film is weak though i am sure my voice will be lost in the choir of the potter cult's exclamations of jubilation at it's release - no matter how much they may question its merit on the inside.go ahead and start pressing the ""Not Useful"" buttons.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
575,wizard2000,Why did Yates and company burn down the Burrows?,5,27 November 2010,"It is my understanding that HP 6 was in the can before Yates and company decided to split the 7th book into two parts, making two movies, choosing to allocate more time to cover the events leading up to Rowling's grand finale.Prior to this decision, I've read that one of the producers said that the Deathly Hallows (the three powerful magical objects) were going to be cut from the 7th movie, leaving only the horcruxes search and the final confrontation. Strange, this would have required changing the actual name of the last movie, and changing Rowling's ending as well. But this did help explain some of the strange editing decisions made in HP 6 (along with the producers' decision to make cuts upfront to increase profits on the tail-end).Thus, the burning down of the Weasley home, the Burrows. And the missing Bill Weasley and Fleur romance. No romance, no Burrows, no wedding at the beginning of HP 7, no introduction to the Deathly Hallows. It makes ""sense"" from a muggle viewpoint, but the burning down of the Burrows makes entirely no sense at all from Rowling's magical world viewpoint.Hello!!! The Burrows in the home of the Weasley family, very proficient wizards and witches...with wands. They could have repaired or rebuilt the Burrows in short order, no problem, no sweat, waving their wands like Slughorn and Dumbledore did at the beginning of the HP 6 book and movie. And besides, the Burrows was under Ministry of Magic protection, so no Death Eater or even Voldemort could get anywhere near it, let alone burn it down.This was so jarring a departure from Rowling's book that I had to knock off several ratings points, with several more knocked off because of how Yates and company handled the tower scene at the end, with Harry's invisibility cloak literally ""vanishing"" from it, with Harry (instead of being under the cloak, invisible, petrified, within feet of the action) found seemingly cowering under the tower floor, having been told to stay put, watching wordless while Snape passed by, even while watching Dumbledore killed, and then unable to stop any of the Death Eaters from escaping from the top of the tower. Duuuuh.Yates and company definitely don't like that invisibility cloak. Maybe the special effects cost too much? At the beginning of HP 6, Harry is petrified by Draco Malfoy, who leaves Harry on the train's floor, covered with the invisibility cloak, petrified, no one knowing where he is, with the train departing back to London, but no snippet showing Harry's perspective from under the invisibility cloak, looking through a gauzy film, as in previous movies. Why? So, while I liked parts of Yates' version of HP 6, other parts were just too jarring and incomprehensible to warrant anything but a 5 out of 10, which is still stretching it because so many of Dumbledore's acquired-with-difficulty memories of horcruxes and Voldemort's history were omitted, along with Dumbledore's funeral at the end, making one wonder exactly what HP 7 would have looked like if it had ended up being only one movie instead of being split into two. Apparently J.K. Rowling signed away her ""creative control"" over HP at the same time she signed away the film rights, leaving those in charge to take ""creative license"" with her masterpiece, twisting it until it is at times almost unrecognizable.

576,soundtrackbuff,"Funny, Exciting, Scary, THIS is what more summer blockbusters should be like",10,7 July 2009,"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince. Most everything about the movie is different--the characters have definitely matured, Hooper's score is better (thank goodness), the special effects have improved, and even the castle itself has a different feel to it...cold and covered in shadows. It's a refreshing touch, though. The series NEEDS constant change, or else it would become quite stale...There are many funny moments in the movie, and the hormones are definitely raging. But, relationships aside, there is also a darker side to the newest Potter entry. Dumbledore and Harry try to unlock the secret to Voldemort's past. Harry must retrieve a precious memory from a long-lost friend of Dumbledore's (an excellent Broadbent).The last thirty or so minutes are marvelous. In particular, there is a scene in which Harry and Dumbledore must venture into a protected vessel of Voldemort's soul...very creepy, very emotional...it was well-done.Ending is surprising. Quite sad, really. I don't want to spoil anything.But it's a wonderful thing to see how much this series has progressed. Epic is definitely a word that may be used to describe Half-Blood Prince.

577,adambogoch92,"Adventure, Action, Love, Comedy, Darkness, Heros, Villains and most importantly MAGIC!!!",9,18 July 2009,"First off I'd like to say that I have read the book twice and obviously loved it, so I am perfectly aware of what was differences, however it's a filmmakers perspective on the book, things work on the page that don't necessarily work on screen, like no end battle was a big one, yeah I missed it, but it would have been extremely repetitive judging on what takes place in the last book. Certain characters or scenes that played out in your head may be different in the movie, because obviously the director, cinematographer and screenplay writer have different heads then you do.The film opens up with the ever so faint Harry Potter theme over the Warner Brothers sign and quickly turns to what is perhaps, the best opening scenes in a Harry Potter film. Harry and Dumbledore in the Ministry of Magic as the press take photos of them after the huge battle with Voldemort. As the press overwhelms Harry, and Dumbledore puts his arm around him. So simple but so well done. And then to an even more perfect opening, the bridge/Diagon Alley scene with the Death Eaters was great! As the film continued it slowly brought back some familiar faces. Daniel, Rupert and Emma, all three of them especially Emma Watson grew as actors terrifically from the last film, Emma really has you feeling for her in a particular scene where she is crying in Harry's arms. Rupert Grint was the comedic star of the film; his timing was brilliant, very funny and worked well with new comer Jessie Cave who was brilliant as Lavender Brown, Ron's annoyingly clingy and slightly horny love interest. As much as I'd like to stay on Rupert, I have to say that Jessie is great! Rupert also was good with Emma, I really started to feel the Hermione/Ron relationship again, not really since Goblet of Fire did we see this. It's really sweet and kodos to Ron as he has two hot girls chasing him around, even if one of them is a bit crazy. Daniel Radcliffe is always the same, he's good. He is reliable to always be our hero, he was very funny to in his comedic scene when he takes the liquid luck.The supporting cast: Bonnie Wright stepped up! She has presence, beauty, and is a good actress, perfect as Ginny. Though some of the scenes between Harry and Ginny were a bit corny but you had to love it anyway. She was sweet and very likable. Michael Gambon, what a legend. As much as I will be burned for saying this, I've always like him better as Dumbledore then the late great Richard Harris, who was awesome, but I love Gambon, and now others can see why. I can't say much more other then he was perfect. I really enjoyed his presence especially in the cave scene. Our newcomer teacher, Horace Slughorn, the talented Jim Broadbent, STOLE THE FREAKING SHOW! He was so funny, and so entertaining. I enjoyed the Slug Club scenes, which he truly shined in, as well as the scene with Hagrid. Alan Rickman had his time to shine. His perfect pauses are what make Severus Snape one of the best characters in the series. He is so entertaining and so powerful especially in the Astronomy tower scene at the end. He also has great chemistry with another great. Helena Bonham Carter is perhaps my favorite casting choice, since Order of the Phoenix, Bellatrix Lestrange has always and always will be my favorite character. She is so sadistically malicious, cruel and absolutely pure evil. She didn't have huge amounts of screen time but way more then expected. She gets to blow up a lot of things, laugh like a mad women and shot some nasty spells at Radcliffe. My favorite scene she stole, the Unbreakable Vow scene in which she taunts Alan Rickman into making a deadly deal with her sister Narcissa Malfoy, Helen McCroy was really good. She brought a little bit of heart to the bad guys, which she isn't all that evil, well compared to her sister that is. Draco, Narcissa's son, Tom Felton, also had his chance to shine and he was really dark and really good. Fenrir Greyback (Dave Legeno) was underused, one line, but multiple close ups. Then to name off a few of the rest, Maggie Smith had much more screen time then Order or Goblet but still not enough, she is always amazing, Robbie Coltrane as the lovable Hagrid was still underused but I liked what he did have. Julie Walters and Mark Williams had decent sized parts and are always lovable. Timothy Spall had nothing of a part and I missed him. Evanna lynch as Luna had a good sized role, very funny! Warwick Davis and David Bradley were good. And finally David Thewlis and Natalia Tena had small but likable parts as normal.What I didn't like was the under use of Greyback, Timothy Spall, not explaining the inferi, Harry randomly starting to like Ginny, Ginny and Dean's break up sort of not clarified. Bellatrix needed more screen time and I thought that the attack on the Burrow was a little out of character and probably should have been longer though I enjoyed it.The score is brilliant, Hooper even brings back some of the music from Order. The cinematography of Delbonnel was outstanding! David Yates is an awesome director and you could see how much fun he was letting his cast have with their characters. The balance between comedy, and darkness is incredible and so hard to pull off but they did it beautifully.And that's it, you will enjoy this movie, just go in with an open mind!",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
578,mr_k_15,"The beginning of the end it's Darker,Deeper and Better !!!",8,27 July 2009,"I have always been a fan of harry potter books,but to be honest the first 4 movies of harry potter were great disappointment to the book fans and not that interesting to stand alone as a movie to appeal to a regular cinema enthusiast.However we started to see quite an improvement in the fifth movie ""order of the phoenix"" as the character got older and the battle scenes got bigger.I really liked harry potter and the half blood prince i think it was the saddest and the darkest in the series so they tried to lighten up the mood with quirks here and there -sometimes a bit too much- but i laughed nether the less, i watched harry potter evolves from a children book and movie rated ""U"" into a teenage movie that even older audience would enjoy,more importantly even the audience that didn't read the book would enjoy it.The movie is a bit long about 150 minutes -expected when you try to make a book of 700 pages into a movie- even then some characters were missing in and some events but it didn't affect the movie much.The acting was not great to say the least specially from the main characters like Daniel Radcliffe as Harry - is it just me? or this guy is a really bad actor- and Emma Watson as Hermione came off as arrogant also I'm very disappointed in Tom Felton as Draco Malfoy - he did a better job as a young Draco- i always rooted for him against harry.on the positive side a solid performance form Rupert Grint as Ron Weasly, and Outstanding performances from the secondary characters like Helena Bonham Carter as Bellatrix Lestrange - Man she is Evil !!! - , Evanna Lynch as Luna Lovegood and of course my favorite Alan Rickman as prof. Snape which balanced out the acting problem.Overall it was a great summer movie to me personally and it is a preparation for the final show down which I'm hoping it will be even better and satisfactory to all of us harry potter fans.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
579,usernamenow,Just like the rest of the Harry Potter films...,3,16 July 2009,"Every time a Harry Potter movie opens, it seems the same thing happens: the movie makes a ton of money and gets great reviews. However, I disagree with all of that completely. If these movies were original ideas, based on original screenplays, then yes, they'd be pretty good movies. However, they are NOT. They're based on a series of books that are incredibly well written.It seems every movie is rushing to the end, taking out huge chunks of the actual story. And the further the series goes, the more they take out. The completely drop all sub plots and focus only on the main plot. And then they don't even do the main plot justice and switch around all of it. I understand when making a movie based on a book, you need to lose some things. Really, I do. That's why i enjoyed the first two movies, when Chris Columbus was directing. He knew what he was doing. He kept the story together and only took out small things that weren't too big a deal. But after he left, they movies went downhill. For example, since the third movie, why don't they ever wear they're robes? They suppose to be ALWAYS wearing them when at Hogwarts, yet they never wear them after the second movie.The movies just focus on visual and what makes it look the best but completely forgets what the movie is based off of, which are the books! For example, the opening bridge sequence. That is literally only mentioned in the book, yet they spent who knows how much on that one unimportant detail because it looked good.I do not like the movies and this one wasn't any different. They take out so much and put in so much that's either not in the book, or not important from the book or change around completely what was the original that its not even based off of Harry Potter anymore.Overall great visuals, as usual. Acting was OK by most, with a special mention for Tom Felton, who really brought it in this one. Do yourself a favor, read the book series. They're SO much more in them and they surpass the movies by so much i cant even come up with an analogy that works.3/10",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
580,slackjaw79,The Best Harry Potter Yet,8,14 August 2009,"Like the other Harry Potter movies, I get the feeling that there was a lot left out of the original story in order to fit everything into the 2 1/2 hours of screen time. I haven't read any of the books, and it never really effected the movie experience until this episode. Did the book elaborate a little more on the Half Blood Prince? Did it tell any of his back story or is that something that we have to wait for in the next installment? It just doesn't seem like a smart thing to do to title the book after a character and then have the plot of the movie about something completely different. Instead of the story of the Half Blood Prince, we're told about Voldemort and his time at the school. It was still good. But am I really going to have to read the book to get the real story?

582,bonsaikathy,The worst movie of the series so far,1,15 January 2010,"I went to see the movie the day it opened. I wondered when it was over how in the world they could get it so wrong. The direction this movie took was beyond stupid and unsatisfying. Most of it was disjointed and even having read the book just before going to see the movie I couldn't for the life of me understand how much of it related to the book or story line. The scene at the borrow in the middle was completely unnecessary and made no sense to the storyline.The love scenes were awful, especially the kiss between Ginny and Harry. Some of the Ron/Lavender stuff just about made me gag. I didn't see it as funny at all. What was the purpose of changing how the scene was done with Harry hiding the book? How is Harry supposed to know about the crown in the next movies or the hufflepuff cup as the cup isn't mentioned in this movie? They left most the memories out. Sorry, too much was changed in this movie from the book and story line and too much was left out. Harry wouldn't have sat below and not done something about the situation at the end with Dumbledore in the tower. Why not have just done it the way it was written in the book? Lastly why in the world would they leave out the funeral? To me it felt almost like the director and writer are just over the series and trying to get it over with and behind them. It appears as though they didn't put much thought into it at all but just threw it together as fast as possible. It was just too disjointed to make any sense at all.I truly hope that the last 2 movies are done far better than this. Let's have it go out with a bang instead of fizzling after so many years of enjoyment.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
583,optwood,Enjoyable but Slow,6,26 March 2010,"I obviously did the 'HP experience' the right way. Watched each movie and then read the book. So I didn't get upset about how much of the book was missing from the movie. However I found it hard to follow some of the dialog and was forced to watch the film on DVD with sub-titles to get everything said. And it was much slower paced than the other films. That said I did enjoy it. **** Here is the spoiler**** While I am sure Dumbledore is dead, I couldn't imagine a situation more asking for him to actually be alive if the author wanted him to not really die. A master wizard (albeit tired) was disarmed by a 15 yo student, then fell off a tower, and his body was found later at the bottom of the tower. Hmmm... How hard would it be for a little confusing magic to make it seem he was disarmed, or even a fake wand? Dumbledore falls to his death? How ... ordinary. He couldn't use a float or fly spell to survive? And then in the 15 minutes between falling and his body being discovered it wouldn't be difficult for a master wizard to provide an artificial substitute. But.. as I said, I am sure he is dead, killing off important secondary characters in the second last book is a well-established literary technique. The use of the liquid luck potion was cute. A good way of allowing the writer to move the plot along without having to think up a reason for Slughorn to tell Harry the secret memory. But once you have opened the 'luck potion' box it can be a problem. How does harry defeat Voldemort? Well lets drink a large potion of 'liquid luck' and start writing random letters. Look, what luck, Harry has written a complete plan to defeat Voldemort without anyone dying or even being badly hurt. 'Wasn't that a stroke of luck'. Of course people will argue that it is not that powerful, but the point is that it can be argued. Until JK Rowling brought up the liquid luck potion, Harry and his friends had to succeed or fail using their skills, knowledge, friends, and a little ordinary luck.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
584,CharlesTheBold,One of the best of the movies,9,18 July 2009,"In my opinion this is one of the best of the movies, focusing on the human strengths and weaknesses of the various characters as the war approaches. Particularly good: Felton as Draco, trapped between Voldamort's orders and what's left of his human decency; Slughorn, not just a pompous name-dropper but an aging has-been trying to win his new students' respect; Gambon of course gets Dumbledore's best scenes of the series and lives up to them; Ginny comes out of the background to offer Harry love and moral support when he most needs it; Luna is back, as dotty and as helpful as ever.Time constraints forced the producers to cut and simplify some of the story -- Scrimgeour, the Dursleys, Voldamort's mother, Fleur and Bill all get left out -- and they treat the invasion of Hogwarts at the end as an unanticipated sneak attack in order to highlight the apparent treachery of Snape. This meant the story could proceed directly from Dumbledore's death to Harry's vow to carry on the quest for the Horcruxes. I thought most of the changes were well thought out, though I would be curious to know what Rowling thinks of them. I look forward to the next installment.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
585,Stardust_4,A worthy addition to the Harry Potter saga,9,16 July 2009,"I am glad to say that, in this writer's opinion, the Half-Blood Prince has restored the films to what they should have been since the Prisoner of Azkaban, three movies ago. The Goblet of Fire and the Order of the Phoenix, respectively, were characterised by too short a length, bland dialogue and the lack of vital subplots.The Half-Blood Prince has changed that. Dark, sinister and dangerous, yet with humour aplenty and almost an overdose of adolescent romance, the Half-Blood Prince is a success. In particular, I must congratulate the performances of Emma Watson as the tormented yet determined central feminine figure, Jim Broadbent as the 'haute couture' tweedy new teacher, and Alan Rickman in his excellently dark portrayal of Severus Snape.If I have any criticism, it is this; whereas the past three Harry Potter films have left a lot out, this film leaves a lot in but doesn't elaborate enough on it. As a prime example, the Ginny-Harry relationship was played down to an almost non-existent level, with no introduction whatsoever to their sudden affection; in addition, the Horcrux references were not extended enough, leaving us to wonder as to what the remaining ones are; and where was Rufus Scrimgeour? However, these are small faults, over-weighed by the highlights; the breathtaking opening scenes over London, the dramatic Quidditch match, the doomed Ron-Lavender romance, the development of the friendship between Ron and Hermione, the emotion-charged climax, the ever-present comedy moments and the spine-chilling cave scene near the end.If this is the standard of Harry Potter films from this year onwards, we can expect a glorious finale in the last two upcoming movies. In the words of Daniel Radcliffe, Harry Potter, ""...just some tosser, I guess..."". In this writer's opinion, he couldn't be more wrong.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
586,marta-i-sousa,"It looks great, but it's not that good",5,18 July 2009,"It's been almost 8 years since the first film of the Harry Potter saga came out. The cast has grown as did the budget and the buzz surrounding it. In these 8 years, technology has developed too and that is pretty noticeable. It's going be surprising if ""The Half-Blood Prince"" doesn't get a few award nominations on the visual and special effects area. It may be daring to claim, but I didn't see one single mistake or bad effect (except maybe the absence of Harry's scar in a few scenes, but the guy probably didn't have that much time to spend in the make-up chair).Almost everything else, well, fails. Even though the performances of the main cast have evolved a lot since the first film, they still have a long way to go. Daniel Radciffe in particular is still a pretty rough actor. The final product, compared to the book, also leaves a lot to desire. A lot of stories (not only secondary, but some important parts of the plot) were cut from the film. It's understandable that time is an issue, but, still, it feels incomplete. It also takes too much time to get anywhere. There's practicably no action on the ""Half-Blood Prince"". We get the feeling that something very dark is happening during the entire course of the film, but we don't get to see it until the very end when the death eaters enter Hogwarts and Dumbledore is killed. In other words, it's a little too tedious for both a blockbuster and a name that attracts the younger generation.This was the first time since watching the saga that I feel that the book was far better than the film. Hopefully the decision of expanding the last book into two films will make less stories to get lost.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince

Now my youngest is an avid reader and fantasy doesn't disappoint.Loved the teen romances at the castle. Lavender Brown's infatuation with Ron was really funny. And Ron and Hermione, Harry and Ginny start to become young couples.Part of the lure of the film is how these teens look after one another. They remind Harry that he can't go it alone. And they care about each other unless someone is stealing someone Else's boyfriend / girlfriend.The young love focus lightened some of the sinister mood from previous movies.

589,oray_watkins,Pleasantly Surprised,7,17 July 2009,"I am a fan of the Harry Potter books. Since the movies started coming out, I have not been a fan of them. None of the movies seemed to capture the feel of the book. They all seemed to get over-weighted by the arrogance of their own medium, focusing more on special effects and over-acting to get the story across. In Yates last installment wasn't stellar, though I had come to expect little, and got slightly more expected with that one.I had no intentions of seeing this movie in the theater, but when I brother, a die-hard Harry Fan, suggested it at the last moment, I decided to go. I expected another mediocre movie, but I was pleasantly surprised.Unlike every other installment of the Potter movies, this one actually had the same feel as the book. You could feel the tension of a bunch of high-schoolers trying to survive school, while also trying to fight the dark powers. Every moment of the story was well done.Some highlights. First, the kids who played young Voldemort stole the show. Simply amazing with their acting. You got such a sense of violence, hostility, and repressed power from their acting. And yet, there was a veneer of sophistication. Second, Professor Slughorn was phenomenal. The actor brought one of the weaker characters from the books into a much stronger light. And, surprisingly, the trio of Potter, Granger, and Weasely did fabulously. They have really grown as actors in the past year. I was entirely surprised by how well they portrayed their characters. Finally, Malfoy's character displayed all the conflicted angst that was felt so palpably in the books. In fact, I think that the movie portrayed Malfoy's character better than the books did (a sign of any good adaptation, do something better than the book did. Not everything, but something).The cinematography was spectacular. This has always been an area where the Potter movies were lacking. But there are some stellar shots, especially of Draco. You could feel the sinister purpose that he had, while also seeing the struggle he has within is core goodness against his evil superego.The special effects were also stellar. When Potter and Dumbledore enter the memory world, I was stunned by the beauty of the special effects.Overall, this was a memorable movie experience, and the only one of the Potter series that is worth shelling out the dough to watch in the theaters. It is the only one I have rated above 5/10. Go check it out, you'll enjoy it.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
590,al_baby_1024,writer/director did not understand the story,3,21 July 2009,"Like a couple of the previous movies, this was adapted by someone who either didn't get the big picture of HP or just didn't care. They flex their CG muscles in ways that add nothing to the story and take time away from important story points. I understand that a movie is different than the book it is based on, there's no way around that. But this movie missed the mark on several MAJOR MAJOR points that are necessary to the story moving forward.Dumbledore did not fill Harry in on Tom Riddle's past and his personality. Without that how is Harry supposed to understand what objects were important enough to Riddle to turn into Horcruxes?Dumbledore did not fill Harry in with his own guesses about the Horcruxes. It would be kinda nice to know this too.We might have been able to see the core DA pals fight Death Eaters in the castle with fewer added in scenes that had nothing to do with the story being told; Harry picking up the waitress, the attack on the Burrow, the lake around the Horcrux, Bellatrix in the Great Hall.Harry would NEVER stand there watching while Dumbledore was surrounded by Death Eaters. That was just stupid. In the book, Dumbledore knew Harry was too impulsive and immobilized him to protect him.And the most MAJOR movie screw-up - Dumbledore surrendering to Malfoy. Immobilizing Harry distracted Dumbledore just long enough for Malfoy to disarm him. Malfoy defeating Dumbledore in combat is absolutely necessary for Harry to later be recognized as the master of the Elder Wand. Without Malfoy defeating Dumbledore then Harry defeating Malfoy, Harry doesn't beat Voldemort. Because the writer and/or director didn't understand or didn't care they just screwed the climax of the series.To the director of DH: We all know that digital effects are nearly perfect, you don't have to prove it to us.

We may not get every scene and every word that Rowling wrote, but this was definitely the closest we have come. The movie is better for it, as well.We have two movies left in the series, and seeing HP&HBP shows that we have hope to see the book well interpreted, directed, and acted.

592,draga94,Not as bad as i thought will be!!,8,19 July 2009,"I am a really big harry potter books fan, and I was looking forward to this movie for a long time. I had listened a lot of thoughts on this movie and they were rather bad. Therefore, i had prepared for a really really bad movie. But, I was wrong.Although there were a lot of unimportant scenes and a big part of the book left away from the movie, the film was very relaxing and very faithful to the book. I only regret for the big battle in the end of the book because it has been left away from the movie, but besides that, it was very good.I am aware of the fact that I have prepared for a really bad movie, and I ended up with a 2 and a half hours of quality spent time. I am very pleased that I haven't disappointed myself and i suggest that you too prepare yourself so you wouldn't leave the cinema screaming and kicking the Harry Potter poster in the entrance of the theater.8/10!!",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
593,iacon6,Excellent!,10,20 July 2009,"Nobody cares what you think. This is an awesome movie that I went to see over and over again! If you are so disappointed, go see the horrible Bay-formers and STFU. This is the best film of the summer and I guess that you don't understand how they translate an almost 652 pages book into a 2.5 hours of a brilliant film. Do you think you can make it better ? You think you have what it takes to make a harry potter film ? Well I don't know who you are, but something tells me that you can't! You are just a whiny fan boy who wants to hate everything they make. There were certain parts that I also wished they would include from the book, but they didn't and it was yet the second best Hp film. The best one so far was ""The order of the Phoenix"". Besides nobody cares what people in India think. Nuff' said!",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
594,ohmysim,Worth a watch - It's just one interpretation,7,16 July 2009,"Overall, an interesting and entertaining interpretation of arguably the best (and my personal favourite) book in the Harry Potter series. I really enjoyed the film, though on reflection it might be connected to the fact that I have not read the book in over a year, and forgot parts of it.I think if you can distance the films from the books, and enjoy how some amazing scenes such as Dumbledore's first meeting with Tom Riddle, the cave, Quidditch, etc, have been brought to life on screen, this film is a must-see. The cast have definitely matured, and it's great to see Ron and Hermione getting more screen time. The film has pace and is exciting with some amazing special effects. There is also a lot of warm-hearted humour, particularly in the scenes with Lavender Brown and Ron, and also McLaggen, which I felt was necessary to balance the films darker tone. It is after all, marketed as a family film.However, anyone who has read the book will know that Voldemort's back-story is both core to the plot, and one of the book's most exciting aspects. This was skimmed over, especially the explaining of the Horcruxes -- the subtlety and complexity of the world that JK Rowling has created is underplayed dramatically. The book allows the reader to have a relationship with every character, where as the films seem to have selected characters to focus on at random. In the Deathly Hallows, viewers who have not read the book are not going to feel the emotional pull elicited by the deaths of much-loved characters, e.g. Tonks and Lupin, because they have not been given the weight on screen that they deserve. The Inferi were also a let-down, being faceless, computer-generated skeletons rather than the truly terrifying, white-fleshed corpses of differing ages and gender.My only other issue was the glossing over of Dumbledore's death. He is Harry's personal mentor and beloved friend. I was outraged that the audience was not even given a real chance to mourn him; Fawkes' lament and the white funeral ended the novel in a sombre, emotional way. A two-minute scene of Harry saying he isn't going back to Hogwarts undermines the significance of Dumbledore's death and the imminence of Voldemort's return to power. The underlying sense of paranoia and fear surrounding Voldemort's return has clearly been diluted to suit a younger audience, a mistake, I feel.Despite my personal criticisms, I still maintain that it is a great film and one of the most enjoyable I've seen this year.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
595,annoyingryan,"Overly compressed, but still good...",7,17 July 2009,"It was a blissful Thursday night when I went to the theatre eagerly anticipating the new Harry Potter movie. Luckily, the theatre was not overly packed, and I sat down with my customary pack of nachos and sprite to watch an interesting, but flawed movie.Firstly, the negatives. Those who have read the novels will notice inconsistencies and omissions. Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince is known for its flashbacks intended more to explore Lord Voldemort's past than to resolve some conflict or pursue some hidden truth. In fact, the Harry Potteresque plot involving Draco Malfoy being 'up to something' is not only revealed early on (as opposed to being kept mysterious), it's relegated almost to subplot status. In this movie, numerous flashbacks are omitted. Certain information key to the next movies' plot is left out, but by no means all of it.Secondly, the ending. The vast majority of the action is omitted. However, I considered this a good thing, as the 'excitement' was slightly convoluted in my opinion; but I feel this is a minority opinion, and thus is included in the negatives. Certain key subcharacters to this 'excitement' are better left to the notoriously dark seventh novel; at least the living embodiment of this 'excitement' managed a cameo appearance.Thirdly, while the novel certainly has its fair share of romantic interaction, the movie seemed intent on translating every last scrap of it to the big screen. In the novel, the presence of the teenage romance is diluted by the vastness of the novel itself. In a movie where everything else is condensed, this makes the recreations have distinct prominence. There is immense comedic value to be had from the numerous instances of teenage romantic blundering, but the 'feel' of the 5th, 6th and especially 7th are intended to be extremely dark. Numerous instances of romance could've been omitted for the sake of atmosphere.Now the positives!Numero uno is Tom Felton, the actor responsible for Draco Malfoy's translation to the big screen. His acting eclipses the feeble attempts of the other child stars, though the three main characters have developed quite a chemistry together. I see an actor who could easily break through his Harry Potter days into mainstream acting.Secondly is the 'cave scene'. The entrance of certain creatures is masterfully done. The tension is literally tangible. ... Okay, I admit it: I jumped.Thirdly is the fellow who portrayed Professor Slughorn. The nuances of the character are fleshed out wonderfully by the talented actor.Fourthly is the 'death' scene. I'm not going to spoil it. Just know that it is very nicely done.Fifthly is Bellatrix. Could anyone have found a better actress to portray this crazy chick?On a final note, despite my concerns regarding its content and overly compressed nature, I do feel it was one of the best movie adaptations in the Harry Potter universe. 7/10",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
596,tojofriends,David Yates fails again...,5,5 August 2009,"I understand that The Half Blood Prince has got a high score IMDb and an exceptionally good rating at Rottentomatoes but I will explain my reasons in detail for rating it so lowly.I went to the hall with a lot of expectations for this one cause in my opinion The Half Blood Price(which I will frequently refer as HBP) was the best novel by JKR in the entire Harry Potter series. And I was truly disappointed after watching the entire movie. The reason behind calling HBP to be the best writing delivered by JKR is because of the maturity of this book. It no longer has the sense of a kid story, it isn't so action packed like order of the phoenix but it has an injected sense of never ending suspense and thriller which puts it in a different position than the other books. But sadly the movie failed to reflect the gifts of the book.At the end of movie in credit it shows ""based on HBP written by JKR"". It should have started with ""very loosely based on HBP..."". In the entire movie most focus was given on the teenage doubts and dilemma in romantic interests of the trio (Which by the way was also loosely followed). This book is about preparing Harry for a greater battle, where Dumbledore himself begins to enlighten Harry about the deepest secrets of Lord Voldemort which ties him to this living world and how to break those anchors of immortality. But in this movie you will find that became a secondary objective. I mean Dumbledore doesn't show Harry the very two crucial memories where Voldemort takes possession of three of the horcruxes. His particular affinity towards specific magical instruments was totally not mentioned, also Dumbledore doesn't inform Harry about any of the other horcruxes. On the top of these at the Lightning Struck Tower (where Dumbledore was killed) Harry hides instead of being immobilized. Now what the hell? why Harry would hide and do nothing to save the man he so much admired? And also Dumbledore willingly allows Draco Malfoy to disarm him putting another serious hole for Deathly Hallows where it is clearly mentioned that Draco mastered the elder wand because he disarmed Dumbledore against the later's will.Perhaps the most disturbing event would be showing the burning of burrow. I mean why the hell two death eaters(only two) would charge at burrow, luring Harry into wilderness and do nothing to him !!! I mean at least they should have kidnapped him as thousand of opportunities were there. But instead they burned the burrow which had no value. It was a poorly decorated old house of the Weaslys with no important valuables in it, why would hey Death Eaters burn it??? As you can see a lot of unnecessary scenes were added and very crucial ones were impressively forgotten.About performance of the casts... what can I say? nothing special. Daniel Radcliff's performance was unmoving as usual. However both Ron Weasly(Rupert Grant) and Lavender Brown managed to do a good job. Rupert Grant was enjoyable in portraying the comic side of Ron. I also expected a lot from Jim Broadbent as Horace Slughorn was an indeed very interesting character but again no pleasure came from watching him.However the actions scenes were nice. The journey in and out of the cave was visually spectacular. Perhaps the best scene would be the dissolving of the dark mark(which wasn't in the book but no complain here), tiny lights from all the wands combining together to form an aura which penetrates through the dark mark in the cloudy sky forcing it to vanish.So I guess you can see why I didn't like the movie(particularly the script). It didn't follow the book mostly. Where JKR herself wrote the book she provided an excellent script within the book. All the director had to do is to follow it. You will also notice that both David Yates's Harry Potter movies(Oder of Phoenix and HBP) slides away from the fundamental foundations of the books. All the first four movies however closely followed the respective books and were indeed very entertaining. I just hope he doesn't make a mess of things for the two parts of Deathly Hallows.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
597,oojjcorp,It was a teenage drama in magic world.,3,16 July 2009,"It was big disappointment for us.It count me and my three friends, who visited this movie. Movie started with some black fog is going over London bridge, and there is chaos all over.Those are same scenes which you have watched in movie trailers, but those were the only scenes which had some actions in them. Other wise it was movie where some girl is after Ron, Hermione is in love with Ron, So everybody is after Ron, and here comes the savior Harry who saves Ron by a deadly love potion.And guess what our time is running out, so director just arranges a climax which everybody knows, so there is no need to watch this movie if you have watched trailers.Only time i felt it paid our money back, when Hermione was in party with Harry behind curtains.She was looking hot.Other wise leave it.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince

I think that's unavoidable, because in the books you can read how harry was feeling, understand it better and so on. However; as a disappointed fan of twilight, I kind of saw it coming- that the movie would be less thrilling than the trailer. Don't get me wrong, the movie was amazing. Its just, I expected better. I think they should have stuck to the book a tiny bit more. I mean, they could have added the part where the gryffindors win the cup and Ginny and harry kiss there. They could have added more dialogue in the scenes with harry and dumbledore- this was the most disappointing, I expected the relationship to grow more than they showed. My favourite scenes, however, were- one, when Hermione was crying and harry was literally her shoulder to cry on. Two, when harry drank Felix felicis and saw slughorn in the greenhouse. Three, when the bridge was falling- amazing effects. Finally, when harry was being dragged down the lake.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
599,jesse_hitz,"Too long, Too Boring.",4,16 July 2009,"I'm not by any means a fan of Harry Potter. I was invited by friends to go catch the sold out show at the theater for a night out. I have read the first three Harry Potter books when i was younger but gave up soon after. I have only seen the first two movies and then this one.This movie follows the same premises as every other Harry Potter. The dark wizard is still not dead and once again looking at coming to power. Pretty much it follows the same premises of the first movie. There are many plot holes in this film that make no sense and i will leave it to the forums to explain that. The movie is quite long and very boring not much happens and at the end it turns out they knew what would happened and it all is a big waste of time.Clearly J.K. Rowling wrote this series as a huge cash grab after the success of her first novel targeted at teens. (Much like twilight) and she follows the same premises as the first part of the story. Not much new happens and they try to make the characters more interesting by giving them girl problems etc.The acting is so bad in this series it's not even funny. Daniel Radcliff is so bad he is the new Mark Hamill. He will never play in another movie other than Harry Potter. The editing is also terrible in this film. The only thing that remotely saves this film is the wonderful CGI, and effects. Very poor summer movie but I'm sure i will do great and the kids will love it.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
600,sam-carter-n-the-toon,The Films Could Have Been Great,3,15 July 2009,"Why is it that they can't make a half decent Harry Potter film? You'd think that with the excellent cast (minus a few which i wont name, yet it is obvious who i mean) and the money they have they'd make brilliant movies but instead they have made 'cheesy' piles of crap which miss out so many important things from the books. As a huge fan of the books i was expecting to see, at least, the story to follow the book well and for the films to be, like the author intended, the films to be dark and to be aimed at adults as well as children. Sadly however this is not the case.This film looked very good on the adverts and i went in expecting it to be so. But all the film was, was cheesy love scenes and a very rushed, very NON-DRAMATIC ENDING! I find myself hoping that these films are re-made in the not too distant future and that they are much darker and follow the book well.

The new minister of magic Rufus Scrimgeour wasn't mentioned and where is bill Wesley and Fleur ? The great battle in the end, the memories of Voldemorts family ,and when he was interested in getting a job in Hogwarts, the funeral etc... I didn't see any of that.And i readed the book more that three times and i don't remember Harry meeting a girl in the train station or the death eaters attacking the Weasleys House, and it was not Luna who found Harry in the train it was Tonks.If you didn't readed the books maybe you will enjoy this movie but if you readed i believe you going to be disappointed.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
602,jake_vogelsang,my harry potter and the half blood prince review,10,22 July 2009,"for some one who hasn't read the book but watch all the films i must say this is this best harry potter film yet much darker, much more humour and more insight into the world of harry potter.And as always (as in the previous films) the cast are terrific you couldn't choose better actors and the directing wasn't bad but i think Mike Newell did a great job with harry potter and the goblet of fire.if like me you saw the film in the first few day's of release then you would have experienced an absolutely breathtaking movie experience every seat in the cinema was full (i mean every seat).conclusion - harry potter 6 (my rating 5/5 pure entertainment) is a magical and intense thrill ride and every knows (that the books are usually ten times better than the films) but with harry potter they seem to just get there in the end",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
603,urp-don,Fans need be disappointed,1,17 July 2009,"There's less of magic and tricks in the sixth instalment of the Harry Potter series, fans need be disappointed -- it offers a heavy dose of drama, romance and humour rather than the plot. Strangely the teenagers of Hogwarts are shown spending more time sorting out their adolescent problems, flirting and pouting. While Harry finds himself attracted to Ginnie Weasley (Bonnie Wright), Ron, much to the dismay of Hermione (Emma Watson), is besotted with Lavender Brown (Jessie Cave). The mood of the film is mostly dark and director David Yates creates an atmosphere of depression and melancholy by showing dense clouds and rain throughout the narrative, making it gloomy compared to the previous versions. In terms of content, nothing much is revealed, though suspense is built up when Draco Malfoy (Tom Felton) is often shown sneaking around forbidden corridors and secret chambers of the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Also, the development of the plot in the film version does not justify the title ""Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"". The story shows that Harry stumbles upon a book on potions in the laboratory of Horace Slughorn (Jim Broadbent), a new bumbling professor of potions. The book belongs to the Half-Blood Prince and it helps him in experimenting and successfully making a potion. But Ginnie thinks he has had enough of the book and hides it.This time the story also bids adieu to one of the most important and adorable characters of the series, leaving Harry all alone to fight off the evil Voldemort. Also, professor Severus Snape (Alan Rickman) turns villain.The film has no scary moments...like when Harry and his friends are attacked in a field by Death Eaters and when Professor Albus Dumbledore (Michael Gambon) takes Harry to a seaside cave.Although nothing much is revealed or explained compared to earlier films, the plot has unsuccessfully set up for a perfect stage for the last and final installment of the wizard franchise. It is not must watch for die-hard Harry Potter fans as it disappoints totally.P.S.-BORING, AWFUL, TERRIBLE HARRY POTTER MOVIE. WORST MOVIE OF THE MOVIE SERIES. THE LAST IHE MOVIE SHOULD BE DIRECTED BY Mike Newell (Who Directed Goblet of Fires of the series) AND NOT David Yates (Who Directed this Movie)",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince

He is lead by his favorite Dumnbledore through various death defying twist and turns in and outside Hogwart. And this time he doesn't get the company of his friends who are more busy in their adolescent infatuation. The menacing presence of Lord Voldermort is absent this time which is a thing to be missed in the movie.Though the evil part is played by Draco Malfoy and Professor Snape.

605,kathiasousa,Why re-write a classic?,5,21 July 2009,"The movie was great, by itself, if you know nothing about the books, and know nothing of what's to follow. It was funny, and the 3-D start was highly entertaining. The destruction caused by the death eaters was well interpreted. But it was annoying to see Harry try to pick up a muggle chick in a common diner, and sitting there with the daily prophet, no less, for all muggles to see. It was disappointing not to see Dumbledore taking down the Dursleys', it was sad that there was no mention of Sirius's legacy and Kreacher since all that comes up in the next movie. It was ridiculous to have Luna actually find Harry on the train with her ""wrackspurt""-seeing glasses and ignore the fact that Dumbledore had placed Aurors all over for protection. Its not like Tonks wasn't in the movie and wasn't available to take her place in the train scene! There was nothing to justify her calling Remus ""sweetie"" out of the blue either. It was also sad that there's no mention at all of poor Bill and Fleur, specially since he got nearly killed in the battle that never made it on screen. Also, I am intrigued to know how Harry is going to set about trying to find the horcruxes in the next movie when he has no idea where to start- The ridiculous scene of the burrow burning down could have been replaced by another memory for instance, Tom Riddle tracing out Hufflepuff's cup and the locket. There was No explanation of the ring whatsoever or where Dumbledore managed to get it and destroy it. Do the viewers ever find out why no teacher has ever lasted more than a year as Defense against the Dark Arts? How is harry going to imagine that one of the horcruxes is hidden at Hogwarts when he has no idea that Tom Riddle ever came back there? Can anyone explain why Bellatrix and those other death eaters were even required to show up in the end if there wasn't going to be a battle? Also, please explain how Harry took on a personality change by obligingly hiding below and watching silently as Draco aimed a threatening wand at Dumbledore? How much more would it have cost to have him wear the cloak and be 'petrified' by the old man so he really had no choice? Hermione was made to look extremely giddy-headed when she lightly slipped past the topic of Dumbledore's untimely death with her ""oh Harry, Ron doesn't mind about you and Ginny as long as you don't snog in front of him!"" What about Harry's talk with Ginny explaining why he couldn't be with her anymore? Definitely not the best movie in the series, and that's saying something because reading the book makes it hard to imagine so much can go wrong!",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
606,FemaleSmells,"I loved it, despite the flaws.",9,20 December 2009,"First of all, I am a MASSIVE Harry Potter fan, but that doesn't mean I'm saying the following just because I love the series so much.Harry Potter 6 is one of my new favourite movies ever. The acting was significantly better than the previous movies (I actually believed Emma's scenes, Dan has greatly improved and I'm beginning to think there's no more room for improvement where Rupert is concerned, and Helena is always always always fantastic). The cinematography was beautiful. It was much funnier than the other movies (I even laughed at the vomit-scene, which was partially off-screen, though I still usually hate this kind of humour.). The effects were amazing. This movie is near-perfect and I loved-love-LOVED it.However (this is a huge However), I wish they followed the book more. I felt that the random fire-burning scene was unnecessary. I don't even know why they added that, it was completely pointless (Bellatrix's craziness could've been incorporated in the fight-scene-that-should've-been). I was slightly annoyed by the fact that Matthew L only had about 3 or so lines. And I wish they featured Bill and Fleur's romance and more memories.But in spite of it all, it's an awesome movie.

607,dasha-29,So sorry to say,8,19 July 2009,"I'm really sorry to say this, but I feel, that the director of this movie doesn't have enough talent to work on it. The book itself is so great, actors are amazing, visual effects, music, everything. But all this turns into already second week and boring movie, which leaves no memories or emotions whatsoever.If I was a person, who had never heard of Harry Potter and the first movie I saw about him was Half Blood Prince - I would never even want to learn anything more about him. It is so week and emotionless. It feels as if director simply does what he's paid for - no passion, no talent. Really sorry to say this.I just remember how wonderful and exciting and magic 3rd and 4th movies were. They made me love Harry Potter. And I'm so sorry to realize, that the last 2 movies would be created by the same person. Nothing to expect.I do believe that director makes the movie. And this one was left not loved, not cared about, not felt through. Since the 5th part these movies became simply part of the line. Next one, next one, next one. I wish there would be made by someone, who can see what Harry Potter books are about, what their message is, but not trying to make another standard not remarkable movie.I'm sure David Yates is a nice and good person, but it's so unfortunate he has become a director for Harry Potter films.

608,redadust,Heart Wrenching,9,15 July 2009,"The Harry Potter series has definitely had my interest since the beginning. I bought my ticket for this film a month in advance, and when I arrived opening night at 9:45 PM there was already a line. The Half-Blood Prince is without a doubt the best film yet in my opinion. Though it did not strictly follow the book, the film adaptation was amazing. This film relies on the viewers assumption of certain events, since conveying every detail the book contained would result in a 15 hour movie. Nonetheless, the director did very well in including the essential parts, the guts if you will, that make the Harry Potter series what it is. This film, however, had a separate feel from the rest of the series.The Half-Blood Prince is probably the most dramatic of the series, and contains the largest climax of all the other Harry Potter films. I don't want to spoil it, so get out there and see it! The actors were great as usual; the score was heart wrenching; the CGI was great, though not as abundant in this film, or so it appears. But have no fear: it is packed with comedy, but since the actors and characters are aging some of the humor is intended for late teens and adults. The trio is growing up and this film is packed with teen drama like relationships, crushes, jealousy etc. The film is great, go and see it.If you loved the first 5 you'll be infatuated with The Half-Blood Prince. It is one of the best adventure/fantasy films I've ever seen!",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
609,holko,Review Harry Potter six,7,14 July 2009,"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince's opening scenes are marked by the chaos and confusion permeating both the Muggle and wizard communities as they experience acts of terrorism via Voldemort's army of Death Eaters, free from the shackles of Azkaban and eager to wage war for their master. The fancy of years gone by has been replaced by a general feeling of unease as prominent members of the wizarding world go missing, their businesses left destroyed or abandoned. Rumors suggest Dumbledore (Michael Gambon) is getting too old and possibly too senile to offer protection strong enough to defend against The Dark Lord, and parents question whether Hogwarts is still the safest place for their children. Magic has irrevocably made the leap from pretty lights and the odd hex to a weapon of mass destruction in the wrong hands. War, hormones, and dark magic equal a better-than-average year for the students of Hogwarts, and the best Potter movie since Prisoner of Azkaban.Burgeoning love is very much the new character in this film; the chaste smooches and not-so-subtle hints of mutual attraction have given way to unbridled make-out sessions and scorned teens in all their glory. Even Dumbledore wants the scoop. Ron (Rupert Grint) and Hermione (Emma Watson) make a modicum of progress in their tumultuous relationship, while Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) pines for Ginny (Bonnie Wright) and occasionally bathes in his own popularity, possessing a cockiness far removed from the wide-eyed innocence of earlier films. The series is first and foremost a fantasy, not a romance, though hints of sex within the hallowed halls of Hogwarts give the teens a quality of realness, and add to the sense of easiness the young actors have developed among themselves after spending much of their own adolescence on the sets of Potter films. The elder actors steal the show, as per usual — Snape (Alan Rickman) is meaner, scarier, funnier, and more unfathomable then he's ever been, while prickly McGonagall's (Dame Maggie Smith) strict nature is infused with the subtle but deep-rooted loyalty for which she is known and loved in the books. It's Jim Broadbent's turn as newly appointed potions teacher Horace Slughorn, however, that gives the Hogwarts teachers the distinction they deserve. Broadbent, as Slughorn, embodies the combination of ego and charm inherent in those members of Slytherin house who haven't fallen in step with Voldemort's anti-Muggle beliefs.Michael Gambon's portrayal of Dumbledore, unfortunately, remains too aloof and stern to capture the loving, albeit conflicted relationship between headmaster and student. His private lessons with Harry seem disjointed and abrupt; oddly, he seems more compassionate toward Tom Riddle (aka Young Voldemort) in a series of flashbacks meant to enable Harry to understand the nature of his enemy. Inexplicably, all of Harry's interactions with Dumbledore are sudden and somewhat confusing. Everyone, whether or not they've read the Potter series, will leave this film knowing who likes whom, but far fewer will understand how Harry and Dumbledore wound up in a mountainside cave hunting for pieces of Voldemort's soul; and fewer still, unless they've really been paying attention, will grasp the profundity of Fawkes the Phoenix's departure from Hogwarts. When it came to Harry's destiny and the fate of humankind versus high school love triangles, well, it sure seems like humankind got shortchanged.The Potter film franchise has never struck a proper balance between pleasing both casual moviegoers and ardent book lovers, and Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince is no exception. The good news is that it comes closer than any of its predecessors, hitting the mark or coming close to it on almost all fronts. With Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows being split into two films, the final installment stands an excellent chance of getting it right.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
610,ccgibs3196,A major disappointment,2,15 July 2009,"As an avid reader of the HP book series, and a devout HP movie fan, the sixth installment came up short in almost every aspect of the film.From a purely cinematographic point of view, the dialogue was rushed, the almost non-existent plot focused too much on minor relationships and details, and none of the scenes elicited the response intended. It was difficult for a scene to last one minute, let alone thirty seconds. The climax was not given enough time to fully develop, and the story ended so abruptly even I was left with a sense of confusion. I cannot imagine how anyone who has not read the books could have followed the plot line at all.When viewing the film with the book fresh in mind, the movie fell so far below expectations it is the greatest disappointment movie-wise to date. The team managed to take a complex, intricate, well-written novel and turn it into a fast-pasted, over-hormonal, and unemotional movie. When I think of the Half Blood Prince, I think of the main purpose to be getting horcruxes, not getting laid. When I initially heard about the fake scene at the Burrow I had an open mind, and figured it would play into the plot. After viewing however, I can only see it as a waste of time, because the only character it introduced was Greyback, but you never heard of him again through the entire movie until the very end--in which he did nothing.The fact that the battle at Hogwarts was left out gives the whole movie an anti-climatic feel. The movie barely even hits on Voldemort's past or what horcruxes are, and the cave scene was dry and unemotional. Dumbledore's death and Snape's betrayal did not elicit any response from me or any of my peers that saw the movie with me. At the end of the movie the audience should be lamenting Dumbledore's horrific death, but the movie moved so fast it was hard to truly wrap your mind around one scene before another began.All in all I found this movie horribly disappointing. The only actor who I saw any significant improvement in was Emma Watson, everyone else seemed cold and unattached. I sincerely hope the seventh movie will be better.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
611,dawgman67,VERY VERY VERY disappointing,7,19 July 2009,"OK, after the Order of the Phoenix I read all 7 of the books. After reading or even during reading them I was disappointed with how the movies were made. But this by far was the worst. I even briefly thought about leaving. I can understand not having the Dursleys in. They didn't add a lot to the book anyway and I knew the battle scene at the end was left out (apparently Yates thinks the fans are sooo stupid they would get confused with the battle scene in the next movie) but the rest was just pitiful. In the book where Harry and Ginny kiss was far better. They left out so many of the memory clips and it was a bit confusing (as in what was that ring for...I know but if you haven't read the books you wouldn't).I will have to read the book again (even though I reread it a couple months ago) to see where the Burrow gets burned down. Why because it Didn't freakin happen. And what was that with Luna finding Harry on the train. The only time you see Tonks is at Christmas and there is no back story or hint of the relationship with Lupin other then her ""honey"" comment. And last but not least the end scenes...OK forget about the battle scene...but why take away the importance of Harry being petrified when Draco was confronting Dumbledore. Also they leave out something so grand as the funeral (though I suspect it will be in the opening of the next movie).Just a VERY VERY VERY disappointing movie.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
612,wmgervasi,Do not understand why Yates felt the need to rewrite the story,6,19 July 2009,"This movie was a serious disappointment to me, and it makes me worry that with the last two movies in the same director's hands that we are losing our beloved series to capricious and seemingly random rewriting. Did JK Rowling have any input into this one? Will she return to the set to try to recover control in the final segments of the story? I sure hope so.The changes to the climax were not only unnecessary, as other reviewers have said, but diminished the impact significantly. Why were the Death Eaters even there only to have no role whatsoever in what transpires? Only so they could watch from the sidelines? This made the story thread regarding the vanishing cabinets nearly irrelevant.My second criticism is far less serious, but the movie nearly dragged on with the teen romance threads. I would have traded 15 minutes of those bits for more detail from the book regarding Voldemort's history.On the plus side, Gambon did a wonderful job with Dumbledore, the best of the series. Bravo!My hope is that Yates has people monitoring these comments and comes to his senses. He did a fantastic job with Order of the Phoenix, which I rate among the best of the HP movies, so I know he is capable of better.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
613,some_dude_x,A mess,3,10 August 2009,"What a mess!!Not worth seeing,not even comparable to the book. HP6 is my favorite but that movie messed it all up. Awful plot,almost no events and not related to the book.HP5 film sucks but it was bearable but the next one is too much.1.Nothing about Scrimgeour.2.Nothing about the O.W,L's results.3.Nothing about the fact that Harry knew Snape was the one who led Voldemort to the Potters.4.NO dramatic ending.5.NO conversation between Harry & Ginny during the funeral.The movie is too cold and doesn't contain enough emotions",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
614,guitarext88,"HP and the Half Blood Prince, (not the book, just a crappy movie)",3,18 August 2009,"What can I say on behalf of this movie that let me down so hard and infuriated me so much? Slughorn was a good actor, Lavender was funny, and they finally got rid of the worst Dumbledore possible..... that's about it.Aside from the normal horrendous interpretation of great moments in the book and intense parts of the story displayed in the other movies, the real point of this piece of the Harry Potter story was completely shat upon and discarded. In fact The whole point of the whole story was mutilated by what the director, (if you can call him that), and script writers did to the plot of this book. The real point of this book is for Dumbledore to familiarize Harry with Voldemort's past life and past deeds leading to his many horcruxes and behavior traits. Dumbledore shows Harry a series of important memories from various witches and wizards, and a house elf that will give harry some kind of clue as to what the horcruxes might be. The point of this book is really a lead up to the 7th book.I cannot even touch the ridiculous movie they made from this amazing book. There is no wonder, there is no chance to see the real might of the characters, they leave out only important parts and characters, there are only stupid romances,(made even more unbearable by the cliché moments and horrible acting of Ginny and Hermione), and create stupid little scenes and unimportant fodder that attempts to create a shadow of the Harry-Slughorn story. In fact I found the whole movie to be based on Harry trying to get the memory from Slughorn. This is important in the book, but it is only really confirmation for what Dumbledore already guesses, (a.k.a. not a huge part). The fact that they leave the Gaunt memory and the Hufflepuff cup/ Slytherin locket memory out is enough to ruin this movie. I have no idea how they will make the 7th movie without these important memories. When Dumbledore died I was done with this movie because it was so anticlimactic. I should have left after that too because the ending of this movie has to go down as one of the worst in history. Here is a list of the many strike outs in this movie.-Death eaters apparently can fly -They skip Dumbledore explaining why Harry has to go back to the Dursleys -Fenrir Greyback makes a cameo in the movie -The Weasleys house gets burned down by flying death eaters -What are inferi? The dead people in the cave underwater? huhuguffaw -There is no need for Snape to reveal he is the Half Blood prince the book is hardly in the movie -Whats Harry's punishment for slicing open and almost killing Draco? -Where's Dobby and Hagrid the whole movie? -they skip Voldemort asking for a job at Hogwarts -Subtlety is thrown to the wind when they reveal Ron and Hermione are definitely gonna get together -Harry can't act -I guess Harry can hang out in the subway while the Order constantly tries to protect him, Chick in the pizza shop? Gimme a fu@$ing break -No mention of the Order of the Pheonix -I guess they Forgot Sirius died -Bellatrix is not a powerful witch she is a two year old that can't talk loud and cackles at stupid s#it. -Classic 'are you serious' moment* - Harry says to Dumbledore something like: ""So horcruxes can be...."" and Dumbledore replies something like: ""Yes, they can be anything a bit of garbage or a pail, now you see the problem we face."" .....WTF! complete contradiction to the book, thats portkeys harry! portkeys.* and another moment: After seeing the Slughorn memory Dumbledore says: ""This is beyond anything I could have imagined"" AHHHHHHHHThere are so many more I can't even bear to remember. I hate this movie. I hope after some time someone who has read the books can remake these terrible movies. It is very obvious to me now that unless they are big name actors that have acted in many awesome American movies British people should not be allowed to act in movies. They should find people that can fake the accent. To all those who have read the books and are shocked at how bad the movies are I feel your pain. To all those that haven't read the books and really like the movies I feel very bad for you, you have missed out on one of the best stories ever. These movies are certainly the worst book to movie adaption there has ever been.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
615,jamnsmit-540-250491,"Leaving the Book Aside, the Best Potter Movie Yet",7,22 November 2009,"Since midnight on July 15 it has been clear that people around that world have been eagerly awaiting an update in the Harry Potter saga. The fact that nearly everyone in the theater already knows what is about to happen doesn't seem to matter much. The movie pulled in the largest ever midnight showing box-office revenues and smashed through the opening weekend coming out, unsurprisingly, on top. Little if any of this was unsuspected. What was unsuspected was the vast difference between critical reviews and Potter fan reviews. The critics loved the film and Rowling book lovers, in large part, were not impressed. The problem, I think, lies in the fact that avid Potter readers walk into the theater and expect to see every plot point covered in the 652 page book portrayed on screen—in less than two and a half hours. It's simply not possible.Adapting a novel for the screen is about choosing what has to be left in, what has to be taken out, and what the story needs to fill the holes. I say this as someone who has never thought about adapting a novel for any reason let alone to add movie to the most successful movie franchise in Hollywood history. The point is however, The Half-Blood Prince is the mostinternal, if you will, of the books in the saga. Large parts of the action in the book happen inside Harry's Head. Harry struggling with his emotions towards Ginny, Harry's curiosity about the actions of Malfoy, and Harry's struggle to put the pieces of Dumbledore (or more accurately Voldemort's) tale together. It's difficult to portray all of these things without a drastic departure from the rest of the movie series. All that to say that I think Steve Kloves did a decent job considering the type of story with which he was working. But most of all, Potter fans should know by now that the films and books are two very different species and expectations from one should not be carried over to the other—it's simply unfair.Stepping away from the book, this movie is the best in the Potter series by far. In fact, I'd even go so far as to say that this movie, without it's potter support, is stand alone a well crafted and entertaining movie. The series has grown and the actors have certainly matured from the days when Christopher Columbus was at the helm, but that's to be expected as they are some 10 years older. Excellent portrayals are to be seen from all sides and Rupert Grint and Tom Felton turn in their best performances to date showing that they have been drastically underused in previous installments.In past movies, Grint has done little more than whimper at appropriate times (when confronted with spiders, crashing a car, the idea of Sirius Black, the mention of You-Know-Who's proper name, Vampires, Bad Dress Robes, and so on). In this movie, Grint is finally given the chance to act. One of the most comic scenes in any of the seven books was brought to life beautifully—and hilariously—by Grint. On the Quiddich field, drugged by love potion, and suffering from an over attached girlfriend, Grint shows that he has comedy chops that could lead to a career outside of Hogwarts.For the past two movies, Felton has shown up only to remind the viewers that life at Hogwarts comes with a few warts. In this movie, through clever script manipulation, Felton as Malfoy plays the chosen one opposite Harry Potter. Draco Malfoy struggles with the task he has been chosen for by the dark side. Felton gives more than his usual sneers in this film, he is allowed to stretch, allowed to grow and due to this shows that he has range as an actor. Felton's portrayal of the struggling adolescent makes the viewer both despise Malfoy and pity him for the role he is struggling to fulfill.Then there are Daniel Radcliffe and Emma Watson who turn in their usual high-quality performances. Watson is heartbreaking to watch as she portrays heartbreak and Radcliffe takes comedic scenes and shows that it is no mistake that he is at the center of this mega hit.There are also the usual stellar British actors that provide sterling support for the young cast. Most of note in this film are Jim Broadbent who brings Professor Slughorn hilariously to life and Alan Rickman who makes it clear that there is no one else worthy enough to play Harry's chief Hogwart's foe.All in all, taking the film for what it is—a movie dependent on literary fans for success—the film is very good. It may never make the ranks of the best films of all time but it is what it is: a blockbuster—and a very worthy one at that.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
616,rainbowapplefizz,Good but...,8,29 March 2018,"I am a huge Harry Potter fan, so I was really excited to see the film version of this. There was a lot that I was looking forward to, and I was a little bit disappointed because most of the scenes that I would've liked to see on screen were omitted. That being said, the scenes that were there were fantastic. However, I am still a little confused even years later as to why Death Eaters burned down the Weasleys' home. I thought this films in a really good job with showing the progression of the trio from children to basically soldiers. I think this is one of my favorite of the films simply because it was done so well.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
617,teknostalgia,An epic series deserves an epic movie.,5,15 July 2009,"I was looking forward to this. I do not read the books so i was expecting some gaps in the narrative (especially after Azkaban).I left the cinema underwhelmed, with an air of regret for getting myself excited at the prospect of seeing this much hyped movie. I felt that Draco Malfoy was VASTLY under-used, considering this was supposed to be partly about his descent into (even more) darkness. We didn't get to see Hagrid's reaction at the end, strange considering the respect evident between the two characters. Also Hagrid was crying over the (unexplained) death of his spider friend, but i don't recall him shedding one tear over the death of the greatest wizard alive.Snape says that Harry is wanted by Voldemort when Bellatrix wants to kill him, but leaves him lying on the ground in agony, when he could have kidnapped him then and there! Game over! No need for another movie! This is the magic equivalent of putting James Bond in an elaborate trap for him to escape from when one bullet to the head will do.I just felt there was too much focus on the love interests and nowhere near enough on the climax. I am well aware i should read the books, as i am sure i would get a greater understanding of the characters and plot, but a movie should stand up in its own right, whether you have read the books or not. I felt cheated and disappointed.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
618,heidirst,"Hormones, yes. Emotion, not so much.",5,1 October 2013,"I thought this movie was very entertaining, but the problem I had with it is there really wasn't any build up and there was no opportunity for me to be involved with the story.Things that were good: The Lavender/Ron/Hermione triangle. It was of course comical. But it was also more than that. There's a lot of emotion going on between these characters. Hermione is obviously upset by the relationship. Ron becomes obviously more and more annoyed with Lavender's antics. And Lavender is obviously jealous of Ron and Hermione's friendship. And it all ends beautifully with Ron whispering Hermione's name in the hospital wing and Lavender running off in tears.My point is that there's a lot going on here. It isn't just in the film for the sake of comic relief. It isn't just in the film because it's in the book. It's in the film to help you connect with these characters and to grow with them. It has depth to it. And most of the rest of the movie was lacking that.Also done well was Slughorn and the whole storyline with trying to get the memory from him. It was funny (Harry drinking Felix Felisis), it was touching (Slughorn's story about Lily), and it was cringe worthy (Harry – as appropriate – has no tact whatsoever). There's depth here, as well. It isn't there just for the sake of plot. It shows you the depth of the characters. It brings you into their stories and helps you to connect and understand them. As far as the rest of the film goes, it tries, but there are so many forgotten and half-way done subplots that it only almost works.Harry and Ginny. This is done really well for a good part of the movie and then it just falls flat. First off, Ginny is dating Dean. There's some cute scenes where Harry obviously has affections for Ginny and then she starts showing them back and then she kisses him and – OMG! Wait! Isn't Ginny dating Dean?! We're not told or shown that they break up at all. It's in the book that they break up – but as far as the movie's concerned, Ginny's cheating on her boyfriend. Anyway, they kiss, Harry opens his eyes and Ginny is gone. There's no explanation for this, and Ginny isn't seen again for the rest of the film. The movie just drops their relationship and forgets about it.The burrow. Half this scene worked really well. Harry tells the Order that Draco's working for Voldemort and Snape's a traitor, the Order doesn't believe him, there's a few cute/awkward moments between him and Ginny, and then Bellatrix and Greyback attack. As a scene by itself. It's was really kind of cool. You get to see the grown ups do some nice wand work against of the Fire Ring of Death, and Bellatrix and Greyback are scary, and OMG! The house is on fire! But then what? What does this accomplish? It's never talked about it later. And how does this show that no one is safe when the Death Eaters clearly lead everyone out of the house before setting it on fire? This is Greyback and Bellatrix that we're talking about! If any two Death Eaters were about murder and death, its them.The Death Eaters breaking into the castle. They don't do anything. They're at Hogwarts! This is something they have been trying to do since Voldemort's first rein! And now they're here and all they do is stand and watch Dumbledore die. There's no attack on anyone. Bellatrix does wreck some havoc by breaking a few shiny things. The rest of the Death Eaters just walk somberly out of the castle like they're embarrassed by her or something. You're Death Eaters! Go attack someone already! The Vanishing Cabinet – Draco's supposed to be really distressed over this thing. He's trying to fix it and he knows that if he fails, Voldemort will kill him. He's been trying to fix this thing for a year and no matter how hard he tries, it just won't work. We don't see any distress from Draco over that. We see him put things in the cabinet and pull things out, but we don't see him fret over it. It's like mild curiosity. Hmm, why is the bird dead? Hmm, why is half my apple missing? What we do see distress over is him cursing Katie and having to kill Dumbledore, which is brilliant and well done and good. In fact, Draco's story was done really well and should be could be counted as one of the good things in this film, but the Vanishing Cabinet seems like it was just put in there because it's in the book and no thought was put into it all.Dumbledore's death and Harry's reaction – didn't quite do it for me. The two are supposed to have a kind of father-son relationship but it wasn't built up enough. The movie tried. There were some nice moments: Dumbledore's hand on Harry's shoulder at the very beginning, Dumbledore apologizing for pulling Harry away from the girl. They were subtle and they did work. But then the film tries a little too hard. Dumbledore asking Harry awkward personal questions about his love life and Harry going, ""oh, no, no, that's all right"" doesn't equal father-son relationship. It just equals awkward.The ending. Not good. Hermione does all the talking and is the serious one and discusses all the changes to come while Ron just sits there and say nothing. They try to patch up the Harry/Ginny thing, but it's too lazy to work.In the end, this film will never be my favorite. The emotion is missing. I wasn't moved to care. In some areas it succeeds, but in most others it just falls flat.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince

From what I could see when this movie ended, the teenage girls in the crowd loved it. Everyone else was steaming mad they wasted money and time seeing this. There were a lot of negative comments from people as they flooded out of the theater.It doesn't start, end, reveal much of anything, have any real exciting or new scenes. The special effects were o.k but few and far apart.

622,ReismanM,Maybe the best Potter movie when viewed independently from the novel.,8,18 July 2009,"And perhaps one of the poorer adaptations. When I watch these films, I do my best to try to watch them completely independently from the books, despite the fact that I have read them all multiple times, as the missing details are always frustrating. In this case, it was a bit difficult to do, as there were seemingly a lot of missing details (some of which are reportedly being shown in the 7th installment, others just eliminated completely for ease and time's sake). If you sit and compare every single detail of the book with the films as you watch them, Half-Blood Prince will frustrate you quite a bit.However, the movie itself is probably the best one so far. The directing and special effects reach a new height of intrigue and do not disappoint at all. The biggest separator from past Potter movies is perhaps that the ""kids"" are now adults, and clearly rounding a corner in terms of their acting ability. I have always felt in past films, the kids try to too hard to create the mood of the scene that they just end up overacting. In this film, that is not the case, where all of the kids (maybe Evanna Lynch/Luna Lovegood the most) really do add to the scene and do a good job acting. Not to mention Jim Broadbent's performance as Horace Slughorn is very good and entertaining.Overall, as a film for fans of Harry Potter books and movies, this does not disappoint. Just do not get too critical of the missing or altered details, as they affect very little and only frustrate you.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
623,kaboomboomboom,Worth watching but could be better,6,15 July 2009,"The last couple of Potter films have done something that I felt the first two didn't achieve- leaving parts of the book out without rewriting them/allowing the audience to not believe they happened in this interpretation. This film went one step further and presented things that happened in between the lines in the books- for example the bridge and Cormac being slimy towards Hermione. However certain things that didn't occur in the book but were included in the film seemed unnecessary and there purely for blockbuster duties; the blowing up of the Burrow and Hagrids' hut.Unlike the other films, you could also tell that the scriptwriters knew what was going to happen in the final installments and were setting everything up for them.I think it was a good film but often went into soap-opera melodrama territory at times rather than the dark, emotional drama.Dumbledore's accent was also a bit distracting. I do love Gambon as an actor.Overall the scenes that translated directly from the book were wonderful, the scenes that were adapted from the book-quidditch, relationships and potions to name a few- were pretty great but the scenes created solely for the film were, a bit, irritating. The CGI was possibly the best it has ever been and the direction and script were both in good forms.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
624,kai_h138,"After creating one of the worst films in the series, Yates is able to redeem himself somewhat.",7,1 August 2009,"Order of the Phoenix had me worried about the state of the sixth film: the editing was haphazard and the pacing was off -- in general, the whole structure was poor. Luckily, Yates seemed to realize this as well, rectifying most of his mistakes in his second entry in the Harry Potter series. It almost reaches the quality of Prisoner of Azkaban (before falling greatly). The editing has improved, the cinematography has jumped in quality as well, the pacing for the first half is good and the writing and dialog is better; however, there are still downsides such as well.I've finally realized why the editing for the fifth film was dreadful: the editor was a person who has only edited television shows and movies, but the editor, Mark Day, seems to have had an epiphany (or he may have watched Azkaban), finally letting the takes breathe and flourish. The only poorly edited scene is when the Weasley's house is under attack. The camera work and editing come together to make a frenzy of a scene, confusing audiences -- it could've been handled different while still mimicking the character's confusion. The only good shot when Harry and Ginny was being attacked was the wide shot where the camera finally slowed down; unfortunately, that shot lasted for half-a-second before delving back into the mess. But overall, the editing has improved, helped greatly by the new cinematographer Bruno Delbonnel.Cinematography was not one of the strengths of Order of the Phoenix, relying on coverage of the scene rather than shooting what is wanted, but it has changed, thankfully. Half-Blood Prince channels Prisoner of Azkaban, employing the use of long takes for one or two scenes, and it's used to its fullest potential, as well as camera movements that go through glass. The camera, for the most part, remains moving and graceful, and framing/composition has improved to take advantage of the wonderful scenery as well. Some transitions were good as well. After Ron's party, Hermione and Harry are sitting on the stairs, and there's a wonderful transition that shows Ron and Lavender, Draco, and the passage of time to daylight. However, like other transitions, the problem is that it's too much of a change, making the audience believe that winter has ended, when, in fact, it hasn't. Such a big transition requires big events. The transition to winter was only okay, however, as it was subtle. A similar one in Prisoner of Azkaban was used, but it was to transition from class to a quidditch match. Lighting, however, has improved, opting for natural instead of by-the-book, three point lighting. Overall, it's better. There were times in the fifth film where the the camera becomes uncontrollably shaky or plainly still, but this time it's better.Another positive aspect is the pacing for the first half. The pace is fast enough to keep the audience interested, but it falls apart in the second half where it acts like an uncontrollable roller-coaster ride, almost crashing near the end -- the ending comes way too quickly. The attempt to keep the pace crazy hurts the story as well, as at the climax, Bellatrix Lestrange and group unexpectedly disappeared after setting the hut on fire, while the students appear out of nowhere to worship Dumbledore near the end. Had it been given time to transition, it would've been much better.A bigger improvement is with the writing, since Steve Kloves, who helmed the writing for the first four, replaces the screenplay writer of the fifth. Dialog is comedic when required, and the plot is smooth enough to follow. Furthermore, acting is a highlight.The acting of the cast barely falters, as each member impresses and invokes believability. There were no weak points. However, that ends the positives for the film.A major negative is Nicholas Hooper and his score. It's a slight improvement over his last, but the music during dialog was incredibly cliché. At times, music was non-existent, but at other times, it did not fit, especially during emotional moments where the simplicity hurts the film.Another dislike is the slow-motion fall of a major character, and the silent scream of a cursed girl, similar to the scream of Harry at the death of his godfather: they're awkward and in all instances, they made me laugh.Overall, Half-Blood Prince could've been equal in quality to Prisoner of Azkaban, but some negatives hurt it. It's certainly better than Order of the Phoenix though.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
625,Ziggyzorro,Outstanding film,10,20 February 2017,"This is where Harry Potter started to get seriously amazing again like it had with the Prisoner of Azkaban. I loved the book, but Half-Blood Prince nails the dreary, dreamlike atmosphere with a standout soundtrack by Hooper. Visually immersive, this shows what you want in a film adaptation, for it it to have all the cinematic bells and whistles and more. Film has it's own necessities and you simply can't think about the book when judging a film on it's own. You want it to be a complete work of art? Well this film looks like a Rembrandt painting and is perhaps one of the most comfy films ever created.In doing it's own thing, HBP a tone masterpiece and directed much tighter by Yates than Order of the Phoenix, which was also underrated and certainly so being his film debut. The acting is better, the cinematography by Delbonnel is arguably the best. The different ways chosen to light Hogwarts in this installment are very brooding and gives the castle it's own character, almost sticking out in the background a dark mark itself. It swallows the characters in times of stress. The latter third is perfect and the film builds very well, it's almost Harry and everyone's most normal year, yet it slowly goes to hell. I still remember how dire the cave scene felt in theaters. Gambon gives his best performance in the series. This is Fincher on steroids. David Yates has hit his stride.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
626,fghaeo,HBP was Verrrry Entertaining But.....,8,27 August 2009,"I went into this movie with no real expectations,though i was dying to see this since i read the book,now i really enjoyed this film a lot it was funny dark scary and sad all in one,a huge upgrade from the very dreary (though well made)OOTP,i will give this a 8 out of 10 simply because of the plot changes,there was absolutely no reason for them,especially giving away the ""Bad Guy"" at the beginning,of course we all knew about that, those of us that read the books,(almost everyone on planet earth)but they should have stuck to the book as much as possible,now one more point id like to make is that i didn't read the 6th book in quite a while so it was much easier for me to enjoy the film,because only main plot points were fresh in my mind,so i would really recommend NOT reading the book again before you watch it if possible,because if you do you will be way more disappointed with the film.Overall very enjoyable albeit the changed plot lines, Review written by someone who loved the first 2 films the most.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
627,emmo1992,Excellent film,7,22 July 2009,"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince IS a good film. I went to see it last night and was hugely impressed with the acting, cinematography, lighting, close-ups and editing. It was interesting but not difficult to follow. I think it's a huge step up from the previous films, definitely catering for the older audience. But...I can understand where the fans of the book are coming from. I've been reading the books since I was eleven, and there are several seemingly important story lines missing, as well as the charm and humour brought by JK Rowling. I am also a film school student however, and understand that sometimes even major cuts are necessary to keep the film fast-paced and catering to a wider audience. I think David Yates finally found that balance in this film, and while I would have liked to have seen a little more action, the dramatic moments certainly make up for it and it's likely DH will be full of action anyway. Everyone will go and see Harry Potter regardless, simply because it's Harry Potter, 'loosley based' on the novel, but still great films.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
628,bethswatch,"Entered apprehensive, left pleasantly surprised.",9,17 July 2009,"I went to see this having read many reviews--most professional critics were positive, while far more regular viewers were critical of the adaptation. To prep for the movie I re-read book 6 and book 7 last week, and so while I can appreciate that some people are upset at the changes to the details between the book and movie, I thought that the movie DID capture the essence of what the book was about--with the exception of the horcruxes (the details of where and what they were, was explained in sufficient detail in book 6, so that in book 7, this didn't necessarily have to be addressed, however their omission in the movie might mean that they will go into that in the DH-movie). As far as people complaining about the high school-ness of the movie, quite frankly, book 6 was all about the teenager-ness of the main characters (which I think makes their quest in DH that much more impressive).All in all, I enjoyed it for what it was.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
629,arjan-32,An uninspired recounting of the events from the book.,4,1 November 2009,"Sometimes, when a movie based on a book is filmed by people who love the book, understand it and want to only recast the story into the medium of cinema one ends up with a slightly different but no less compelling retelling of the same wonderful story. Example in case would be Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings trilogy where it is abundantly clear that he poured his heart and soul into the movies, that he was a humble admirer of the world that Tolkien shaped and that he treated the work with respect and dignity. The end result was a story that even the most die hard fans of the books could find little fault with.Such is not the case with Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince. Just like the previous movies it is made people who seem to have more affection for shooting a moneymaker with a guaranteed audience and merchandising than actually creating a cinematographic experience that stays true to the world created by Rowling. The scenes are rushed and hurried, actors simply uttering their lines rather than acting them out, glossing over details, missing the subtleties that could so easily be achieved had even the tiniest amount of effort been invested. Instead they seem content to simply recount the events of the book within their allotted time and be done with it. Stringing them together in an incoherent succession of snippets from the book hoping that eventually they will ""magically"" form a comprehensive story. In addition to this crucial events have simply been left out, neither Harry nor Snape get to exhibit their rage and pain about the events that happen, their final confrontation an incredible letdown.I don't want to blame the actors in this case, at times I can almost feel the better ones trying to break out of the confines that have been set upon them. Alan Rickman as always is utterly brilliant and makes the most out of the scenes that he has. Michael Gambon is the biggest miscast of these movies: instead of the gentle, kindly and wise Albus Dumbledore he seems intent on playing the bristly Gandalf the Wizard. The fact that he is allowed to play Dumbledore in this manner is all you really need to know about the director's dedication to and knowledge of the books. Robbie Coltrane's earlier magnificent performances as Hagrid are not repeated in this movie (nor in the last I may add), mostly I feel because of the shockingly poor scenes he is written into. In addition to the little screen time he receives it seems to have taken the fire out of him. In the earlier movies he was a giant, a greatheart, now he's just a man in a big suit.Other performances are not bad, Emma Watson notably stands out from the three main characters (as usual) but the brotherly bond between Rupert Grint and Daniel Radcliffe is quite noticeable on screen and adds a good deal of realism to the characters.In the end it's a fairly mediocre feature. It has some nice special effects but sadly the grand fight scene at the end was completely skipped and replaced by a halfhearted attempt at action in the middle of the movie. As a result the big suspenseful ending carried little weight and I felt decidedly untouched by it. Apathy seems to be the most positive feeling any fan of the books can take away from this movie. If you haven't read the books, the magic of the story might compel you to feel differently, but ultimately it falls significantly short of its true potential and in my mind will forever be a 'could have been'.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
630,Bond_911,Don't expect it to be the book... it's a nice watch!,8,15 July 2009,"Obviously, we can't expect the movie to be like the book. After being somewhat disappointed the last 5 times, I went to see this movie not having read the book. And to say the least it was a pleasant surprise.The film's technical aspects, the cinematography, special-effects,directing, background score was all top-notch. Acting was brilliant, right from the youngsters to the more experienced actors. Even though it's longer than a usual film, it keeps to addicted to it the whole time. Although, I couldn't help but feel lost at times and I had to turn to by friend who had red the book to catch up.In my friend's view, the directors is truthful to the book and even though you don't get the same experience as the book, it's definitely worth a watch. I agree!",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
631,dennnyz,Completely misses to convey the mood from the book,4,21 July 2009,"I was looking forward this movie for ages. Couldn't wait to buy a ticket and get engrossed in a great story. Unfortunately, the 2,5-hour experience left me totally disappointed. The movie completely misses to convey the tightening darkness and despair in the wizards' world, and the much darker atmosphere of the book.Throughout, I was feeling as if I am watching a teenage highschool drama. All the fun, snogging, boy-girl staff was there, played really well by all the young actors, but there was nothing more. The attack on the bridge, the attack on the Burrow (a total disappointment), and the final scenes were, to say the least, a soft caricature of the actual drama conveyed in the book. And honestly, leaving out Voldemort's story also contributed to this, taking out one of the major themes in the books, and completely omitting the horrorful drama of pursuing and creating the horcruxes.I kept asking myself if it is only me, being a total fan of the books, who feels this way, seeing the mutilation of my most favorite story in the whole series. However, my friends who have not read the books, and were with me in the theater, also felt bored by the slow pacing and lack of action in the movie.The only story well told, was that of Draco. Tom is really great in this movie, and manages to convey the best of his character. As for Harry, to witness the attack on Dumbledore, and not intervene - come on, that was totally against his character, and very, very unconvincing.Overall, despite good acting by almost everybody, I felt the scenario and pacing of the movie lacking to convey the true spirit of the book, and the drama of this story.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
632,mattiapahor,the baddast adaptation,6,18 July 2020,"The worst adaptation from book ever. the book is certainly among the best, but the film is not. there is no life of Voldemort, where the whole book focuses... regarding it is of absolute boredom. sin. the film is boring.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
633,lake_bolt,Another brick in the wall...,8,17 July 2009,"Okay, we have the teenage love scenes, the super special effects, and the best selling book to support the film. But we also have a dull scenario filled with stupid dialogues and a lot of added things that weren't really needed.But, it's not so bad. The opening scene, the Harry-Luna on the train scene, the cave scene, the Katie Bell scene, etc, etc. All of them were intriguing and greatly made. Ron ''love scenes'' were hilarious and I enjoyed watching them.What I didn't like is the fact that this is yet another HP movie that tells the book so - fast!!! One minute Harry's on the station, talking to Dumbled - oops, now he's convincing Slugho - oops, he's aboard the Hogwarts expr - oops, now we see Draco with the - oops, Dumbie is dead. Rare is the person who will understand the film without reading the book. ANd also, so many things that are important in the books were cut from the film, while some unnecessary scenes were added, such as the attack on the Burrow. What the hell was that?? All in all, just another brick in the wall. I mean, all in all, another HP film that focused more on the effects than on the script. I even prefer OotP to this movie.I'm not saying HP6(the movie, of course) is bad, it is good. It is a lot of fun and a real summer blockbuster and all. But, for the fans of the book, and the may-be future ones, it's another disappointment.7.5/10 - Good",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
634,jjjjjj-18,I hate the creator of this film more,1,17 July 2009,"This was easily the worst film among the lot guys....I don't know what the other guys mean by ""great film""....maybe Warner Bros them-self is posting these comments....I had read from newspapers that this film has lots of romance and comedy.....But unfortunately that is the ONLY thing that this movie has.....and these jokes were mostly un-laughable....and the romance was non-palpable I am a lover of HP series (movies and books both)....but i don't remember each and every line like some of the fanatics.....i only remember the outline.....I wont say a movie is bad just because it deviated from the book....I am judging the film just own its own merit...ITS REALLY Disappointing....virtually no magic, no mentioning of possible horcrux materials, too little Tom Riddle memories, and the final battle scene -well there was no battle..I seriously think Warner Bros was trying to save money by cutting down the battle scenes to NIL.If there is no magic what fun is a HP movie....? And to compound this....there is nothing else....believe me nothing else If u r a fanatic and cannot stop watching it.....wait for the DVD....but don't waste your time and money on this one HP and the order of phoenix too was a bit boring, but the final battle made up for that to an extent.....but here there is not even that....So I rate HP-6 the worst among the lot",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
635,xxmonexx,The Best Book...The Worst Movie!,4,15 July 2009,"As an avid Harry Potter fan who has read the books multiple times and of course seen the movies repeatedly, I was extremely excited to see this movie at the midnight showing. Half-Blood Prince is my favorite book and other than 7, the darkest book in the series.That being said, I was so disgusted with this movie. Yates & company literally turned it into Harry Potter comedy hour. I'm not sure how anyone thought this movie was amazingly dark when the theater was cracking up laughing the entire time at trite jokes. The only thing that should have been funny in this entire movie was Lavender & Won Won's obsession w/ each other.The movie emphasized the unrequited love/snogging/Ron & Lavender romance over the major plot line which was learning about Tom Riddle's background. With the exception of Dumbledore's first meeting w/ Tom & Tom asking about how to make Horcruxes, all of the background was left out. That's essentially three quarters of the book omitted.What was the point of not having Tonks find Harry on the train? How can you have Tonks call Remus sweetie and not explain all the drama between them and how they got together? How can you leave out Madam Rosmerta's involvement? What was the point of the burning of the Burrow scene? The ending was horrific. It was completely different than the book. So now Dumbledore is the only one who can apparate on Hogwarts grounds? Malfoy spends all this time working on this cabinet only to have the Death Eaters walk through, Bellatrix (who is not present in the book) encourage him to kill Dumbledore, Snape kills Dumbledore, and they kindly saunter off the grounds in no hurry. No battle... no fear of being caught...nothing. What was the point of the cabinet in the movie? It was completely anti-climatic and they didn't even have the funeral scene which is a must-have. The worst part ever was the very end...Harry and Hermione are talking about Dumbledore's death and going searching for horcruxes and she randomly chimes in that Ron is OK w/ Ginny and Harry. WHAT?! It was so awkward.And can someone please tell me how they are going to explain Dobby and Kreacher in the Deathly Hallows movies when they have essentially been omitted from the subsequent movies after being introduced? I honestly would like a do-over. They really need to re-shoot this movie and try again because it was bad. For the real fan, it leaves you cold and empty, with no tears for Dumbledore because you are so confused, and wondering why Yates and Co. cared about Lavender being funny more than the back story of Tom Riddle.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
636,kasumi_kimoto,"Yet another great movie in the series, if not the best.",8,14 July 2009,"I went to this movie with no expectations whatsoever, but even if had high ones, I'm certain they would've been fulfilled.The movie was just amazing, it caught my attention every single moment, and never gets boring, while it's definitely not a short movie with it's 153 min duration. However this may also be one of the negative points, as the movie goes by so quickly that it felt to me like less time went by then in the book. But I do believe this was unavoidable, and perhaps a special edition DVD with extra material could make the movie feel less like a rollercoasterride.The acting was also rather good, while Daniel redcliffe, may not look the Harry potter that I had imagined, messy hair, messy hair. He does bring the character to live and continues to give the audience a good interpretation of this famous character. This time with a little bit more humour. Which reminds me, if anyone cares for a good laugh, definitely go watch this one. Because while the sky in the movies may be darker then before, the humour is brighter, and fills most of the movie without making the serious parts less dark.The movie is visually well done, with a lot of care for detail, and beautiful locations. And you can expect it to follow the book well, but as I said, it might just feel a bit like a roller-coaster ride, so as cliché as it may sound, fasten your seat-belts and prepare for one hell of a Harry potter ride.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
637,legolander,Great opening...Terrible Ending...,7,4 August 2009,"The film's opening sequence was breathtaking. And that's about it. The rest of the film revolves around the romance of Harry and his friends. As a matter of fact, the whole Voldemort background was nearly cut from the film, save for two shallow flashbacks. The complex story of Tom Riddle was never elaborated in the film. And this is where my list of complaints starts. Oh, and by the way, it's time for those blasted anti-book purists to swallow every single praise they've given to this film. They don't deserve to be called fans of Harry Potter, because they literally don't know anything about the importance of staying true to the books. Damn them all, if I may say so. First, the omission of characters. Several of them were cut from the movie while some of those who were cast, were given little amount of screen time (Tonks and Lupin for instance). How will they introduce Bill Weasley, Fleur Delacour, and Rufus Scrimgeour in the seventh movie? I can already see them being randomly put into the story, like mushrooms sprouting out of nowhere.Second, the alterations made to the movie. Okay, the opening attack was just fine, but all of a sudden, we see Harry flirting with a slutty little waitress. Why the hell did they have to show this? They should have just used those minutes for the appearance of the Durseleys. And then we see Narcissa Malfoy shedding crocodile tears for her only son, Draco. The director could have given her more lines to show her genuine despair for what lies ahead. To fast track things, we move to the Vanishing Cabinet plot. We frequently see Draco going to the Room of Requirement. Okay, that was fine. Although in the book, Harry's suspicions were not confirmed until the climax of the story. Going back, the directors could have added more suspense to this plot by not giving away too much. We move on to the kiss between Harry and Ginny. It was a nice little sweet scene. But I found Ginny's character a little too aggressive (romantically). She was tough in terms of her inclination to fight alongside Dumbledore's Army and the Order of the Phoenix, but was nevertheless decent and controlled when dealing with romance. She initiates the kiss between her and Harry in the movie. But in my opinion, her book counterpart would never have done this. She was just casual with Harry after getting over her preteen crush on him. In the film, she constantly flirts with Harry until eventually, it was implied that they ended up together.As for Harry Potter's character, I should say this: practice what you preach. Before obtaining the real memory from Horace Slughorn, Harry lectures him about how brave he should be because otherwise, the old professor disgraces Lily Potter. But towards the end, I think Harry ought to swallow those words of encouragement because during the scene prior to Dumbledore's death, he just stood there and did absolutely nothing to help the poor old headmaster. Now, about the climax. In the book, Harry even argues with Dumbledore and accuses him of not taking the safety of the students seriously. Quite the opposite happens in the movie. Neither of them was cautious. They left the school unprotected. No members of the Order of the Phoenix, no Dumbledore's Army, and no professors patrolling the corridors. In fact, right after Dumbledore is killed, no battle ever occurs. All we see is Bellatrix breaking dishes and goblets and even the windows of the Great Hall in such an ecstatic manner. There was no fight scene or whatsoever skirmish there should have been. Nobody was on the lookout, except for one pathetic defenseless Auror who got blasted out of the way as Death Eaters walked out of the castle. This poses a major plot hole: why did Draco exert so much effort in repairing the Vanishing cabinet when all the while the Death Eaters were just planning to have a nighttime stroll at Hogwarts? Now that is truly anticlimactic. Come to think of it, after what happened at the Burrow, do people honestly expect Dumbledore and Harry to leave the school without adding extra security around the place? Talk about unrealistic. I had no problems with the addition of the Battle at the Burrow, in fact, it should have added more spice to the film's intense storyline. But in the end, fans must realize that the whole Burning of the Burrow scene was just pointless, since the battle at the end was removed. Tsk. Tsk. Tsk. Tsk...Oh, I almost forgot about Dumbledore's funeral. Hey, now I remember, there was no funeral at all! How thick could the filmmakers get? The most important figure of authority in school got murdered by one of his most trusted colleagues and yet, he gets nothing but an awkward and poorly staged wand lighting vigil by the students and teachers. It made no sense, except perhaps for the fact that it was a sign of salute to their fallen Headmaster. Nevertheless, they could have added more drama to the conclusion of the film by putting in the funeral. The ending was actually rushed. Random pieces of information were thrown in just so they could consume the 2 1/2 hour- time span. Overall, the film was enjoyable. The visual effects again exceeded expectations. The acting was very well done. Michael Gambon was able to nail the portrayal of Dumbledore. The same goes with Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, Rupert Grint, Evanna Lynch, Bonnie Wright, Helena Bonham Carter, Tom Felton, and of course, Alan Rickman. However, in terms of plot and character consistency, the film was a tragic failure. Considering that Half-Blood Prince is one of the easiest books to adapt, sad to say but the filmmakers left the majority of the audience puzzled, most particularly the non-book fans.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
638,bawhp_KillerRabbit,Harry Potter 6,4,15 July 2009,Well If liked the 4th movie and can't stand reading this movie is for you however if you liked the book and thought that the 5th movie was a great Summary and was a improvement over the fourth YOU WILL BE DISSAPIONTED!! This Movie To me was Hollywood turning not so Interesting book in their perspective into one there is more romance in the movie than the book. and the way he did the romance was made everything funny. That and the first Scene in the movie Was not in the book at all. Once a again David Yates has Let Down Fans Of The Book Series By Cutting out a scene cause he didn't know how to do it so he made some quick way by doing adding something funny and making himself look bad in front of a world harry potter book audience . The First scene could have been quick Harry could have had his face on the glass with and a note From Dumbledore saying he would pick him up Friday at 11pm and the lights go out out side and and harry awakes and starts to throw stuff in his trunk and heads down stairs to find Dumbledore greeted by Uncle Vernon Did harry tell that i was coming and then a angry and shocked look on the uncle's face and Dumbledore explains why he's there and him and harry take off into the night. If done right it could have been done in the same amount of time as the Fake not needed scene in the first five minutes The Ending where Dumbledore dies should not of change and Did David Yates Not Read The Story Nevile Longbottom is not even in the movie he has one line He Is A important Character in the book and has to kill Voldemort in the seventh book I know i'll be waiting for the first part of the seventh movie to be released for i will not be going opening night i will wait for one of the fans of the book to write how the first part is. This movie was better than 4 in the long run but to me only by a notch so i gave it a rating above what i would rate it If Hollywood or David Yates Reads This Summaries Work great For movie i was pleased with what u did with the fifth book and how you summarized it in the film this is what you should have done with the sixth film not gone back to your ways of the fourth,Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
639,cult_movie_freak,A breath of fresh air for Potter fans.,9,11 July 2009,"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince is possibly one of the only, if not the only, movie in the series that stays true to the novel on which it is based. I say this not from reading it, which I have not, but from the reaction of a friend who has read it a number of times. From a film stand-point, it may be the best so far. Though I still have a soft spot for the first one, John William's magical score and all, this one comes pretty damn close. David Yates shows his true directing talent here which was suspiciously absent from the previous film, Order of the Phoenix. First example in the flashback scenes (of which there are a number of), or whatever the true term of it is, the style of the cinematography almost completely shifts to a darker, more frightful style. The art direction, as with all of the films, continues to mesmerize the audience. The script is witty and I admit I had more than a couple of laughs. I personally felt that the film relied too much on the relationships of the three main characters and less on the main focus of the movie, but thats just me. The acting overall was superb. Nothing really different than the last films. I saw this film with an audience of maybe 1000 at the premiere in New York City, and I can confidently say that not one of those viewers went away with a frown. This is a fantastic magical ride of a movie that I highly recommend.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
640,sweetadeleine,"Subtlety is sacked for schticks: sleaze, snogging, and seedy second-rate stagecraft",3,17 July 2009,"Let me first say that I am a movie buff of sorts, and I take my time making judgments on films. And the acting in this movie was very good, and visually (other than the Inferi, which looked inhuman and merely repulsive rather than scary) it was appealing. That being said, the script is horrible. It's choppy, and it forced the actors to do things that they would never have done if they were staying true to the characters from the books.I have read the books, but I'm not a fanatic about them. I often go to see Harry Potter films without remembering what happens much at all in the books, and I don't expect them to follow exactly. That being said, I was quite looking forward to the romances between Ron & Hermione and Harry & Ginny. The book does a pretty great job of making these sort of ambiguous undercurrents that reveal a lot of what the characters are like and where they come from. Steve Kloves and David Yates destroyed this by making budding young love try to mimic cheap Hollywood romantic comedies. It is forced, contrived,obvious, and starts in far too soon rather than taking its course over the school year. I didn't mind that there was so much of it, just that it was so badly done. Ron and Hermione were the only good players; Lavender was horribly overdone (to the point of obsession rather than merely being overly affectionate and lovey-dovey), and Harry and Ginny don't seem to have any reason whatsoever to like one another, and there was no question for him of whether or not she liked him back. I can't believe they had her feeding him a mince pie and tying his shoelace. How sexist and contrived can you get? Ginny would never do that! And their snogging scene does not happen in front of Ron, there is no nod of approval to show Harry that he's OK with the relationship, and frankly we never get to see them have a relationship. Instead, at the closing scene of the movie when Dumbledore has died and Harry probably couldn't care less about romance, Hermione informs him that she talked to Ron and he's OK with the Harry/Ginny ship. Hermione would never do that! They are all completely hands-off friends as far as the romance department goes. They do NOT get into each other's business unless invited.Alan Rickman is an amazing Severus Snape, but he plays out pretty badly in this film, and I'm going to go ahead and attribute it to the directing. Obviously the director, writer, and producer thought that we should make Snape's lack of loyalty to Voldemort really obvious through his hesitancy and facial expression. Snape would never do that! Snape is an expert at withdrawing from his emotions nonverbally. Though he may express his more negative emotions through his actions, he does not write any of his emotions all over his face; instead, he has a constant dour expression that reveals nothing, which this movie destroys.Tom Felton is a superb Draco Malfoy, particularly in this film. However, because they give away what is not surely known to Harry about the vanishing cabinets and his affiliation with Death Eaters we do not have the huge emotional impact when Dumbledore dies. In the book, Ron and Hermione don't believe Harry and so they don't help him in his desperate attempts to find out what Malfoy is up to. They also are disbelieving when Harry continues to openly mistrust Snape. When Snape kills Dumbledore, everyone is devastated and guilty for not having listened to Harry, particularly Ron and Hermione. There is none of that shame or loss in this film. It's almost as if the makers of this movie decided that since probably everyone knew already it wouldn't have any impact. Because of that presupposition, it doesn't. The most beloved character in Harry Potter is killed off in what should appear to be huge betrayal while Harry is paralyzed and can do nothing. This is reduced to nothing surprising/emotional whatsoever. Later, Harry angrily walks past Professor McGonagall while she offers to speak with him about Dumbledore's death, and viewers are left wondering why because there was never any buildup of necessities in this film to make even the most basic ending scenes have any impact. The Harry Potter books are a played up character study; we study Harry, Voldemort, and lastly Snape and Dumbledore and all their intertwinings very closely. Therein lies the deep beauty of Harry Potter. Admittedly, this would always be difficult to translate to film, but any writers/producers/directors not up to the task shouldn't have bothered.I can't believe JK Rowling approved the sweeping changes they made to her work; the movie is almost entirely surface, all the best parts are left out, and beyond that things of absolutely no consequence are added in. This movie is an insult to anyone who has or has not read the books. The main players making this movie clearly don't have any respect for their audience. It is also clear that they do not understand the nuances of the characters they were portraying on screen. With more than half a year extra, you'd think this movie would be the best of the bunch, however that is still reserved for POA, which I saw without having read any of the books and it is not only the best but the most faithful adaptation.Bottom line: go see this, with trepidation. Then make your own film because dammit, I would like to see a much better version of this story. I am so looking forward to some Harry Potter fanatics remaking these films in the future. I fell asleep the second time I went to see this.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince

I wouldn't have gave it a 4*.Anyone who has not read the book can surely skip this movie for the sake that you'd get no linkage as to what's going on. What's Going On? That's the Question .. i was asking myself throughout the whole movie. It seems they could have done a Good job by Making 2 movies out of this. Instead of Squeezing Everything in one.As a Potter Fan I'd have thought out the Monumental Incidents that this movie should have showed. Bill? Nothing...etc etc.. all Gone.. Seeing a Quidditch match was a relief.. I mean it's last time they were going to show.This Movie lacks a Pace... Un-necssary Parts have been added and tried to make them ease the tension the movie builds for it's lack of story continuity or Linkage.

642,xantrias,Nice bloopers summary or left-out scenes collection...,2,17 July 2009,"First I wanna say sorry in advance for all those who gave this film more than 6 stars AND didn't know the book. I presume that all the others who actually DID read the novel first gave a bad critic cuz otherwise, i really suggest you to stop reading.This Film is not based on the novel by J.K.Rowling...i guess the writers didn't read the book or had a special copy about ideas that Rowling didn't consider well enough to mention them in the book.I mean, how crazy must a writer be for not only not mention 75% of the heavily needed background information in a film, but actually to put in scenes that didn't appear in the book...I admit, the film has some funny scenes, and you DO laugh sometimes, but that's it!!All the mystery and thrill behind Dumbledore's memories about young and old Tom Riddle is not there! Why is it not there? Cuz there are only two memories shown! The most crucial plot in the film (Harry's understanding what he has to do, how and why)is simply left out. The ending is catastrophic...what the hell is wrong with those writers? Harry is not a brave young man anymore who would rather through himself into battle than leaving a friend behind. No, now he is a coward, who watches Dumbledore die even though he could have done something. Why is that? Cuz according to the movie, Harry doesn't hide under the invisibility cloak jinxed by Dumbledore himself, he just walks down the stairs and watches from underneath. Hm...I didn't know Harry was a coward...that's odd and totally contra-dictionary to what was mentioned AND shown in the last 5 books and films! So here is a film with at most 20% of the books content: Almost no memories about the past of Voldemort, no Rufus Scrimgeour, no funeral, no fight in Hogwards, actually no relationship between Ginny and Harry but with some added and by the way absolutely invented scenes.Although the film was very bad, the acting was outstanding. And that's why I gave two and not one star! Sorry guys, i have to puke right now!",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
643,whynotand1,A Disgrace for all readers.. a comedy for movie watchers,1,15 July 2009,"Being a reader and viewer of all the books and movies I have to say by far this is the worst movie. For one the movie did not show any important detail that viewers need to know for the final two movies. The important Tom Riddle memories weren't shown. No Funeral? No Big fight at the end? No werewolf attack? I can go on and on. It seemed they cut out all of the action and dark parts and put in comedy and romance. Although romance is an important part of this book, the scenes had to be the cheesiest and was completely over the top.I rather have went to hear a reading of this book then have to sit through that. If you told me i would be falling asleep halfway through the movie I would call you crazy. I also love some of the added parts like the burrow burnt down. what???? Another thing left out was the conversation that Harry had with Ginny at the end. COME ON!!!! This movie mad me most upset because if you leave out the fighting scene at the end... whats the fighting scene gonna be like in the final book. In my opinion i rather can this director start the movie over and i wouldn't care to wait 4 or 5 more years if it was gonna be that dreadful. My advice don't see it... read it.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
644,aragornelessar-1,Why on earth are they doing that?,3,20 July 2009,"To all disappointed fans all over the world: Why don't we unite and send Warner Brothers and J.K. Rowling tons of letters each day, where we express our disappointment, that we now twice have been given not the movie we all were expecting? How can J.K. Rowling even agree, that David Yates and the authors are taking every magic out of her creation? Does she even care? What is her opinion?And what is wrong with you guys saying that you are able ""to see the story behind the book"". What nonsense is that? The story is ""in the book"" and it's a damned good story, so why the hell messing it up with stupid things never happened in the book (like the scene with Bellatrix and Greyback at the Burrow), loosing time with unnecessary details, leaving so many things unexplained and changing the story in a totally annoying way (the end was a joke!)? I really tried hard to forgive many things, but the result is totally unforgivable.As I said after I saw the Order of the Phoenix, same goes for the Half-Blood Prince: You can not follow the line, when you haven't read the book! It seems like peaces are just glued together. We should shout out loud and put an end to those ""violations"" against good books.And we have two more to come directed by David Yates. I will not support this junk and I will not go to the movies to see Deathly Hallows I and II.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
645,dlstewart6759,Torn between 2 sides of my brain,6,16 July 2009,"Having recently re-read HBP prior to the film coming out, I was greatly distressed by how much was cut from the book: The new leadership of the Ministy of Magic, Harry's new inheritance (including inheriting Kreacher), leaving the Dursley's stunned with shame. and so much more.Probably the biggest missing piece in the movie was the thread of who the Half Blood Prince might have been. The film glosses over the whole Price theme until the final revelation of who it is.It was later that I realized that really, the whole Half Blood Prince theme wasn't really relevant to the ongoing story line. Yes, it was pertinent. But it really lead nowhere to the final upcoming conflict with Valdemort.So, taken as a film not totally aimed at the loyal fans of the book, the film actually hits the high points of the upcoming battle in the next 2 films.People who have not read the books, but have been following the movies, will actually have proper perspective to what has transpired to make Valdemort who he is, and what has led Harry to be who he is.Did I miss the battle at Hogwarts between the Death Eaters and the Order? Absolutely! Did I miss Fauke's forlorn song after the funeral? Absolutely! Did I miss who exactly was Fenrir Greyback and how he played in the development of Lupin? Totally! Where was Kreacher who's story plays prominently in the next book? And I don't recall any attack on the Burrow!But this is a movie! Making this film into an accurate representation of the book would have taken 4 hours plus. The main ingredients to get the story moving to the next chapter were invoked. On that note, I have to give the screen writers their due for tackling a complex editing job. Yes, some of it felt rushed, but it was a long book. I will simply have to read the book again (but skip all the teen angst and snogging). I may have to review the film again when it comes to DVD to check my assessment.Thanks for your time.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
646,kschildhouse,Wait for the DVD,1,25 July 2009,"One of my favorite books reduced to a smarmy goofy back story. Seriously? Unfortunately, yes. As I walked out of the theater I couldn't believe what I had just seen. A movie that was so far from the book that it barely resembled the text from which it was adapted from. This series is titled Harry Potter and..... This movie was Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince. NOT Ron and Lavender and the Half Blood Prince!!! I can't even begin to imagine how they're going to recover from the eliminations of this movie not to mention the eliminations of past characters from other movies. Too bad, I really had hoped WB would redeem themselves after the fiasco of Phoenix and the selfish move to push back the release date of this movie. Wait until the DVD is released, then see it. Otherwise grab the book and enjoy a true masterpiece!!!",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
647,kfred108,"Awesome trailer, horrible movie",1,18 July 2009,"I went to the theaters to finally see Public Enemies at which they cancelled due to the amount of people wanting to see the new Harry Potter. I was not too upset considering the trailer for the movie looked much better than the previous films. I have read up to the fourth Harry Potter book so I had nothing to compare the movie to in terms of the sixth book. That being said the movie was awful. Even if I had read the book I would say the same thing. If your a fan of the books then I'm sure you will go see this, but I strongly advise against it. The beginning sucked you in with decent visual effects and what looked like three smoke monsters terrifying the muggles. After that part, which lasted a minute or two, I had to wait an hour and half to see Dumbledore defeat hundreds of Gollums with a storm of fire, but before that I had to sit through an hour and a half watching each of the characters trying to get laid. The best part of this movie experience or lack there of, was the popcorn.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
648,adeeboo0,"Amazingly portrayed! AND YES, I am a fan of the books, and the Half-Blood Prince is one of my favorites.",10,2 December 2010,"Many people are saying this is an awful movie compared to the book, but honestly saying, I thought the movie was quite fun and amazing. Yes, they have deleted things, but everything necessary is there. I had very low expectations for this movie after Order of the Phoenix, but as soon as the trailer came out, I knew this movie will be amazing. The special effects are better than ever. The casting is amazing, the acting is great. By the way, come to think of it, the book itself is more of a romance and focuses on the story more towards the end.People are mostly upset about:1- Why there wasn't a fighting scene towards the end (there really was actually, but sort of a shortened one, they show how Bellatrix destroys the Great Hall, and I consider that fighting!) 2- Dumbledore's funeral and The White Tomb ( Well, yeah they did delete that, but they showed how sad everyone was and them casting white spells to defeat the dark mark...as for the tomb, well, no comment about that.)The movie has a great pacing and quite enjoyable! I was very pleased with this movie",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
649,anup_henry,the best installment.....................,10,16 July 2009,"As beautifully made as it is -- and this may be the best-looking, best-directed Potter film yet -- there's an undeniable level of frustration built into ""Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince."" Basically it comes down to: Can we get on with this? The film's story is so transitional -- it's mostly a mixing of giddy teen romance and frustrated quest -- that it feels like filler on the way to the series' conclusion. Well-made, even arresting filler, true; but come on.That said, it's a marvel how quickly this film's two-and-a-half hours fly by, a testament to the skill of director David Yates, who took over the series with ""Order of the Phoenix"" and will follow it through its two-movies-from-one-novel conclusion, ""Deathly Hallows."" Yates keeps you entertained. It's just that the entertainment feels like so much movie-magic sleight of hand. Obviously, the next two films will have to actually go somewhere. Returning to Hogwarts school for his sixth year, Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) is now famously ""The Chosen One,"" the wizard who offers the best hope of defeating evil Lord Voldemort (who never actually appears in this film). He's also a young man with hormones and an attraction to Ginny Weasely (Bonnie Wright), younger sister of best buddy Ron (Rupert Grint).Ron himself is now the secret object of affection for gal pal Hermione (Emma Watson), although he soon has a clingy girlfriend who mucks things up. All of this is a bit problematic in the film since -- she's 19 now and it's OK to say it -- Emma Watson is somewhat Marjory hot, and neither Ron nor his girlfriend come close. Oh, well, how could the casting directors have known all those years ago? Meanwhile there's a new professor in town named Horace Slughorn (the delectable Jim Broadbent) who has a secret in his past that, when known, should unlock some mysteries about Lord Voldemort. Top wizard Dumbledore (Michael Gambon) asks Harry to try to pry the info out of Slughorn over the course of the school year.Also factoring in is a textbook that Harry conveniently stumbles on, a book that used to belong to someone called ""the Half-Blood Prince,"" which contains all sorts of potions, spells and magical hints.Meanwhile, designated evil kid Draco Malfoy (Tom Felton) is up to something bad, and Professor Snape (Alan Rickman) has apparently signed on to protect him. This can't be good.Still, Yates and his mix of old and young cast members -- have so many young actors ever worked with so many superb elders? -- have their fun along the way. Both Grint and Radcliffe have silly scenes in which they act stoned, Broadbent gets to transform out of a chair and whenever Helena Bonham Carter shows up as the evil Bellatrix Lestrange, she's an ecstatic dervish of doom.The film stays in PG territory for the most part, but smaller kids (and adults) may be creeper out by an attack of drowned bodies. And some of the revelations feel a bit disconnected as they rush forward toward the end.Still, this is Potter well-done, if Potter unresolved. Now let's see this thing through to the end.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
650,vikrant_pce,What's Yates got in store?,9,28 August 2009,"After watching the first 5 movies I never expected this to be a better adaptation of the book because it is not possible to wrap up 6th book in a span of anywhere under 3 hrs. Also there once again were minor changes to the original plot. Yet inclusion of the battle at the end b/w DA and Order vs Death Eaters could have set it up for a totally different response rather than the current less than expected results. Yet Yates has done a pretty good job in this film. Also the younger cast of this series have acted a lot better and Gambon, Broadbent, and Rickman are simply superb in their roles. I'm a great fan of the Harry Potter books by J.K.Rowling, and I expect that Yates does a fair amount of justice with the Deathly Hallows. The graphics and sound effects in the 6th movie were also remarkably improved and as a movie it was one of the best of the series. I hope for much more better movies in the form of 7th and 8th ones.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
651,fer-v,Worst one yet.,3,16 July 2009,"I saw the movie last night. I have ONE BIG QUESTION: HOW ON EARTH DID JK ROWLING ALLOW THEM TO DO THIS!!!?????I mean what's with adding scenes that are absolutely unnecessary? Why show the Burrow burning down instead of the huge fight at the end of the book? I understand that they can't fit everything into a reasonable amount of time, but come on! Why add things that make no sense? Why change important parts like the scene where Dumbledore is killed and Harry just stands there looking like an idiot.. was it too hard to do it the book's way instead? Was it too difficult to make the light from the potion in the cave look green instead of white? Was it too hard for the people that made the movie to have a big ring with a big black stone be the horrocrux instead of a tiny little ring that was unimpressive? I mean why change little details like that? I think they are starting to think that people won't notice stuff, when in reality we actually do!!! What's with all the focus being on the love story and the funny parts when the book actually focuses on Tom riddle and his life story??? And why change the kiss scene between Ginny and Harry? Was it too hard to have them kiss in the common room???????????? you moronic people :( I'm very disappointed :(",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
652,YouAreNotSpecial1,Great Build Up To the Final 2 Part Movie.,7,18 July 2009,"Goods: Funny, Looks GREAT, Sad, Dark, Mature, Better Acting! Bads: To much comedy, unnecessary time wasting scenes, some scenes cut out which should have been left in.The half blood prince is properly one of the best looking, scary, Sad and enjoyable Harry Potter Movies So Far.I haven't read the books that is properly why i enjoyed this movie then most of the people i know who have read the book(s) Half Blood Prince is without doubt looks the best its just above ""Prisoner of Azkaban"" the film is stunning its much darker then the other HP films for sure the color, contrast and lighting sets the tone and looks much more serious and mature. The visual affects are just jaw dropping beats all previous films.Half Blood Prince shows more background about ""Lord Voldemort's"" dark past. ""Dumbledore"" and Harry get much closer and break the teacher and student relationship and become close friends.NOW this is properly the funniest HP Movie ever, the film has many light funny scenes and a lot of romance between Harry and Ginny, Ron and Hermione and most of the movie takes a lot of time laying out this romance between the characters. Now all harry potter movies have humor in them but this one had a bit too much not that its a bad thing but it takes up too much time which they could of spend most of that time telling more of the important side of the story. Tot that the romance isn't important.NOW let me lay this out for people who are bashing ""David Yates"" for the plot and the change from the book to film. He did not write this movie he has directed it and has done a GREAT Job doing so. Blame the screenplay writer for the Plot which i had no problem with accept for one missing scene from the book (The Ending).The performance from ALL actors/actress's are great if not really good they give a more mature deliverance playing there characters then the last HP Movies. ""Tom Felton"" is properly above all performances in my opinion My hats off to him.Harry Potter And The half blood Prince is its own and should not be judged so heavily and put down because its not 100 percent to the book. This goes for all harry potter films.Its a great movie and i recommend it to any who is a fan and watch the movie for being its own thing. A MOVIE.8/10",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
653,sasi_usdk,absolutely awful!!! beyond words!!!,1,21 July 2009,"This should be worst depiction of a HP novel. I actually felt bored to sit through the movie. So many plot holes and so much disconnection!!! I am fine with change, I don't ask the movie to exactly replicate the book. But the essence should not still be missed. This movie should not be about the adolescence of the characters but the journey into LV's past. How can anyone pull off the next movie w/o actually setting up any key plots needed for it? How can Harry complete his mission in the next part if he never actually saw any clues in part6? People say that we should not be comparing the movie with the book. But how anyone explain the burrow being burnt down? What it its significance in the story? And how corny is Ginny tying Harry's shoe laces. I felt like, where am I? what am I doing here? Even by a teen flick standards, this is bad.I am not sure whether Steve Kloves even read part 7 of the book properly, what with the mundane screenplay and pointless plots of this movie. I guess he is planning to slay part7 down too. And even worse there will be 2 parts to this nonsense.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
654,cgfnortje-1,The Movie vs The Book,8,16 July 2009,"In Harry Potter and the Halfblood Prince our heroes (Harry Potter, Hermione Granger and Ron Weasley) are portrayed as lovesick teenagers with more serious things to worry about. Again the enemy (the dark Lord Voldemort) has a mole inside the Hogwarts school of magic. One of the people that Albus Dumbledore trusts most makes a secret pact with the enemy to protect this mole.While all this cloak and dagger stuff is going on, Albus Dumbledore and Harry Potter uncover the past of Lord Voldemort. More secrets are revealed about Voldemort aka Tom Riddle and Potter and Dumbledore goes on a quest to find one of the Dark Lord's best kept secrets. In the process Harry Potter almost dies fighting off zombies in a dark, wet and very scary cave. Here I must admit that I almost had to clean my seat. Scary as hell...This latest Harry Potter movie is an action packed thrill-ride and had me (a thirty three year old male) chewing my nails, laughing out loud and crying like a girl. I think it is probably the best Potter film yet.I suppose some Potter fans who read the book will be somewhat disappointed. The screenwriters definitely cut a few large chunks from the original story and some scenes were completely changed! In addition, if this is the first ever Potter movie you plan to see you may end up not having the foggiest idea what the hell it's all about! You absolutely have to watch the first few Potter movies to know what's going on in this movie. And if you REALLY want to enjoy this movie, stay away from the book at all costs! You will only spoil it for yourself. Rather read the book after the movie. You will certainly appreciate the book even more that way.I did however read all the Harry Potter books prior to this movie and watched all the movies up to date, and although this movie did leave out a few chapters that I would have loved to see on the big screen (Snape attempting to teach Potter to do silent spell casting in Defence Against the Dark Arts class), this movie did impress me more than any of the previous Potter movies.Most of all, the acting was a lot better. Especially Alan Rickman impressed me tremendously as Snape on the scene where he made the unbreakable vow. Jim Broadbent was also a pleasure to watch as professor Slughorn.Of the children, I would have to say that Emma Watson (Hermoine Granger), and Tom Felton (Draco Malfoy) delivered the best performances. Although I wouldn't say that their performances warrant Oscars, they did quite well for kids. Bonnie Wright (Ginny Weasly) also deserve some mention, but only because she actually learned to act a bit. In the previous movies she was more of a cardboard character.I was also impressed by the performances of the two kids who played Tom Riddle at age 11 (Hero Fiennes-Tiffin) and 16 (Frank Dillane). If I saw a kid behaving like that in real life, I would either try to kill him in his sleep or run for my life!Rupert Grint and Daniel Radcliffe? Well, in the previous Potter movies, I always thought that Rupert was a bit of a better actor than Daniel. I never liked those funny twitches Daniel used to make with his mouth to simulate emotion. However, in this movie the three main characters (played by Daniel, Rupert and Emma) played nicely off each other. Obviously they have played opposite each other in a few other Potter movies, so it would only make sense that their on-screen chemistry should improve over time.I know that the movie does not come close to the book, but should the book really be the instrument of measurement? Admitedly, a movie and a book are two different mediums. The book was a whopper packed with scenes and scenarios, and I do not think one can honestly expect a scriptwriter to include every little detail in the movie.Let's face it. A script is a few pages long. This book was an action packed read with a fresh plot-twist every second page! The book had everything plus the kitchen sink in it! You simply cannot fit it all into one movie.All in all, I think the movie was darn good and worth the wait. The final two movies will really have to be good to top this one. I will not be surprised if Halfblood Prince gets a few nominations.Harry Potter rules!",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
655,mruch1,Harry Potter book vs movie,8,23 July 2009,"The reason this movie is getting rave reviews is because it is an excellent movie. I am getting sick of people comparing the movie to the book. If I wanted to know what took place in the book versus what takes place in the movie, I would read the book. That is the reason that I haven't read any of the books, and I don't intend to until after the movie series is over. I went to the theater to see Harry Potter the movie, not Harry Potter a literal interpretation of the book. My interpretation of the characters has been based on the movie version of these characters, which to my understanding are ""based"" on the characters in the books. Seeing this movie, I was stunned by a certain event which occurs at the end of the film. I understood exactly why the characters involved in the event did what they did, and I didn't feel that I needed to reference the book to see if my understanding was correct.If people are going to continue to compare these movies to the books, then I'm sure that some of them will be disappointed, but I don't believe that this comparison gives them the right to trash the movie, simply because it didn't live up to the expectation of the book. A large part of whether you enjoy a book, or not, is based on your imagination and how you perceive the printed word in your mind. No movie can ever expect to live up to your imagination. Accept the movies for what they are - an interpretation of the written word. They are not - and never can be a page by page representation of what is written in the book.Finally, if you are going to review the film - then review the film. Do not compare it to the book, but rather review it for its own merits or flaws. Saying that the acting was weak, or that there wasn't enough action is much better than trying to tell the reader what was missing from the movie. From my perspective, having never opened the cover on a Harry Potter book, nothing was missing from the movie.For my part - I thought this was the best movie so far. The films have been getting better since the main actors have grown up. I thought that Order of the Phoenix was exceptionally well made, and this one, although there wasn't as much action as there was in OotP, was still a moving - rewarding piece of filmography. I liked that certain characters were put into sticky situations with some impossible decisions to make. I can't wait to see the next two movies and see how the series ends.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
656,dechong,What is with all the good ratings?,4,23 July 2009,"This movie is crap! Everyone on this world who read the novel will confirm that... or they are completely nuts! Well... for the sake of truth i have to admit that i thought ""oh this is a good movie"" until the so called showdown starts. No Action at all! The book was full of it! Lots of fights and deaths and rel great action... NON in the movie! Just the death of Dumbledore! To me it seems like this movie builds up on the death of him! It centers about presenting Dumbledore once more as a great man everyone have to love and ... boom he dies! Im not saying he should have lived, no way! What i am saying is that some little... no,much more, more action would have been just good. My other concern is that you don't know how the Harry/Ginny and Hermione/ Ron relationships ended of if you did not read the book. Too much of a Teenie Movie as well! It focuses way too much on stupid Teenager Relationships... and this is NOT mature at all! All the jokes too are very stupid! It is much more of a kids film (with love) as any other part was if you ask me. But for the sake of the book: watch this movie to find it awful! That is all i ask of you.

The effects are great and the story went never boring......always something happened....and that's what i liked very much! After this movie I decided to read the book once again to see how it changed my view. It's always interesting to see the differences between the book and the movie and it's even more interesting to compare the pictures you have in your head after you read the book and the pictures on the screen.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
658,gbowles76,Waste of time,1,16 July 2009,"After the 4th and 5th movies, my expectations really weren't very high, but even low ones were disappointed with this movie. I mean, I do understand having to cut out some parts of a book to make a movie fit within an time frame, but come on, blowing up the burrow for dramatic effect? Sadly this is the direction that more and more movies are taking. I know they have announced that the 7th movie will be in two parts, and I hope to God for the director's sake, that he follows the book line by line because this 6th movie was nothing but an abortion of the book. It was nothing less than two hours of wasted life and cut corners. Please do us a favor and read the 7th book a few times before you put out the final story boards for the 7th movie.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
659,Trokin,I spend 210 minutes in the cinema to get mentally molested.,4,23 July 2009,"I have no clue why this film has such a high rating on IMDb. There are many movies that are way better than Harry Potter 6 and though they have a way lower rating. Actually I read all the books. While growing up I distanced myself from the fantasy world the books tried to build. Especially the 6th and the 7th book weren't that exciting anymore like the other 5 ones. Still they were cool to read and the storyline fitted. Action combined with the magic part, human relations, some cute weirdness all that getting expressed by a good vs. bad story. To sum it up: worth its reading time. I watched the first 3 movies and I was disappointed but with the 4th and the 5th movie it felt like the movies were getting better, they had at least more elements of the books in a acceptable balance as their forerunner. So I thought this one could be finally worth it to be called a Harry Potter movie. I was wrong...or better I was terribly wrong. It kinda reminded me of an adult movie, just that they only showed the plot and no explicit scenes. To summarize it they tried to be closer to the book this time by combining the ""human relations"" and ""cute weirdness"" and made a movie out of it. They kinda cut out everything else, there was like 5 minutes of magic and 5 minutes of action in the movie. It felt like they took the action scenes from the book that were described on like 50 sites and reduced them to 1 site, in the desperate urge to keep the movie on its love-boat-trip and to never risk the rated 12 approval. Sadly this movie kinda feels like a Twilight clone and I guess that the success of this explicit movie by girls in puberty made the producers of Harry Potter 6 cut The Half-Blood Prince the Twilight way: Combine a low amount of fantasy with a high amount of teenage love. After all it was like with the first 3 movies - they were just after the profit, disregarding in any way what they are doing to the books...",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
660,matt-n273,Good for those willing to ignore missing book scenes.,7,18 July 2009,"I've been a fan of Harry Potter since I read the first book around ten or eleven years ago. Around the same time as the first movie came out. I'll admit that, as a fan of the books, this movie is kind of a disappointment. But the big thing to notice is that it's a MOVIE, and while it would be nice to have everything from the book in the movie, it's not possible.I think that, as a movie, this installment of the Harry Potter series did remarkably well. It kept with the books overall tone of darkness and growing tension, as well as the romantic subplots, and the ending, while not the same as the book, denotes a chilling sadness in the hearts of those watching. Watching Bellatrix run through the Hall destroying the dishes and windows, and then putting out all the candles definitely sent me the message that things are going downhill, and I'm sure that the other watchers felt it too.The acting was great, especially from Dan and Tom(Harry and Draco, respectively). Rupert did a great job portraying Ron's hopeless love life, Bonny was superb as Ginny, and Emma showed a humor in Hermione that I doubt many knew of, while also displaying her excellent acting skills in the sadness of Ron's hooking up with a certain Lav-Lav. Alan Rickman was very convincing as Snape, especially in the Tower scene, displaying exactly what had gone through my mind while I was reading the books, and Michael Gambon was remarkable as Dumbledore, especially in the cave scene.The plot was easy to follow, thought that is not to say it was weak or uninteresting. It was fast paced all the way through, dark in the places it was needed, and humorous when needed.The fight scenes, though few, were amazing. My heart was pounding during the bathroom scene, and the Burrow's destruction had me on the edge of my seat.All in all, Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince was a good movie. It was well done in Yate's style, and while it was missing several seemingly important scenes from the book, I believe it portrayed exactly what the average watcher needed to know: Harry, Ron, and Hermione are in for dark, dangerous times. Things are bleak in their world, and they won't always have someone to fall back on. And despite what they'd like to believe, the world isn't always cut into black and white. Everyone has shades of gray that come into view.If you're looking for a good watch, this movie is for you.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
661,addyinnocent17,OMG......Worst HP movie ever,3,19 July 2009,"OK....As a big Harry Potter fan i waited for the movie....scheduled to release in November, i was disappointed to see the movie release delayed for 6 months. i waited and waited and then the day it was released in India, i went to see it. I had high anticipations from the movie after seeing its trailers which were really looking good. Even after the poor attempt of David Yates at the fifth part, i was hopeful that he would do justice to the best book in the Harry Potter series but i was wrong!!!! First the good points of the movie. The special effects and the visuals were really stunning and high quality. Dan and others acted really well and it was nice to see Ginny having a meaty role in the movie. She looks gorgeous. The Scenes at Lake were really upto the mark. We had some nice comic moments well enacted by Dan and Rupert. But let me ask...is that the reason one goes to see a Harry Potter movie?? I didn't go to see a teenage romantic comedy. The tagline of the movie says that Harry and Dumbledore try to unravel Voldemort's past and the time we actually get to see his past in only 10 minutes in a damn 2:30 hours movie!!!! The durseleys were totally left out. So were Bill and Fleur. Hagrid got only two scenes in the whole movie.The only thing we learnt about Voldemort is that he learnt to make horcruxes. Director and writers do not care about telling us what things he chooses to make horcruxes which was so nicely told in the movie.No reference was made for Voldemort's father, mother, Gaunt. No reference for Voldemort's deeds after schooling what so ever. After 2 hours of comedy sequences between Lavender and ""Won Won"", we come to know about horcruxes and thats all!!!! this is serious crap....There is virtually no story in the movie....I am concluded that David Yates doesn't even know how to tell a story in a movie. Nor does he ever bother to read the novel.The last scene was totally a let down which made the movie a complete disappointment for everyone. Death eaters just enter hogwarts and Snape kills Dumbledore with Harry standing just one floor under watching everything like a coward (in the novel he was immobilised by Dumbledore's spell). They kill Dumbledore and leave Hogwarts quietly without any fight without anyone watching except Harry. This is bullshit!!! in the novel, the fight sequence in the end was so amazing with the Order of phoenix and DA fighting the death eaters...the same was totally missed out which could have been the best part of the movie..Some people might say that its impossible to put the whole novel in a 2:30 hour movie but then how did Lord of the Rings or the Narnia movies manage to do it....So this movie was the worst Harry Potter movie and David Yates as an HP director is bad luck for HP fans. I wondered whether Warner Bros should have got Chris Nolan to direct this movie.I am not keeping my fingers crossed for the seventh part as i am now sure that we will again get a totally crap movie thanks to Warner Bros that David is directing the last HP assignment.In the nutshell....A Total disastrous movie....Don't waste your time watching it....",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
662,saintelectra,awkward!,4,17 July 2009,"I watched this movie as soon as it released in my country, and I felt upset. I watched it with my friend who also a big fan of HP, and we agreed that the movie is the most book-alike, otherwise the most boring one. I don't understand why David Yates prefer Ron comedy scenes than the most important scene of the book! Well, I admit Ron-Hermione/Harry-Ginny love story is very amusing, especially for those who are big fans of them. But should it be?? The best part of the movie are cut down! How BRILLIANT.Firstly, NO BILL WEASLEY. I am a big fan of him and I was wondering how he would look like when I enter the cinema, and what I got? Nothing close to him. And now I start to think that The Weasley only consist of Arthut, Molly, Fred-George, Ron, Ginny, and even I can't remember Percy's face, did he ever show up in the movie though? Secondly, NO FLEUR DELACOUR. of course, no Bill, no Fleur. And no wedding. Thirdly, NO BATTLE. WTF, that's the best part of the movie!!!! Hello????? Is Yates crazy? This makes Aurors look like dull men!For you who loves romance like Twilight, you'll be happy to see the freak romance in the movie. and plus scenes that are not in the book make this movie seems worsen. Overall, this is the longest yet the most boring HP ever!",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
663,foxme13,Now feeling very leery of the next two films...,3,11 November 2010,"I really can't add anything that hasn't already been mentioned about how many important things were left out of this film. My only question is why this film adaptation so horribly represented the story it was supposed to be portraying. I think as the years go by people will look back and realize that David Yates was the worst thing that could have happened to this wonderful and magical epic story. Movies 1-4 were magical, interesting, and although they may not have followed the story-lines exactly, what movie ever has or could? At least they seemed to make every attempt to stay true to the heart of the story. Something that I simply cannot say for this film.After reading the book and watching the movie, I find myself at a loss. The director felt no need to include all of the poignant and powerful parts of the of the story that made it my favorite of the series thus far, but he included overly long scenes of bits that simply held no draw for me and most other fans of the deeper storyline. As well as creating scenes of his own that had no purpose in moving things forward. Does anyone else wonder if he actually read the book for himself or just had someone interpret it for him? In an interview he explains that he included the scene outside the burrow because he felt there was ""lack of a sense of jeopardy from the outside."" Wow, Mr. Yates, perhaps if you had stuck to the many elements you had left out, such as the over-protectiveness of Mrs. Weasley in the beginning, countless aurors and other security measures at the school (including the frequent and curiously convenient appearances of Tonks), the frequent mentions through the daily prophet of the horrible ""jeopardy from the outside."" It almost looks as though he simply felt he could have written a better story than J.K. Rowling and he felt the need to show everyone.I also noticed that in this particular film there seem to be very very few scenes with more than three or four characters in the scene. Things seemed drawn in so tight that I lost the feeling of the grand scale of what is going on and the many people involved in it all. The feeling should be tight but filled with the wizards that are now drawing closer together in anticipation of the coming darkness. Well...I've finished my ramblings. Essentially, I was highly disappointment in Mr. Yates' work and almost couldn't stand to watch the entire thing. I am about to read the final Harry Potter book, which I had hoped to finish prior to the release of the new film. Now, I find myself actually doubting whether or not I will want to see it at all. I would truly hate to sit through another butcher session like this one.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
664,caramelboy,The Half-Crap Prince,5,16 July 2009,"Being a fan of Harry Potter films and books, I was very disappointed in this. The performances were good, but some of the characters were left out. They completely forgot about Harry's other flame from ""The Order of the Phoenix"", Cho Chang, and a lot of other characters. I was beginning to like Neville in the last film, but in this one he doesn't say a word. The teen love scenes were kinda good, but the movie was focused too much on it. In fact, it was more focused on Ron and that annoying groupie, Lavender Brown, than Harry and Ginnie. Moving on to the flashbacks, Yates had skipped quite a lot and used only two flashbacks which I found annoying just for the stupid teen love scenes. The performances were really good though. Radcliffe is more nicer and funnier than he was in OTP because he was quite a grouch in that. He still shows the emotional side of Potter in this which is still good. Rupert Grint and Emma Watson also did good performances, but the best were Alan Rickman and Michael Gambon (who's Dumbledore may even rival Ian Mckellin's Gandalf the Grey/White). Also Jim Broadent was kind of charming and funny as Professor Slughorn, the potions teacher. The climax was handled badly as it was too fast, but most of the other action sequences like the bridge being attacked was pretty fun because of the visuals and stuff. Still they were sort of useless to add as they did not add much to the story. The same goes for the burrow being attacked which was useless and time wasting. It was very hard to shed a tear near the end of what happened to Dumbledore because Yates handled it so badly like it wasn't important at all.The movie could have done better if it focused more on the real story than the love subplots. I hope they change their minds about letting Yates direct the last because he omits out a lot and I don't like the direction he is taking the films. Where's Peter Jackson or Guillermo Del Toro when you need them.At least this film is better than ""Twilight"". Heck, when the ""New Moon"" trailer came up, a character in it turned into a wolf and then a guy in the theater shouted ""it's a squirrel"" and everyone in the theater laughed ....lol",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
665,maritza-15,Immensely satisfying for fans who can see the movie behind the book,9,12 July 2009,"I was lucky enough to see a preview of Half-Blood Prince three days before opening day. I saw it a second time with my son who is not quite ten, but who is generally mature for his age and doesn't scare easily. The two viewings give me the unique advantage of both the adult and the child perspective on the movie. I only recently started counting myself a true Harry Potter fan after my son introduced me to the movies a couple of years ago. I finished the last book only three weeks before seeing the movie adaptation of Half-Blood Prince the first time.With all the book details very fresh in my mind, I had high expectations of the movie. And Yates, the production crew and the cast definitely delivered. The movie impresses on many levels from an artistic point of view. The stripped landscapes and washed out colors convey a constant feeling of dread and foreboding. The standard train trip to Hogwarts was particularly stark, seen against a landscape scorched by a hot summer sun and dotted with dark pools of water. The usual lush greenery and joyous train ride are nowhere to be seen.Personally, I felt the pace was spot-on and that the movie elegantly made time for all key plot points. But only if you enjoy a plot line driven by character and emotion. For the younger lot, looking for frightening wizard duels and attacks by magical creatures, the first hour and a half of the movie drags on a bit. My son certainly became fidgety, and didn't appreciate the finesse and sophistication of the plot and cinematic approach.Most of the threatening and darkening tone of the movie was also lost upon him, whereas I reveled in the finer details contributing to a general sense of ever-encroaching darkness. There are worse things in life to be afraid of than big hairy spiders. My son missed seeing those - I was a lot more intrigued by the ominous undercurrents made palpable by the indomitable trio of David Yates (director), Steve Kloves (screenplay) and Delbonnel (photography).Some people feel that the romantic comedy aspects played too large a role in the movie, but I felt this aspect added some much-needed lightness and human drama to the movie. Harry (Daniel Radcliffe), Hermione (Emma Watson) and Ron (Rupert Grint) all find themselves dealing with the vagaries of young love - from dealing with unwanted advances to finding love in unexpected places. The romance was aimed perfectly at the young teen market, and I found myself cringing ruefully at some of Lavender Brown's love-obsessed stunts and smiling wistfully at the tenderness between Harry and Ginny. Haven't we all been there at some stage of our lives?All in all, Harry Potter is growing up. And so is the market for these movies. If you've seen all the movies up to now or read all the books, and your are at an age to appreciate the adult themes and movie techniques, this movie should fall pitch-perfect on your ear. You are likely to leave the cinema filled with a heart-wrenching sadness for innocence lost. Purist fans will most certainly complain bitterly about numerous sub-plots, events and characters that were cut from the movie and the odd scene that doesn't exist in the book. But Yates' truly gutsy adaptation really works and brings a depth and clarity to the main themes of the book that is quite extraordinary. He manages to capture the lingering lightness of that time before the serious business of adulthood sets in, alongside the relentless buildup to the final showdown between The Dark Lord and The Chosen One. And the lack of closure at the end of the movie is no accident, I believe. Just like the book, this movie leaves you aching to see how it all ends (never mind the fact that you already know).I must also commend the acting. The young leads have all matured in pace with the maturing content of the books and their acting shows it. Rupert Grint shines brightly in the somewhat Shakespearean love comedy he finds himself in, and makes the most of his new-found sport hero popularity. Emma Watson hits the spot, portraying Hermione's emotional vulnerability with gentle confidence and softness.As for Radcliffe, it's easy to miss the evolution he's undergone as Harry, since there are other actors ostensibly given more to do in this outing, like Tom Felton and Bonnie Wright, both of whom get the opportunity to take their characters to a new level. Tom Felton, especially, does a remarkable job. But Radcliffe's task of playing the steadfast and courageous, yet not flashy or arrogant hero, remains a difficult one. Especially on second viewing, it becomes clear how his understated and controlled performance speaks very much to the type of man Harry Potter is shaping up to be. A man who is left with a tremendous responsibility at the end of this movie and takes it up without flinching. The boy-wizard is no more.Of the older guard, Alan Rickman's Snape was a consummate performance, ... obviously. And Michael Gambon's portrayal of Dumbledore never felt more right than in this movie. Jim Broadbent's Slughorn is deliciously played with just the right mix of off-putting sycophancy and endearing pathos.All in all - a triumph all around!",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
666,charlenemain-1,How to enjoy this movie if you're a fan of the HP Books,3,15 July 2009,"Last night I had gone to the midnight showing of the movie. This morning I wrote a review (below) b/c I wanted to express how disappointed I was. However, I still had tickets to go see it this afternoon. I certainly did not want to sit there for another 2 hours hating it so I had to find a way to like it. I really, really wanted to like this movie. I love HP, afterall! I decided to try another approach, to watch the movie without thinking of the book at all. And I'll be da*ned if it didn't work! I realized that I had spent so much time picking apart what the movie DID NOT have, that I never allowed myself to enjoy what it DID have. Once I did that, and accepted that this movie is merely ""based on"" the book, I was able to enjoy it! Suddenly, the love story did not seem to dominate as much as it did on my first viewing.....Honestly, I never really thought that changing the way I approached the movie would work, but it did. So, if your a really big fan of the books and cd's, and you really want to find some way to enjoy this movie, I suggest you leave all the knowledge you have of the books at home, sit back, and watch! I started reading reviews last week, so I was aware that all the really good stuff in the book wasn't going to be in the movie. Still I was excited and stood in line for almost 3 hours to see this movie. When I left I felt very, very disappointed. I couldn't believe what I watched, this was a joke, right? Sure that other Harry Potter fans felt the same way, I started to read the fan reviews. Now I'm wondering....did I miss something? How is it this movie is getting such rave reviews?? Did anyone not notice all the plot moments that were changed or left out completely? SPOILERS************************************************ I so wanted to see Dumbledore give the Dursley's their due. And how about Harry and Dumbldore going on the journey to view the Marvolos and Voldomorts father? And lets not even talk about the best part of the book, the fight at the castle. I read somewhere that the director did not want to do the fight because of the fight in book 7. I mean really, come on, that's probably the lamest excuse I've ever heard. Ya know, I never even shed a bloody tear when they killed Dumbledore. There was no emotional work up to it, in my opinion, it was really weak. When I read the book, I cried for days! Well, maybe that's why I did not during the movie....I already mourned him :-) I knew their had to be a lot of things that did not make it in the movie, I just assumed it would be the teenage love angst. Especially given the action films this movie is competing against.But then again, it's getting great reviews, so I think I'm part of the minority of people who were really, really hoping to get a Harry Potter movie that would make JK Rowling proud, at least when she cared.The movie was funny, absolutely. But that's all it was, except for the last 30 minutes. The last 30 minutes, like the 5th movie, is the best part, IMO. But, that's not saying much.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
667,dbalay,Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - I was expecting more...,6,15 July 2009,"Harry Potter and the half blood prince is a highly entertaining and truly enjoyable movie. The movie overall is very good and a light hearted look at the trials and tribulations of growing teens and the relationships they ""enjoy"" plus the usual twists. In many ways the scenes are stolen by the outstanding performance of Rupert Grint. He will have you rolling on the floor laughing your @$$ off. Alan Rickman does his usual outstanding job as the ever formidable Professor Snape. Once again we are not sure if we should love him or hate him though it becomes apparent if one reads into the story a little deeper. As a newcomer (actually returning teacher) Jim Broadbent plays a very entertaining but not quite readable Professor Slughorn. Peculiar, yes, but not quite as intriguing as most of the other 'single season' professors have been. What this movie lacks is the depth. The intrigue, the mystery, the suspense and the excitement. These components all exist, but are too superficial and run by much too quickly. The characters never have a chance to draw on or show their deeper thoughts and emotions, even near the end at the movie's 'big event', when one would expect a great outpouring we have but a moment's silence and unity. No sparks, no thunder...where is the depth? The hugely charismatic Helena Bonham Carter and other villains are on screen for only a glimpse a half dozen times or less and the ever Epic battle of good vs evil..............well, you will have to see it to believe it. The cinematography and score are terrific as expected, but perhaps it is in the direction that the multi-layered characters are flattened out. Chris Columbus and Mike Newell got it..as for David Yates....has he ever read the books? I will certainly buy the DVD and enjoy it again but somehow just expected more.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
668,Chaser120,Alright but kind of disappointing,5,15 July 2009,Overall this movie was not that bad. However I will say that some parts of the book were completely destroyed by this movie. They took out necessary or large parts of the novel and put in random scenes that were never in the book and that served no purpose. I realize that they need to cut things out of the movies because the books are so long but they did not even make good use of the time they had because of the scenes they added that should not have been there. I also felt they focused too much on the relationship aspect and took out a whole bunch of important details that will make the events in the 7th movie much harder to explain in my opinion. I think the writers were relying on people who read the books to understand the back stories that they never explained at all in the movie. Overall it was an okay film but parts of it just left me extremely disappointed.,Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
669,snowy1965,Bitterly Disappointed,3,15 July 2009,"I went to watch this movie on opening night with high hopes. The series had been building wonderfully up until now. So what went wrong?? I get that films have to cut out a quite a bit of the book as otherwise they would be too long. However why oh why did they add bits that did not belong. For example the attack on the Weasley house. Was that needed? No. However it wasted time that could have been used on other things.The was no where near enough explanation about the Horuxes. My other half who has not read the books was totally perplexed by them & although got that they contain part of Voldermorts soul, did not get the importance of them.If Harry shut his eyes when the book was hidden, he would not see something crucial in the final book (note I am trying not to spoil too much here).My main gripe though has to be the ending. Had not so much emphasis & time been spent on the raging hormones going on in Hogwarts (honestly you could have conveyed it brilliantly in half the time they spent on it, it really was too contrived in the end) they could have stayed true to the book.Where was the huge fight scene? Do they really believe that people will take that Death Eaters came into Hogwarts & no one did a thing? Are we meant to believe that Harry actually did as he was told for a change & did not go to Dumbledores aid? There is a reason that Dumbledore froze Harry in the book. It was to stop him from trying to save him. There is a reason that in the book the whole school fought the Death Eaters too. That is because it is simply unimaginable that they would get into the castle without people fighting back.I cant believe that the people who made this movie thought that they should cut out the fight scene so that people do not get bored with it due to the seventh & eight movie? It was vital for heavens sake! There has been a fight scene at the end of every movie yet this one they suddenly think they should omit the most important fight scene to date? The fight for Hogwarts? Shame on the people that made this movie. Lets not forget also the unexplained way the Twins managed to set up their shop when their parents are so poor. Or the relationship between Tonks & Remus Lupin? This movie to me is the same as in the Star Wars movies (the original ones) when we had The Empire Strikes Back. This is what the Half Blood Prince is the equivalent too & it shouldn't have been. It was never a bridging book between five & seven, but not good as a stand alone book. It was a brilliant stand alone book & should have been the same as a movie. However it missed the mark badly. I really hope they do a better job on The Deathly Hallows, as I feel a lot of people will have been put off by this dismal failure.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
670,a153313,By far the weakest in the series and a very weak movie to boot,1,20 July 2009,"This was by far the weakest movie in the series. I brought a person to the movie with me that has never read a HP book, nor has she seen a HP movie. I though the movie was weak compared to the book which was full of lush details and motivations entirely lacking in the movie. Then I looked at her face and knew she was thinking ""say what?""Were you to see this movie on its own without reading any of the books it would not stand by itself. A movie needs, to stand alone, to be complete with character development and plot.

I seriously wasn't sure if this was the same movie... Why didn't Dumbledore pick Harry up from the Dursleys and give them a piece of his mind? Where was the Slug Club? Why didn't Harry know that Sirius' house was now his? not to mention Kreacher? It plays a big part in the next movies! Why weren't the lessons with Dumbledore fully developed? You find out almost NOTHING about Voldemort's past. Where were Bill and Fleur? Where was the twins' shop? (Blink and you miss it) Where was Hagrid? Where was Neville? Where was Quiditch? Where was Tonks' and Lupin's relationship??? What, am I just supposed to believe that they get married out of nowhere in the next book? Where was Madam Rosmerta's role? Where were apparition lessons? How are the trio meant to move from place to place in the next books? Magic Carpet?!?!?! Where was Dumbledore's funeral? Where was Harry's and Ginny's relationship and break-up? Where was Scrimgeour? Where was the big fight at the end? Where was the set up with the diadem? Where was Fenrir Greyback? WHY for the love of all that's holy, did Harry just STAND there while Snape murdered Dumbledore before his very eyes? He was meant to be PETRIFIED (literally)!!! And not only that, but Snape actually SEES Harry, and does nothing about it. Won't Harry find it kinda odd that a Death Eater sees him, practically defenceless, and doesn't do anything about it? Harry is meant to believe that Snape is a full fledged Death Eater, yet he lets Harry get off scott free? That is a SERIOUS oversight in the plot of the book! All these things listed above, the major plot points, weren't there! I couldn't find them!What I COULD find however was: The burning down of the burrow...?!? Dumbledore seeming to only JUST realize that Voldemort used Horcruxes even though he was meant to have already destroyed one... and not only that but I also explicitly heard Dumbledore say: ""They could be anything""!!! In the book, he clearly points out that they WOULDN'T be just anything, that Riddle liked collecting things. In the movie, he makes out as if it could be any old thing, a shoe, a can, a piece of paper... (better get searching then Harry, I found the ring, because ""Magic leaves traces"", but when I die, you're screwed!!!) Some random waitress in some random diner... A rock concert tribute to Dumbledore... A revealing of Hermione's love for Ron... and i DEFINITELY found Ron's and Lavender's relationship and... sexual innuendo?? OK, the Ron and Lavender subplot in the book was quite nice and funny but in the movie, it completely shadowed the ACTUAL story! they were snogging all over the place! it was impossible to focus on anything else with them popping up everywhere! It turned the movie into some sickly rom-com! and then I was shocked to find sexual innuendo! yup, believe it or not. And i know I wasn't the only one because i heard laughs and hoots all around the theater. The scene where Ginny bends down to tie Harry's shoelaces... what is up with that? Hey hang on a minute, isn't Harry's cloak meant to be a hallow? Good thing Luna CHARMED it off him then!!!MASSIVE SPOILERS AHEADSo, not only did they destroy the capodopera that this movie could have been, but they also didn't set up the next movie/s. How are Harry, Ron and Hermione going to start looking for the Horcruxes if they don't even know what they COULD be? How are the contents of Dumbledore's will going to be passed along if Scrimgeour doesn't even exist? How is Harry going to remember that Xenophilius was wearing the symbol of the Hallows at the wedding if the WEDDING CAN'T EXIST??? And HOW is Voldemort going to get the wand from Dumbledore's tomb if 1. the TOMB Isn't THERE and 2. THE WAND Isn't IN THE TOMB ANYWAY!!! How is Harry meant to remember where the diadem was if he NEVER BLOODY SAW IT!!!! How are they going to use Grimmauld Place and Kreacher, not to mention Dobby if there was never even a whisper about what happened to them???This movie was thoroughly disappointing, and I really think they should... remake it basically!!! Because not only was THIS movie bad, but it's set to ruin the next ones as well. The only slim ray of hope (because hope springs eternal) left for the next movies is that they include what they missed out in HBP at the start of the first seventh one.

672,erikawolford,Bad adaptation,3,16 July 2009,"I agree that this was a horrible representation of the book. I felt like half of the story and characters were cut out (where has Dobby been, he plays an important role after all!!!??) and even changed (Ginny does not cry over boys, come on!! and since when does Dumbledore need to ask Harry permission for anything, it seemed like the two were more buddies than professor and student).

Rowling extremely disappointed. The cinematography and effects were outstanding. However, Many facts and events that are crucial to the storyline, such as Harry and Dumbledore's ""lessons"" which explain the horcruxes and the reasoning behind Tom Riddle's choices for them, were left out of the film. Scenes were added into the film that never happened in the book and proved to have NO significance to the storyline Such as the Christmas scene at the burrow with LeStrang. If the makers of this film were so keen on adding action scenes into the movie to keep it moving, then maybe they should have thought about the huge fight scene with the death eaters at Hogwarts on the night of Dumbledore's death, which actually did take place in the story. At the end, Harry picks up Dumbledore's wand from his desk, which anyone who read the books knows that it was with the headmaster in his grave. This is ,unfortunately, a major error made in the film will make it almost impossible for the final chapter to come to the big screen without the film makers looking stupid.

The special effects were great, the acting was as good as in the prior movies, but nothing much happens in this one. In fact the movie had more the feel of a long-running soap opera than a feature film. A lot of time was spent covering teen romances. A lot more time was used to drop hints about things one presumes will come in future movies, but which lend nothing to this one. Not to worry though, the movie has enough logical inconsistencies in it to distract you while you're waiting for nothing to happen.

Halfway through the movie I waited it to end. But this was a complete and utter waste of time. Yes, it follows the book to a point but did it have to be a 2h+ movie for that.

676,fearcheol,An Epic Treat For The Eyes And Ears! Don't let it leave the cinema before you see it,9,18 July 2009,"Okay so I'll divide this into each quality of the film.Plot: Slightly Lacking. This is a tricky one considering that there really wasn't that much happening in the book and so it makes it harder for the creators to work on the piece. Books are totally different to movies in the sense that its usually a one person effort, this means that they can focus on other factors if they know the plot is lacking. So its harder for a large film crew because its a much larger product. Would've probably benefited from more of the new interference of magic with muggles rather than just at the beginning.(7/10) Script: Extremely well balance. Jokes, off-topic parts, sad tones, teen lingo and serious parts all contributed to a well thought out script. (9/10)Screen play: Locations and character actions were really stuck out well in this movie. Although some scenes were a little bit pro-longed and could have been shortened to allow for a more intense final few scenes. (8/10)Cinematography: Wow.... I mean Wow! This really just blew me away. Words can't describe how beautiful some of the scenes were in this film. There were times when just wished the movie would pause so that i could look at the incredible set-up and scenery in this film. Times when my focus was just wrenched from the characters to look at something else and then be taken back to them just when we needed to. And one scene that really made me shiver! Its the camera-work that really makes this film succeed. Honestly DelBonnel has got it in the bag! And by that i mean a well deserved Oscar. (10/10)Score: I really liked Hooper's score myself. Although only really apparent at some points of the film. But personally think this was the best thing to do. Williams score for the first few was nothing short of genius but when you get this far in a series you start to want to look for more. The theme of Harry Potter is already known to everyone whose seen it. Even if Hooper had done an incredibly absorbing score that stole the show, everyone would still probably only remember the one that started the whole thing off! (8.5/10)Characters: Radcliffe (Harry)was really exceptional in this one. He's matured an awful lot. Really fit into his role, becoming less modest about being so important.He displayed anger in a much more controlled way than in Order of the Phoenix and Azkaban. We even get to see a completely different side to him which really showed how good an actor he has become! Watson (Hermione) has also matured very well in this one. Little more desperate as a troubled character. Hormones obviously having an effect with many of people But mostly with her as it makes her the most upset. Her and Harry's bond becomes so more apparent She has also become a fine young actress.Grint (Ron): Brings great laughs even better acted than ever before! Never went over the top with his antics Able to show how important friendship with Harry is. Gotten used to the fact that his best friend is so famous!Gambon ( Dumbledore): Finally came to a par with Richard Harris. Truly was the magical old man that everyone loves. Has such an ability to use his character as anything he wanted it to be. In any situation.Felton (Malfoy):Great part in this film. Sure if he continues his acting career he could very well be a great villain in many many films!Wright ( Ginny): Captivating! Probably had the most attention from the entire audience Dominance and strength was such a surprise! Sudden love interest a bit too sudden. Should be an even greater delight in the next one.Id say more about the characters but there's too many to go through",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
677,Dan_og,Extremely Disappointing,1,20 July 2009,"How anyone could enjoy this film after reading the books is beyond me. Some extremely mediocre acting throughout with Gambon spearheading with a dreadful Dumbledore. Again i feel that the board behind the films at still hurting by the bad choice of casting in Daniel Radcliffe that can obviously not act...They have added many an extra unnecessary scene such as the attack on the burrow by Fenir and Bellatrix which is definitely not in the book.They also missed the main scene (in my opinion), the funeral of Dumbledore. I respect that it would be very hard to live up to the books but i think they have ruined it. I know some people would of enjoyed it but the general acknowledgment amongst my friends it that it was highly disappointing. Hoping they will not disappoint so much for the next film.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
678,ginnyhayes,"Harry Potter and the... Eh, Just Don't Even.",1,24 July 2009,"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince was horrible. Don't get me wrong: The acting was great, the score was amazing, the scenery beautiful... The only thing wrong? The plot. They absolutely BUTCHERED the book--and while I (and millions of others) agree that YES, they cannot fit everything from the book into the movie, I (also like many others) do say that there were some HUGE plot points that they skipped and they took trivial, two-sentence moments from the book and made THOSE into the main parts of the movie. Oh, and let's not forget how much they added! But I'll just list it out for you:1. Does anyone remember the Burrow burning down in the book? No? Oh, that's right--it doesn't. But in the movie it does! Don't ask why--no one knows. 2. They never really mentioned that Fenrir Greyback was a werewolf. He just looked like a yellow-eyed, exceptionally hairy man. 3. They never/barely mentioned or showed Bill and Fleur--and they didn't mention the wedding. So I don't know they're going to start the 7th movie--with a random wedding? Non-book readers, get ready for some surprises! 4. Where was Hagrid? And Neville? They both only had, like, 2 scenes each and they resorted Neville back to the fumbling loser he was before, when he SHOULD have been becoming more of a take-charge kind of guy, like he was in the Hallows. 5. Where was ANYONE, for that matter? All of those characters we know and love (and sometimes love to hate) weren't there! Or if they were, they had really minor scenes! McGonagall and Parvati and Flitwick and LUNA and people like them. 6. Where were all the memories? The Horcrux discussions? The evening lessons? Everyone heard Dumbledore clearly say (of the Horcruxes), ""They could be anything."" Riiight--wasn't Dumbledore supposed to have an inkling of what they might be? What is Harry supposed to do now, guess all of them?7. And what was up with Dumbledore JUST finding out that Voldemort was using Horcruxes? That is wrong/weird for two reasons: A) Dumbledore is supposed to have all the answers, so that was weird and B) He had already acquired the ring and destroyed it--if he didn't know Voldemort was using Horcruxes, why? Did he just feel like smashing it?8. There was no battle at the end. The Death Eaters kind of just waltzed in, trashed some things and then killed Dumbledore (while Harry cowered in fear, by the way, which is so wrong). Then they left, after smashing some windows. And all this happened while everyone was asleep, I might add.9. Oh, and then, Hagrid took Dumbledore's body outside and somehow, everyone was randomly outside, staring at his body and not even crying or looking sad...? 10. There was no funeral. Okay... so what did they do to Dumbledore's body? Threw it in a sack, I guess. 11. And the Flight of the Prince was so lame. It wasn't dramatic at all, Harry's and Snape's expressions were so wooden I thought they were trees, and it was all over in about three seconds. 12. Harry and Ginny's get-together and break-up... neither was there. One day Ginny was with Dean, the next she was with Harry. And then at the end... they were still together. Okay, then. And they never showed Harry awkwardly realizing he liked Ginny. I mean, why show THAT when you could show Ron and Lavender thrashing about all the time, right...?13. And then Hermione blurted out her love for Ron. Great and all--but what are they going to do for the Hallows now?14. And all the random, awkward, unexplained moments. Like: Ginny tying Harry's shoelaces, or Hermione blurting out--almost right after Dumbledore died--""Oh, Harry, by the way: Ron is okay with you dating Ginny."" Um... what? So, basically, the movie was more like a 99 percent Ron-and-Lavender- and-Hermione love triangle than a Harry-and-Ginny or a Harry-and- Dumbledore-and-memories sort of thing. Wonderful! And yes, I am a die- hard fan (have read each book about 200 times--not kidding) but I am NOT biased. Order of the Phoenix pretty much... sucked, but I let it go, and enjoyed it, 'cause at least it had SOME of the main parts! Like the fight at the end, right? But this? Let's just put it like this: if I had a magic wand, I wouldn't use it to do magic--I'd use it to stab myself in the eyes. Cheerio, Ginny (and that's really my name)",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
679,scribblehearts-1,The Half-Blood Prince Movie was a HUGE disappointment!,4,21 July 2009,"The Half-Blood Prince Movie was a HUGE disappointment! :( It was utter nonsense! I don't know what crazy people wrote the script and story line for the movie, but it was completely at ends with the book. This might sound like a harsh review, but I'm sure they could have done a better job if they just put more effort -- after all, they did postpone the movie from last November until the middle of July. That's a good half a year! They could have edited much more within that huge gaping time span.The opening was unrelated, and they totally forgot about introducing Scimegour as the new Minister of Magic and Fleur & Bill. How are they supposed to fix that in the next two movies (7th book)? I mean the wedding was an important chapter and Scimegour needed to give Dumbledore's will... The movie's opening -- the whole subway/train thing was entirely stupid, pointless. To change to that from the important book opening with the Other Minister? I don't think it was a good choice at all. The 6th was supposed to lead up to the next book, and act as a solid foundation. With skipped scenes, people who haven't read the books will be confused.The movie was out of order -- the Unbreakable Vow wasn't even introduced until like a half hour into the movie. Bellatrix was supposed to question Snape more, and Narcissa didn't fit the part as Draco's blonde mother.A major negative was the whole Burrow-catches-on-fire-scene. What was that all about? It had nothing at all to do with the plot; it didn't contribute anything! Where are the Weasleys supposed to live in the 7th & 8th movies? How is that supposed to be where Bill & Fleur's wedding takes place if it's BURNED TO THE GROUND?! Plus, the movie was called the HALF-BLOOD PRINCE, but where was the book?!! They briefly showed it. The part with the Room of Requirement was wrong, too. Ginny did not accompany Harry there so that he would never find the book again. Actually in the book, Harry went there to hide the book from Snape after the Sectumsempra incident with Malfoy. That was a crucial scene in explaining how Harry finds the diadem of Ravenclaw in the 7th book.& To those who defend that ""movie's must be adapted,"" well, J.K. Rowling's books were masterpieces that would have been brilliant left alone. They entirely skipped the battle scene and funeral - two huge chunks of the book's ending. I mean, really -- how can you DO that? The editors could have chosen to delete un-needed scenes, but to get rid of some of the most important ones and to add entirely fake scenes that didn't develop the plot in any way was just plain stupid. The movie gets most its viewers from fans of the BOOKS. It's called HARRY POTTER AND THE HALF-BLOOD PRINCE because it is supposed to represent the BOOK.T__T The whole movie was extremely dark and gloomy - very gray and dull. Instead of trying to be overly artistic, they should have added more color, since it was kind of hard to tell when it was day and night. Overall, maybe a 4/10 - a stretch for the poor adaptation from book to movie. To sum it up: it was a poor excuse for a Harry Potter movie.No one in my theater clapped.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
680,Lord_regent,Heed the warnings. Movie falls dreadfully short of preceding ones,6,22 July 2009,"I've enjoyed the first 5 movies to date without having read the books or needing to. But this movie was obviously off the pace of its predecessors. My wife who has read every book was able to answer my 30 some questions. Which leaves me pondering why the producers who have done so well with the previous movies, botched this one up Soooo badly. As you read around the other reviews they make it clear what is missing from the books. But even a person such as myself could tell the pacing and characters were way off. Don't get me wrong. The actors have grown and the movie focused on their personal growth and relationships. We got to see more of everyones growth including specific bad guys like Draco. The special effects were as always top notch but i would expect no less from a Potter movie. But not the blockbuster I was hoping for. No great magic fight in the school. Missing characters. Many explanations not offered as it's assumed everyone read the books. Overall. It just fell short. Hopefully the final 2 part movie covering book 7 will overcome all the short comings of this movie.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince

Just came back from the play of HP-The Half Blood Prince. After an hour and a half of cheesy college teenage romance i gave up. I woke up at the very end of it and i've never been so happy to leave. Slow paced, out of track and an horrible screenplay for those who've read the book and especially for those who haven't read one of the most exciting book of the series. The book still has excitement throughout all of the story. The movie doesn't at all. At the moment i don't even feel like to trust to go see the very next and last one.

682,bregette_101,Half blood prince was OK... but it's not gonna be in my favourite movie list.^^,8,27 July 2009,Well for me ... I thought the movie was OK having read the books at least 3 times each. The 6th movie of the Harry Potter series focused more on the emotion part. The emotions were very apparent in the film which blended well with the cinematography and the music. I appreciate the fact that they developed the Harry/Ginny relationship in the film since it was a shocker for some of the readers to see this couple happening. Considering that Harry Potter and the Half blood prince is a pretty long book. I thought the film version was pretty well done. Although I would have been thrilled if they included Voldemort's very dark past(killing his own family for one) and also the battle at Hogwarts and Dumbledore's funeral. Oh well.. what can i expect. It's pretty hard to turn a novel into a book. I wish they could have done the ending part better though.. sighHalf blood prince was OK... but it's not gonna be in my favourite movie list.^^but even with all these things... I still love the 6th HP movie. And rate it an 8.5/10.,Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
683,missyoung_1990,Harry Potter and the Half-Assed Film,1,29 July 2009,"What an total and utter disappointment.I am a Die Hard Harry Potter fan who owns all of the books, but I unfortunately had to take a break from reading the books do do other things. However. I made sure to read the book 1 week before I saw the movie, hoping that the magic which I envisioned manifested itself on the big screen.No such luck.Kudos to Danielle Radcliffe and the others for maintaining a great performance of what little they had to work with. And my God was it sparse. The Order of the Phoenix should have been a tell-tale sign of the nonsense that was to come, as it too was missing chunks of story line. It's like it all went down hill from the Goblet of Fire. Here are more than a few discrepancies: 1. Who the hell was that chick in the café? And what the hell was Harry even DOING in a café? In the book, he is first shown asleep with his head placed on the glass of his window.2. The Dudleys have vanished.3. THE NEW PRIME MINISTER AIN'T EVEN MENTIONED. Neither are his two encounters with Harry.4. The Muggle Prime Minister didn't get his debut.5. Fleur and Bill are non-existent.6. Tonks? M.I.A.7. Harry's little chat with Mr. Weasley? 8. Harry's encounter with the Malfoys in Diagon Alley? 9. What the HELL were Harry, Hermione and Ron doing on the roof of a building spying into the window at Borgin & Burkes? Where was the invisibility cloak? And the Death Eaters aren't even supposed to be there! 10. The Horwarts Express was all wrong...it should have been how it was in their first year, with private compartments.11. Tonks fixes Harry nose, not Luna. He is also escorted into Hogwarts by Snape.12. Hagrid's gone missing, And NEVILLE WAS SUPPOSED TO BE A PART OF THE SLUG CLUB, NOT A BUS BOY.13. Slughorn isn't nearly as fat as he's supposed to be.14. Voldemort is pretty much not even a part of the story line anymore.15. Half of the memories are missing.16. The fight scene between some of the students and the Death Eaters--gone.17. In the book, Dumbledore is killed at one of the entrances, not inside. and Harry isn't even under Petrificus Totalus OR his invisibility cloak--which plays a major part in the book.18. The Phoenix doesn't sing.19. The scene where Harry is in Dumbledore's office with ALL the professors? Not even there.20. Professor Trelawney's encounter with the Room Of Requirement--gone 21. Ginny doesn't accompany Harry to hide Ron's book 22. Ron's Birthday is missing, which is how he managed to eat the love potion in the first place.23. Why was Ron's house on fire? 23. Dumbledore's funeral doesn't take place, which is quite unbelievable...you may as well not even put Harry in the movie. I actually cried at the end of the book because it was so moving.I'm just going to stop, as I could go on for days. I feel like finding David Yates and punching him in the face for being to damn lazy. And that's really what it came down to. LAZYNESS. How can you cut out key elements of the book and replace them with crappy teenage love scenes? This isn't Twilight, it isn't even in the same ball park. Ms. Rowling ought to sue this fiend for putting the name of her hard work on this lame excuse for a film. It should be completely remade by the director of the first film. He knew what he was doing.If you are a die hard Harry Potter fan, or even just a big fan of the movies, don't waste your time or your money on this rubbish. You'll be thoroughly confused and disappointed. The plot isn't even there. David Yates must have vomited all over it and tossed it out like he did with this film. That's what happens when you put lazy, greedy people in charge of projects. They give you a piece of crap they wiped their asses with and expect you not to notice the smell. I'm sorry I must be so harsh, because I am truly a fan of all of the actors, but that vile man must be stopped.David Yates, you sicken me.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
684,dcsnga85,Loads better than the first 5 put together,10,3 August 2009,"I just watched the movie again for the second time. I have to say, this movie is by far the best of the series so far. I agree that it does not follow the book 100%, but things are left out in all the movies, and this one was 2 1/2 hours long even! Besides the ending battle being out, the burrow burning, and all the quirky scenes between harry and Ginny (I love the pairing but I don't think Bonnie whats-her-face has enough personality for Ginny's character) I thought they did an excellent job with the details from the book. This movie was how they should have made the other 5 movies; The acting was very much improved on everyone's part, the smaller scenes practically matched the book word-for-word, and the visual effects were absolutely stunning (dumbledores ring of fire, anyone?) All in all, my disappointment by the lack of some details was completely overshadowed by everything else in this movie. If the next 2 movies are anything like this one was, Harry Potter will have a tremendous ending.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
685,imaginedrakons,"Funny,Richly colored, and dark.",8,20 August 2009,"While some people may see this Harry Potter as a disappointment, I find it to be quite the opposite. While the movie does leave some parts out, David Yates did a good job cutting down the book so that it had a reasonable running time but still had key points in the story. Daniel Raddcliffe (Harry Potter) Was excellent, Although he was not as good compared to his older peers, such as the always wonderfully dark Alan Rickman(Severus snape), and the Manic and beautiful Bonnie Wright as Bellatrix Lestrange. The Cinematography was beautiful, capturing the dark yet rich tone of the movie. Also, I found this movie much more humorous then the past installments. Emma Watson is amazing at capturing the sweet yet troubled in love Hermione, and Rupert Grint gives a funny yet only passable performance as Ron Weasley.Bonnie Wright was the only Actress who I found to be very terrible at playing her role, which was a very easy one. In the few scenes in which she appeared, Bonnie gave a flat, Rather card-board performance as Ron's sister and Harry's love interest. The special effects were once again fantastic, and the final quidditch match in the series was well done.While I do advise viewers to get a little background info from reading the book or consulting a friend who knows about the series before seeing the movie, simply because it can get a little confusing. Over all, Harry Potter and The Half-Blood Prince is a Great and Triumphant movie.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince

I was soooo wrong... Second half the same interaction... No action, everything stupid and predictable.

687,tim-devisser86,"Good Romantic Comedy, although the book was more of a thriller",6,8 August 2009,"Stripped of all context and pretension, Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, is a nice romantic comedy. If you are looking for a teenage romance and some innocent laughs, look no further. You will like this movie, and I don't resent you for it. That being said, I do not believe that the people making HBP understood the roll that the source material plays in the Harry Potter saga. In the book, Harry is faced with the reality that there is no one to protect him from the vengeance of Lord Voldemort, and that he himself cannot protect those he loves. It is the beginning of the end, as the inevitability of his confrontation with his arch-nemesis is driven home by the murder of his mentor. It is a thriller. The fact that the movie focuses instead on Harry's budding love life is difficult to swallow for a fan of the book. This sixth installment is also the book in which professor Snape's loyalty as a double agent is suspect. In the book, Snape's ability to conceal his true emotions and thoughts is second to none, whereas Alan Rickman portrays him as transparently hesitant. This ruins the ""surprise"" (or at least the catharsis) of his eventual redemption in the final installment. The suspense of the source material, the darkness that the death of Dumbledore deserves, the doubt and fear that Harry should feel at the end, as he sets off alone to find the hidden pieces of Voldemort's soul, is not adequately conveyed. There is no Battle of the Astronomy Tower or Funeral for Dumbledore (two of the most iconic scenes in the book). The film instead concentrates on comic relief and high school romance in a way that draws the attention away from the main plot line of murder and betrayal. And not in a good way. As a result, HBP does not serve the same purpose as its source material. That being said, the film is generally well designed, shot and acted. Many of the child actors have come into their own and the special effects are top notch. It is funny and usually touching at the appropriate times. Even the darker scenes are executed with the intended effect. This does not make it a dark movie, though. It is not a bad movie in and of itself, but it does fail to focus on what seems to be the main plot line of the book. The book is a great thriller, whereas the movie is just a decent romantic comedy. The 6 out of 10 -I confess- is more a result of my purism and disappointment than the quality of the movie.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince

But I really didn't like the movie. Way too much stuff got cut out, although funny (where it shouldn't have been) it was overall very blend.No idea if that's just me, but I think there were no immersion at all, seems like the sound/music or whatever was wrong, missing or something...I really hope they are not going to screw the two parts of the last one like this.

689,hchristoforidis,Maybe movie of the year,10,10 December 2009,"First of all, we must understand this: A novel and a movie based on a book, are two entirely forms of art. HP fans should stop blaming this movie for not being a filmed presentation of the book. In my opinion, as long as a director shows respect to the book, there are certain freedoms he/she can have, on the way of expressing themselves.I don't want a movie to give me the same feeling I felt when reading the book. That's impossible! After all I love reading and no movie can make me quit reading books. That's why reviews from people who haven't read the Half Blood Prince are way more correct and right from the readers of the series. We must judge the film by itself, as a film and not in comparison with the book. The same problem also happened with the Lord of the Rings movies. People, read the books, watch the movies and enjoy both of them! We judge a movie by it's script, directing, acting, sets, costumes, special effects (visual and sound), make up and music score.""Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince"" is an excellent movie, maybe the second best of the series, after ""Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire"". It's more dark, less fairytale-for-children like, more serious and amazingly dramatic, with some Dumbledor scenes that will be remembered for ever. The sets are beautiful, the acting is good, the script is decent and the music is just magic.It's been a while since we had a big budget film with this amount of drama, emotion and story-depth, in a way that makes 2012 looks even more ridiculous, cartoonish and like a fairy tale.

690,isacrame,Worst Movie Ever!,1,10 December 2009,"WORST MOVIE EVER! Why don't the directors start writing novels of their own, because it's evident that they cannot follow the ones Rowling has written. She should be appalled by the way they have completely disfigured her stories. I would. And I thought that the Order of the Phoenix film was bad!... This is much worse.Is it that difficult to stick to the stories?... We, the fans, want to watch what SHE has written. Can't the directors and screenwriters grasp that or are they too stupid and greedy? I'm only glad I didn't spend the money to watch it in the cinema, and sorry I bought it in DVD.I would have a large laundry list here of horrible and appalling things that they did in this movie, among them the very poor acting by all the parties (which can only be blamed on the director), but what disturbs me the most is the fact that Voldemort's past is practically erased when it should be the very central part of the film, as it is in the novel. It would have been wonderful to have all those flash-back memories come to life for us. Instead, we're left watching meaningless scenes that Rowling never wrote, and which totally distorted the novel.This book is also about the half-blood prince and Harry discovering the book. The mystery of unraveling who the prince is was laced throughout the plot of the book. In the movie, Snape merely blurts out that he's the half blood prince as if he just had some indigestion, which at that point was rendered meaningless by not having had all the precursor mystery.

First off, 2 hours and a half!!! i mean, for half the movie, we were just looking at Harry and his stupid fat head! he didn't even wear the scar in this movie! disgraceful! i think i should be the new harry potter! i mean, im charming, sexy, intelligent, six pack... anyway, lets move on. They should make this movie go quicker. The camera moves so slowly that i could've gone to China and back again and still the camera would be looking at Harry Potter crying over something retarded. And whats with him liking Ginny! i mean, he has all these hot girls (or men, i saw u Frank'n'furter)and he goes for the wranger who is younger than him! i mean, im not gonna go up to a girl thats in 2nd grade whilst im in 10th grade and ask her out! that's just disgusting! Anyway, im gonna have to wrap this up soon. So that idiot has given this a 5 out of 10. the next harry potter is split in two, so i guess about 4 hours for each movie. there wasn't much clips of harry potter ruddy crying that they gotta add more.

694,emmalaver92,For Harry Potter geeks everywhere... a disappointment.,4,14 June 2010,"*Continuous SPOILERS throughout* Okay, as a major Harry Potter geek, i expected to walk into the theatre to experience all the emotions, the darkness, and the magic that i saw in the book. Disappointingly, it had little to none. Lets start at the beginning... it was slightly random... no Dumbledore picking Harry up from the Dursleys, just Harry in a grimy café, hitting on a muggle girl. I didn't see the point in that. I will say, though, that i found Jim Broadbent as a near-perfect Slughorn, persuaded out of retirement by Dumbledore.Where was Tonks?! (And her relationship with Lupin?) And Harry's cloak is a hallow, so someone explain to me how Luna could jinx it off Harry?! This could prove a problem in the last film.Next, we have the sickly sweet introduction of Lavender Brown to Ron's life. At first, i found her to be a source of comic relief for the film, but after a few scenes, i just cringed at the sight of them. Especially the hospital wing scene. And the time could have been used for other omitted plots, such as Voldemort's mother's past... not even referenced to! The only memories shown is the orphanage one, and the horcrux one. I was quite looking forwards to Voldy's background, too. Another thing, Dumbledore is meant to have already destroyed a horcrux (hence the dead black hand), so why did he look so surprised after seeing the memory?? 'They could be anything' Yeah, thanks, DD! No mention of the fact Riddle likes collecting items of value. THAT could prove a problem in the next film! How did Harry get away with cursing Malfoy so easily?! No legilmens by Snape, no detentions, nothing.The burning Burrow.. wasn't in the book, supposedly put in 'for a bit more action'. On behalf of any devoted Harry Potter fan, it was completely unnecessary. Which could prove problems in the next film (yet again.) A major major plot was Malfoy fixing the broken cabinet, to let the death eaters into the school. They got in, Malfoy couldn't do it, Snape stepped in, there was no battle with the order, so what was the point of fixing the cabinet?? None.And although i love Helena Bonham-Carter's portrayal of Bellatrix, there is no mention of her in the book. And as for Greyback... any non-book readers confused? Cause nowhere was it said that he was a werewolf.Lastly, WHAT happened to the ending?! It was so abrupt... no emotional talk with Ginny, I couldn't sense the emotions of Harry, of his grieving of dumbledore (seeing as he didn't even have a funeral...) or the impending doom that awaits him in the final book, i sensed none of it.Yates focused too much on HBP being an action-packed, romance filled blockbuster, rather than the darkness that JK Rowling created, and staying loyal to the book.JK, i sincerely hope you didn't have a final say. The movie doesn't even begin to do the book justice.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
695,louisekraz,I know what is wrong with this movie...WHERE'S THE LOVE?,5,15 July 2009,"I know what is wrong with this movie and it is such a simple thing. The whole basis of the Harry Potter universe is the importance of love. Dumbledore tell us this all the time and it is not until Harry can understand the kind of love he is talking about —self-sacrificial, unequivocal, passionate devotion to others—that Harry can eliminate Voldemort and save the wizarding community.So, each of the movies in the series has to address this issue but this one doesn't fully understand the different kinds of love and sadly it mixes them up into an inconsistent mess. Love, the kind that saved Harry and the kind that will save us all, is not the same as being in love. Now, you could argue that the movie does address different kinds of love: there is adolescent love and infatuation (Ron and Lavender), love induced by force (Romilda Vane), self-love (McLaggen and Slughorn), a mother's love (Narcissa Malfoy), the love of true friends (Harry and Hermione). All of these are explored but they are not supplemented by true love. Granted, Dumbledore, in his death, is the one who demonstrates this but no one acknowledges it for what it was. There is no funeral and funerals are necessary for people to talk about this love. Harry doesn't react when McGonagall tells him Dumbledore really cared for him. The story is incomplete without the reminder of real love.I don't insist on being faithful to the books but I do insist on being faithful to the main theme of the Harry Potter world. Let me give you some examples of the misleading threads in this story, the ones that are inconsistent or even contradictory of that world as it has been created and as we all expect it to be.If Dumbledore is the one who knows above all other what this love is, he would not be making inquiries of Harry about his relationship with Hermione (he would either already know, or he would be able to tell by watching them). He also wouldn't suddenly become buddies with Harry, commenting on the hair on Harry's chin or the lost opportunity with the waitress in the Muggle café. Dumbledore doesn't suffer out loud much when he is drinking the potion in the cave and that is the scene in which we should learn of his deep love for the sister he let die. There is no hint of the pain a lost love brings.Not using the scenes from Privet Drive also weakens the point about love that Dumbledore always makes. When he goes there to chastise the Dursleys (in the book) he reminds us all about a mother's love and the protection it bestows. In this movie, we get the sense that Harry is now removed from all that. The burning down of the Burrow is simply wrong: this is where Harry learns of the love a family can give: is that now gone too? The movie has some very funny scenes about love (Ron eating the tainted candy is perfect) but the silliness is not part of a bigger story: it all just seems episodic, like little vignettes from a comedy series. The smart, passionate fans of the Harry Potter universe can handle the complexity of this subject but this movie, unfortunately, talks down to them. Needless to say, I don't love it.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
696,cryptstalkervisceri,Good films....with a few disappointments,8,5 September 2010,"Let me start off by saying I am a HUGE fan of both the books and the films...having read AND watched them (and listened to the audiotape) since I was 9. Having said that I've never found the films to be rubbish, despite other reviews which point out lack of content. Yes, Scrimegour does not appear(Bill Nighy will appear as him in DH) Yes, Big battle scene is left out Yes, No scolding of the Dursleys Yes, Robbie Coltrane hardly appears (forgive me Im a Hagrid fan) there's loads of missing stuff...but people seem to forget that Half Blood Prince is a 600+ book and that films rarely get more than 2 hours and a half. You cant squeeze in every single ruddy detail into a 2 hour film. I for one have always enjoyed the feel of these films, light and funny at the start and middle, and tragic in the end. The cast has always been excellent (Alan Rickman, Michael Gambon, Tom Felton and Emma Watson are a pleasure to watch)despite the fact that there are so many roles they manage to squeeze in a few lines all the time...and you get to appreciate that little time you get to see them in action (despite Timothy Spall not having proper dialogue since GoF)there are a few disappointments in this film tho.For Example Harry not being petrified, the rushed ending, Grawp, the funeral missing among others, but nevertheless I enjoyed it immensely 7.5 out of 10 from my part....8 cos Im a huge fan, cannot wait to see DH and am anxious to see John Hurt, Ralph Fiennes, Brendan Gleeson and DOBBY again",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
697,melipooh72,Disappointed despite the warnings.,7,29 July 2009,"Half-Blood Prince was my favorite Harry Potter book. I was so excited to see this movie. I couldn't wait to see the back stories. Voldemort's history, the Potters and Snape as teens at school, etc. I waited months and months after the movie release date was pushed back. I could not have set myself up for more disappointment.Friends and family saw the movie before I did since I waited to see it on IMAX (what a joke) and they all warned me that a lot was left out. What an understatement. Everything I was looking forward to was gone. What was left was a teenage soap opera. I couldn't care less about the evolution of Harry/Ginny or Ron/Hermoine. I cared about the real story.Even though I tried, I found it impossible to block out what was missing. I am not even sure I want to see the last movie(s). What is the point? If you haven't read the book and/or you are a teenage girl, you will probably love this movie. Since I don't fall into either category, I guess I am out of luck.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
698,CrimsonGalleon,Best movie ever,10,22 November 2011,"I went to see this movie at the midnight showing, and it was amazing! It's not only my favorite Harry Potter movie, but my favorite movie of all time. It had a great storyline and the story flowed really well. It would have made sense to any one pretty much (even if you hadn't seen the other films). It was still dramatic while continuing to have well written jokes. It also followed the book really closely (*SPOILER*: I don't really know why they had to blow up, then rebuild the burrow)and even included most details the other films didn't have. It also set up the next film, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1. I would recommend this move to anyone (even if they aren't a Harry Potter fan)and is great for a rainy day or family movie night.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
699,elyswim,The best of the Harry Potter Films!,9,17 July 2009,"I've allowed myself to sleep on the Harry Potter film before I decided to write about it. Frankly, last night at the end of the film, I was overwhelmed with excitement. I thought the movie was outstanding. Incredibly well made and quite funny. The child inside of me was excited at the magic both within the film and of the film. I follow here with thoughts on film design, content, and its conversion from book to film.Film design: In short, outstanding.Now having majored in film at the university I attended, it's difficult to determine what someone who hasn't studied film so extensively notices or does not notice. From the very first images of Half Blood Prince, I saw a dimly lit, fairly high contrast image with heavy blue/black color tone. This made the film seem more dark and ""artsy."" This is not to say that there were no warm colored scenes. Everything at the Weasley's house was very warm with earth tone colors. The contrast of these scenes with the rest of the film really made these scenes ""pop."" Indeed, the dark lighting sets the mood of the film, one that will stay with the series. And this mood is very appropriate as evil looms ever closer to the protagonist.Shot complexity was also fairly apparent. In certain parts the depth of the shot was essential to getting the ""joke"" set up in the film. Take for example when Ron was given the love potion and Harry took him to Slughorn. As the two talked we could see a blurry Ron in the background sit on the top of the couch and promptly fall over. These comedic moments add humor to the film but also make us aware of the complexity that the director/cinematographer duo intended. Undeniably this adds credence to those in charge over at Warner Brothers.I'm sure many could (and perhaps may) write a large paper on the topic of film design in Harry Potter, but I'll leave that for those that plan on getting paid for it (or plan on getting a grade for it). Let's move to content! Content: From book to Film In every Harry Potter book, save the last, there is a certain expectation of day-to-day activity that should be included. J.K. Rowling takes her time to explore the nuances of every class whether it be Charms or Professor Trelawney's admittedly useless fortune telling class. In the books, Rowling develops personalities for even these small side characters. Her words paint a portrait of a life that many kids probably wish for. It's this quality that makes her books so magical. I would love to be at Hogwarts flying on brooms, hanging out with Harry Potter and playing around with spells. Rowling allows to access this in our imagination while we read the books. As a result she has sold millions upon millions.This is where many have a problem with the movies. It would be financially stupid to include all these perspectives in a film that costs 29000$ a minute to make. The movie would have to be 10 hours long (if not longer!) No one would be willing to sit through it, and people would be bored! As a result, the movies present only the bare-bones plot with few frills. So while we actually have an image to look at, the nuances and daily life of Harry and his pals are lost. Thus, one of the main criticisms of the movie is that it simply takes out too much. Film is after all a business (and a very risky one at that). Producers and directors need to do what is best for the FILM, and not necessarily stay faithful to the story. Hence ""creative liberty."" Unfortunately, I had already read the books by the time the respective movies were released. I'd be curious to know if the movies are coherent as their own entity. Yes, they may be a bare bones plot compared to the book, but for those movie watchers who haven't read the books do you get the general gist of the plot? Overall, I thought Harry Potter was astoundingly well made, though there are criticisms about its plot and certain choice removals, I do think they were necessary and allow Harry Potter to be accessed by a wider audience. I hope this was informative.www.twitter.com/elyswim hopefullymakingfilms.wordpress.com",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
700,sheydel,Uhhhhhh........what happened?,2,26 December 2009,"Okay, I just purchased the DVD, Widescreen edition, and watched it on my 52"" flat-panel........and I have absolutely no idea what happened in this version of the novel. I turned all the lights off (had to), watched on the big-screen, and still could not see more than 50% of the movie. Why do directors think that the only way to impart mystery and drama is to turn out all the lights on the set? Honest, most of the movie was lost due to the utter absence of lighting of the scenes. Is it too much to ask that the viewer actually be able to SEE the movie?

701,grimplegrumple,Think of it as a first part of a trilogy,8,19 July 2009,"You gotta think of this as a first part of a trilogy. Things are starting to get to the final conclusion of the story. If you've read the final book, you enjoy the movie better knowing what is coming in the final two movies. If you haven't you feel like there is so much left out, but it's all in the final book. I do think that instead of the attack on the burrow, they could've had the attack on hogwarts giving some more time to Neville and Luna and what they end up doing in the final book, particularly Neville. One more very important thing they leave out, is one very important memory that gives Harry the clue to finding the final horcruxes in the last book, this was taken out and is very important to what they do in the future. Also, the kiss was totally lame. Harry was the one supposed to take initiative, not Ginny. Anyway, if you haven't read the last book, don't worry, everything SHOULD be explained in the final two films, so think of it as a first part of a trilogy and you might enjoy the movie more. If you read the final book after watching the movie, things will make sense.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
702,catherine_quincy,So disappointing it's surreal,10,27 July 2009,"************SPOILERS*********** I left the theater feeling much like I had after Order of the Phoenix: angry, disappointed and rather bewildered. The fact that I had spent 6hrs in line for this on opening night did little to ease my wretched mental state. There is little to say that hasn't already been mentioned by other reviewers, but I wanted to note a few things that annoyed me intensely within this farce of a script: The movie opens with Harry sitting in a train station café, catching the eye of the pretty waitress and looking pleased with himself for scoring a date with her. Apparently, a mere few weeks after Sirius's murder, Harry has completely forgotten his godfather, whom he loved as a brother and father-figure.When Dumbledore finally sees Slughorn's original memory, he says with horror that he had no idea the magic they faced was so dark as to involve horcruxes. And yet, about 10 seconds later, he tells Harry he thinks he might have already found another one of them. If he didn't even know he was looking for horcruxes, why would he have been searching for them? Ginny never breaks up with Dean in the movie, so it looks as though she is just two-timing him with Harry.In that joke of a Burrow scene, the death eaters just tease Harry with some spooky pyrotechnic special effects rather than make any real attempt to either kill or kidnap him. It didn't look like there was any magical protection on the place, so why didn't Voldemort just show up and do Harry in over Christmas? The whole scene only gave the impression that the death eaters are nothing but nasty pranksters who like to set houses on fire for fun...but they aren't really serious about killing Harry at all.Ginny hides the Prince's potions book in the RoR so that no other student (including Harry) can ever find and read it again. Why not just burn it then?!",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
703,YuskueLover,Disappointed Fan,7,16 July 2009,"The thing is, I really love harry potter. I had a total marathon of the past movies counting up the days until the movie came out. So, I really disappointed in the fact that the left out such crucial details of the Dark Lord's life. After watching the movie you would think that he's just a man who wants to be immortal not the truth behind him. Everything from hating his father and mother is completely left out. We got no good insight as to what happened so them. Even the ring, that was shown but not really explained. Furthermore the characters relationships were not built on more. The way that Snape and Dumbledore interacted in the book was more in-depth. The emphasis on the way that Dumbledore put all his trust into to Snape was shown. In the novel it was so clear absolutely how much that he trusted Snape it was crazy. After reading the 6th one, and the death of Dumbledore, I felt like he was such a old fool. But in the movie I got none of that sensation. Even the ending...where was the feeling, the passion, the feeling of doom and solemn that was about to take over them. I totally did not appreciate the whole line about Ron not caring that he was with Ginny. It was random it did not fit right there. Dumbledore has JUST DIED. Whats going on...No offense but the screen play writers tore up the book. I feel that the movie totally did not convey anything that was going on.Praise to Tom Felton and Alan Rickman though. Those scenes with them were the best. Tom Felton did a wonderful job showing the turmoil that he was going through with the job he was given. Even though he did not have a massive amount of lines, his face expression portrayed exactly what it supposed to. Alan Rickman like always did a good job as Snape. I love when he tells Dumbledore that he's asking too much and taking too much. Why in the world was that scene not extended.Another thing Voldemort(present self) was not in the whole movie. What happened to the scene where they were sitting around the table, with that floating teachers body above it??? Geez...the romantic scenes were acceptable but I'm just so THROUGHLY disappointed with the way they dealt with the flashbacks and the character interaction. AND how in the HECK do they NOT have THE death eaters ATTACK hogwarts like they were supposed to. Not was the best part in the whole novel. HOw could they leave such an action filled scene out of the m movie. There was barely action in the movie that would have spiced it up for everyone.Oh! But the darkness was enhanced greatly. I enjoyed it for sure. The scene with Katie Bell, Ron, and the Inferi WAS SO AWESOME! It was what I was waiting for. The way i imaged the 6th one was the seriousness of Voldemort return to shower down on hogwarts and those scenes did that.Another Flaw is that the stress on the security was not were it should have been. When I read the book the fact that Death Eaters made their way into Hogwarts even after all the precautions was outstanding. Hogwarts the safe haven had been invaded. But in the movie it DID NOT seem like a big thing at all that the Death Eaters were even there. I WANTED that big fight at the end with Harry charging through after to Snape while Hogwarts is in CHAOS. I don't even understand why a great scene like that would not be in the movie. I really don't understand it AT ALL.The comedy aspect of the movie was good. Sure a few hahahas are fine. I don't have any complaints there.Overall I'm just really disappointed. I know this movie could have been so much better. Like my sister said with some many movies eventually one of them had to not be so good. I wonder how JK Rowling feels because this movie did absolutely no justice to her novel. Voldemort has no substance as a character right now expect as someone who just wants to live forever. Thats not who he is. Crazy. But yeah I'm sure I'll be satisfied with number seven movies so I'll just look forward to that. yeah...tears",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince

It could have been one of the best, but ended up being the worst. While still enjoyable on its own, there are so many things that could have been done differently/better. It seems that a lot of key components and best parts of the book were compromised for more teenage romance, which to be honest gets a little boring after a while, and comedy.A good film but quite disappointing.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
705,TroubleTobS,"Great acting, but one (or two) mayor thing(s) missing",7,23 July 2009,"OK, first of all, I didn't know, what to think about this movie when I left theater. When the movie began, I had high hopes because they had released such awesome trailers. And it looked good for the first hour and a half. They introduced everything i wanted to see. One nice thing was the Quiditch game, that wasn't to long but not to short either. The acting of Radcliffe and the others was outstanding. They are finally no ""child-actors"" anymore.So to make it short my expectations where about to be satisfied...at least that's what I thought up to that moment. After some two ours of the movie, I started to get a little nervous, because it seamed they have left out some important stuff, that's necessary to know for the last part.And here come the spoilers: the audience, doesn't get to know, that Tom Riddle killed his father, that he is related to Slitherin, and that he has a weakness for stuff, that once belonged to the four founders of hogwarts. Therefore it will make no sense to the audience, how Harry is supposed to know, where to look, or what to look for, finding the horcruxes. The only other thing that really bothers me is that they left out the apparition classes. All three of them do it all the time in the last part. so that will be confusing like ""Since when can they do that?""OK, so after two hours of watching, these things went through my mind, but i thought, hell, that won't even matter much after the final battle scene. Well we all know, how that took place. There was none. Looking at it a couple days later, that doesn't bother me that much anymore, even though they missed their chance to make it the best movie in the hole series so far.But there is one mayor thing that really bothers me. It's one of the most important things there is, and every former part has benefited from it- the music. Where was the great score, that originally came from John Williams? Where were these great moments that give you goosebumps, like in the forth part with the music by Patrick Doyle. It just wasn't there, and I believe that's why so many people said, they thought it was boring. There was just no tension-building music around.Besides all the other things, that in my eyes are secondary, I really hope, they come up with a breathtaking score for the last two parts, otherwise, I'm afraid a big piece of Harry Potter will be lost.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince

As with the books, the maturity of the characters shows through in this film. It's a little darker, a little heavier and, of course, a big revelation in the story. They also up the ante on the humor which came across in a pretty enjoyable way. Visually the film was excellent. It was worth the extra money to see it on the IMAX and it holds up on DVD too. The writing was good, the acting was better IMO than in some of the other installments and it kept me entertained consistently from start to finish. I would also say it took a turn from the previous movies in that it was more geared towards an adult audience. Yes, the content dictates that, but it was also a good adaptation.

Instead these important scenes were replaced with ridiculous, although sometimes funny, love triangles and awkward teenage crush scenes. What was the point? I just kept feeling like Harry Potter had all these childish scenes just to target their young audiences. I felt the movie started to revolve more around Ron and Hermione and Harry And Ginny then Tom Riddle's past and how it is affecting everything in the present.**Spoiler Alert** And what was with the whole fire at the burrow scene? This whole scene could have been replaced with a more important battle scene at the end. Instead Dumbledore dies and the movie ends one minute later.

710,basketball_freakazoid,A little piece of advice...,8,16 July 2009,"I consider myself to have two personas within me when I watch Harry Potter films. On one hand I am the avid die-hard obsessive Harry Potter fan. From that perspective, this movie was a tremendous disappointment. I'm not going to list everything they cut out in the movie (as most other commenters have done), but I'll just say that much of the meat has been cut out and that they are going to have a very hard time with the next installment as they cut out major plot points. The Harry Potter fan in me chastises Steve Kloves for his terrible, TERRIBLE adaptation of the novel that captured my heart many many years ago. From that perspective, this was the LEAST faithful of the Harry Potter adaptations: like Slughorn's first modified memory, it was useless and a disappointment to all concerned.On the other hand, I am a frequent, crazily critical movie buff. From that perspective, this movie was very good! David Yates' direction of the script that was given to him was perfect, and I consider him to be the second strongest HP director (#1? Obviously Mr. Alfonso Cuaron). He definitely adds magic to the series and I can't wait to see what he has done with the next installment(s). Even Kloves' script is an example of pure genius storytelling, capturing the magic of the wizarding world. But what fuels this movie even more is the performances of the amazing and talented actors. Daniel Radcliffe has finally grown into a mature actor who gave a stellar performance as everybody's favourite Boy Who Lived. Michael Gambon's Dumbledore was PERFECT, especially during the scene in the Cave where he brought me nearly to tears. Alan Rickman plays a very conflicting Snape with astounding conviction. Helena Bonham Carter shines in her unfortunately small role (at least for the moment) as Bellatrix Lestrange, and she continues to prove why she was one of the highlights of OotP. The new addition of Jim Broadbent as Horace Slughorn worked wonders as he delivers what is undoubtedly the most outstanding version of the role that will never be matched. The biggest surprise was Tom Felton's portrayal as Draco Malfoy; he finally gave that role his absolute all and made the audience hate and pity him with his stellar talent.In summary, the acting and direction really carry a movie that would have been ruined by an abysmal script. The HP fan gives this movie 50% (which ironically is how much of the novel is in the film), the movie buff in me gives it a 90%! Rounding it out to 80%! So my advice is, when watching this movie, leave the Harry Potter novel out of your mind, and you will thoroughly enjoy it! Just wait for the hangover when you realize that it was nothing like the novel, accept it, move on, and love the movie!P.S. I just wanted to add for all the Harry Potter diehards out there, if it's good enough for Leaky's Pottercast, it should be good enough for you!",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
711,chelleparti5,"A great movie, as Harry Potter films go",8,17 July 2009,"Although I have read many of the comments and sense that the general feeling towards this movie is disappointment, I must say that I have to disagree. As an avid reader of the books, having read them all at least three times, I feel that I go into these movies with extremely high expectations. However, this was the movie I was most impressed with in the series. I may have become desensitized to the normally horrifying book-turned-movie process, but I feel like Yates hit the mark this time. All of the essential parts of the book are there, with much added entertainment that was a pleasant instead of discouraging surprise. About 80% of the movie is verbatim from the book, exactly how I pictured it, and for that I am grateful, having sat through Harry Potter films that seemed to be about 50% Rowling and 50% Hollywood.I do, however, sympathize with the many discouraged fans--there were many scenes they cut out that I hoped would be there, especially at the end of the movie, like Bill and Fleur, more Harry/Ginny conversation, and, perhaps most of all, Dumbledore's funeral. Of course, I did expect them to take out some of the memories for time purposes, and I am overall happy with their choices. Though they took out the memories that most revealed Voldemort's motives, I believe (and hope) that they will be able to accommodate them into the next two movies, since they will have ample time for it. My only major tiff with the movie was the addition of a rather long scene that not only did not happen in the book, it changes the plot line for future movies: the destruction of the Burrow. This was my only WTF moment during this movie, which is a good thing, but it was a rather big mistake, in my opinion. I wish they would have opted for throwing in the actual action that happened at the end, rather than trying to throw some in the middle. However, as mistakes go, I'd rather it be one mistake than constant ones throughout the entire film.

712,HarryPotterSUXX,"To say I was disappointed is an understatement, Half Blood Prince is among the weakest in the series.",1,15 July 2009,"SPOILERS AHEADThe beginning of the Half Blood Prince starts with the Death Eaters attacking London and destroying everything in sight. After a great opening, Harry, Ron, and Hermoine return for their sixth year at Hogwarts and then, nothing.... We get two slow hours of Ron's potion making, and teenage angst, with little mention of Tom Riddle's memories, or Harry and Dumbledore's hunt for his horcruxes. The Weasley's house is burned, and then instead of the DD funeral, they change the ending. Harry just stars under the floor, while Snape kills Dumbledore. Harry cries, and the students all wave their wands at the sky to erase the dark marks. Then Harry, Ron and Hermoine leave Hogwarts. Too many things cut out, too little action, too much fluff, and, at the end, I didn't care whether or not there was a DD funeral. Definitely the weakest film yet, too many things taken out, and too many silly things put back in. Too little Tom Riddle also. The movie was just plain AWFUL!If David Yates screws up Deathly Hollows half as badly as he screwed up Order of the Phoenix, and Half Blood Prince, then he will be the one to blame for taking the Potter series seriously downhill. It was the first time I have seen an audience actually fall asleep during a Harry Potter movie and after the ending, only two people clapped. There were a lot of very disappointed people after the movie ended. I have never heard the statement ""I want my money back"" from a Harry Potter movie until now. Consider me highly disappointed in that this is by far the weakest film of the series, and that's saying something after the extremely dull Order of the Phoenix. David Yates is bad luck for the Potter films.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
713,moonofsunrise,Harry Potter and the half-assed attempt at a movie,2,16 July 2009,"This is a good movie... if you haven't read any of the books. While visually, the effects were great, they were about ALL that carried the movie. In fact, there was very little of the original storyline from the book.There were key plot elements from the book missing. In the book, there were a number of memories Dumbledore put into the pensieve regarding the origins of Tom Riddle (Voldemort) that showed where he came from, underlying what the horcruxes were, how he got Slytherin's ring (he killed his Muggle father and made his uncle Morphin Gaunt take the blame), etc. They left out Bill Weasley and Fleur Delacour's engagement and Molly Weasely's dislike of Fleur. They left out the DA's involvement and their taking the rest of Harry's Felix Felicis potion, the involvement of the Order of the Pheonix, Bill getting injured and Fleur's acceptance of him even though Fenrir Greyback had disfigured him, leading to Molly Weasely's acceptance of her. They got Tonks all wrong. At first, in the book, when Harry arrives at the Burrow, she is crying on Molly's shoulder, and it is only later that we find she has been in love with Lupin. In an added scene, during the movie, at (supposedly) Christmas break, she and Lupin are already together. The actress who plays Tonks is not the same Tonks, neither in style nor manner. The Death Eater attack in the movie that resulted in the burning down of the Weaselys' home was NOT in the book, and was graphic and grossly unnecessary.As well as Fleur and Bill, Rufus Scrimgeour is completely left out, and it is not even mentioned that he became Minister of Magic. Percy Weasley is not present. All house elves are left out. Moaning Myrtle is not present, and she is a major character in this book. In the book, she mentions to Harry about the ""boy crying in the bathroom"" (Draco Malfoy), and when he and Harry have the battle in the bathroom and he is near death, it is she who cries out ""MURDER!"", alerting people of what happened. In the movie, she is absent, and Professor Snape's unbidden arrival after Draco and Harry's ""scuffle"" makes no sense at all. The parts of Bellatrix Lestrange and Luna Lovegood were beefed up, and while I enjoy both characters and the actresses who play them to perfection, such an addition did not sit well with me. Also, in the book, Dumbledore was killed in his office with Harry under his invisibility cloak, unable to move, speak, or react. In the movie, he was killed somewhere else. Wrong, wrong, wrong.I did, however, enjoy the Weasely twins' shop. They got that right, at least. I laughed watching Hagrid and Slughorn absolutely plastered together after Aragog's funeral. Draco Malfoy was perfect. No longer the spoiled brat he once was in the other books/movies, he is shown in his own coming of age. His father in prison, he is desperate to prove himself, although the task, murder, is daunting. He cries in the bathroom and uses round-about ways to do it because, deep down, he is not a killer, which, until death, Dumbledore sees. The teenage soap operas revolving around Hermione and Ron, as well as Harry and Ginny, are well done, reminding us that this is not just about good and evil, magic and wonder, but about teenagers growing up and coping with homework and romance. Alan Rickman, as always, is perfect as Professor Snape. You can see as he makes the unbreakable vow, the look on his face that highlights his lack of willingness, yet lack of choice in the matter. You can see his division as he struggles to protect Harry, as well as to protect Draco Malfoy from spiraling down a dark path from which there is no return. He very aptly portrays Snape's reluctance to kill Dumbledore as he must, both as the unbreakable vow dictates and as Dumbledore asks.In short, plot-wise, they got more wrong than right, making the movie a gaunt version of the full richness of Rowling's original novel. The visual effects alone, while wonderful, were not enough to feed the movie's anorexic plot line.While I did not exit the theater within the first hour, as many of my fellow movie-goers in the theater did, I left the movie theater disappointed, outraged, and cheated. I felt I had wasted precious time and hard-earned money. This movie is not worthy to carry the book's title ""Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"", but should be dubbed ""Harry Potter and a half-assed attempt at a movie"".",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
714,TheGhostofFreedom,God awful,2,20 July 2009,"So bad I'm not sure where to start. I left the theater wondering what the hell I'd just watched and where the hell it'd come from. Case in point the burrow being destroyed was a completely pointless scene that could have been removed so as to make time for actually important things like Dumbledore's ideas as to what the horcruxes could be and even the significance of their existence and the number 7. Voldemort's past is glossed over completely as if they just expect everyone to have read the book before. How Harry and the others will even know what to look for in the next movie I haven't the faintest idea. Much of the movie is centered around the teenage relationships and it just drags the entire movie down with a lot of unneeded fluff. I know that the story's supposed to be about Harry growing up, but there's too much of an imbalance between relationships and the rest of the plot.Then there's the acting which still needs improvement on the part of the younger actors, especially Ginny who's acting was completely wooden for most of the film. The only part which I thought was actually decent was the scene where Harry took the felix felicus and was completely loopy. Otherwise it was just plain bad. The adults continue being the only people who can actually act in these movies, although Slughorn seemed a little off, he was better than the youths.Overall, this movie just continues the downward spiral these movies have been in since at least the second or third film, and is easily the worst yet.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
715,erinmarkes,Decent Harry,6,28 August 2017,"With all of the films you can notice that the acting is improving with the maturity of the characters. You can tell that there is a close bond between the actors of which all pull of their roles well. The directing and visual effects, like all of the films to date does not disappoint. In all a great family film, a pleasure to watch and I would recommend this film to most people. I am glad that the final film will be split into two parts, to be honest they could have done it with this film! *** For people who have never seen any of the films or read the books I took my friend with me who has not seen or read any of the books and he was completely lost throughout the film (Although he still enjoyed it!). If you wish to see this I would recommend you need to see Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix first. Otherwise you may find this film a little confusing.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
716,missylizzie13,For Fans of the Books a Major Disappointment,4,16 July 2009,"Before you read this you should know I love Harry Potter. The message of the series and the characters have been a part of my life since I was ten years old. I grew up with Harry, Herminone and Ron. That is why I feel an obligation to warn fans of this brilliantly written piece of literature. Prepare yourselves! I am not by any means saying that the film is a complete wash but if you, like me, love the book brace yourselves for an utter let down.They have not included things essential to the storyline. Do they include all of the memories that Dumbledore has recovered which are crucial for the next part of the series? No, my fellow Gryffindors, they have not... Dumbledore's death had about the importance of a mosquito's. There was no time for a funeral in the movie, I guess it was too depressing for the Warner Brothers executives or too boring for screenwriter Steve Kloves. The review of ""summer blockbuster"" is a slap in the face to all of us that as kids waited anxiously for the next book premiere. This movie was an abomination and insult to fans. The really big issue for me is that they have messed up this film so badly that I can only expect the worst for the final two adaptations of Rowling's masterpiece.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
717,dstarr-4,All Excitement Avoided,5,18 July 2009,"Here we are back at the latest in the Harry Potter franchise. I left the movie being thoroughly unimpressed. Major scenes from the book were deleted or downplayed to the point of boredom. Reasonable expectations were never realized. The most exciting scene from the movie was a complete invention by the movie maker. One bright thing was seeing Bonnie Wright do a very good job in the whole movie. Ginny was quite good. This seemed to be a skeleton of the book, when adding ten minutes to the movie and not filming the scene that was a complete fiction of the movie maker, the movie could have been exciting or even compelling. My advice is to wait until the movie gets to DVD, as it certainly was not worth the price of admission and popcorn.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
718,DgrangerHasTwoHundredAccounts,Half Blood Prince is the most disappointing film of the summer and the worst Harry Potter film so far..,1,15 July 2009,"I consider myself a Harry Potter fan. Not of the movies, but from the books which they came from. There's a reason why each of J.K. Rowling's 7 books have brought much fan base all over the world, it's because of the magic of the Harry Potter books.In the last several years, I feel more and more magic from the books have been cut from the movies. I blame this on Warner Brothers who obviously views the Potter property as a ticket to high profit rather than an experience that filmgoers and book lovers can share together.I loved the essence of the first two films, but when Alfonso Cuaron took over as the director of Prisoner of Azkaban, it seems more and more material had been cut from the books on which they are based. Prisoner of Azkaban was the first and some key sequences were eliminated. The change wasn't too bad -- back then. Then Goblet of Fire came out a year later, and even more material was cut. Then Order of the Phoenix came out two years ago, and it seems half of the book was cut to the point where the film was quite dull and pointless.But, Half Blood Prince is the worst of them all. Many fans of the Harry Potter film series keep on stating that the films are an entirely different form of entertainment than the books, and that all the details cannot be included. That's nonsense. The first two Harry Potter movies were able to capture the essence of the books perfectly. The Narnia films were able to capture the essence of their books perfectly as well, there is no reason why the rest of the Harry Potter books cannot do the same.What we have with Half Blood Prince is a cliff note's version of the film with much of the material that made the book so special completely cut out. Events such as Harry and Dumbledore's quest for Voldemort's Horcruxes are barely touched on, while the majority of the film focuses on the sillier parts of the novel such as the growing hormones between the sixth year Hogwarts students. It seems that the producers of Harry Potter were aware of the growing popularity of the Twilight phenomenon and wanted to make their own teenage romantic love story as part of the series. That doesn't feel right in a Harry Potter film in anyway.I feel that David Yates directed the two worst Harry Potter films so far, and that he will undoubtedly destroy the once great Harry Potter film series. The fact that the final book will be split into two separate films makes me question his abilities as a director of the final film of one of the best fantasy book series of all time.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
719,rickfox,1/2 Blood Prince,6,15 July 2009,"This version of Harry Potter was, as the last three movies have been, only a closely related story to the books. It, like most screen adaptations of best-sellers, always leaves you asking, ""I wish they had included (insert your many favorite passages here)."" Spoiler section--No Dobby again and no proper send off for Dumbledore. What's with burning down the Burrow? Not in the book at all! Alan Rickman definitely set himself up to be a feature character for the last 2 films. He was brilliant. I also liked how they gave a more central focus to Rupert Grint and, I thought Jim Broadbent was terrific as Slughorn.Contrary to at least one review I read, I don't think this series needs to change to stay fresh. If you've read the books, the real quality in their development comes from Rowling and should not Steve Kloves or any screenwriter. Just stay close to the originals and people will like them.If you're a fan or not, this movie will give you lots to discuss about what's ahead.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
720,Vince27,One of the Summer's Best Blockbuster's,9,10 July 2009,"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince is the sixth installment in the Harry Potter series, and it is the greatest one yet. Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince mixes comedy, romance, drama, and adventure into one, and makes it so marvelous and fun to watch.The acting in this film than in the earlier ones is more mature and better in quality, also in part because of the maturity of all the actors in the film. Jim Broadbent, Alan Rickman, and Michael Gambon are brilliant and elegant to watch in this masterpiece. The trio, Emma Watson, Rupert Grint, and Daniel Radcliffe are also amazing in their roles and pull them off well.The directing and visuals in this one are marvelous. David Yates gives his best directing in his career to date, and does an amazing job of telling the storyline of J.K Rowling's fantastic book. The visual effects are so well done and look so real. The cinematography sets the tone for the whole movie right from start to finish, and turns the series in a even darker direction. I also give praise to Hooper's score which is beautiful and sets the tone in certain dark scenes.To cap it off, the last half hour of the film is just delicious. The effects, cinematography, and acting are stunning in the last half hour, and sets up for a shocking ending. The movie is not sort of rushed, but you feel that it is being pushed forward. It doesn't feel long at all because of everything going on, so it passes by normally. Quidditch is back and is certainly the funnest part of the movie and is action packed. The romance in this film is done well and is done humorously. Everyone in this film, whether it be Harry, Hermione, or Rom, all have love on their mind. Half-Blood Prince is also very funny, and Ron will have you laughing a lot.A great film that most people will enjoy and especially fans of the books. It combines a lot of genres together and makes the film feel more real and more magnificent then the others. It's a pleasure to watch, and when your done, you just can't wait for the next two to come out. I hope you enjoy it!",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
721,gabisue,"Excellent, really excellent.",9,21 July 2009,"SPOILERS!!!! SPOILERS!!!What is everyone complaining about??? I am a huuuuge fan of the books and I absolutely loved this movie! The trio improved greatly since Order of the Phoenix (which was excellent as well). Dumbledore was at his best as the quirky and powerful headmaster. The cinematography was stunning!! The chemistry between Harry and Ginny was lovely. It showed their blossoming affection for each other through their interactions. It was pure and innocent. I was glad how Hermione confides in Harry her affection and heartbreak for Ron in a very touching scene. After the death of Dumbledore, I really did want the funeral and that is my only complaint with the film. The confrontation between Harry and Snape after the murder was thrilling. You should expect the movie to depart from the book people!! This was an excellent movie, definitely the best of the series. All of these reviews do not rate the movie, they just furiously analyze the differences between the movie and the book. SEE THIS MOVIE!",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
722,marichka21,"i give seven points to some nice plot moments and to a few actors, who were brilliant.",7,20 July 2009,"10 points for Snape, was well done, but since he is the half-blood prince, we should of seen him more in the movie. Hermione was brilliant, Ron brilliant, Ginny - just beautiful, Harry Potter - just horrible. He didn't persuade me of his feelings to Ginny, and they should be very strong. Perhaps that gentle kiss and the way Ginny took his hand compensated it a little. I honestly don't like Daniel anymore in playing the most important role, he is not doing it well for me. Everyone around him is doing it much better. He wasn't even jealous when Ginny kissed another guy.Then, what's up with the beginning? That was stupid!!!!!!! I said in the theater ""NO WAY!!!"" Oh, where are the former producers of the movie? I know, side effects are great, some actor's emotions are great, but something is missing, some key points. When you read the book, you can't stop, there is always this excitement, and when you finish reading it, there is this big ""WOW"", and in the movie it wasn't there. It's a dark moment for Harry Potter, but there is this big side to his life - his love to Ginny. It should bright up the whole thing.At the end, when Harry brings so needed memory from professor Slughorn. Little thing that could of been done much better. Harry was very exited to get that, he ran to Dumbledore, why didn't they show it? That doesn't take extra time, just make it better.Anyways, I am sorry for such negative words. I hope that the producer will work better on the plot and Daniels role in the next movie, he has to improve himself.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
723,Xanares,Comment / review from a non-reader of the books,2,18 July 2009,"What a mess! Dead-ends and utterly pointless turns en mass. 80% of the movie is a romantic comedy with random plot gems trying to push through. Stellar acting and cinematography is completely wasted.**Spoilers**! War is brewing, Voldemorts power is gaining and his (potential) enemies are disappearing one by one - meanwhile Hogwarts turns into a party-like-it-is-1999 ""snoggfest"" with a myriad of parties and broken teenage-hearts.Harry is hitting on a waitress, but Dumbledore spoils that and drags him back into the plot, good man.A recruiting-trip for the new potion-master and holder of a very important secret, and a brief stop at the Weasleys later we're at Hogwarts. No more school-uniforms! What has England become?! Oh yea, before that a bit o' alley fun. Some adept Draco-spying by Harry reveals he really fancies furniture.So while Hogwarts is not training any army to counter Voldemort, they are at least, strike that, Dumbledore and Harry are at least trying to get a clear picture of Tom Riddle's past in order to find ways to eliminate him. We learn he came from an orphanage, recruited to Hogwarts by Dumbledore himself. As Harry he spoke with snakes from an early age and did bad things to those that hurt him, but that he was evil was not clear - and in this movie it never becomes clear - if he was or turned evil or if so why.Snape is doing some serious double-agent stuff into enemy territory - or is it friendly, we don't know - swearing to protect Draco, who apparently is Voldemort's chosen one now, and Snape is to become that chosen one if Draco fails. The need for using Draco then why?Meanwhile the inaptly-named Deatheaters spread utter chaos and dread by appearing in London in clear day, blowing up a shop in the alley while abducting the owner, and most of all by burning down the Weasley's place during Christmas - for no apparent reason! Put that in your pipe and smoke it Potter! Oh and he did smoke it... completely useless Harry totally Leroy-Jenkins'ed and ran off into the fight alone here. I guess he thought Dumbledore would pop up like in the former movie... and absolutely nothing relevant happened in that whole scene although we see Genny is fond of him.Draco? He is almost completely transformed into a non-speaking loner, who strolls Hogwarts at night in an almost Potterish way. More furniture-love? Yes you guessed it. So he is messing with some ""teleportation"" device, clever. But he is so annoyingly little fleshed out and has a silly encounter with Harry along the way too, getting owned in the process and saved by Snape (of course). I feel there is so much ignored potential in Tom's performances here, sad.Harry hit Draco with a nasty spell gained from a book of an old student, the Half-blood Prince. Very interesting book this one - but Harry's friends don't like him reading a lot, so it has to go. Reading is bad for you, don't you know? Some attempts at hitting Dumbledore with poisoning fail and hit students instead (who recover). Harry thinks immediately it's Malfoy - we never find out for sure.Harry finally get Slughorn drunk and finds out what he told Tom Riddle privately back in the day (the secret). 7 soul-splitting-wizard-souls Batman! Even Dumbledore is dumbstruck, although he handily did uncover some of them beforehand. They are kept in normal items, like the book from a former movie or a ring, and called a Horcrux.We have no idea WHY he did this or what the benefit of knowing it is to our friends Harry and co. We guess it is just so they know what to destroy... but who knows really.Off to find one of them they go and Dumbledore shows how little need he really has for water after asking for it 3 times, almost dying, but curing that sandy throat and saving it all by BURNING everything, yes burning.It comes as no surprise then that in the end, utterly confused as we are, we don't care that Deatheaters ""teleport"" into Hogwarts through Draco's furniture just to taunt Draco into killing Dumbledore, which fails utterly and Snape finally loosing his patience with Hogwarts, Dumbledore, Deatheaters and Draco finishes the job for him and that way gets out of his swearing bond.Harry puts up a fight which does little if nothing to Snape. While the moronic and useless Deatheaters burn Hagrid's house, Harry uses his newly gain super-spell on Snape, who brushes the mosquito-sting off, gets annoyed with him, disarms him and tells him that yes, he is the Half-Blood Prince and it is pretty useless using his own spell against him. Try to remember that one Potter.Dumbledore is not buried or put into song, just mourned a bit with some concert-like waving of white wands and a few tears. The greatest wizard is dead, he died with a whimper.. Or is he? Time will tell. Two more movies to royally screw up.Note that I kind of like the acting all-around and some of the filming is stunningly well done, but when the plot is completely sacrificed to silly romance and comedy that doesn't build characters at all, well you blow it.Some friendly advice. 1) Leave the comedy to the house-elves - they're better at it and it comes of as more believable/natural (where is Dobby??). 2) Give characters (especially evil) some fleshing out! Are we supposed to guess what's on Draco's mind?? 3) Keep romance at a minimum, this movie pretty much did enough of it for all the 8 movies combined. The keyword is subtle. 4) Ask yourself if things makes sense and are intricate to the plot or character development, if not cut it out.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
724,teresateles,Where was Half-Blood Prince?,9,25 July 2009,"I'm a big fan of Harry Potter's series, and I was so looking forward to this movie! After seen it, I loved it. I loved the chosen actors such as the actor who played Tom Riddle when he was 16 years old, the captions, the scenarios and so on. But when I started to think about the movie as a fan of the book, I wonder ed what have the people that didn't read the book thought of the title: Half-Blood Prince. I think that it was not very well explored, as if it was not important to the movie, I mean, it isn't the most important to the series itself but to this movie, for this story, it was! And the only thing we could see was Harry doing good potions and no mystery beyond the Prince himself. When Snape says he is the Half-Blood prince, it doesn't even make people shocked.

As a movie adaptation of a book I love, it fell short.",9,28 July 2009,"For those who read the books, otherwise some of this will not make sense.Spoilers, of course.In General: After reading everyone else's complaints and praises about the movie, I have formulated my opinion. It of course irks me how much they left out and I am bemused on the ""how does Harry know what the Horcruxes are?"" situation. Being a teenager who watches romantic comedies once in a while, I quite enjoyed all the humor, but I do understand older audience members getting fed up with it. I felt as though when it was funny, it played its part, but when it became intense, it did so very well. As a sequel to a series of movies I love, it did not disappoint. As a movie adaptation of a book I love, it fell short. So I have mixed feelings.Acting: I was pleasantly surprised and impressed with Emma Watson, for I've hated Hermione in the movies since PoA. She seemed more real in this one, less eyebrows. Tom Felton, I feel, did a very good job (considering he hasn't done much in the past films) but I disagree with those who think he stole the show. He just made faces the entire time, except the end in the tower. Don't hit me, please. Bonnie Wright was most disappointing. All of her lines seemed forced and the Harry/Ginny scenes were really awkward and I felt embarrassed FOR them. There wasn't enough Neville, Luna, Tonks, or Lupin. And as ever, the majority of the adult talent was sorely under-used.Scenes/Nitpicking: I found the paparazzi at the ministry scene a nice tie-in from the last movie. I felt the waitress scene to be stupid and unnecessary. Where were the Dursleys? It was good to have Slughorn mention Regulus Black at the beginning, at least they won't have to explain THAT in DH. I thoroughly enjoyed the part at the Burrow when Ginny, upon seeing Harry's trunk and owl, yells up the stairs for Molly, and Ron and Hermione pop out of higher levels. As I said above, I did enjoy all the humor. The attack at the Burrow was interesting to watch but, again, unnecessary. The poisoning of Ron made me really uncomfortable; it's hard to watch such a fun character foaming from the mouth while gagging and spitting! Then, being a hardcore Ron/Hermione shipper I squee-d a little inside at the hospital scene. I found the Felix scene hilarious (especially the pincers part) but felt the next half-hour rushed. It went straight from ""Lily gave me a fish"" to ""let's watch the memory!"" then straight into ""let's go get the locket!"" Harry didn't even say goodbye to his friends. I admit I almost shed a tear when Harry was forcing the potion down Dumbledore's throat and felt a pang of sadness when Bella destroyed the Great Hall, but I felt nothing when the man died. The acting was good, but they didn't build up the relationship between him and Harry enough for my heart to be in it. The same thing happened with Sirius in the last one (though I did cry during the Possession scene that followed). So, no funeral? Did Dumbledore's life and friends mean nothing? What a waste. And why was Harry and Co. up in the tower where it all happened in the end? Why was Ron sitting far away? This made no sense to me.Conclusion: It is a pleasure to watch, while I'm watching it. If I think about it too much afterward, I start to not like it as much. The advice to myself therefore, is to, as always, treat the book and movie as two separate entities and move on with my life.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
726,kkholland,153 minutes of your life you will never get back,3,10 June 2010,"Seriously, I generally like the Harry Potter series, and am not a movie snob, but this is the worst movie I have seen in a long time. With its glacier slow pacing, complete lack of suspense, and bizarre lighting, this movie will leave you feeling lobotomized. I would be angry at having lost 153 (!!!!) of the most boring minutes of my, but I am too numb to care.It is clear that they dumbed down every emotion and piece of suspense so that parents would still take little kids to this movie. It was like watching Julius Caesar made for nine year olds, only less entertaining.While it is always a challenge to make a complete movie out of an installation in a series, this entire film felt like being dragged in a long, slow line from point A to point B.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
727,TheREALBunneh,Mixed thoughts,8,17 July 2009,"The reason I gave this an 8 is because it is truly a sensational film, the best yet out of the whole franchise. The acting is milestones ahead of what it has been in previous HP films (especially from Emma Watson), the storyline and characters are much more layered and 3D, the sets and special effects are breathtaking, and the score is absolutely gorgeous. As a stand-alone film, I would happily give this a 10.BUT, of course, it is not a stand-alone film - it is the follow up of many other films, and is also based on a book so rich and layered that it could not possibly compete. While this is (IMO) the best film so far, it is also the most unlike the book, and if you know the book and what follows in the Deathly Hallows, you can't help but notice gaping holes in the plot where crucial information has been left out. This film features only 2 of Dumbledore's collected memories - the book shows quite a few more, some of which are important in Harry's hunt for the horcruxes and may have to be dumped somewhere unfitting in the next two films, just to get them out the way (for example, the memory featuring Hepsibar Smith and Hufflepuff's cup). Also, fans of the book will no doubt notice that some of their favourite scenes have been taken out: the funeral at the end, the aftermath of the final Quidditch match (the involvement of Quidditch in this film was entertaining, but seemed pointless as it lead to nothing), and most importantly the battle at Hogwarts between the Death Eaters and The Order/Dumbledore's Army. What I'm trying to say is, if you have not read the book you will probably be able to enjoy this film for the beautiful and intense piece of work it really is - but unfortunately, if you have read the book then the comparisons will come flying at you from the very start, whether you like it or not, and there are definitely more here than there have been in previous instalments.Half-Blood Prince is definitely the darkest of the books, and this has proved to be the darkest film - the ever present sense of tension or even impending doom is hair-raising, and every scene featuring Tom Felton (Draco Malfoy) had me almost breathless, even if he does look about 30 now. He is definitely one of the best actors of the HP films. There are also some painfully tear jerking moments throughout: including a surprise attack on the Burrow, which was heartbreaking, and the scene in the cave where Harry has to force the liquid down Dumbledore's throat - that is the first time, in any film since he started, that I've really appreciated Michael Gambon as Dumbledore, which I imagine will be the same for many of you.In short, definitely a must see - but book fans must accept that the films have taken their own turn now, and I imagine that the changes in this one will lead to some very major differences in the two Deathly Hallows instalments. The films could never be the masterpieces that the books are, but this one sure comes close....mischief managed.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince

Fenrir Grayback Tonk's patronus and explanation the funeralIt isn't that I expected a faithful adaptation, but those are important details.I ""loved"" the way you can kill the Headmaster and then walk through the corridors, even destroying the Great Hall without no one waking up nor listening, and also do an fatal curse like ""Sectumsempra"" and not getting even detention...Hardly a decent movie, it could have been better, MUCH better.

729,cdcrulesleith,Why do we do it to ourselves?,4,23 July 2009,"It comes around most summers, the flurry of hype and advertising surrounding the latest Harry Potter instalment, and every critic claims it is The Best One Yet, the reviews all say Harry Potter Shows Its Dark Side and everyone comments on how they are Maturing As Actors.And we all go to see it. And we all come out claiming ""never again"".This time is not too different. The acting has improved dramatically, although there are still a few cringe-worthy moments. Tom Felton (Malfoy) is the most impressive, with much more to do in this instalment than the others. Radcliffe exhibits good comic timing for once. The adult cast are as dependable as ever, Rickman, Bonham Carter and Broadbent are all fantastic, and Michael Gambon puts in his best so far.However, it is still not worth going to see by any stretch of the imagination. Some snippets are brilliantly done, the CGI better than ever, the opening shot is good, and the memory scenes especially are done perfectly, exactly as imagined. But these are gems hidden with in two and a half hours of dirge.I've heard, as a fan of the books, many others disgusted with the amount left out from them. This I don't mind in the slightest, it would be ridiculous to include all of the intricate subtle storyline twists that make the series so great. It's the embellishments and contrived utter rubbish that has been actually added to the movie that made me feel a little sick.I understand taking liberties with the plot line... but not if it turns a fantastic book into a dismal film! The emphasis on the romantic storyline (a relatively minor part in the book) was woeful, to the point I had to bite my lip to avoid shouting expletives at the screen. The ending also seems to have been completely misunderstood, the agony in the book being Harry physically cannot move to protect his mentor. I won't even vent my feelings on the burning of the Burrow.Having said that, the whole cave scene, from beginning to end, is fantastically done.It's just a pity the rest is so undeniably awful.Don't put yourself through it this year.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
730,crystaldeckard,My Harry Potter Movie Review,10,15 July 2009,"I went to the midnight showing of Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince. It stayed more true to the book then any other Harry Potter. Some of the others watching the movie, who hadn't read the series but seen all the movies was shocked when Dumbledore died. But we just told them you haven't seen the last of Dumbledore yet and they were happy. I really can't say a bad thing about the movie. I loved it. If I had to pick one thing they forgot to put in the movie would be would the funeral of Dumbledore when the white tomb was created and there was no Krum or Cho. But those are only small tiny things for those who want to be picky. I was extremely happy that the scene from the book where Hermione created the birds and attacks Ron with them when she is upset that he kissed the other girl. Overall AWESOME MOVIE, I plan to go re-watch it soon!!!! It's a must see movie.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
731,oliver-259,Worst Potter movie ever. Why did they do that?,2,3 August 2009,"To keep it short: I did NOT read the book. This movie does NOT have a story and it does NOT explain anything that happens within it. The Half-Blood-Prince is mentioned. Fine. But never explain WHAT exactly that is, or even why it should be important.Wort of the series. By far. And I am NOT an disappointed fan of the books.I never wrote a comment on a film so far, but when I came out of the cinema yesterday I was SO disappointed, that I thought I should take the time to warn you people. I really like the HP-movies. But this one ... holy moly, it just don't work for me. As a movie, mind.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
732,Ariana1313,Harry Potter and the Teenage Angst,4,18 July 2009,"I've seen fans of the books hate this movie. I am a fan of the books and did not like this movie. It was one of the darkest books and one of the most light-hearted movies. When I read the book, I did not care about the love triangle/square/hexagon that was going on, did you? No. I did not go see this movie to see a version of Twilight. I wanted to see the main plot line. Why was it even called Half-Blood Prince if you weren't really going to include it? And apparently Voldemort isn't important anymore. I was bored waiting for the movie to do something besides talk about love interests. Actually, I went with someone who had only seen the movies and never read the books. He was also confused about what was going on and felt the whole Half-Blood prince thing was just kinda thrown in there. Overall, he didn't seem to care much for the movie either. I think he felt that major points were left out. He was significantly confused and didn't care about Ron/Lavender. And, at the end of the movie, I was waiting for DD's funeral to happen. Then, just a black screen and credits. Wait, what? Apparently DD doesn't matter anymore either. So then, who seemed most important in this movie? Ron, Lavender, Harry (I suppose), and maybe Hermione. Aragog's death? Hilarious apparently. Nothing about this movie seemed quite right. I spent $8.50 to be sorely disappointed. My favorite book turned into my least favorite movie, and I was alright with most of the other films made.Overall, if you are a fan of the books, be ready to be disappointed. If you are a fan of the movies, be ready to be confused (since they seem to leave out so much of the plot that explains things that readers already know).",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince

734,pstineme,Good Movie,8,15 July 2009,"Would have been great if it had been six hours long so they could have included everything. Movie makers had to cater to the book fans and movie fans. I think they had a good balance. Great books don't always make great movies due to time constraints and what makes a great book doesn't make a great movie. Many of the good parts left out of the book simply wouldn't have made the movie much better. Overall, yes there was room for improvement, but I'm not sure what they could have taken out to fit more in. Taking out some of the romance stuff might have made it more faithful to the book but I'm not sure that it would have improved the movie. I think I'll re-read the book, I'm sure it will be even better now.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince

When I saw the order of Phoenix movie, I realized that I couldn't wait 4 years to know how the saga was going to end... I don't like reading books but I made an exception... and thank god that I read the book because the movie is so fast, so unclear and so dark that people that has not read the book, will understand nothing... In the book, the young live of Tom Riddle is exhaustively explained... and in the movie? In the movie only the visit to the orphanage! Really sick. More things... the final scene... what a XXXX! In the book the ambient is outstanding... but in the movie.... what a bad final scene. And for people who don't know.... this movie was scheduled for November 2008... but in October 2008 they decided that for economical purposes they will not release the movie 'til July 2009 even though the movie was already finished and packaged...

I really don't understand why this movie had so many differences from the book.Why was the battle at Hogwarts omitted? if so, then what is the point of Malfoy bringing the death eaters? so they can smash the dinning hall and burn Hagrid's place? that is really stupid, bad movies do stupid things!Why is Harry now a pussy? yeah! a pussy! He sees as Dumbledore dies and does nothing because Dumbledore throws a spell on him, and place him under the invisible cloak. That is why! not because Snape tells him to shhhhh!

I personally haven't read any book, but after this movie i will in order to calm my nerves.But i liked all the previous movies.This one hurt my feelings.I went out of the cinema with my tears ready to drop wondering how could they possibly do that to us? how could they shoot such an awful movie.It lasts 2.30 hours 1.30 of which is about Ron and his sexual games.There are silly jokes,i thought i was watching American Pie or something.The movie leaves you with a feeling of disappointment and emptiness.I hope that i have time to read the book soon because i was really hurt at my feelings.Could somehow all our complaints be read from the producers or whatever JK Rowling,Yates and whoever other is responsible for that mess?I wish so... 1/10 because there is no 0 or negatives (-)",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince

But besides that, its a dreadful waste of a good novel and our time. shouldn't the main focus of the 6th one, be training Harry to fight? Instead of cramp it with high school drama, who likes whom, who is jealous of whom, who wants whom.....The story was broken down into tiny pieces that don't really connect to on another. I don't for those didn't read the book, how do they understand everything. WHY are they keeping Yates as the director? There are hundreds of much more amazing ones whom can do the story justice. I mean, how many films have the scene of a creepy dark lake, and all of a sudden something come out the dark water to drag the main character into the lake. Its so cliché. Now I really worry about the last two, hope they won't be so disappointing.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
739,Z-al,Best movie of the series however it suffers from some flaws,7,26 July 2009,"i think the movie was excellent, EXCEPT for some parts where the audience were left confused or faithful harry potter fans outraged. For example, the death-eaters attacked and burnt the burrow (Weasley house). Some people might ask what that might have been about and comments such as ""so random"" ""what the f***?"" ""weaslly are homeless"" can be heard and quite understood. There are more similar scenes such as this throughout the movie, another can be the beginning where a much older bartender hits on Harry and much unlike his character harry hits back. I think those scenes should have been totally deleted, it adds confusion to both people familiar with the story and those who aren't. I personally would have used that airtime to make the ending a bit more complicated and add a fight scene. Otherwise i think the movie was quite good and closer to the book than the rest of the movies. The comedy was nice but a little too much at times and the acting was definitely improved. I wish we could see a bit more of Snape though. I was extremely pleased with Michael Gambon's performance in this film, specially for a man who has never read any of the harry potter books. However one must note that this movie was surpassed by the book itself, one cannot understand the magic of harry potter books without reading the books. Yet this is definitely the best movie in the series. 7.5/10 for me on this.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince

The movies however I've seen several times each, and I enjoy them all.As of now Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince has the highest score of the Potter movies with 7.8. Let me tell you that it is not worthy of such a score. I tried really hard to like it, after all it is Harry Potter, but it's flawed in so many ways. It hurts me to type this, but at times if feels more like a sequence of random scenes than a actual movie. There's no substance, no adventure and very little magic. The dramaturgy is nonexistent, and I'm saying that as a educated script writer. In all fairness, it is indeed a bit funny at times, and the new teacher is a good cast, but besides that I got no love for The Hald-Blood Prince.As said I never read the books, this one might've been a tough adaption. Nevertheless, it's simply not a well crafted film.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince

Where's the quidditch finals? Where's the fight at the ending (I was expecting this so much! :( )? Where's Dumbledore funeral!

743,snowbear1014,Mature and Realistic,10,15 July 2009,"The sixth installment of Harry Potter did wonders establishing a very real, and very terrifying backbone to the series. We have to understand that Voldemort is at large and that the Wizarding is at War. There is no more time for childish themes. This film was very good, and it stayed true to the book. I thought it was neat how mature the actors have become in accordance to the characters in the book. Doesn't skip a beat. The actors did a wonderful job, and I have to say both the drama and the comic relief offered, balanced the entire movie out, making it both entertaining and frighteningly real. Harry Potter and his gang are in for a really nasty time, and I don't think many realized it until this movie, including myself. I envisioned the horrors of Final Battle in the 7th Book, but to see it captured on screen will make the fantasy a reality. I give props to the Cast and Crew for making a wonderful film, and for making the series come to life. I can't for the 7th (& 8th) movie!!

I was so disappointed from the way this movie was filmed. The best parts of the books are not included in the movies and a lot of things are not explained. If the director had done the film similar with book, this movie would have been a masterpiece. However, I still love this movie.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
745,andrewmoore-30596,Could have been better.,8,27 May 2021,"I thought this movie was a great way to establish Harry's journey during the final 2 movies. It establishes Toms character through his backstory and the danger of the horcruxes. Dumbledore is looking super badass and Draco's task is heartbreaking as he is forced to do something he simply is not ready for. The soundtrack is also one of my favorite, with ""Inferi in the Firestorm"" and ""Dumbledore's Farewell"" being some of my favorite scores from, throughout the 8 films.But this film is definitely not perfect. The romance between Harry and Ginny is bland an cringe. The chemistry just isn't there and it makes it very difficult to watch without laughing. Way to much time is spent with Ron and Lavender. The first half of this movie is just kind of boring and the second half is the only part of the movie I would actually be willing to rewatch. Ron has been downgraded from his book stance and its really sad watching him sit in the back and listen instead of joining the conversation.The part that really made me give this movie an 8 was the last 1/4. Learning about the horcruxes was shocking, and it puts into scale the absolute magnitude of the trios last task. The cave scene was incredible. The acting (especially from Gambon), the intense visuals, and the soundtrack all combined to make me sit at the edge of my seat. Snape killing Dumbledore was a massive twist. Killing of one of the most powerful wizards of all time and leaving me wondering how they are even going to finish this series. (SPOILERS FOR THE DEATHLY HALLOWS.) It is even sadder when we understand why Snape had to do it. ""Severus, please"" was one of the best lines, and Feltons and Rickmans acting was great.Overall I enjoyed this movie, but it definitely could have been better. This is also my favorite book in the series in case anyone was wondering.P. S. This is my first review :D.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
746,pamela_smith,Boring and without suspense,1,17 July 2009,"Worst HP move thus far. While the opening scene was a thrilling 3-D like ride which should be seen at an OmniMax, the 3 minutes or so it lasted were definitely not enough to sustain my interest. There was absolutely no suspense. The notion that heroic Harry would be crushing on Ginny is sad, but writing likable, but dense and goofy Ron as the brilliant and beautiful Hermoine's crush is a ridiculous and intentional anti-Romantic ploy that simply does not work -- though that is the author's fault. Sorry, but pathetic Ron doesn't even qualify as a starter boyfriend for Hermoine. The characters' respective love interests are totally lacking in credibility of any kind and serve only as distasteful distractions from the extremely boring plot. I started checking my watch within 45 minutes, hoping the 2 1/2 hour movie was almost over. C'est la vie. At least I didn't pay for the ticket!",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
747,griff713-1,what the $^%#% was that??,2,15 July 2009,"I agree with several others.... Did the director even READ the book? Does he know what a book is?? Look, Hollywood, you take a great book and make a film out of it for one reason alone: you want fans of the book to come see their favorite story come to life.YOU DON'T BUTCHER IT! Anyone else completely disappointed with the way Harry and Ginny's first kiss was filmed? It should NOT have been contrived by Ginny, but a complete surprise to BOTH of them, and done in the Gryffindor common room in front of the whole house! That being said, how did Hermione and Ron catch wind of it? They weren't there! This was the worst directed film of the whole series. I can appreciate needing to change a few things, even leaving some things out, after all you only have 2 to 2 1/2 hrs to tell the whole story, but why change that scene?? It served no purpose whatsoever! I could go on and on, but I'm just sick at heart...... J.K. .... why did you let them do this to your wonderful story?",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
748,sportantino,Not my cup of tea,4,13 July 2009,"As an avid Harry Potter reader, I was left with an empty feeling when I exited the theater. While I had braced myself for possible disappointment after reading about all the artistic changes I knew would be coming, it still did not prepare me for the actual movie.I know that they had added the whole ""Burrow on fire"" scene to placate the fans of the nonexistent, epic, Order of the Phoenix vs. Death Eaters duel at the end. However, as there is no epic duel, then what is the point of having the vanishing cabinets in the movie at all. Because of the lack of the battle, there is no point for having all the Death Eaters enter the castle. It seems that the only reason why the enter the castle is to give Draco a twisted moral support which completely changes the intentions in the book. And if there are no vanishing cabinets, then the whole Draco Malfoy in agony thing was completely unnecessary. It seems that I could go in circles regarding this topic but this was the biggest disappointment for me.Maybe I am just being a picky fan, but I just feel so empty. I was expecting to cry at the end of the movie when Dumbledore dies as I did when I read the book. Instead, I was still hung up on the lack of confrontation. It was just so wrong.While I find fault with a lot of the artistic changes, it is not a necessarily bad movie. I do like the dark overtones to the movie and the music score is to die for. The acting is pretty much spot on. Once again, Alan Rickman portrays the slippery character Severus Snape perfectly. Jim Broadbent is wonderful as Slughorn. The only character I personally did not care for was Jessie Cave as Lavender. I just pictured the character differently in my mind.Those are just my personal thoughts that I had to share. I would recommend seeing this movie because it is not bad. You should just form your own opinions.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince

I even liked how most of the movies were adapted, I've got them all on DVD. However, HBP truly did disappoint me. My husband and son(who have not read the books, my son is just starting the 2nd one) were totally bored with the movie. They have seen all the previous HP's. This one left them totally confused. It jumped around too much and too many important details were left out. They spent too much time on the romance part (and they didn't totally explain that either.) They left out key parts in the story. I'm going to have to go back and re-read the book again, because some things just didn't make sense.I feel that they did not do the book justice. I'm just very disappointed and felt I wasted 2 1/2 hours this afternoon.

This was such a raw movie and i skipped a lot of minutes (Around 20) watching it. I really like book of the movie but after this movie i couldn't enjoy my book. I thought the movie would be very.... idk what to say. I thought the movie would be like the 5th film. Exciting soundtrack, interesting plot and players playing their role very well. There is absolutely NOTHING in this movie. My review of the movie is also the same as 7th and 8th film.

751,breakingfree92,Overall...,10,15 July 2009,"I've been a fan of Potter since I was 8 years old. Every movie I've watched some many times I almost know them word for word and I was really looking forward to this latest film. I went into the cinema knowing that not everything I wanted from the book would be included, it was only going to be ""based on the book"", even so I was really looking forward to it. Personally, I didn't think the (re)introduction of Dumbledore really worked, leaving the Dursley's out was a mistake, but I think Slughorn's entrance was brilliant, as was the previous scene with the Alley and the Bridge. The Twins shop was beyond AMAZING!!!!!! It was exactly how I had imagined it. Hogwarts was amazing, as usual, and I was glad that Quidditch was back in the film, because that was one of my favorite parts of the book... However, I think there weren't enough of the lessons to lead into the next film(s) because if the viewers have not read the the books they may be left confused with the following films. One huge disappoint was the big battle at the end of the film, particularly the stuff with Bill and Fleur... it was needed IMO. Other than that, I really did enjoy it. The cave part was done brilliantly and I was on the edge of my seat that entire time. I should mention the acting of Dan, Emma, Rupert, Bonnie and Tom. They have grown up and matured, and their acting is a lot better now.. (not that it wasn't in the beginning though). All in all...

I wanted to cry at the end of the movie not because of its ending, but because how boring and flat the movie was. ----Contains spoilers---- If you are an true book fans I believe it will be better off reading the book again instead of watching the movie. I dragged my boyfriend to watch it with the promise that there was going to be a lot of action during the film but I was deeply disappointed. The movie spent more time going in between scenes about the flirting among all the young Hogwarts students and very vague understanding about the Dark's Lord past. I was looking forward to all the memories it should have included and the impressive wizard fights when they break into the castle. Dumbledore's end was too quick and sudden with no funeral! What annoyed me the most was how horrible Ginny was! Pointless love scenes among them. The only scenes I enjoyed were the ones with Lavender Brown. There was truly no action in the film (maybe Quidditch) and it seemed to drag so much even though this is an extremely important book (film) in order to understand the seventh book and the destruction of the Dark Lord. Gosh I am so mad about the film. If you have not read the books you might find it occasionally funny, cute and maybe ""dark"" but I would suggest to pick up the book and start reading it.I give it a 6 out of 10 just because I am a true Harry Potter fan. The fifth film was more interesting with more action.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
753,jose-samraj,Harry Potter minus angst,4,17 July 2009,"For a story which gets progressively darker, the movies seem to get quite lighter. It' got a healthy dose of romance, awesome graphics, funny dialog and decent acting. But it really lacks the angst which really characterizes Potter. I admit that too much of angst is one of the pitfalls of Harry's character. But Harry Potter as a boyscout hero does not work for me. That's Ron's job, which he does rather well both in the book and movies.One thing that will strike you is the intensity of teenage love in HBP. The book does take it up a notch. But the movie tends to linger too much on it. It does provide quite a few funny moments. But not quite so endearing. It gives the feel that the movie doesn't take itself seriously.Harry Potter's the guy who's gonna save the world. And he seems to say, ""Hey, there's always the next movie to get serious. Let me have some fun here.""",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince

It's nothing special. And it was pointless of Draco to repair the cabinet because the Death Eaters didn't do anything. Now I'm a Snape fan so obviously I think there should have been way more of a build up. But others who have no favourites among characters agreed with me that there needed more build up, and more detailing on the spell that Harry found in the book belonging to the Half-Blood Prince.All-in-all I believe that the writing of the movie script could have been made much better.

This book wasn't my favorite of the series, but the movie is. I thought the special effects were fabulous, the acting was great, and the most dramatic scene at the end made my sob like my dog died (and I don't even have a dog).If you haven't read the books, you might not understand how this movie is not full of action and still amazing.

756,aparnablossoms,The POINT please?,2,20 July 2009,"Harry Potter and The Half Blood Prince.I must say. I love almost all the movies I watch. But this one was a definite shocker.People say that the movie is not to be compared with the book. But this movie is an adaptation from the book. The book is to be respected! But the entire plot line is changed!The First half was fun. Lot of Romance and Comedy. And Harry Potter seemed to enjoy the fact that he was the ' Chosen One ', something I don't remember happening in the book.. ever. It was still pretty good and even though Ron-Hermione already seemed to be in love and Harry realized he was in love with Ginny at the very beginning. I still enjoyed certain scenes a lot though.But the Second half was the total mood buster. The entire story seemed to be rushed. There was no affinity to the book. I don't know why Bellatrix set fire to the Burrow and ran off into the farms yelling "" I killed Sirius Black""! They could've easily replaced that 5 minute scene with Rufus Scrimgeor and Percy Weasley's visit to the Burrow. Movie would've made more sense then!Also the main point Of HBP was lost! The Memories! The Gaunts, Hokey, Tom Riddle working in Borin & Burke's weren't introduced at all! And Dumbledore's list of Horcrux's wasn't mentioned!And Dumbledore was able to apparate from the Tower? Then why didn't he apparate when Malfoy had the wand pointed at him. And why was ( magically UNbound) Harry not able to curse Malfoy when he was watching Dumbldore and Malfoy talk?On the whole a LOT of very important incidents were replaced with useless stuff ( like Ginny tying Harry's shoe laces for heaven's sake!!!)If its that difficult to fit the book into a movie make a tele-series or something, RESPECT THE BOOK!But the scene where Dumbledore produces a ring of fire and the scene where Snape reveals that he is the half blood prince were both quite impressive.Bottom Line : Watch it if you have to.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
757,lilwill1997,I'll give it a B+,8,30 July 2009,"I thought this harry potter movie was really good. But i thought the ending was pretty bad because they didn't do the battle that was in the end of the book.I thought the kiss scene between Harry and Ginny was a little disappointing. Because they didn't do it as it was in the book.This was the 4th best harry potter movie right after Golbet of fire, Chamber of sercets and Prisoner of Azakbran. They took a lot of stuff from the book out.This was one of the most disappointing Harry potter movies. Because of what they left out from the book. I thought it need a little more action scenes in the movie. And they focus a little to much on the love story.I can't wait to see it in imax. Because the special effects were great as always.It's good that there splitting the last book into two movies. Because now they should not leave anything out from the book.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
758,ivy1141990,Definitely not as good as my favorite book,4,15 July 2009,"This reminded me a lot of Twilight. It concentrated much more on the romance than actual important parts of the plot. It jumped all over the place. Honestly, if I had not reread the book a week ago I would have been so confused. But then again I spent the whole movie wondering where different parts were. Basically read the book again to get the plot but try not to think about it when watching the movie.*SPOILERS* There was so much missing from this. There were no memories which was such a huge part of the plot. Voldemort's mom wasn't in the movie. When Dumbledore was killed, I didn't feel any emotion. It was so confusing how Ginny never broke up with her other boyfriend and kissed Harry. If I had not read the book I would have been extremely confused. Also I missed not having the kiss in the Common Room and seeing Ron's whole reaction. This was my favorite book because of all of the romance but I feel like they kind of ruined the movie with it. I was really looking forward to seeing this movie since it was my favorite book. And while it was really amusing and had some good part, it didn't feel like it was based on the book enough",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
759,sabrin_uh,"again, another complainer.",3,15 July 2009,"Oh gosh. This movie was seriously lacking. The obviously artificial lighting was so distracting, though I understand Yates was going for ""dark."" There was really hardly any magic in the movie, and maybe the producers and director jumped too fast on the chance to get in some ""romance"" in there, which should've taken the back seat compared to the more important storyline--and way more interesting!--storyline, that of Tom Riddle. It was so choppy, the color palette was so banal, and though the minimal music did a good job at creating that darker atmosphere, it wouldn't hurt to put in a little more to make the movie more engaging! Sometimes the quiet was just too awkward because there was already so much missing from the movie.I read the book, but I forgot most of it, and I was so close to feeling lost. I'm sure my parents had no idea what was going on in the beginning. The ending was surely anticlimactic. Who cares if it's going to be ""too similar"" to the final movie?? That will be months and months from now, and anyway, all the plots are pretty similar! I think they were also going too much for that ""artsy"" appeal. There was a lot of beauty in the film, but it was more for show, and did less to compliment the atmosphere of the story. Sure, it was ""darker"" but it shouldn't mean emptier! Seriously. They should have just given in to making all the movies ten hours long with an intermission like back in the day. There would be less disappointed people.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
760,SierraWay,Definitely the best of the Potter franchise so far!,9,18 July 2009,"I can honestly tell you that I have been a Potter fan for more than half of my life. I have grown up with the Potter books and they matured at the same time I matured and at the very same rate. The five previous Potter films didn't always impress me. I adore Chamber of Secrets and the Sorceror's Stone, they contained the same feel of magic and wonder that the books did, the feeling of being new to Hogwarts and the wonder of the mysteries that reside there. Afterwards, the films got a bit choppy. I always felt that certain important plot points and bits of things that made the books my favorite, lacked to communicate with the big screen. Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince impressed me. I feel no need to restate the plot, as I'm sure it's been read many times. Daniel Radcliffe brings something extra to Harry this time around. He feels more human, and his loss is my loss. Rupert Grint was absolutely fantastic this time around as Ron Weasley. I found myself laughing at almost everything he said and did. His facial expressions were priceless. Emma Watson was outstanding as Hermione Granger once again. She has really matured with her character and I felt a real sense of emotion watching her. Not only was the three main stars fantastic, but as were the supporting cast. Tom Felton, who as Draco Malfoy, I had always felt a sort of Hatred towards him. But in this film, as I have read the books, I knew his ordeal, I felt sorry for him. And not just because I knew what he had to do, but the way he showed his hestitation for having to do it, it was more than clear that he didn't want to. He showed a little boy in a sense who was set out to do a dark deed. Michael Gambon reprised his role as the infamous Dumbledore, and I absolutely couldn't get enough of him. He was the gentle yet intimidating Dumbledore that we know and love, but in this film, I felt the weakness that was protruding from him. Alan Rickman was great as Severus Snape and I couldn't help but wish there was a bit more of him in the film. Bonnie Wright was cute and flirtacious as Ginny Weasley. Helena Bonham Carter brought fright to me as Bellatrix Lestrange. And Jim Broadbent was a perfect Slughorn (lacking in the looks department) but played him well. His expressions hilarious, and I found myself truly loving him and never looking at him the way he had thought Harry may look at him after showing him the real memory. I was thoroughly impressed with David Yates new direction. The film was visually stunning. I will take this film as his apology for truly butchering Order of the Phoenix (still loved it) and I wish for him to know that I accept it.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
761,sbgmail,Not The Potter We Expected,7,15 July 2009,"I can't take the real taste of magical Rowling style until The Goblet of Fire. That means i think David Yates isn't a right choice for the Harry Potter series. I don't surely know he is a good director maybe. Because in some thriller scenes it seems nice. It takes you in movie. But there are no solid connections between scenes in this movie. Seems like funny, thrilled and romantic scenes shown orderly. In funny scenes it seems adequate. They make you laugh really. You can't see much romantic scenes but it's OK. Thriller scenes are good. You feel the tension when you're watching. But something is missing. Something that original book or first two movies have is not in this movie. You can't go with it and forget the clock. You always watch because you wonder what is different from book. Also as the other fans said very important scenes deleted when filming. I think Chris Columbus or Mike Newell were good choices for Harry Potter but not sure about Yates. Watch this if you wonder but don't expect much...",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
762,nnordakk,Harry Potter is a big coward !!! At least according to the movie ...,2,29 July 2009,"I'm almost too angry to write a comment ! This is my first ever comment here. I give the movie a 2 because it has nicely filmed images and effects ... but there it ends, I would've liked giving it a 0.They invent story lines that conflict with the real storyline and in the mean time they haven't got the time left to film very important aspects of the book. The result is that in the end Harry is a scared witness that doesn't dare to act in stead of the person that in the book would have thrown himself in the fight if he could have ... In the end Harry looks like a big coward. So everybody who has read the book and thinks that Harry is a coward, I would say go and see the movie, all the others who think he's a brave gryffindor, just stay at home, spare yourself the money, and just enjoy rereading the book or you will be sad and disappointed as I was ...",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
763,jas_99,Disappointed,5,28 July 2009,"I am sorry, but I do not understand how so many people are loving this movie. I was extremely disappointed with this movie. They left out the two main parts of the story of the sixth book. Where is the battle? Where is Dumbledore's funeral? Why is Fenrir just a side character with no lines? Where are all the flashbacks? Especially the first at the Gaunt's. I am sorry to be one of the few who was not as pleased with this title. I just don't understand how the climax of the book can be left out of the movie. And what in the heck is the added scene at the Weasley's....Pointless. I did enjoy the cave scene however. I thought it was done quite well and the depiction was pretty close. I have been a die-hard Harry fan since the beginning and have read all of the books at least 3 times each, 5 times for the last three books. I enjoyed the movie but was definitely disappointed with it.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
764,ivakovac,A slap in the face for Harry Potter fans,1,6 March 2010,"There are many ways in which the story in the movie differs from the one in the book. One could conclude with certainty that everything in the book that contributes to the depth of the characters, thus the plot, making it convincing, is in the movie subordinated to the needs of commerce, meaning; action scenes (the notorious added scene, which was a truly ""how dare you"" move, according to book fans), clichés, ""let's-go-see-twilight"" type of crowd pleasers... The building of the story is completely destroyed, leaving only the scenes that were described as epic in the book, without awareness that the journey to these events, the details, and the getting to know the characters, played the most important role in the epic effect that it had on the readers. I understand that movie adaptations quite often require changes in plot and detail, so the story could be told right. This movie is, however, changing the story into something it is not; a shallow, boring, wannabe epic, that attracts mostly teenagers that desperately want to fit in. If Terry Gilliam had been given a chance to direct this, maybe it would have worked, but this guy turned a great story into a bad film, trying to make it ""better"". A slap in the face for Harry Potter fans.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
765,baladriarose9,"I'm a HUGE HP fan, but...",5,15 July 2009,"*Multitudes of Spoilers within* I am huge on Harry Potter....I would spend hours before Deathly Hallows defending Snape and analyzing everything. I loved book 6 immensely, but this movie was not well done. I was so disappointed, after having waited with everyone else for over a year for this and it didn't deliver.The acting was wooden and even awkward to witness at times. It seemed poorly organized. You definitely have to read the book to get the movie, which is not a good thing for people who just want to watch he films, for people who are not avid Potter fans. Things were unnecessarily added and important things were unnecessarily removed.It was impossible to follow for non-book readers because nothing was explained; it was just there. The necklace scene happened and was never discussed again. More attention was paid to Lavender Brown instead of the plot. Yes, character development was necessary, but there was neither a balance with plot nor any real character development! The fight scene at the Weasley's seemed entirely pointless to me., I read in an interview about why it was put in and thought it would be interesting to see, but I was disappointed because nothing happened.Fenrir Greyback was a superfluous character. He wasn't explained or given anything to do at all. The Quidditch match seemed stuffed in there. Once again, the organization and the transitions were non-existent. The Dursleys didn't even make an appearance, but that was OK. Unfortunately, they replaced it with a scene where Harry asks out some chick who never appears again.I think the biggest disappointment was there was NO WIZARD BATTLE at the end!!!! What the heck is up with that? Everything was so calm! No one fought anyone...completely absurd...where's Fenrir ripping Charlie's face off? Also, they didn't show Dumbledore's funeral...wouldn't that have been good closure for his death? Especially since it was rated PG...they toned down everything else, they should have kept his funeral! The only cool part for me was Dumbldore's fire scene and Snape who is always wonderful in the movies. He needs more air time...I can't understand why they don't put more focus on him, given his singular importance.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
766,msmith4-2,Trying hard to figure out what book this is based on,3,22 November 2010,"This film reminds me of the story about people writing serials who would leave the hero in a completely inescapable position because someone else was going to write the next chapter.This film is missing critical setup for itself and the Deathly Hallows. The Burrow burned down ? Really ? I don't seem to remember reading that. Harry getting propositioned by the (definitely sharp looking) waitress...missed that too. Fudge's explanation ? Gone. Dumbledore's funeral ? Gone. But we did get the bridge collapse (I think that's from Thornton Wilder), the kidnapping of Ollivander, and a sterilized version of The Kiss. The battle to escape Hogwarts after Dumbledore's death ? MIA.This is the worst adaptation of the HP books to this point. I can only hope there's a remake.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
767,JohnnyOnAQuest,My favorite Potter movie (coming from an avid fan),9,15 July 2009,"Let me start off by saying, I am a huge HP fan. I have read the books countless times, am a daily visitor on MuggleNet, and have subscribed to Mugglecast for four years. The books are definitely where it's at, and the movies are so-so. I can still remember storming out of the theatre after OOTP two years ago, yelling the whole way home about how David Yates screwed everything up and how awful of a movie it was altogether, story line and directing style. However, the Half-Blood Prince surpassed each of the last 5 movies greatly in almost aspect. I came into the movie theater completely stoked because of all of the positive reviews it was getting on Rotten Tomatoes. After seeing all the previews last fall, I thought the general look of the movie was just overall better. And it was. I owe David Yates a huge apology for cursing his name so many times over the last two years. This was a great picture and I know the next two will be great as well. I also owe Michael Gambon a bit of an apology, but WHERE WAS THIS DUMBLEDORE THE LAST 3 MOVIES?? Gambon totally exceeded my expectations, he was so good in HBP! I could not stand him at all in the previous three, he was just a grumpy old gray man. In HBP he was old, wise, with his white shiny hair he was supposed to have the whole time. A great performance out of him, so great I really really wish we had seen this out of him in the other movies.When I first saw Slughorn in the previews, I was completely irritated. He was supposed to be a largely obese man with a big mustache? But then I got to thinking, how many quality actors are actually really fat? There's only two answers- Richard Griffiths and that fat guy from the Diabetes commercial. Neither of them could play Slughorn. Broadbent made this movie, I love that dang cooky smile he always had on and how his eyes just always looked so crazy...I can't describe it but I loved it. He performed amazingly.I know people are upset about the omission of the battle and confused on the burrow scene, and I will say I partly agree with you. The Burrow scene was in there to show that the death eaters were f***ing s**t up this whole time. Remember in the book how they read the paper every morning and reading about everythign that was happening? That scene was a lot better than having stupid newspaper flashbacks or whatever they had in OOTP. For me, it was the little things that made this movie. When they include tiny details from the book, it really makes it special to me. I was ecstatic that they had the whole Aragog burial scene, it was so well done and I was glad to see Hagrid get some screen time. Also, just random little lines that were so similar to the book, it makes the movie that much more special.For everyone who's complaining about how funny it is- lighten up! This is how it's supposed to be. I catch myself laughing out loud whenever I read the books, they're hilarious. JK just has a writing style that can be so serious at one point and hilarious the next, I was laughing and enjoying myself the whole time, it just really made me feel good.Overall, really spectacular movie. The people complaining about how they left too much stuff out are also the ones complaining that it jumped around. I liked how they focused on central things and really got deep into them, instead of going ADD and showing every little possible thing for 30 seconds. Whether you liked it or not, you really do have to admire the trio growing and Gambon and Broadbent's performances, they were so outstanding. Go see it again! I know I am.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince

Harry tries everything to help him in the book - here, Potter looks like a coward - he should win against Voldemort?This is the first movie where I really think I won't buy it.

But, unfortunately, we decided to wait for quite a while to get the most possible out of it, by going to watch it in 3D IMAX. THAT WAS A MISTAKE! I'm not sure if it was stated anywhere, but the movie runs in 3D only the first 15, the most uneventful, minutes or so. If it were the first 3D movie ever, I guess it could be an excuse. But it were not! I felt robbed, by paying extra $7 and getting an even worse quality movie, I'd get in a regular theater.Otherwise, I liked the performance of the actors, just as much as before and if you liked the previous movies, it won't disappoint you (BUT DON'T GO TO IMAX 3D). The new character, Slughorn, is played very nicely by Jim Broadbent, introducing, as was before with new figures, a new light into the movie.So, as a conclusion - go see the movie, but AVOID going to 3D IMAX!",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
770,michael-triscele,The Magic Spell that got F'd Way Up.....,3,15 July 2009,"This movie was an incredible disappointment for me and my 10 friends that went. Warner Brothers should be hung for putting this garbage out. The movie is a complete puff piece. It was like watching a G rated version of the movie through cliff notes of the book. They left out Dumbledore's funeral and far far worse removed any of the psychological mind bending that was going on throughout the story. It was more of a comedy then anything. Then to top it off Snape not only was a wimp because they dumbed down his character, they removed Much of Tom Riddles story, like the fact he had already murdered before even attending school at Hogwarts (as it was inferred when remembering the cave scene as described when he visited it as child), or any of the other deeply rooted evil things his character is. The movie lacked any real substance comparable with the book. It was an incredible let down. Also, who in heck was thinking ""hmmmmm we wont release the movie for another 9 months and we probably don't need to review it or compare it with the book, nawwww we'll just fleece the public for all there worth and turn out a crap job thats made for the people who are to lazy to read the books for themselves.""This movie was supposed to be DARK!!!!!!! This was the book that taught you to despise and hate Snape, but instead it was ""ohh he's really kind of a nice guy isn't he?"" when you are not supposed to find that out until the 3rd or 4th to last chapter of the last book. This movie should have made you hate and fear Voldemort even more to because you finally understood how Voldemort came to be. This movie done right should have been rated R and gone for another 15-20 minutes. If I were Warner Brothers id be no less than ashamed. They took one of the greatest original book series in decades and ruined it as far as im concerned. Its a puff piece with no soul. Any art that was there is now lost.All I want to know is did anyone in this film or even better did David Yates or anyone at Warner brothers read the freaking book??!??!??!?!? Get the director back from ""The Prisoner of Azkaban"", he understood how to make you feel like Hogwarts was real and made you feel like you were there and made it all DARK!!! Just as the book was.

PLEAAAAAAAAAAAASEEEEEEEE don't make the 7th movie.. I don't think is the actors and actress that make the movie so bad..

I know that the 6th book isn't such fairy tail like the 1st, but it's a movie of high quality but not like in TS. Most of all episodes outdoors weren't panoramic like in other films. And territory around castle and Weastly's house was not the same like it was previous. About actors. Play of Ginny was the worst comparing with the 2d film. And also I don't like that half of plot in this movie was changed especially 2 last episodes (in cave and Dambldor's death). I don't think that it was to hard to do all like in book.

Remember that they are limited to two and half hours and cannot translate the text word for word. Overall this movie did a wonderful job of capturing the essence of what J.K.

It seems - FOR ONE WHO HAS NOT READ THE NOVELS - necessary to be in possession of a SIXTH sense, to understand the plot of the HBP by only watching the movie. What prefigures during the OOTP is the impossibility to picturize in 2 hours what lasts 607 pages!That's platitudinous? - Sure, but still necessary! As the first three HPmovies showed, there is a way of filming a novel by emphasizing the thread(s) and motives of the literature by extracting them thoroughly from the remaining plot. That worked in the beginning of the Harry Potter Movie Art! Those were self-reliant pieces of filming by telling the most important facts and the interconnectedness of the main characters. You can easily apprehend that in 2 hours cinema-time! Not to be misunderstood: That is exactly what the HBP wanted and did. It's only, that the motives increased, the interconnectedness complicates and the main characters changed a lot. So, for example, there is not enough time for the Dumbledore-Snape Link, especially in this part the history and development of the Dark Lord, though the movie emphasizes on that, there is not the space for the Weasley/Granger- connection. Something that prefigures in OOTP very sensitive and well-worked-out as I think. During the whole movie there is a constant swing from dark, terrifying pictures to first-love motives, which need the ease of the first movies, everything being new and so on.I think - without knowing the product - Rowling and Warner Bros. are well advised to split the last part. That'll give us the chance to enjoy more time with Potter & Co. and perhaps a propitiatory end, as it is couched literarily!",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince

The filmmakers did a superb job re-creating the eeriness and darkness of the novel. Unfortunately, that's about ALL they captured of the book.NOWHERE does Dumbledore inform Harry what the remaining horcruxes are, or even HOW MANY exist. Harry NEVER sees the memories he needs to fulfill the incredible task before him. Dumbledore is even SURPRISED about how many horcruxes Riddle created! How can this film lead into the two-part finale? Harry will have to have tremendous leaps of intuition to even figure out what the horcruxes are. I can't see how the makers will reconcile this ridiculous oversight. Why, exactly, is there a near 10 minute scene at the Burrow, where Harry, Ginny, Lupin, and Tonks fight Bellatrix and Fenrir (NOT IN THE BOOK), when that time could have been better spent explaining the hows, whats, wheres, and whys of Voldemort's horcruxes?!?!?!

They should have thought it out more clearly what to include and what to discard. The fact that they added a scene that, while dramatic, was a complete deviation from the real story line. They could have lengthened the show by about 10 minutes and set everything on path. I wont even mention the butchering of the ending. I truly hope the last book is followed more closely.

I started going to the HP films for the wonder and imagination, my favorites are the day to day magic like making dinner, and scenes where the Hogwarts students are learning magic. There was 1 interesting potions scene, no defense against the dark arts, 1 new discovery by Potter, 1 fun cleaning the house scene, no interesting dining hall magic during dinners, and Voldemort is not in this film. It had some comedic scenes, but nothing to make me laugh long enough to miss anything important. The sets were again amazing. I LOVED Fred and George's shop scene. The memory scenes were captivating. The quidditch games were good but not as exciting as earlier films. Hermione's brilliance was completely overlooked. The Half-Blood Prince storyline was skipped, Dumbledore's withering hand storyline was skipped. The ending had a twist but was underwhelming.

The movie sets itself up very nicely for a fantastic finish. Unfortunately, that is not how it ends up. The fact that there is no intense battle at Hogwarts at the end makes me very unhappy. Director David Yates claims that the reason behind removing the battle was because of the final battle in book 7. Well, I don't think that is justification to completely change one of Rowling's books. I am shocked that she gave them the go-ahead to change the ending by so much. If, however, you have not read the books and have only seen the movies than I would imagine you would enjoy this movie a lot more than those who have read the books. I would have easily given this movie a 9 but the last 20 minutes should have been so much different that I just cant.

She focuses on the scene and how it is supposed to be delivered. I've read a lot from the book purists that they left too much out. They DIDN'T. They told everything that needed to be told.Every single part of this movie is great. It is funny,emotional,well acted,great looking,and very good storytelling.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
781,jorda0mega,The point of view of a guy who has not read the books.,6,26 July 2009,"First of all let me state that I am not a hardcore Harry Potter fan. I have not read the books, however, I have watched all the previous movies. Having said that, I found this movie somewhat slow. Although it did explain a great deal of stuff, I thought the movie lacked action scenes. The previous movies of Harry Potter I thought to be very entertaining. There was a great deal of action, magic and interesting stories. They were the kind of movies that drive one to go to the movie theater, I mean who doesn't want to see magic in a wizard movie? This movie on the other hand lacked a lot of that. On the other hand it did explain some intriguing stuff which I found very interesting but not enough to drive my attention throughout the whole movie. As a result, I felt bored and even sleepy at times. Even though I might understand why some fans find this movie particularly amusing, I don't think it is worth the money for outsiders of the HP world like myself. Once again, this review is intended to give some insight to people that might want to watch a good adventure/fantasy movie.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
782,fermanagh2000,This is boring and bad!!!,5,16 July 2009,"Come on, are you serious? I saw this last night and actually fell asleep! I can't remember the last time that this happened in a cinema as I'm a avid movie lover...This was the more boring 2.5 hrs I've sat through in a long time!!! Harry Potter is supposed to be a magician but we never saw any of his supposed potential!!! In fact he waved his wand a few times and barely conjured up any magic at all... No action, just long drawn scenes that went nowhere...together with no plot cohesion...bad boring movie that only wins with people because the novels are extremely popular!!! I suggest that everyone waits for the DVD release!",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
783,hotbosons,Will it pay a price for altering and cutting the original story-line?,6,21 July 2009,"I was very excited to watch this movie mainly because of two reasons, 1. It is a harry potter movie and 2. The story takes a decisive turn in finding weapons that will lead to the final goal of throwing out the dark lord. However, I was disappointed after watching this movie as the movie is completely out of line from the original book. We all understand that the entire book can not be covered in a movie that is about 2 hrs long but this one misses too many important events that any harry potter book reader will not be able to digest. The cinematography , sound and special effects are all great in this movie but just the constant reminder of many scenes that any harry potter book lover will miss in this movie is a killer for me. If you have not read Harry Potter books than probably you want find any difference and will actually like this movie but for someone like me who loves Harry Potter books will definitely be disappointed. And all around the world this series of movies have become very popular just because most of them have read harry potter books. The director has disappointed all the harry potter book lovers in this movie and it will be very interesting to see whether it will also affect the gross turn-out and ultimately the profit. I am now looking forward for the Blu Ray release of this movie especially the 'extended version' if they have any plans for the extended version of this movie. For me that might make sense.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
784,katrine_stangeland,I Don't understand what others are complaining about,10,17 July 2009,"Trust me, if you choose to not see the movie because of the negative comments you will truly lose something. i am not saying that others reviews are bad, but giving the movie 1 star or 2 stars i simply stupid. If you truly are a harry potter fan you will enjoy the movie, not off course love it, because the movies and the books will always be different, and thats the point!. many people are complaining about how different it was from the book and so on, well, a movie cant be exactly similar to the book, thats why it is callers ""the Movie"", if you want the book then you should read the book. one should think of what the movie contains, not that its not the book.to begin with, i must say that i think this is the best Harry potter movie, it combines darkness,teenage love(witch by the way was not as cheesy as i though at the first time), and off course magic not to mention Humor. The humor in this film is one of the greatest, its hard to explain, but its something most people find funny,the love witch i at first found stupid(because i have never like love in books) was in fact enjoyable to watch, not many people think this, but i found this movie to be closest to the book of all the movies.When Hermione gets angry over Ron being with Another girl, we get to see that she might have feelings for Ron, Emma Watson(Hermione) does an sweet and mature acting witch i felt was great. While Rupert Grint(Ron) Is simply an Comedy king and i really believe he will continue acting. The Draco part was true to the movie, and we get to see who Draco really is, Tom Felton does an amazing job as the New death eater Draco Malfoy. When it comes to the darkness scenes, i have to say that Michael Gambon(Dumbledore) shows the greatest Albus of all time, and his acting is simply touching and beautiful to watch. The memories that belongs to Tom riddle was simply simply amazing, and Jim Broadbent was the perfect choice for Slughorn whom harry tries to get a memory from.The trios acting had become better, and off course the always amazing Alan Rickman(Snape) shows himself in his true colors.Furthermore, i will say to you that this movie is something i cannot understand why other people hate it. to me, it is simply an masterpiece,even if you are an harry potter fan or not you should see it. and remember this is not the ""figthing movie"" that is the last movie, this is about finding answers and HOW to defeat the dark lord in the end.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
785,artyvice,I liked it but....,7,15 July 2009,"This movie does serve it's purpose, serving as a gateway between the previous and up-coming films. I have to say as a passionate follower of the books and movies, I expected so much more from this film as the 6th book was my favorite. There was so much detail left out of the movie that I felt I wish would of been seen. Now I fully understand the difficulties of adapting a book onto screen and filming the most important parts of the book and trying to make everything tie itself together. I commend Yates for the difficult tasks he has before to do the series justice. Like I said, I just wish there was more detail in it, it was striped of so much and changed a tad here and there from the book. I guess it's just too hard being as the movie was already 9 reels long. I give it a 7 for my profound love of the series. All I can say is that if Yates states ""You haven't seen anything yet"" I hope he really has something special in line for us in the next two. By giving himself another movie to help finish the 7th book, I believe he will be able to add more to the movie.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
786,drakulashaker,A long wait to be let down...,5,16 July 2009,"...but how can a book be better than the film? The main story of the book is Dumbledore's realisation of the existence of Horcruxes, and the crucial help required from Harry to secure possession of an old un-tampered memory belonging to Slughorn, the new potions master; and in turn find the Horcruxes and destroy them. Infected by an incurable curse, Dumbledore knows that his time is running out.The side show is mainly Draco's dilemma, Quidditch, a luck potion and romance; with a splattering of news of terrible events in both the Wizarding and Muggle worlds.The finale of the book is a climactic confrontation of good versus evil, like we expect in all good stories, which sees our hero trapped, helpless, as he painfully watches the man he admires, slain by the hand of the man he detests. Thus leading to our hero's struggle to complete a monumental task that only he alone can accomplish.The film, however, takes a different approach. It shows our hero not only smitten with a clever little book but also Ron's sister. There is some curiosity from him regarding the main story, his attempts to retrieve the memory, his journeys into the pensieve, but, his early comment to Dumbledore 'to be honest Professor, I just kind of go with it' really seems to sum up his 'tagalong' approach. His main interest is more with Draco's dilemma, which is the norm considering Draco is top of his list when it comes to 'someone up to no good'.We then have to endure far too much romance and comedy? Although I had to snigger at Ron falling off the back of the couch in Slughorn's study. Even Dumbledore gets in on it with his line in the hospital regarding Lavender being shunned by Ron, 'oh to be young again and feel the bitter sting of love'. No prizes for who he is thinking of. Eventually, we get back to the main event which is cracking open a Horcrux, unfortunately it didn't pop for me. The cave scene lacked. No atmosphere, danger, anticipation, trepidation. And sadly the screaming pleas of Dumbledore to Harry did not materialise.Which left me with one last hope that the finale would make up for everything? It left me stoney cold. The dialogue seemed empty. The setting was dire, like an amateur dramatics evening on squeaky boards, and more so, our hero just seemed to watch it all unfold. The fleeing of the Death Eaters was made easy with our hero's weak efforts to impede them. Finally, we gather around the body of Dumbledore. Unfortunately there is nothing moving about it at all, in fact there's probably more movement in the corpse. Now this part in the book had it all, emotion, pain, passion, injuries, tears, but most of all it projected a mood – all omitted from the film which left nothing but an American style sob.Good bits; The snatching of Ollivander, Millennium Bridge, The Burrow, the levitating Katie Bell, pensieve dips, young Riddle, Fenrir, Bellatrix, Ron's Quidditch moment. And well done Horace.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
787,jNets,A truly great film for fans of HP,10,14 July 2009,"The sixth instalment of the Harry Potter series delivers everything it should. Action, suspense, comedy, horror and sadness are all done in exactly the right amounts. The movie takes you on a roller coaster ride of emotions, from happy to sad to scared and many other places in between. It is certainly a movie that will have you laughing out loud one minute, gripping the arm of your chair the next, and if you're anything like me, crying your eyes out as well. But it is so worth the ride. I hope other HP fans like my family and I will enjoy it as much as we did. And I hope that it continues to attract new viewers to the series. They haven't all been brilliant, but I think this one is easily the best. Sure they haven't kept everything in from the book, but they can't. It just wouldn't be possible. What they have done though, they have done very well. Well worth the money!",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
788,hconiglio10,Phoning it in...,5,3 August 2009,"To start off, I will admit that I am indeed a Potter Purist. I have read all of the books several times, but I understand the translation from novel to film often leaves certain points from the book out. And, as with all of the Harry Potter books, it is impossible to cram every plot point into a movie that people will actually sit through. With this clarification out of the way, may the review begin: To give the film credit, it was beautifully shot, the scenery was lovely, etc.,etc. But the quality of the film pretty much stops there. The young actors, who have supposedly ""grown into"" their respective roles, still struggle to bring gravity and true, teenaged emotion to the screen. As a result, many scenes in the film lack the power that they could have.The veteran actors, who usually steal the show with their subtle but powerful performances, are unfortunately given little screen time. The two characters who primarily appear are Michael Gambon and Jim Broadbent as Albus Dumbledore and Horace Slughorn, respectively. The two actors are horribly miscast. Gambon has been a weak point as Albus Dumbledore since his induction into the movies, portraying the venerable headmaster as flighty and lacking the gravity he possesses in the books. Broadbent shows a clueless, bumbling Horace Slughorn, as opposed to the canny and clever version he was in the novels.Still keeping in mind that not all points from a novel make it into the movie, many scenes from the books were cut that were vital for not only understanding the plot of the film, but in understanding events that occur in the seventh installment. The scenes that were added were absolutely pointless to the overall plot of the story. The teenage romance story lines, while mildly entertaining at first, drag on and add nothing to the overall plot. Even the extremely important stories of the Half-Blood Price and the early Voldemort are streamlined to make way for the love stories, making the film in to a teenaged love story instead of the revelations about Voldemort's origins and the importance of the information that they provide. In short, it is becoming obvious that they filmmakers of the Harry Potter franchise are phoning it in. It is becoming less about the stories and more about the money they will bring in. I hope that with the time spent on the two-part conclusion will bring much better, much more poignant films. However, I am not optimistic.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
789,j-mathews22,Yates successfully ruined the best book of the series,5,16 July 2009,"Remember the lord of the rings trilogy? Each installment pushed three hours and everyone sat through that and loved every minute? The Return of the king obtained a clean sweep at the Oscars which is the smallest hint to how great the films were. This movie skips over so many vital portions of the book and emphasizes the love stories with horrific acting. For most fans I have full confidence in saying this is the worst interpretation of a Harry Potter Book and they should have hired better writers and a better director who actually read the book. I am not sure if they are worried about time or whether little children would follow but this book was a work of art and to disgrace it with this awful editing and plotting really rubs me the wrong way. Take a chance and be bold, follow the plot! Two positives: Malfoy did a good job portraying the scared,dark hesitant character and the cinematography was excellent.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
790,gokgozm,Worst HP Movie ever,1,3 August 2009,"Only ~20% of movie contains main story. About 80% is high-school children loves. Lover fights, feelings... Young actors & actress acts are very awful.In death scene, i think they're not feeling bad. Only very few tears on Emma Watson eyes. Other act are very bad. And director try to make this scene dramatic with not music, but in movies acting is first thing, not effect and music. These are supporters.I'm not going to coming HP movies. Maybe rent them when they release DVDs.Sorry for my English.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
791,guido-pettinari,Boring,4,21 July 2009,"I did not like the movie at all. I am not speaking about the story - the movie itself was rubbish! There were no connections between different scenes, it looked like a collage of separated mini stories.Moreover, the focus on the teenager side was really boring. Really, who cares about the redhead girlfriends when the Dark Lord is going to conquer the world?I liked the other episodes, but this time I was really bored. I suspect that the movie production spared money knowing that people would pay the ticket anyway.A last remark on Daniel Radcliffe acting. I think he can act, but the director must have told him not to do so. He is irritating, always with the same expression and stuttering.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
792,ductape723,Rocked my multi-colored neon socks off!,10,16 July 2009,"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince is the best movie so far. In fact (I know this is totally sacrilege) in many ways it even surpasses the book.For one thing, it was definitely the funniest movie. It was in fact funnier than all five previous movies combined, including the scenes that were hilarious but that weren't intended to be from the first few movies. Just about everyone in the audience got all the jokes and there was never a moment I can recall when anyone laughed at a part that wasn't supposed to be funny.The acting was AWESOME! Daniel Radcliffe did every part of this movie well, especially the humor, which was nice since we've never really gotten to see him being funny in the previous movies. Rupert Grint also played his role well, especially after he swallowed Romilda Vane's potion and had to be the love-struck fool. Emma Watson delivered the usual excellent performance. You could really feel her pain of being in love with Ron who didn't love her back. Evanna Lynch is an amazing Luna, 'nuff said.SPOILERS IN FOLLOWING PARAGRAPH Tom Felton did exceptionally well after having a mostly minor role in the previous films. He made you feel sorry for Draco Malfoy to the point where I actually found myself defending his actions at the end of the film. Which I thought was a nice touch in comparison the Malfoy of the books who is 100% impossible to like. Sure, Malfoy's still mean in the movie, and you still hate him, but you end up hating him for being mean, not for trying to kill Dumbledore. NO MORE SPOILERS FOR NOWJim Broadbent was AMAZING as Slughorn. Sure he wasn't fat and wheezy, but he did so well you ended up not caring. Bonnie Wright as Ginny Weasley could have been much better. Though I think that it's also partially the script. Most of her dialogue seemed forced and not very natural. Michael Gambon was interesting to watch. In the previous movies he's always been so serious so the occasional funny and personal lines he would deliver were new to the audience, but he delivered them well. Jessie Cave as Lavender Brown seemed way over the top. But in a way she managed it well.The cinematography was the best ever. The opening scene with the flashbulbs going off was gorgeous. It made you think of old movies and it was an excellent opener to the movie. All the other scenes with the camera angles were perfect. Though there were a few unnecessary close-ups but other than that it was excellent. Also the staging (Where people are and when) was very well done.The score was the best one yet. It didn't have random titanic reminiscent music in the most random places (POA). The music was much more dramatic than in the first three movies. And it was quite a bit better than movies four and five.The script was definitely the best one yet. Except for the scene where Ginny hides the book in the room of requirement, it had no corny scenes. The humor in it was excellent all the jokes were actually funny and well delivered, which definitely helped.The best scene in the entire movie was when Harry drank the felix felicis, I think that was definitely the moment where Daniel Radcliffe shone the brightest.Quidditch (which has been missing for the past two movies and was barely there in the third) was excellent. The way it was staged and run made the games actually exciting, unlike how they've been in all the other movies (the ones that had Quidditch anyways).SPOILER IN FOLLOWING PARAGRAPH I've heard many complaints about the attack on the burrow scene. But I didn't mind that. It was deviating from the book but it was excellent in showing how the worlds changing in the story. It shows the audience how Voldemort's rise makes life so uncertain. One minute you could be eating dinner in a nice warm house, the next your house is being consumed in flames while you stand helpless in the yard. And Molly Weasley's expression in that scene definitely helped show that in the movie. END OF SPOILER FOR NOWScene transitions were fairly smooth, there were a few scenes that I thought it was kind of choppy, but bearable. Also there were some issues with keeping the balance between light and dark. In the movie, it was also rather choppy, but once again, bearably so. The movie was also very fast paced which made its unusually long runtime (153 minutes or 2 and a half hours) unnoticeable. Also, the special effects (which were LOTR worthy) were excellent.So basically, it was absolutely amazing. Everything about it was just 100% top notch, best movie I've seen all year. This is definitely a movie to watch again and again.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
793,oopazob,"the weakest in the series ..""I want my money back""",4,19 October 2009,"Too little action, too much fluff, and, at the end.Definitely the weakest film yet, The movie was just plain AWFUL! ""I want my money back"". Consider me highly disappointed in that this is by far the weakest film of the series, and that's saying something after the extremely dull Order of the Phoenix.From a purely cinematographic point of view, the dialogue was rushed, the almost non-existent plot focused too much on minor relationships and details, and none of the scenes elicited the response intended. It was difficult for a scene to last one minute, let alone thirty seconds. The climax was not given enough time to fully develop, and the story ended so abruptly even I was left with a sense of confusion.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
794,frsandstone77,"Please, don't go into this movie looking for the book.",10,15 July 2009,"I want to make sure that everyone understands that I am an avid reader of the books. I have read them all 6-7 times through. The last time I had read book 6 was two days ago, in preparation for the film. I regret this slightly, as I was constantly reminded throughout the film that this was not the book, but was the best that the screenwriters could do with the time limit they were given.Here's where I explain my rating of ""10/10."" After the film began with a certain chapter neglected I realized that I should stop viewing it as a book put into video form, and more of a movie based loosely on the book. After that point, I started to enjoy the film. The movie follows the book almost to a ""T"" in terms of basic plot structure. Things happen in different ways than they do in the book, but I decided this was because, in the book, Rowling was able to tell the reader more about the current situation with her own comments. Everything important is accounted for in this film. The movie itself, from a movie standpoint, was really good. It was funny, scary, and flowed amazingly.Some advice for movie goers: When you watch the movie, don't look for details, because at 2hr30min they really can't fit that much of the book on screen. Enjoy this one, in my opinion, it's the best so far.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
795,Verok,"A different Potter, lyrical and introspective",8,16 July 2009,"I walked into the theater on opening day expecting a bigger, darker, and equally rushed installment of Harry Potter from David Yates. What I saw couldn't have surprised me more: this newest Potter is unrecognizably different from its predecessors, darker and scarier certainly, but also possessed of a lyricism and artistic expressiveness that had rarely, if ever, graced earlier films in the franchise. Every shot is a work of art; every dialogue carefully calibrated; every moment a visual feast. That isn't to say this film is unequivocally better than the preceding five: it gains its lyricism at the expense of continuity and solid storytelling. Unlike previous installments, which often feel rushed, Half-Blood Prince takes its time, moving at a leisurely pace from one artfully realized scene to the next. The overall result - despite the sweet, sometimes engrossing, and occasionally sublime artistry of each scene - is a disjointed whole that lacks real momentum until the last thirty minutes or so, like a series of anecdotes that blend nicely into one another but don't lead solidly or insistently, as they do in the books, from one to the next. The story is also very likely to be confusing for those who aren't more than casual fans of the books: many little details and subplots are included with minimal exposition, making the film more a visual translation of a story instead of a story in its own right. In spite of this, there's a lot that redeems this adaptation. The humor is impressively edgy and frequent, the romance touching but not excessive. Some scenes are genuinely terrifying, others truly exhilarating. A few are deeply moving in their understated power. The acting from the veterans - particularly Michael Gambon (Dumbledore), Alan Rickman (Snape), and Jim Broadbent (Slughorn) - is pitch perfect, while the trio, though not Oscar material, continue to improve with each film. Nicholas Hooper's score, while not on par with John Williams' creations, has also improved this time around and has some truly beautiful moments.In sum, this is an adaptation that I have a lot of respect for, even though I disagree with some of the changes that the screenwriter and director have implemented. In cinematic execution it outdoes all previous Potter films; its only shortfall is in the storytelling, which seems to have taken a step backward from that of previous films. Here's hoping that David Yates succeeds in combining the artistry of this latest film with the taut pacing of Goblet of Fire or Order of the Phoenix to make the last two installments something truly great.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
796,KilsonCyan,Bloody free spirited screenplay!,4,15 November 2010,"Just FYI, I just started rereading the half-blood-prince and am about in the middle of it. Considering I have seen the movie several times, I can only say what happened? The screenplay has changed so many facts that were important to the story itself that you wonder why JK Rowling is ""OK"" with it. I must say that the book itself is quite long to be turned into just one movie. Same goes for the fifth and seventh. But the seventh got turned into two movies. Anyhow the movie will upset you if you read the book and loved it. However the movie itself does work. Considering of course not taking it as a movie in a series. Because its rather not making to much sense at all because tons of facts are missing.So if you just watched the movies but love the harry potter series, read the books. If you love the movies keep on watching, they are great by themselves. I liked the movie to be quite honest anyway, that's why it gets 4 stars after all. It's nicely done with effects and the implementation of the wizards world is great. The mood throughout the movie is really dark and depressive which makes it likable. The feeling of it reminds of Star Wars Episode 3.Concluding everything in one sentence. Nice movies but bad series!",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
797,riv-deez,What's the big deal?,8,21 July 2009,"Personally, I don't get why everyone is calling this movie such a failure.If you're a purist, you'll probably hate this film. As an adaptation, it's lacking. The credits say ""based on..."" for a reason. The only thing I personally considered a necessity and found lacking was the story of the Half-Blood Prince. So the Prince is Snape... why? What bearing does that have? It could have done with a little elaboration.If you'll all be just a little bit patient, I think you'll find all the ""holes"" that you seem to think make this a film such a catastrophe are plugged to an acceptable standard at some point in the next two films. This is a series, remember? There is time to recover the series you are apparently already mourning.I didn't fork out $10 expecting development of characters that hardly impact on the action-oriented films. I paid to see a dark, mysterious action film intermingled with comedy and special effects, which is precisely what I've come to expect from Harry Potter in the 8 years since I first saw The Philosopher's Stone. In that regard, this film is amazing. It is at once funny and dark, an important contrast that the main actors accomplished with great success. There was killing and magic and Quidditch. It had intrigue, raw emotion, and love triangles overlapped in such a way that it was like a love Star of David. It was like observing a regular day at high school... with dark wizards. Believe me, it's one pretty exhilarating ride if you're a fan of the movies, and can watch without deconstructing it.If you haven't seen it yet, go see it without thinking of the book.If you saw it, and you weren't impressed, forget that the books were ever written. Imagine that some Hollywood writer pulled this series out of the blue. Thus, wipe out any preconception you had, every detail of the story that you think of when you think ""Harry Potter"". Watch every film again, then go back and see The Half-Blood Prince once more. You'll be amazed at how much you enjoy it when you stop trying to pick out the bits that are ""wrong"".",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
798,david_woods,A bit disappointing for a non-die hard potter fan.,6,20 July 2009,"Having never been a die hard fan, or having read any of the books, I have enjoyed the Harry Potter series because each installment has been full of adventure, excitement, intrigue, a bit of romance, and, most importantly, a good storyline. I have watched all movies several time and enjoyed them each time. This last installment has been a bit of a disappointment to someone who just enjoys the series for it's overall value. To put it in a nutshell, this movie started, and ended, in the same spot. All the action, adventure, romance, excitement all went nowhere; It was a space filler. By the end of the movie I was getting a bit uncomfortable because I assumed they would be closing off the storyline, but instead the movie ended with nothing noticeable achieved and no quest completed. For the entire movie, the only action/adventure that seemed to have a point was right at the end of the movie. The rest of it seemed to be there to try and spice up a storyline that was not doing anything or going anywhere.The romance also went nowhere. It started at point A, went to Point B and C then decided to go back to A and pretend B and C never happened. Overall the whole movie was a big disappointment. I assume another movie is coming out, otherwise there would have been absolutely no point to this movie.If you're a die hard fan, like the two girls I went with, I can see the value of this movie, even though they both admitted the movie (and the book, because this movie was very close to the book, apparently) did not go anywhere. If you're not a die hard fan then I would wait until it comes out on DVD.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
799,iiwerin,What the bloody hell was that???,1,24 July 2009,"I really do not understand how Rowling could let all this happen?!I loved the books. I loved the movies. At least the first three.Many before me have listed those things that we all have been waiting for to be featured in this movie for so long a time. In vain... I'll not repeat them.My favourite scene in the book was the flight from the castle and the battle. It was exciting and intense. Completely missing from the movie. So are Kreacher and Dobby and all the other house-elves. And no diadem, no Order of the Phoenix (inside or outside Hogwarts). There is one tiny thing I have never understood. I know that technology is improving every day. But if the visual effects department features something in one movie, why do they have to change it later? Remember the scene with Sirius in the fireplace in HP IV? And then in HP V? Not the same, and in my opinion, the latter version is worse. Or the dementors that were brilliant in III, and changing ever since? Or the Pensieve? and the thoughts?And please somebody tell me where the bloody hell is the green flash from avada kedavra? Why exactly is it blue in the Half Blood Prince?I don't see why they waited so long to come out but have started to work on Deathly Hallows I-II. Maybe they should have see the viewers reactions first and then choose a decent crew...Everybody hates now Yates. I have to admit, his part was big in how to make this film a piece of shite. But what about Kloves? I really hope he made a lot of money now, and that when next time readers come along a very good and enjoyable book he will not feel the necessity to adapt it... And that neither will the authors give him permission to do so...I am not sure I am interested in the final movies anymore... And I well know I am not alone...You know, if I think of how much they changed the story, they really should have kept Sirius alive. He and Snape could have been pals, Hermione could be stupid or the whole story set on the moon. OR maybe start the whole thing Voldemort killing Harry...",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
800,ludacha,I expected so much more,5,5 August 2009,"In advance, I would like to apologize for my English. There aren't any important spoilers in this review. All funny moments in the movie? I've seen in trailer. It was a great opening, the bridge scene, but that was in the trailer, that I (and I believe and many other fans) watched so many times before movie was released.Dramatic scenes weren't so dramatic after all. So much scenes were dragged out, some weren't even explained, and so many weren't necessary. Actually, too many things weren't explained. (So much fans could be confused if they didn't read the book.) If you didn't read the book you will probably have to watch this movie again so that you could understand it all. Important things that were in the book were left out. I remembered now one random thing they didn't explained. In the beginning, Dumbledore's hand was badly hurt. They never explained it.Ending? I wouldn't call THAT an ending.Acting? Rupert was excellent. Emma was having new weird expressions, I didn't like them. Daniel was.. well, usual. I am a big fan of both the books and the movies, but this movie wasn't AT ALL what I expected. I even surprised myself, I was actually bored in the beginning (30 first minutes) and really disappointed at the ending.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
801,cwings1991,Not that great,8,15 July 2009,"It seems that many people think this movie was very good... I think it was a horrible representation of the book. This is just my opinion, but honestly, I was completely and totally disappointed. The sixth book was my favorite of the series by far and this movie didn't do it justice. It seemed way too obvious to me that they made it more as a build up for the final movies instead of focusing on making this movie more enjoyable. Many people will probably disagree with me but I just thought I'd tell you that if you go into it expecting it to be amazing (like I did), you may be extremely unsatisfied upon leaving the theater.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
802,b_miller91,One of the best if not the best in the series.,9,21 July 2009,"This film captures the darkness and desperation brought on by the death eaters and voldemort. The acting from everyone has improved greatly, Alan Rickman gives his best performance by far as Snape. Gambon finals delivers as Dumbledore, playing him flawlessly. Then there's Tom Felton who plays the scared and troubled Draco Malfoy as if he himself was given the task of killing the greatest wizard of the age. The cave scene was done brilliantly, though some of the other ""action"" scenes were a little under-whelming. Overall, this was a big step up from OoTP. I left happy with it despite some minor flaws and it sets us up for a great ending in DH I and II.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
803,sasi_vu,is this the film you expect after reading the book,5,16 July 2009,iam a great fan of happy potter books and read each book nearly 10 times.and my favorite book being the 6th and i never expected such a kind of film to be taken from my fav book.2 hr 30min time is not enough to take such an wonderful book and it needed to be taken like lord of rings a 4hr movie.comedy is good but movie is not a masterpiece and i expect much more from the movie.movie is not a complete disappointment but can do a lot much better.many action scenes in the book are not included in the movie and the climax of the movie is not good.even if the climax is good it might have covered a lot of negatives in the movie.expecting the 7th part(part 1) a lot much better than this,Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
804,preminiser,Technically great.,4,22 July 2009,"I was really looking forward to this movie, now I'm thinking WTF!$!?. The Half Blood Prince was a great book and the movie castrated it. From a technical point of view this movie was amazing. Cinematography, CGI and the musical score were truly brilliant. For those things the movie scores full marks but story wise it was really Sh*t in comparison to the book. After seeing what Yates did with the Order of the Phoenix I felt immediately that he should finish the rest of the movies left in the series. After watching his latest effort I take it all back. Even though the movie was roughly 2.5 hours long, I felt that some of the actors didn't have enough time to really create a meaningful impact. Everything about the story just felt extremely compressed. One of the biggest letdowns that this movie has is the way it dealt with the ""climax"", it was massively disappointing. I'm not sure if there were budget constraints in regards to how it should have built up to the climax, because after the money the previous movies have made, it really shouldn't have been an issue to leave out what would have been an exciting part of the movie(those of you that have read the book will understand). Like I said earlier, this movie has redeeming qualities. I was constantly glued to the screen because this movie has some serious eye candy. The cinematography and the way that Yates directed some of the scenes were breath-taking. The musical score was better than the previous films and the CGI was on par with most decent blockbusters. If you've read the books you will more than likely ignore all negative criticism and watch the movie anyway, which will more than likely leave you feeling disappointed.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
805,Maverick-Jafri,Let me say this. Half Blood Prince as a movie alone was very good.,4,23 July 2009,"Let me say this. Half Blood Prince as a movie alone was very good. It stands it's ground as a film better than any of the others of the series. But only as a film. And only because there are so many parts to a film. This installment obviously stepped everything up a notch: the cinematography, the special effects, the darker score, the improved acting, etc... But the key element which was boosted this franchise into world-class fame, is the story. And in this one, it's just not there. As a fan of the books and having had no SERIOUS gripes with any of the other films, I must say i HATED the screenplay for this one. Everything that made the book amazing was ripped from the film, and instead replaced by annoying large quantities of romantic subplot. Yes, there is romance in the sixth book but not shoved down your throat. JK Rowling masterfully crafted a novel that was perfectly balanced. The romance was there although it didn't detract from the main plot and at times was intertwined with the larger goings-on at hogwarts. In the movie the romance takes up most of the screen time. Not to mention the ending of the film was brutally butchered.So much time could have been detracted from the silly romances to focus on more important things which were completely ommitted or deliberately changed. The ending is extremely anti-climactic and once it's over it'll leave you in your seat thinking ""it's over?"" My final gripe with this movie is that it really should have been PG-13. If you've read the novel then you know the subject matter is MUCH darker and the story would have been done greater justice with just a higher rating(and a better screenwriter, yes i'm looking at you Steve Kloves).Overall as a movie i'd give it an 8 out of 10.But as a HARRY POTTER movie it gets 4 out of 10. And that's pushing it.Well heres to 2010 to see how they screw up the finale. Oh wait, they already did. I didn't know there were 8 years at hogwarts...",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
806,flyingfreddy,Wtf...,6,15 July 2009,"As I have seen and read all of the series, I knew where the movie was going...and I kind of enjoyed it... putting the emphasis on ""kind of"". However, the movie leaves out important stuff. They substituted it with some humor ...which wasn't THAT funny. It was maybe worth a chuckle here and there, but nothing more. Throughout the first part I was thinking this was a romantic comedy or something....like we were watching some soap opera. Cut the crap, I'm not here to see Hermione go ""oh my gaawd....I love ron...but he's with that chick...oh my gaaawd"". Yes, it should be a part of the movie, but not THE part of the movie. I came to see Harry Potter do some magic, not get a hard on from Ginny. I want action, adventure and yeah... a hint of romance. If you're going to watch this with the same expectations...this movie is going to disappoint.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
807,oilersman3985,Fantastic!,10,18 July 2009,"Okay...Many hard-core fans have been disappointed with this movie. Why? Because they ALL think it should follow the book EXACTLY the way it was written. I am a hard-core fan, and I love this movie because I see the movies separate from the books. The books are good the way they are, and the movies are good the way they are. I don't compare them because if I do, I know I will be disappointed, and so will many others. I also don't understand how all the haters of this film dislike David Yates...yet they praise the acting. A director is the person who tells the actors to act certain ways, to have certain emotions. To people who think David Yates is a horrible director but thinks the acting is good should all feel dumb. No offence but seriously, people need to get some common sense. Anyways, If you are reading this and you are debating seeing the movie, please go. It was fantastic! Also remember if you are a hard-core fan of the book, do NOT compare it to the movie. Go see the movie to be entertained!",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
808,jandajohn,140 minutes of waiting for action,4,15 July 2009,"OK i know that Harry Potter has never been packed full with action and all the other parts before this one had moments i loved watching over and over yet in this one i was completely let down. I counted exactly 5 scenes in the movie where there was some action going on and these make up a maximum of 20 minutes of a 140 minute movie. Since i read the book before i was really excited about the fight at the end and Dumbledores dramatic death. What did i get? No fight and a Dumbledore provoking Draco to kill him in one second and then asking Snape for help in the next with a pathetic ""Sirius. Please."" HELLO?! He was standing next to the death eaters what did he expect him to do?! I was in tears when i read that scene in the book and expected the same in the movie yet i couldn't help laughing at how ridiculous the whole scene was. Not even his dramatic fall could make me feel a tiny bit of sadness. Everything else in the movie was good as always yet as the plot makes up the whole movie i myself can only give 4 out of 10 stars... little hint: i know your not going to be able to resist watching it but i would suggest waiting till its out on DVD its really not worth the money",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
809,karankapoor03,all expectations in the dustbin,1,16 July 2009,"Well to start with the movie is a love triangle of Hermione,Ron and one another new girl.Yes harry potter plays a role too and he too tries to carry on his love story.This movie is more of a love story in which each of the character tries to be involved in the love.There is one action scene in the movie which lasts for 20 seconds and that too not good.Action sequences were hugely missed in the movie.The movie is not worth money.The director has played with the emotions of the audience.I am saying that because i am a big fan of Harry potter series.And the screenplay was also pretty bad.I would recommend that not to go for this movie.It will destroy your interest in the coming harry potter movies.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
810,lady_amber_nicole,The screen Writer should be shot,4,16 August 2009,"Who's bright Idea was it to make Harry Potter 6 as awful as what I just saw in the movie theater? They basically turned a great book into a PG rated Nightmare. I understand they want to make money but after watching this movie I want 2 things back. The $10 I spent on the ticket and the 2 and a half hours I had to spend in that theater. I understand about time and not trying to make another titanic length movie, but adding stuff that has not meaning for the 6th's book, Taking out a key point: the battle at the end, that what give this movie their WTF moments. I mean who goes to a school and just blows up the hall, please! I also don't remember Hargats house being set a flame. This movie was a study in what not to do as a script writer. I mean was I the only one that wondered who the heck was the big guy that they featured when looking at the death eater yet never told you what he's purpose was. I think the script writes should get on their knees and apologies to us all for this trash. This makes me fearful of what they plan for book 7, which they are cutting into 2 movies. If either one of them is PG I'm skipping them. over 20 people died in book 7 to make it PG would mean that all the fights and all the key points in the movies would be excluded. I can tell you as a fan giving it a 4 was being nice it doesn't rate that high",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
811,Ultimate_Dobby,So Freaking Fantastic!,10,15 July 2009,"Well...I saw the film today, and was not only impressed, but totally blown away. I thought the other films blew me away when I saw them (except OOTP), but this is the first movie in the series that I consider, seriously, a possible Oscar contender. The acting, music, cinematography, script, directing are all excellent.Where to begin? I've followed the production of this movie for about a year now, I knew in advance what was cut or changed, and what happened in the movie. Don't know why. Probably because of my original disappointment in OOTP (even though on multiple viewings, it has grown on me), and I wanted to be prepared. After a while I felt like I knew too much, but it didn't spoil my experience of the film.This movie can be split into two halves, light and dark. Both work extremely well and there is a perfect balance between them in the film.Light: This is definitely the funniest and wittiest of the films yet. The cinema I was in laughed at all the right times, so I can't have been the only one that was amused. But don't worry, just because it's funnier doesn't mean it's more ""childish"", the comedy works as being approachable to a wide audience, Jim Broadbent and Rupert Grint are probably the best examples of comedy in this film. Both are extraordinary actors and they provide the comedy for most of their scenes. Alan Rickman impressed me at times with his comic-timing too. I believe this is also the first Potter film that I didn't cringe once.I was hesitant about some of the romantic comedy segments from some reviews that I've read that state there is too much of it, but honestly, it was fine. The balance was so perfect. Without all the hype/criticism, I probably wouldn't have been noticing of the Rom-com as much as I did, and I wasn't disappointed. The Ron-Lav relationship was surprisingly brief in my opinion, which was fine for me, because I wasn't too sure weather I was sold on Jessie Cave as Lavender or not, especially when she ran out of the hospital wing ""crying"". Emma Watson was wonderful in this movie, her crying scene almost set me off too.Dark: There is not much action in this film, but for what there is, it is impressive. The film also never seems to drag with the lack of it. First, we see the Milennium Bridge come down and DE's flying through London, which looks brilliant (though I would've liked people to fall of the bridge, morbid as that sounds). Then we see some disturbing scenes (something I would be cautious about when deciding to take children to this movie) of Katie Bell getting cursed, Ron being poisoned (foaming at the mouth and shaking), and Draco bleeding in the chest, which I was surprised at how much blood there was in the scene, considering the US's PG Rating, which by the way, I don't think is accurate to this movie. The Burrow scene works well for injecting action into the middle of the movie, even though it doesn't serve too much to the purpose of the plot. The cave scene was probably my favourite part of the film. EPIC! And scary. I was shivering there, and in the astronomy tower scene, since I knew what was coming. The death scene of this movie is handled rather well. A little bit brief, but still shocking and you don't know what to think of the murderer at this point.I'm no book purist. I don't care when scenes are cut unless they're big and gaping (e.g. a death scene). I get really annoyed when I hear book fans saying that they ""didn't do the book justice"". Seriously. These movies are adapted very well compared to other adaptations, they should be lucky that we have as much as we do in these movies. I didn't even miss the funeral, since I have reasons for them not being there, and they seem pretty reasonable reasons to me.So in a nutshell, this movie is the best of the series by a long way. It was Totally worth waiting eight extra months for. It's been a great journey waiting for this movie, gaining the trailers, and tonight was the payoff. I'm so relieved, the film was so amazing! It'll be on my top ten list for the rest of time probably.Overall, maybe 9.7/10, with issues only to do with some of the editing, and possibly Jessie Cave. Oh, 9.7 sounds so low! I guess it can be rounded to 10 out of 10!Thank you, David Yates! Can't wait for DH!!!",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
812,Luto1414,"If you want to enjoy this movie, Turn off your brain...",5,16 July 2009,"Regrettably, I wasted 3 hours waiting at the theater for this movie to start. I was excited and even contempt with the 12 year old girls running around in capes because I thought it was all worth it to see the movie! ...I was wrong.If you liked Twilight, you'll get a kick out of this ""new"" story. It seems as though the entire movie is centered around Ron and his new girlfriend Lavender Brown (remember that name because you might miss the 1 time they say ""Lav"" in the movie). The drama, almost horror-centered book transformed into a comedy, romance-centered film.What bothers me the most about this movie is the complete disregard for Rowling's plot and emotional build-up from the book. It seems as though Steve Kloves believed the film's audience could only comprehend simple love crushes and one line jokes for it's audience. It's hard for me to imagine what the next two films will be like, especially since they left out a several of the important character's stories (Bill and Fleur, Fenrir Greyback, Scrimgeour...just to name a few).In the end, if you're going to see this movie, don't think...just laugh at the jokes and romances and you'll do fine, you may actually enjoy it. Also, I recommend sneaking in a flask of your favorite liquor...anything to dull the pain of this movie.If you've read the books, ignore the positive reviews for this movie, you will not enjoy what it became. -Possibly the worst of the 6, though the best when it comes to acting and the overall -look- of the movie.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
813,gaurav-jaju-1,Unjustice to movie done at each level,6,19 July 2009,"Compared to other HP, this movie was least magical to say and was kind of moving too fast. People were led to assume lot of things and I feel it surely wasn't one of the greatest harry potter movie. It was more about snugging and love thing..... There wasn't any magic at all.... I mean how many new things were shown..... Like how they do put unbreakable jinxes on wall or stuffs like that... What happens to Weasley's after there House is burned.....Ron supposedly was sleeping up there.....and I guess he was still up there while house was burning... Quidditch match was great.....but not detailed.....it was like Today we play Quidditch and we won because of Ron...So lets party....all in 5 min may be....Harry potter comes and picks up horcux from dumbledore's body without anyone noticing it......Gimme a break.....I was disappointed but still a 6.......",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
814,mblaha2,Not for REAL Harry Potter fans...,4,20 July 2009,"The six installment to this series has gotten great reviews and is said to be the best movie so far. I am a huge Harry Potter fan and have been an avid reader of the books since childhood. In anticipation for the movie I reread the 6th book. I was extremely excited for this since I loved the book and the reviews were all so positive, I have to say, it was by far the worst movie so far. The books are masterpieces and perfect in every way and this movie strayed so far from the book. It changed almost everything, from minor details to extremely important plot points. I wouldn't have been surprised if they changed the name of the movie from The Half Blood Prince because it barely skimmed the surface of that element to the book and the importance it plays.It focused on stupid things such as lavender brown and left out very important memories and plot points. It was very boring and finally when an action sequence occurred it wasn't even a scene from the book. Not too mention the last half hour of the movie was 100% different from the book. I had to explain to my sister what horcruxes are (the most important element to the book) and how Harry is supposed to find them because in the book he has a very good idea what the remaining ones are but in the movie he has no idea. How they figure it in the 7th movie is beyond me and means they will have to change a lot more.The movie could have been a huge success if it just stuck to the book and didn't try to be cute and funny. Get some to write a screenplay whose actually read the books for the 7th movie. I saw this movie hoping to see one of my favorite books from one of the greatest series come to life with a desire to relive the great story and was sorely disappointed.4 out of 10 stars",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
815,gladiolus19,A sweet and fresh breath of Harry Potter series,9,24 July 2009,"No matter what you think of HP6 movie, I still love it, and rate it 9/10. Yeah we all know there's no Death Eaters' fight, no Dumbledore's funeral, no Ravenclaw's tiara, no Bill turning into a werewolf, no etc etc. The film somehow mismatched with all other blockbusters this summer, like Star Trek, T4, Transformer 2, where every explosion seems to BOOM right in front of your face. What remains afterward were simple and sweet. Lavender's damp heart on the window, Ron's funny face and quotes when influenced the Love Potion, Hermione's smile when Ron's mumbling, Malfoy's expression when realized the bird was dead... Personally, I think all the cast did an amazing job, fulfilling and blowing life into the characters. Rupert outstandingly succeeded the 10 minutes of ""tragical Ron and the Love Potion"", which really made us believe that Ron's been enchanted. Michael Gambon's portrayal of Dumbledore never felt more right, with jokes and haunting glance saying ""Please"". Tom Felton finally had room to bloom, showing more humanly aspect of Draco. And it was both surprising and delighting to watch Jim Broadbent portraying ""I prefer the whole set"" Prof. Slughorn. Of course, not to mention wicked and scary Helena Bonham Carter (as always), and Alan Rickman's creepy but perfect skill of slip-one-word-at-a-time.We readers always claim movies are no competitors to books, as we read and we let our own imagination take flight, and when the film comes out, doesn't quite match with what we've had in minds, we prove it bad. Think about this way, we've seen enough of action already,and HP6 is not an action movie, at all. It's meant to be a beautiful piece of fantasy and romance. It's the humor, the sweetness of young relationship, the hardness of making choice, the unconditional sacrifice, and 'magical' magic that lingers in the end.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
816,franchoiss,"Great film, even though it isn't close to being a carbon copy of the book",8,18 July 2009,"Granted, no movie will ever be as rich in detail and in plot as a book is. However, this film is DEFINITELY the best one as far as Harry Potter goes. An avid HP fan, I've read each book no less than 10 times, and therefore it was easy to tell how the film deviated from the book. Many parts of the book were entirely take out, some of them vital to the story line. The beginning is completely different, and some scenes were entirely made up. The scenes that weren't from the book did actually help the movie, so I won't complain about them. I was looking forward to seeing how they did all the meetings between Dumbledore and Harry, and was extremely disappointed to see that not only do they meet twice to discuss Voldemort, but that only two of the memories Dumbledore shows Harry are seen. I believe the meetings between Dumbledore and Harry to be the backbone of the book, since that's where Harry learns not only what a Horcrux is but also finds out what are the ones Voldemort made (Hufflepuff's cup, Nagini, Ravenclaw's Diadem, Slytherin's Locket). Since this was omitted from the film, it's going to be very interesting to see how they incorporate it to the next one, being the Horcruxes what the seventh book is all about. The humor in this movie is great, as well as the special effects. The acting has also gotten much better when compared to the other films. What makes this movie great is that, although it didn't entirely follow the book, it was carried out extremely well, therefore making it a movie that's interesting not only for the HP fans, but for people who've never read the books of this fantastic world that is Harry Potter.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
817,suvro-m,Could have been a thousand times better,4,16 July 2009,"Well I just saw the movie today,and well the only thing that I can say That I'm thoroughly disappointed.The sixth book is my favorite book,and to see such a poor on screen adaptation of it,I have nothing to say.Well of course u cant show all the facts of a book in a movie,but my question is why divulge from facts that u r already showing.I mean there r so many meaningless things here,specially when Bellatrix burns down the Burrow(Weasly house),I mean what d hell was the director even thinking.The biggest disappointment 4 me was the climax,it looked like the director hurried through to finish the movie and created a b*** s*** climax.The main selling point 4 this movie was the death of Dumbledore,and to my greatest disappointment that part of the movie was probably the worst part of the film.Being a huge Potter fan I'm really p***ed of after watching d movie,I expected so much more and in return I got so much less.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
818,tabacco-1,Totall Disappointment,4,16 July 2009,"After reading ZeroCorpse-1 review I have to agree with his assessment of the movie. There were definite plot story lines that were left out so that at the end when Snape said to Harry that he is the Half Blood Prince I was like ""where did that come from and why did he say it?"" There was nothing leading up to it so it made no sense. Also if there were ""Guards"" in the castle then what happened to the battle between the Order and the Death Eaters? I just read that the screen writer did not even read the book. Well if I was J.K. Rowling I wouldn't want someone destroying my books by pitiful attempts to bring them to the screen.Overall I was left disappointed because the movie did not set anything up for the final movie. I can only dread what they will attempt to put on the screen. The only good thing about the last movie will be is that it will be the last movie.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
819,vjs243,.....Worst one yet,3,15 July 2009,"As a fan of the books I have always been highly critical of the harry potter movie franchise, but I have always been able to appreciate and enjoy the movies even though they may have left out some of my favorite scenes from the books. However, this movie was different. I want to start out with the good by just saying that the acting in the movie is great, each cast member did a great job........but unfortunately that was the only thing keeping this movie afloat. The score was one of the worst I've ever heard in a movie, and the CGI was terrible as well. In the scene where Dumbledore an Harry get the locket, in what is probably one of the most traumatic scenes in the Harry Potter book series, I was left feeling bored, and I almost laughed at how fake the Inferi looked. I felt like I was just watching a herd of Calista Flockharts with bad makeup storming Dumbledore and Harry on the island......it looked ridiculous. There was no build up throughout the movie. By the time Dumbledore's death came along it seemed to just come out of no where and I was just yawning and waiting for it to be over. My main issue was that the movie was ONLY about the relationship drama going on at Hogwarts; it was like David Yates based the movie on an episode of NYC Prep. He completely avoided what the Half Blood Prince is really about.......learning about Voldemort's history and how and why he became who he is. The only thing we learned about him was that he was a bad kid and he created horcruxes, but it didn't really go deep into his character, which I feel was the purpose of the 6th book, not to highlight relationship drama in Hogwarts. Instead of focusing on that drama so much maybe some other parts of the book should have been included such as the other memories of Voldemort? Or maybe the huge battle scene at the end of the book? Or maybe DUMBLEDORE'S FUNERAL?! Overall, I was left questioning David Yates' abilities as a director. The whole storyline was boring, and I have seen Lifetime movies better than this. As I said before, I know some scenes will not be included, and that is fine, I loved the first five movies despite what they didn't include from the books, but this was ridiculous. He left out the scenes in the book that were the exciting parts, and also the scenes that were detrimental to the whole story and paving the way for the seventh book. I saw the movie with some friends who didn't even read the books, and they too just thought it was a bore. Thank you David Yates for raping my favorite story in front of my eyes.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
820,sakcen,Do they have the right to change the script ?,1,19 July 2009,"This was the worst Harry Potter movie ever. I wonder if the Author knew about the scenario, cause we supposed to learn about Voldemort (Heir of Slytherin) in this movie and the Horcruxes. How did Dumbledore cursed while trying to destroy one? Did anyone see it? Or the necklace? How did Voldemort obtain the necklace, before Albania or after it :D. How did Ron start dating with Lev? it was because of Victor Krum, but did we see it? Phoenix??? Funeral??? Kids seems like they were used to the death of Dumbledore, where were the tears and prick of conscience of Harry? (he supposed to be stunned under the cloak and that was why he couldn't stop Snape killing Dumbledore)Minister's proposal? ETC..I'm really angry at this moment but I don't think it will change, I just watched some sightseeing of Hogwarts some special FXs and some meaningless glances of kids to each others. I started to believe that easy money makes the production team too relaxed to shoot a good movie in the end. After 5 years you shouldn't do this to the fans.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
821,lmv_sarsona,"This Half-Blood Prince is awesomely, bloody BRILLIANT!",10,22 July 2009,"WARNING: This review might be a bit biased to your liking since the writer is a certified witch. So beware. You've been warned. (May also contain spoilers.)Before I wrote this review, I tried reading other reviews from fans/haters (yes there are haters, imagine that?) and I got mixed ratings overall, but I love how most of the reviews gave a 5+ shooting star rating. See, I'm already sounding like a biased fan.But I'm not. Why? David Yates is my least favorite Harry Potter director. I like Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, because of Luna, a few bits of Ron and Hermione moments (yours truly ships Ron and Hermione), but mostly, just Luna (Luna Lovegood is yours truly's favorite character.)So now that's straighten up, on to the real review.This Half-Blood Prince is awesomely, bloody BRILLIANT!I have to admit that the part of me being a Ron and Hermione shipper dominates the things that the film have lacked. They changed a lot of things for one thing when it could be easily be just adapted straight from the book and they've also removed some things. But surprisingly for me, it never failed to capture the entirety of the book. A non-HP reader will understand what's the deal for sure because of all the explanation (at least if they understand British English and humor), which I think is one of the main goals of Yates. I definitely think he redeemed himself with this one. Ron and Hermione moments. Ahhh... They were the most wonderful things. Rupert and Emma definitely have this chemistry whether they admit it or not. I can feel the love and the hurt from it shooting out of the big screen towards me. It was heaven for a shipper like me.Quidditch is back! And much better. Though I never saw Harry with his snitch catching techniques, I am just happy that the attention was with Ron. All Ron's! Dumbledore's death. I just can't believe that he died again for the umpteenth time in front of me. I cried and cried. It was awful. And believable. A lot might say that it was altered and all, but it's already awesome for me. We can't have everything after all.The actors have also improved a big deal. Emma Watson proved that she doesn't have only one facial expression, and that she could REALLY act. Rupert Grint is again, brilliant. Dan is Harry Potter, the ONLY Harry Potter. And Bonnie Wright as Ginny makes a definite sweet connection with Harry. Evanna Lynch as Luna Lovegood, exceptionally awesome. And of course, the other supporting characters are at their best too. I would most like to mention Sir Michael Gambon, saying, ""Severus, please..."" and then falling from the tower. It was heartbreaking.The long waiting was a bit of a disaster, but it was all worth it. David Yates is still not my favorite director but now he's definitely no longer at the bottom of my list. Steve Kloves proved that even if he thought it was Harry and Hermione in the end, he completely made a turnabout.I am still trying to compare this film with my most favorite, ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone"" and I might need a few more re-watching (saw it thrice already), for me to be able to give the final verdict of my number one Harry Potter film.And there's still Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, the book being my most favorite might be my most favorite film too. Now that Yates have proved himself, I am, once again, having sky high hopes for Deathly Hallows. Another bit of a long wait again I guess.Oh, and did I mentioned that Half-Blood Prince was made of awesome? No? Well then, IT IS!",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
822,paulinadavey123,Very Disappointing...... Wished it was Half as Good as the Novel,2,17 July 2009,"All I can say is that this film is not worth watching as it strays far from the lines of the book. Though the script quite often quotes the novel it does not follow the subject of the story and general plot. The movie disregards the fact that J.K Rowling based the book on discovering the 'dark secrets' about 'Lord Voldermorts' past when the script-writers are actually obsessing over the fact that Harry isn't a little boy anymore and the feelings that the characters have developed for each other. I would have liked to see more of the things that the book shared with readers than watching adolescent teens 'snogging'.Some positive points about the movie was that the special effects and scenery were good and that the acting has improved since the first film.If you haven't read the books by all means go and see it. You might have different views but the people that I know that have seen the movie and haven't read the books, found it ""boring"" and ""not what I thought it would be"".But it would help if you read the book first so you could see what you might be missing out on.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
823,TheJenneh,Brilliant Movie? I think not!,6,15 July 2009,"Indeed, the special effects in this film were impressive, however the movie was a MASSIVE let down to me as a big HP fan. I have read all of the books countless times, so I was expecting to notice a FEW mistakes in this movie.I was mistaken when I thought ""A Few"". This movie didn't start off the way it was meant to, there was no sign of the British Prime Minister, nor ANY mention of the new minister of Magic or the former Minister for that matter. Harry was in a café, when he noticed Dumbledore, later apparating with him to visit Slughorn. For those who have read the book, this is not how it happened, Harry was staying with the Dursleys, received a letter from Dumbledore which stated he would come for Harry on a Friday night at 11pm. Dumbledore arrived at the Dursleys, spoke with Harry for a while and THEN they apparated to visit Slughorn.This introduction made me question if the rest of the movie was going to be so different from the book.Another change was when Harry was left underneath his invisibility cloak in the Hogwarts Express after Malfoy petrified him. Tonks was meant to find Harry, NOT Luna Lovegood. I may be picky, but I feel they changed things unnecessarily!Dumbledore's funeral wasn't shown. MASSIVE chunks of Tom Riddle's history was left out, as well as other Memories to be viewed by Harry and Dumbledore. And everyone boasted about this movie being Dark. It's clearly NOT dark at all.I think those who haven't read the book will find the movie to be a brilliant one. I don't think it was BAD but I feel it could have been a lot better. I've given the film a 6, for the effects, the occasional laugh and for the scenes that were not tampered with!",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince

825,rakesh_289,only if i could give this 0/10,1,18 July 2009,"i don't know what to comment about,there's nothing in the movie to comment about the first half was a teen-movie the second half was worse(the cave scene was okay) burrow scene was pointless(actually i found the entire movie pointless) there was no emotion in the end scene and the dumbledore's death scene(i was happy dumbledore was dead and the torcher movie was over) ginny weasley is given way too much importance(she hides the HBP's book and not harry) and i cannot imagine lavender blabbering about ron in front of the teachers let alone the headmaster dumbledore asks harry about his feelings for hermione there is plenty of these idiotic scenes,i don't understand how so many gave it 10/10 this might be the worst movie i have ever seen,shame IMDb doesn't have a 0/10 rating",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince

827,lasaldude,"compared to the others, a 6 out of 10 at its best maybe a 5 instead",6,15 July 2009,let me sum it up for you. The movie is 2.5 hours long. two hours of hormones raging with everyone kissing everyone just about. With crybaby boohooing about someone kissing someone that isn't me. They throw in a couple short scenes about Tom Riddle when he was young and how drako is becoming a death eater with a job to accomplish for Tom Riddle. That's just to keep you from losing interest in the movie because of all the teen romance that's sprouting everywhere. Then the last half hour was the only interesting part of the story and was almost worth sitting through the last two hours for. what a disappointing piece of crap. It needs heavily edited with a lot more action and mystery questions to be answered. MAJOR FAIL TO MAKE US FANS WAIT SO LONG FOR THIS DISAPPOINTMENT !!!,Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
828,manusunil,How Inferi Massacred the Fans,1,3 August 2009,"It is very difficult to write a neutral review of a very pathetic adaptation of one of your favorite books. Yet, try, I shall! For a fan, the movie is torture, but for someone who has miraculously avoided everything potter in the real world and knows nothing about the series, he would definitely enjoy watching the movie once in the theater (especially if someone else paid for the ticket). So what makes the movie bad? Spoiler Alert!! You have been warned.Oh, did you know Dumbledore had a profound interest in Harry's love life. First he votes in favor of a muggle chick, harry was digging at a diner and then he wondered out loud if Harry-Hermoine had a thing going on. Perhaps, this was where Jo told the director ""Hey! Dumbledore is gay!"" But then Dumbledore also has the uncanny habit of leaving Harry in a swamp, or not telling Harry anything but simply ordering him. Do not doubt him Harry, just trust him. Especially, when he never told you he will be teaching you stuff, and then suddenly whips out memories to drown you. Hark! The movie is an insult to Dumbledore's memory, especially the climax – the death of Dumbledore. Grave dishonor to the venerable old man. They didn't even give him his tomb. Most probably he will wait for another year to get his tomb in Part 1 of the seventh movie. Gawd! He'd smell, then!The trouble is, the screenplay of the movie is awful when compared to the book. What is the point of making a book adaptation, if you don't care what is happening in the book and *with emphasis* WHY! The 6th book was supposed to be everything about Snape – it was to tell us that Snape has been Dumbledore's man through and through. But all Snape ends up doing in the movie is to blurt ""yes, I am the half blood prince"" (like I care!), full stop. Alan Rickman is a great artist, but hey! Snape was supposed to be in pain then. Pain of what he had to do, what Dumbledore made him do, how that affects him. The movie was also to prepare Harry for what's coming for him in the future. All he has learned in the movie is that Voldemort made 7 horcruxes, two of which were the riddle diary and ""a ring"". That's it. Good Luck harry, finding everything else because you don't even know where to look at, what to look for and nothing to guide you into Voldemort's choices of horcruxes.There are no emotions in the movie, except some exceedingly stupid snogging sessions – which happen for no reason whatsoever, and a final acceptance of the Ron-Hermoine relationship (which was, for the record, far more subtle and way more beautiful in the book). The Lav Lav-Won Won episode is like a slap on the face of the readers (at least fans), a slap that shall echo through out eternity. There is a whole new Harry- Ginny angle, very different from the book and makes the reader question ""Was that a consequence of Sirius's death?"" (Oh yes, twice you are reminded that Sirius died in the last movie and that his death unapparently affects Harry) ""How did harry fall for Ginny, without ever even noticing her?"". When asked, Scabbers has been quoted to say: ""Just Like That. Harry just woke up one day to realize he is in love with Ginny. What else would be the point of it all being magic and a pretty girl playing Ginny? The story had to include both of these elements – the magic, and the pretty chick.""The movie has it shares of laughs, some really awesome comedy scenes that will certainly inspire Jim Carrey to new heights – especially the one where Ginny ties Harry's shoe laces (that was fun), or when Lav Lav decides to Piggy-back Won Won (That is creative love), or when Hermoine tells Harry that Ron is finally fine with harry going out with Ginny (at the end of the movie, when Harry 'foolishly' breaks up with Ginny 'for her own safety' in the book.) Heroes can be dumb! It's the movies that make them smart, confident and appealing.What's with Slughorn by the way? He was supposed to be a clever wizard, who likes to make collections of talented students, who would make it big in the future. All Jim Broadbent could get out of his experience, on screen, was a witless clown who could only fumble and mumble around. That and his weird eye brows.I am just glad, they did not ""choose"" to show a Voldemort-Bellatrix thing going on – what with love being in the air and romance being the flavor of the month, after all.Its not like the movie is a complete waste of time and money. Its only that as a fan it is not possible to be disgruntled and disappointed with the movie. They made me wait for this crap, goddammit! Otherwise, the execution, the direction, the background score, the effects, the performances, (in other words, everything other than the script/screenplay/story) is exceptional. It is only the screen play that will confuse the viewer and brutally massacre the fans. Truth be told, the trailers were far more watchable than the movies.Let me complete this review with the ""Phoenix Lament"" (the official song for the Potter fans who watch the Potter movies):Oh Jo! How could you ever approve such a script?Oh Kloves! What happened to your uber-scripting skills? I cant imagine, why I waited for this movie for almost 20 months.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
829,Raven_God,"Love, War, and Crappy Romance for Harry Potter",8,19 July 2009,"I went to the theater with a bit of excitement for the sixth Harry Potter film. Being a BIG fan of the Harry Potter books and being very disappointed (understatement) by the fourth (shudder)and fifth film I want this one to be the one to change the hope for Harry Potter films. It came close yet not so close. Harry Potter book fans prepare to be in a dull treatment from the film and average film goers prepare to enjoy the epic movie. The Pros of this film are: - Stunning acting, Good Job to Alan Rickman, Michael Gambon, Jim Broadbent, and especially Tom Felton. These people are magnificent as their characters. They play their pair to the extreme. -Visual effects looked real and dark. -Dark photography that fits the film. -Flashback scenes are awesome! Cons for this film are: -It is too much about the romance! This film is more focus on the love and not the war. The book had even amount of war and romance. If the film kept that balance then it would of be good -The jokes! I swear if they try to make Harry Potter comical again I will scream! The film was dark in the beginning and should stay that way. No more ""But I am the Chosen One!"" (smack by two by four) or ""These girls are going kill me, Harry"" Get rid of the stupid one liners that plagued the films since the third.All in all this film is good for the film goer but to those Harry Potter fans like me let's face it, they don't care about us. These film series are dedicated not to the fans who bought every Harry Potter thing there is but to the families who go to the movies. Yes expected important scenes to be missing that was from the book. But to the person who doesn't know Harry Potter who wouldn't even know. So that is a wrap for my review. I rate it Harry Potter Fan stars: 6.3 out of 10Movie Goer stars: 9.8 of 10 Review stars equals about: 7.5-8.0 out of 10.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
830,evanscence_100,"The most crucial book, the worst adaption.",6,18 July 2009,"This movie started off where the fifth one left off. Oh, wait, no it did not. We saw Harry return to Hogwarts. Why start this film off with him back at the Ministry? Where was the important conversation Dumbledore had with the Dursleys in the book? That would have been a great way to start the movie off. And what was with the burrow attack scene? All in all, the movie was great. It made me laugh, gasp, and shed a tear. But compare it to the MOST IMPORTANT book, and it falls extremely short. The movie had so much romance and forced funny scenes, it soon became ridiculous. However, if you watch the movies only, then you will probably find this movie the best one yet. If you are a true Harry Potter fan, you will be outraged by the lack of information they set in the movie. It will be very hard for them to progress with the seventh one, since there are a lot of missing pieces that were set in play by the sixth book, which were left out of the movie. There are so many flaws and holes, I could write a book the size of The Half Blood Prince containing the mess ups. Way to screw up, yet again, Hollywood.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
831,ThankGodForSilence,Harry Potter and the mess of a book.,4,18 July 2009,"Okay, now I had a very nasty feeling about the new Harry Potter movie. The last movie was a disaster apart from the last bit where Harry was possessed. But never mind I decided to enjoy this one regardless of my annoyed reactions of the muck up of the last ones.I personally like the books better and I know that not all things can be kept in but this movie put some stupid and ridiculous parts in. Why did Ginny chase after Harry when the Burrow was attacked? What was the point in that? To make Ginny look like an lovelorn idiot that would willingly put herself in danger even though older, better wizards went after Harry. I was disgusted with the ridiculous plots, this movie really went to the dogs because of David's silly ideas. Yes, romance was in the book but Harry was more into following Draco and some Hermione jealously. I'm a teenager but the barrel of raging hormones was stressing me out with the pathetic and time wasting scenes. Even with Ron getting poisoned was made into comedy... And why was Dumbledore asking weird, personal questions? He was like a weird uncle. And what was with the start with Harry being made into some sort of pimp?! That was so out of character and stupid. Couldn't stand all the Ginny and Harry faffing about, was just silly.All in all I was completely disappointed. I was disgusted, upset and annoyed. I didn't cry when I saw Sirius die and I didn't cry yet again at Dumbledore. I was won over by Helena Bonham Carter and Tom Felton though the acting from both of them was absolutely flawless in the movie that was a complete disaster. I love the Harry Potter films but if I'm honest, they have gone to the dogs since the Fourth one... I definitely will try the last two films, but, I wont get my hopes up.Mess of a movie, actors undervalued and a load of garbage thrown in for 'laughs'... Waste of money in my opinion. Though I will get it cheap on DVD and try it again because some points of the movie was amazing, like the bridge collapsing, but apart from that... Wreck of a movie...",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
832,shibbiesdrum,huge disappointment just anti-climatic,3,18 August 2009,I was really looking forward to seeing this as i thought maybe after the order film was such a disappointment and just felt like a filler but watched this and found it to be exactly the same when dumbledoor and harry are at the place where he has to drink the poison i started to think great getting darker and there's going to be a good climax to the film but it just when down hill i mean when dumbledoor dies its basically malfoy not having the balls to do it and snape comes along and poof bye bye dumbledoor even everyones reaction to this is so mundane. The last 2 films have basically nothing happen in them and try to hard to appeal to everyone. If the film ended at the death would of been OK ...ended on a bummer a bit more hard hitting but it had to end with some mushyness which brings it right back down to 5 year old friendly and this overambitious nature of the film just ruins it. It needs to choose a more niche audience and have things actually happen.,Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
833,dshiva17,"Different formula, great outcome",9,18 July 2009,"Man, I can count the days I've waited for this movie to come! And you know what? It was certainly worth it. In the previous film, Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, I had a very strong way of seeing the adaptations. I guess I was kind of intolerant because the story on-screen didn't show all the things I wanted to watch, but the fact is that, a film is a film, and a book is a book. No matter how faithful it may be to the novel, it will always sound and be different. And this film is clearly proof of that. Right in the beginning of it, we watch immediate changes in the storytelling. It doesn't start with Harry at home. It starts with an event we don't witness in the book. Nevertheless, it was nice. Different, and very creative. Most of the action that takes place on-screen had many changes, but that just makes the movie very authentic, very independent, and as long as it remains loyal to the original plot, all the rest is valid. Keep in mind that it is ""based on the novel"". This is just for you guys, Harry Potter fans and everybody else, to remember to criticize the motion picture for itself. The constant comparison between film and book only makes the evaluation difficult and unfair. There, I've said it. Now, about the movie, I loved a bit of everything in it. The storytelling was very decent, mentioning all the important events of the book, being constantly creative, smooth and fast. The screenplay was quite bold and guess what? It had precisely everything a HP movie should have: feeling, true teen hood, a very unique sense of humor and loads of fun and magic. Steve Kloves used a risky screen writing, given that the story was so radically different, and the characters, especially, the young ones, were much more credible, because they acted more like real teenagers, being rebellious, joking about this and that, full of feelings, with jealousy, craziness, boldness, and all the ""nesses"" you can come up with; love, friendship, rivalries and all that we can expect from teenagers. The acting was definitely improved, because now, Daniel Radcliffe was able to give more of himself in each scene. Emma Watson was, too, very complete. She gave us a much more detailed, pain in the neck, and annoyingly lovable Hermione. About Rupert Grint, he nailed it! He made some scenes, serious laughing matters. He helped bringing truly enjoyable comedy. When Ron had to be ridiculous, Rupert came along and made the audience laugh their heads off. Beautiful! The cinematography was precious. I think I had never seen before french cinematography in a big budget film. It was so innovative, and surprisingly magical. It totally transformed the ambient of the scenes. What else can I say? I could keep writing about this, and probably, I wouldn't be done by tomorrow. I will just tell you this: expect the boldest, strongest, and most loyal (to the the story's and JK Rowling's spirit) HP movie you've ever seen.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
834,misstmm0272,Disappointing,5,15 July 2009,"I'm a big fan of Harry Potter, seen all movies and read all the books. I showed up 3 hours early to make sure I got a good seat for this very anticipated movie. I'm very disappointed in the movie. I liked the special effects and they were a couple of things added that I thought were pretty good. But you can't rewrite the book so that it will fit into a 2 1/2 hour movie and be good for all of the little kids. The 6th book was supposed to be dark and I'm a little worried that they will forget this in the Book 7 movies as well. The fan base for Harry Potter has grown up with the movies, they aren't all still 10 years old. The kids who watched the first movie are now teenagers. In order to keep the movie PG and appropriate for small children they changed to many things and left out more than I can comprehend. Spoilers*** (main issues for me) There was a lot of information in book 6 about Voldemort and the horcruxes and the movie did talk about it but I didn't feel that the movie pressed the importance of finding and destroying them to Harry. The fight scene at Hogwarts when Dumbledore dies was left out altogether. How do you think we are supposed to believe that a group of deatheaters are going to just walk around in the castle and then leave out the front door without so much as a ""hey what are you doing here"". They really missed the boat leaving out the fight scene. Last and this would really have made a beautiful scene on the big screen. They left out Dumbledore's funeral. The big white tomb and Hagrid carrying Dumbledore's body down to the tomb. And they could have mentioned that he is the only headmaster to ever be laid to rest at Hogwarts. I would have been happy with the movie if they had just gone on and made it 3 hours and added the fight scene and the funeral. All I can hope is that they show the funeral at the beginning of 7 or that the DVD has an uncut version that has everything that's missing.You still have to watch no matter how much they missed. I just will have to say my prayer that they don't ""f"" up the 7th book as much as they did the 6th.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
835,nnamsalg10,I disagree,3,18 July 2009,"I think that David Yates did a terrible job of adaptation. I couldn't believe that he changed the fight sequence in the end. When I was reading about the death eaters fighting the students in Hogwarts, I could imagine the scene so vividly and I thought that it would be the best Harry Potter film yet. I was sadly disappointed with the directors choice to accentuate the love stories in all their lives and leave out the juicy details that dealt with the main plot of all the books. I mean, why even show the magic cabinet? The death eaters came through and then ran away from Hogwarts after doing very minimal damage. They never had to use the thing according to the movie and therefore it was pointless to have it in. This was just one of the many sequences that was sadly unnecessary,(even though it should have been) in telling the story. I felt like I had missed something grand in the movie. Especially after the crappy mourning process that was supposed to take place of a grand funeral. I hope that the seventh movie can redeem this awful piece of trash. On a side note, I can't believe they are making a movie for ""Where the Wild Things Are."" The most beloved book of all time is going to be ruined for countless generations. This children's book allowed kids to open their imaginations and go to their own wild place, and now they are going to be forced to sit through another ""adults"" idea of what that place should be. Tom Hanks should have known better. Let the children use their imagination and quit trying to exploit and suck out their fragile little minds.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
836,braceface_dogs6,"Great movie, but a bit of disappointment",9,16 July 2009,"As a movie goer, and compared to the other ones, I personally LOVED it. Here's why: 1: I loved how the comedy was intertwined with dark, creepy images of Draco Malfoy. I found that it was really well done, and it put in something for everyone. 2: The hormones of the teens really start kicking in. The whole Hermione/Ron love/hate story cracked me up. 3: That undeniably funny/awkward scene where Ron and Harry are in the dormitory talking about 'nice skin'. That scene alone deserves to be paid 10$ to be seen. 4: It wasn't all doom and gloom as it seemed the 5th one was (to me). 5: There was no pacing with extra talking, the movie had a good beat (it switched from fun (Ron/Hermione) to creepy/scary (Draco) to suspenseful (Harry and Dumbledore visiting memories)and it kept going around the cycle). 6: Great acting. They made me love all the characters. 7: I actually liked the scene they added. It's one of those rare cases where adding a scene from a book-based movie didn't turn out disastrous, although I would have liked to have seen them extinguish the fire, because it made me a bit sad to see them all so scared and sad. But I was also a bit disappointed, as an avid fan of the books, for these reasons: 1: Probably the biggest reason, THERE WAS NO FIGHT SCENE. I was very disappointed because I was looking forward to it the most. 2: Not much Neville, no Scrimgeour, no O.W.L. grades received, not much Fred and George, no Bill and Fleur... a lot of things were missing. 3: Not much explanation over Horcruxes, and not many important memories were shown, so it might difficult to understand the last ones for non-readers. Apart from that, I found it overall a very good movie. Basically, if you've read the book you'll think a lot of things are missing, but you'll understand it better than if you haven't.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
837,aayres-2,the next two movies better be amazing,6,19 July 2009,"I am a huge harry potter fan. I have read all the books and waited in line for my copy till 2 am because I couldn't wait any longer to see what would happen next. I have seen every movie the day it premiered and own them all on video. After they got a different director the movies have just been going downhill, but this was just ridiculous. Not only did they leave out several important parts. A few of which were the main reason I had been looking forward to the movie in the first place. They also filled the movie with a bunch of pointless fluff that was barely mentioned in the book. I left the theater feeling disappointed and all that is left to say is the two movies that makeup the 7th book better be amazing.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
838,spartycopper,Amazing,9,15 July 2009,"**Will Contain Spoilers** So far, the negative comments that I've seen regarding this movie seem to revolve around the fact that certain elements were left out, such as Dumbledore's funeral, several memories, and the Dursleys altogether. If this really bothers you, then why did you see the first five and expect anything different? The first two movie adaptions were very close to the books, and while the third kept to the main storyline, there were several random additions that made no sense and (personally) distracted from the movie as a whole. The fourth was a complete disaster, composed only of major plot events, while the fifth was only marginally better.I watched all five in the day proceeding the midnight opening, and at this point, it really isn't fair to compare the movies to the books. Dumbledore's funeral would have been overkill after the scene at the foot of the tower, and there really wasn't a huge need for a gigantic battle when we know it's coming in the seventh or eighth movie.The actors finally seemed to have absorbed their roles, especially the main three. Emma Watson and Rupert Grint were near perfection, while Daniel Radcliffe has been solid, albeit a little forced. I felt he showed more emotion during Cedric Diggory's death than Dumbledore's. But Tom Felton and Alan Rickman were absolutely superb, getting you to care so much about their characters that if you know what's going to happen later on (and possibly even if you don't), you're more emotional for them in the final scenes of the movie than you are for Dumbledore.For once, the subplots that were eliminated made the story easier to follow, preventing it from dragging on and turning a two and a half hour movie into a three hour one. The Weasley's shop was immense fun, and the CGI seems to only get more impressive.Overall, as a movie, as the sixth movie in the Harry Potter series, this was probably the best adaption so far. The characters are deeper, the story is more important, the acting is better, and you're more invested while watching it. True fans who understand that not every little detail (Such as Tonks being the one to find Harry on the train, not Luna) needs to translate to the big screen should really enjoy this installment, and with the now-expected somewhat cheesy ending, you're left only wanting more.The only reason I don't give this ten out of ten was because I feel it really should have been PG-13. Dumbledore's hand was barely shown, the Inferi could have been much scarier, and the Sectumsempra spell performed on Malfoy should have been a little more devastating.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
839,xcguyxc,Good Acting... Horrendous Reenactment...,2,15 July 2009,"I felt the movie was good but only if you did not read the book. The last movie to me was much better at connecting you with the characters. Some of the scenes left viewers confused at what was going on and why. Also the lack of details and changes to the original story are what killed it for me. (I.E: JK Rowling described the skull above the castle as a ""blazing green skull with a serpent thong"") details like that are what make the made the Potter series what it is. I am not saying I wouldn't recommend the movie just if you read the book please don't get your hopes up. The book and the movie are different in so many ways.One think I would like to note is that this movie seamed to be directed much more towards children than The Order Of The Phoenix. To me it lacked the character of a blockbuster flick.I would like to make this statement... WB what in the hell were you thinking, this is a fan biased series not a makeup your own story and call it Harry Potter! and to JK Rowling how could you let WB make such a crappy remake of your stupendous book? I am honestly considering not even seeing the last 2 movies.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
840,mukri743,Worst of all movies and not even worth writing review,3,15 July 2009,I haven't read the book and according to me this is the worst of all movies till now. Still can't imagine how it took 2 years to make this crap. There is absolutely nothing related to the title and the movie. The producers followed a great marketing strategy as the movie has nothing in action apart from what is shown in the trailers. Hope the future movies do not cheat viewers like me who haven't read the book and would like to enjoy most of the movie. Disgrace to show the death of the great wizard Dumbledore so lame. I seriously think dumbledore himself was so frustrated after seeing this movie that he let him killed rather than continuing in another pathetic movie.,Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
841,tejasdkulkarni,Harry Potter 6,9,15 July 2009,"When it's Harry Potter, people are going to watch it regardless of anything. I am not saying that this movie lacks to recreate the magic. Actually I would go ahead and say this is the best amongst all that have came until now! This movie has everything in it - drama, emotion, magic and needless to say the impeccable scenes by all the actors. This movie takes the Harry Potter movies to an altogether new level. The scenes between Harry and Dumbeldore are beautifully crafted and will hook you onto to the screen until the end. If you want to compare this movie with the previous one's then I would say that this movie has a darker side than the rest. This is mostly because of the tragic scene at the end of the movie. Even if you have never watched a Harry Potter movie before, it is a must watch. I would give it a 9/10.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
842,euro_kid111,"simply the best OHHHH, better than all the rest (tina turner)...",10,28 July 2009,"WOW!!! mind has been blown!! I knew this movie was going to be awesome because it had awesome previews to accompany it. I can always tell if a movie is going to be marvelous by the previews alone...Half-Blood Prince= awesome... Transformers= explosive diarrheaOK onto the analysis...Superb acting ol'around. Props to all actors and props to the casting director for Horace Slughorn, perfect. Special effects were equally satisfying, very real. I must disagree with people who are hating the screenplay, i loved it. The best Potter to date in every category. I counted 2 things that weren't actually in the book. One is easily fixed when your a wizard and know how to fix things, honestly, flick of a wand and everythings back to normal. The other, more screen time for a very hot actress portraying Lestrange no complaints about that. The reason I'm defending the screenplay is because I re-read the Half-Blood Prince after watching it and everything (minus those 2) were in the movie was in the book, granted that not everything in the book was in the movie. All the lines are actually word for word taken out of the book I was surprised. Overall this movies a 10 it was fantastic and hilarious. It will keep you interested throughout, an absolute must watch for fans and basically any an everyone. I cannot wait for The Deathly Hallows next year...YEAAAAAAAAAA",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
843,directitall,Harry Potter?,1,15 July 2009,"Lets just start off with if you had the choice of sitting in a electric chair or watching harry potter chose the electric chair, its less painful. The movie was slow and boring and lacked any entertainment once so ever. At times when the movie was trying to be funny it was just an awkward silence and let me just say this was only 10 minutes into the movie and i was already board out of my mind. The movie seemed to be low key and had no action through out the film. If you are thinking about seeing this movie, don't, its horrible in every shape way or form. So i give it one star because this website dose not allow me to give a worse rating. -Vinny Pizzi",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
844,iggyhop09,"Good movie, but did not follow the book!",8,15 July 2009,"This was by far my favorite book along with deathly hollows. Movie wise, this was a good movie. Love, comedy, and adventure. For the big fans of the books, sorry to disappoint you, but you will be disappointed. They left huge parts of the book out(the huge part in the end when the death eaters come to the school and there is a huge battle, not in it, along with other major parts). Now don't get me wrong, i loved the movie, my favorite out of the rest. It wasn't corny and stupid, it was solid. I just really wish they would've stuck to the roots of the book! I can only hope the next movie is more book orientated.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
845,amendeb17,A Delicious Summer Treat,9,12 July 2009,"Only the most unyielding literalist Potter fans will not enjoy this film as it has it all: exquisite cinematography, a brilliant soundtrack, imaginative direction, and the best acting from both veterans and young guns we've seen so far in the series. All are put to brilliant use as Dumbledore and Harry conspire to discover Lord Voldermort's secrets whilst simultaneously straining every sinew to contain outbreaks of rampant hormones and potion-taking at Hogwarts. Some of the sets are breathtaking, in particular Weasley Wizard Wheezes. The film is hilarious throughout, Rupert Grint excelling with superb support from Jessie Cave, Freddie Stroma (as Cormac McClaggen) and Evanna Lynch. Bonnie Wright and Tom Felton are allowed to step out of their two-dimensional characters, Wright delivering sensuousness and strength and Felton giving an outstanding all-round performance. Daniel Radcliffe continues to carry the weight of both the part and the franchise with effortless ease, and Emma Watson is once again a delight as the emotionally embattled focus of the superb trio, who have now added a facility for comedy to their formidable acting skills. The veterans pull out all the stops, Michael Gambon is exceptional, becoming a truly charismatic and compelling presence by the end of the film, and of course, perfectly pitched performances from the likes of Bonham Carter (terrifyingly seductive), Jim Broadbent (funny and pathos-filled), and Alan Rickman (unreadably malevolent). And, despite being on the screen for what seemed an instant, both David Thewlis and Helen McCrory successfully convey their respective characters' desperation and edginess. The film never lags because when you are not being gripped by visceral Quidditch or battle scenes you are laughing your head off at the comedy which ranges from broad and physical to witty and acute.The film is all the more satisfying because there is a very strong sense of place, and the characters are three-dimensional, and utterly recognisable. And, it is truly multi-dimensional, part romcom, detective story, rites-of-passage teen adventure, magical, scary-horror, political, and, above all, about love and friendship. All Rowling's stories are multi-layered but this is the first film to really capture the complexity and fun of the series.You cannot wish for more from a film than it both stays in the mind, and, the first urge you have is to want to see it all over again. Half Blood Prince delivers on both counts, and more.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
846,tien900,And.... what was the point???,5,16 July 2009,"In my opinion, this movie failed as a Harry Potter film not so much because the scenes were poorly made, but because the scenes were poorly CHOSEN.I'm not sure why David Yates thought it was more important to make up a (completely pointless) scene about the Burrow burning when if he really wanted to tug some heartstrings over a terrible loss all he had to do was hold Dumbledore's funeral. I would think the loss of this beloved headmaster (without whom even Harry himself says Hogwarts will never be the same again) would outweigh a house that has probably had little more then fifteen minutes screen time in the past five movies combined. When I read the book, I cried for a half an hour. The loss of Dumbledore is a terrible blow - yet the movie kills him off quick and doesn't leave any room for you to mourn because two minutes later it is over.Moving on, the acting was definitely the best of all the films so far. The visual effects were awesome, but that's to be expected with big budget films these days. And I admit, I laughed really hard throughout this movie and thought they did a pretty good job of making the funny scenes in the book just as hilarious on screen. The problem was, they offered so much screen time to humor and (overdone and over-pronounced) teen romance that they completely sacrificed the plot.If I didn't know better, I'd say the director thought that it was more important to portray the effects of teens with hormones and magic powers than to reveal the fascinating psyche of Voldemort or to show the fiercely loyal relationship between Harry and Dumbledore. Because when it comes right down to it, the film barely sticks a toe in to try to do these things.The REAL magic of Harry Potter, the reason we love these books and this story so much is because yes, it is fun to watch characters we love grow up and experience all of the rights of passage and coming of age in a magical world we wish existed, but much MUCH more importantly - to reveal to us the both dark and the light sides of human nature and the consequences of the choices we make, and to also experience who we can choose be if we continue to choose to act from our best and highest self (as Harry,) as well as the experience we will have if we choose the latter (as Voldemort.)This book is primarily supposed to be about the relationship between Harry and Dumbledore, the relationship between Harry and Snape (as the Half-Blood Prince, too), and Voldemort. In this movie, they are not. In the movie, the story is mainly about Ron and Hermione and all of the love triangles they find themselves in and the relationship between Harry and Slughorn.I am sorry that teen romance is more important to this director than the fine walk between our light and our dark side. But I suppose perhaps that is simply a reflection of where our society is currently at. I must admit, I was hoping for something a little deeper than hormones.In my opinion the best performance given in this movie was by Tom Felton, playing Draco Malfoy. I believed him and his conflict more than anyone and my heart went out to him. Alan Rickman was awesome as usual. And our heroic trio have all improved tremendously in their acting skills. Rupert Grint was hysterical as usual and Daniel Radcliff has shown he can definitely do humor. Emma Watson did excellent as well, though that's nothing new. The actress I was most disappointed in is definitely Bonnie Wright. It isn't necessarily that she's a bad actress, but that she definitely wasn't playing Ginny Weasley. Ginny is a firecracker full of spark and energy and daring. Bonnie Wright is reserved and meek. I didn't believe she and Harry were meant to be together in this movie.Overall, the biggest mistake of this movie I felt was to leave out Dumbledore's funeral. Without that, this movie has absolutely no leg to stand on. You can't take away one of the most beloved characters and then kick everyone out of the theater before they've even had time to get over the shock of his death. I may have enjoyed watching many of our favorite scenes come to life on screen, and they did a good job with most of them, the problem was they picked the wrong ones (and made some rubbish changes to several of them), and for that Harry Potter fans will never forgive them. I could go through and list all of the mistakes I feel they made, but I'm sure plenty of other reviewers have done that for me already.All we can hope for is that one day in the far future when special effects are even cooler, a new director will step up and re-make the Harry Potter movies for what they were meant to be. Until then, read the books!",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
847,jenna_a22,Worst Interpretation EVER,1,15 July 2009,"This segment of HP will disappoint all who read the novel. The Burrow burns down during x-mas break due to Bellatrix and Fenrir (who is never described as a werewolf) perhaps for the lack of action at the end of the movie...the Dursleys are completely cut from the movie, meaning when Dumbledore picks Harry up for the summer it's at the train station for some apparent reason...The Ginny/Dean/Harry dichotomy is skewed, there was no break up between Ginny and Dean and Harry is clearly in love with her from the start of the movie which eliminates his confusion on his feelings during the school year...Hermoine prematurely spills the beans on her feelings for Ron which was only speculation in the novels...Lavender Brown becomes a obsessive and crazed girlfriend rather than simply over-affectionate (a reminiscent Unis from She's the Man)...the battle scene is missing from the end giving Dumbledore's death an anticlimactic feel making it all the more unemotional and disappointing...Harry hides under the floor simply holding his wand looking like a coward while Dumbledore dies, Snape sees him hiding rather than Harry being frozen under his cloak compliments of Dumbledore ...There is no funeral or break up with Ginny at the end of it (there is no relationship between the two either simply a kiss)...Hagrid is basically deleted from the movie as is Neville...Pensive trips are deleted and the Horocruxes are never explained, not even slightly...Luna finds Harry on the Hogwarts Express rather than Tonks...The Slug Club simply makes a cameo rather than a proper introduction and explanation...the Inferi look more like skeletons compared to the white bodies described in the book...I'm sure more discrepancies are present, however I can only remember so many of them.It is absolutely a horrible interpretation of the book and I hope that they look at all of the mistakes and gaps left for the next movie and fill them in with more than humor (they are supposed to be in the middle of an all out war aren't they?) I mean I didn't even feel emotional when Dumbledore was killed, I was too busy trying to figure out why Harry was acting like a stunned coward under the floor boards and not doing something, isn't that his thing...doing seemingly impossible rescue missions?!?! I am utterly disappointed in this installment of HP!!",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
848,downing-131,The Movie if hadn't read the books is OK otherwise its crap,6,15 July 2009,The new Harry potter is packed with some good laughs some happy and sad moments and some action. With all that said it was OK. But for someone who has read the book three times like myself the movie was crap it left out several events and some of the more interesting action events from the book. With some of the events left out it will even effect the last two movies of the last book. So it leaves us to wander what will happen with the last movies. I do not know why when u have a great source to wright a script from how you can mess up but for this movie based off a book they did. Many of the important events in the book that were transferred to the film even still were s cued from there original form.,Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
849,justifiedmeans,"Very funny, but takes liberties with plot and serious parts are lacking.",4,15 July 2009,"As I began to watch, I was excited because I felt like this would be the best movie in the series. The movie was hilarious. Great timing, good acting, and excellent visuals.But whenever the film dipped into the ""meat"" of the story, it never got very deep. It took great liberties with the plot - several scenes are totally made up; large, important scenes that never happened in the books. Most of the important scenes in the book are never mentioned or referred to, and there is very little actual character development outside of the main trio. I don't remember Neville having a single line in this movie.Anyone who has read the books will know that there is a momentous event in year six, and while the film certainly covers it, it is rushed and altered such that the audience does not feel much when it happens.Certainly it is understandable that fitting everything from the book into the movie is impossible, and that certain liberties must be taken. Even with this understanding, the filmmakers went too far with this film and butchered it so it didn't make you feel what the books make you feel.Summary: Thought it would be the best HP film, but it turned out to be the worst.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
850,eric-bolt,Harry Potter and the Half-Done Movie,4,15 July 2009,"Let me start by saying, I know that you have to alter and omit scenes from a novel when adapting it to the silver screen. However, it is not necessary to take a chain saw to what can easily be debated as the best book in the series. Half-Blood Prince is key to setting up the final, now two, movies and this version missed the mark. Now the major novel plot points are there, Harry learns about Voldemort's past, Draco struggles with his chosen task and Snape does kill Dumbledore but much of the set-up plot and subplots have been completely omitted. For fans out there that have read the book will get a strange feeling in their gut just a few minutes in.After the Deatheater attack on London the muggel minister is supposed to receive a late night visit. Omitted! During the time spent at the Wesley's prior to the school year there is supposed to be a blast from the past and news of an upcoming marriage. Omitted! So just minutes into the feature many of the actual fans should start to wonder if something fishy is going on. After the duration of the film all of the omissions are topped off by the big daddy of them all. There is no funeral for the deceased headmaster. How can that be? it is easily the 2nd biggest moment in seven novels, next to the climax when Voldemort is killed. Additional ommisions: Many of Dumbeldore's Voldemort memories Any of Snape's interaction as the Defense against the Dark Arts instructorProper development of the Snape Good Vs. Evil plot Quitich cup match, unless that is the match shown in the movie but you couldn't tell The alterations in the film are also a huge let down. Unfortunately our friendly writers decided that it would be wise to alter the first kiss of the future Mr. and Mrs. Potter. I cannot even wrap my head around why writers would think fans wouldn't notice. I'm not even going to get into, beyond a mention, of the two biggest changes. When the headmaster gets killed it needs to be word for word from the novel, enough said. Since they felt it necessary to not shoot the funeral I guess they felt it would be fine to end with our three heroes together instead of Harry walking off after breaking up with Ginny. Those are Huge! Now before I continue to rag on the choices of the writers I will say that HBP is visually stunning to a level above the previous films and what they did put into the script works for the film. Only those who have spent the time to read the novel will notice the major issues with this film. For entertainment value alone it was a good movie. Please to not destroy Deathly Hallows the way this edition was destroyed.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
851,mgmt-8,"Wow, just wow",5,15 July 2009,"I am a very big Harry Potter fan. I've read the books and seen all the movies. While it is understandable to stray from the books a bit and leave things out to cut it short, this movie took it way too far.It was filled with way too much fluff and not much fact! They left out some very important details and did not make use of some very entertaining scenes. The ending however was the worst. Without giving away what happens, its hard to say, but lets just say what should have been a deeply emotional and empowering moment of the ""love conquers all"" is robbed, and there is no real closure. It also left out some major fight scenes, which would have made it so much more bearable. It also doesn't show the depth of Malfoy's struggles or what Dumbledore is doing with Harry. There aren't any of the explanations shown that this book was WRITTEN for. There were some very entertaining parts and I still love Harry Potter, but the writers and director made some very bad choices and need to seriously step it up to give Harry the ending he deserves. See this movie because its part of the story, but this is by far the one of the worst book to film adaptations I have ever seen.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince

Background: I read bits and pieces of the first two books, and the 4th book before the 4th movie came out. Having been disappointed by the things they left out I vowed to not read the series until after the movies were finished because it ruined the 4th movie for me. This movie made me change my mind. I knew things were missing, but it irritated me because I couldn't tell what.Don't get me wrong. I loved this movie. It was like an evening with long lost friends. The romance and tension were believable, and your heart really goes out to Hogwarts. But I felt it was lacking. Lacking anger, lacking build-up to the next movie. I feel like they didn't develop the scenes and the overall plot enough. This needed to be made into two movies like the last book will be. The last book should probably be made into 3. And you know what? I'd still go see every single one.In the end, I was happy to be reunited with the Harry Potter series. I enjoyed my 2.5 hours to no end.

854,shor_D_inges,Very boring and leaves out valuable info,7,15 July 2009,"Overall i liked the movie very much but it leaves out so much information that is crucial for the next movie. in the book dumbledore told harry to not tell anyone about the hocruxes except for his best friends. Also Dumbledore and harry discussed what the other horcruxes might be, this gives harry a HUGE lead for when he goes to look for them. also harry got a big hint on how to destroy a hocrux in the book with basilisk venom but nothing in the movie. i honestly don't see how they will be able to make these next movies without these facts.now on to the movie vs book. i was really looking forward to the big battle at hogwarts the night dumbledore died but that was blown off. as far as the movie goes they really didn't need to sneak in the death eaters in the end. basically draco found a weak dumbledore and snape came in and did the job, the others just stood there and watched. nothing was ever said about greyback being a vicious werewolf that enjoyed infecting others. also when dumbledore died it was boring, harry had almost no reaction it should have been like when sirius was killed. this should have been the climax of the entire movie.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
855,ashley-wolf,Fan of Books? Talk about upset! Fresh fan?...it was cool,4,15 July 2009,"Since I consider myself a dedicated Harry Potter fan, I am going to try to put this as nicely as possible...If I had never read any of the books (hey they're long I get it) I would have thought this movie was pretty cool and a step up from past films in terms of laughter and the script itself including special effects. There would have been mild confusion towards the end but as said before I would be the casual fan who wouldn't really mind.That being said, I am not what you would call a ""casual fan."" I along with many others had been devastated when I learned that Warner Brothers had pushed back the release date 6 months and had waited in the theatre for 3+ hours for a movie that I was anticipating to be one of my favorites in the series. In its good moments, there were little things from the book which I was happy to see on the silver screen. Ron's sudden girl-magnet status was done very well along with Slughorn's character debut. The only thing that was wrong was the title. I thought this was Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince? I did not buy a ticket to Ronald Weasley and the stories of Romance nor did I buy a ticket to Harry Potter's Friends with a touch of You-Know-Who on the side. Not only that, what happened to the plot? Where did it go? Who knows...maybe Ron will know if we ask him....How can you fear a wizard when you can't understand why he is the way that he is? What happened to that kiss between Harry and Ginny? (YIKES...oh ""i can stay hidden in here too""...WHAT????)Where was Snape's big moment? Where was the drama? In addition, why oh whywould you omit critical moments and downgrade important characters to CREATE new ones that don't mean anything to take their place? Bottom line: This movie was like part 1 of 3 with no real closure, action, and not to mention storyline.

856,roxychic484,did i miss the climax?,3,15 July 2009,"Either I completely missed the climax, or there wasn't one. What happened to the dramatic battles that Harry faces in each book? They seem to have left it out of this movie! The movie is not all that dark. Aside from the death eater attacks, the element of the movie that is focused the most on is the relationships between Harry, Ron, Hermione, and whoever currently likes one of the three. The strained but passionate relationship between Tonks and Lupin is never mentioned in the move aside from Tonks calling Lupin ""Sweetie"" or ""Sweetheart"" (Sorry, I can't recall what she called him). Also, the lessons that Dumbledore thought were so important to Harry were hardly given a thought in the movie. Harry only saw three memories out of the hundreds that Dumbledore had collected in his office. I have to admit that the graphics and special effects were incredible. They really stepped it up since the order of the phoenix.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
857,challa-rajesh,To all the raving fans!!!...This is the worst of all!!!,5,15 July 2009,"Yet another disaster attempt !!! I seriously think Yates&co failed miserably in understanding key plot of the book and having read all the earlier comments from all the users i don't quiet understand how some really feel this movie is so good and convincing.when a movie is an adaptation of a book(of such a wonderful book),any person who is trying to adapt it should surely understand the basic plot and emotion and make sure you never miss that in the movie...surely one can say even those who haven't read the books can say that there's a lot going on in the wizard world by the end of the 5th part and the main idea of 6th part is establishing the scenes where Dumbledore explains the key knowledge of how to destroy Voldemort. They travel together into memories which are really important for harry to understand.Horcruxes form the main key to the 6th part and this seems to be the least important to Yates for the reasons only known to him. Apart from the introduction of Voldmorte as a boy and Slughorn's memory , the rest have been omitted . I wouldn't have cared much for the Voldmortes parents memory or the one in which he tries for a job at Hogwarts but the one where he gets his hands on the other Horcrux in Hepzibah Smith's house is imp as it would have given an opportunity to explain or list out all the possible Horcruxes so that would be crucial later on.I don't see how the director would be able to explain this in his next movie as we know for the reasons.The technical team has given wonderful job all over with excellent graphics and should really appreciate Delbonnel for his truly spectacular camera work.The main lead have shown lot of maturity in acting skills though i prefer Harry to be much better over emotional scenes with more depth than we see now. The saving grace in this movie is the performance given by Michael Gambon and Alan Rickman.The major part of the script i think has been wasted on the love stories rather than main key points in the film. Even then the emotion is missing if you see the 5th part and the 6th part you feel as if Harry has developed liking for Ginny all of a sudden and the breakup of Dean and Ginny hasn't been shown. and lot of things from the book has been changed, i can understand the necessity of change while you adapt a movie from a book but when you compare the earlier films they never seem like they changed the true emotion of how Harry feels about all the dear ones he loves like Sirius,Ron,Hermoine,Dumbledore and Weasley's. He would rather die for them than see them in danger and that emotion has been tampered with in this movie as we see harry do nothing when he sees main character whom he adores so much being killed. Wat's the point in keeping the attack at burrow rather than last action scene and many characters from the book in this part are missing in the movie like Bill ,Fleur,Kreacher and Dobby. All in all worst interpretation of the book and i think Steve has his own version of harry potter in his mind rather than the one in millions of Harry's fans...i hope the Yates&co come to their senses at least for the last two parts and get a movie which would make JKR proud....asking that is not too much i guess !!!",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
858,vwalk,"Overall, kind of disappointed with the movie",7,15 July 2009,"As like any other Harry potter fan, I was miffed about the movie release push back from November to July. But once I was over that, I was giddy as all can be for this movie, and I bought my tickets weeks ago to ensure a spot to the midnight show...and I must confess, as much as I wish I didn't I was fairly disappointed in the overall outcome of this movie.If you have never read the books or are not a die hard fan -- then this movie is awesome!!!! But, myself being a die hard fan I always prepare myself for the movies as I know that the movies will never be as good as the books, nonetheless I still enjoy them. However, with that said there are some things that really bothered me about this movie, the biggest being -- I cannot believe that they left out Dumbledore's funeral!!! WTF. Not only was I not happy with how Dumbledore died, as Harry was just kind of standing there not doing anything, whereas in the book he REALLY couldn't do anything...but I cannot believe that for how many times they showed Draco pulling that cloth off of the cabinet that they couldn't fit in 10 min for Dumbledore's funeral!! This is a huge turning point for Harry! Not to mention the rest of the wizarding world! The only wizard that Voldemort every feared just died and the movie did not embrace that moment; that feeling; that ultimate heart-wrencher. I really think that this movie could have been perfect if it had included this part of the book. I just don't like how they went from the saddest thing ever, to Hermione talking to Harry about snogging Ginny. Although the ending with the trio talking is similar to the book, it really only works in the book because you've already gone through Dumbledore's funeral!I did really like the light-hearted school life portrayed, I think it was good for character development and it was funny to watch, but again with that said, this was a very very dark book and I think that the movie really lacked that. I really liked the actor chosen for Slughorn -- couldn't be any better! I didn't care for the scenes that they added, such as the beginning scene -- I mean it was cute, but I think it would have been better to keep to the book and have Fudge meet with the Muggle Minister, as now wizards are not the only ones in danger anymore - as portrayed by the bridge breaking, etc. This would have added the darkness to the film. And Dumbledore talking to the Dursley's would have been fun to see. Furthermore, the whole Burrow scene -- I really don't understand the point of that. It added nothing to the movie, was never in the book and didn't really make sense...it just seemed really random - it was time they would have spent on DUMBLEDORE'S FUNERAL!!!! And there were a couple of other things I noticed but in the end I don't think it really affected the movie. And I am curious as to why they left out Kreacher and Fleur...especially Kreacher -- how are they going to explain him in the next movie???? And Fleur added comedy to the book and also explains some things that occur in the 7th book.I really wish Peter Jackson, or someone with the same ambitions as him, did the Harry Potter movies and would then get it right the first time!Anyhoo-- that is my rant and my thoughts.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
859,amgonska,Harry Potter 6 a bit of a let down...but there is hope,8,15 July 2009,"As a fan of the Harry Potter universe, I have to say that the movie was building up to that awesome fight scene at the end but the production company didn't pull through. Although I enjoyed the comedic touches and for the most part the plot line stuck to the book, I was expecting (as I am sure others were)a bang for my buck. Personally I think they should have saved the money they spent on the attack on the Burrow and used it for the end invasion of Hogwarts. All of the other little things and details from the book however could not be copied word for word and translated into the movie or else it would have been 4 maybe 6 hours long. Everyone should keep in mind this, whether you were there or not, back when the original star wars came out the empire strikes back wasn't as good as the 1st or last. It was a set up movie for the big show stopping finale, much as harry potter 5 and 6 are a set up for something (hopefully) phenomenal. With that said they should have played up the darkness factor and still broken it up with the comedy, and again that final battle in Hogwarts would have shown how much of a threat Voldemort and the Death Eaters really are, being able to infiltrate one of the safest places in the wizard world. Of course I will see the last two movies when they come out, my only hope is that they don't disappoint.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
860,pharmapri,"Good setup for HP7, Focus on relationships, Will be better in hindsight",9,15 July 2009,"As I exited the theater after the midnight showing, I noticed that the younger crowd was very disappointed and were noting several changes and details that were left out, and the older crowd was pleased overall. I'm not sure if that's because us older folk are used to movies leaving out detail or if we realized that the undertones of this movie are very important to the overall series.This movie actually surprised me in that they kept in a lot of the interaction between the students, and there were a lot of scenes from the book that I was expecting to be cut from the movie in place of background on Riddle. At first I was taken aback by how much of Riddle's background was left out, but then I realized that this info (along with more on Snape's history) would be a perfect plot for the first part of HP7, with the war starting in HP7 part 2. Which leaves character development for Harry and friends in HP6.I think the relationships and love between the kids and families is probably one of the most important messages in the series (aside from choosing the light over the dark), and HP6 really focused on this and covered some ground that was missing in previous movies. The acting has greatly improved as the kids have grown, and the chemistry and humor between them is a joy to watch. The scenes were neatly broken up with some action and some plot advancement; but, again, I expect to see more plot development in HP7. It was expected that some scenes and characters would be left out as there are time constraints, but I think this was handled well in HP6. I didn't mind the group fight missing from the end, as I don't think it was really necessary for the storyline as a whole, and I think there will be plenty of action in HP7 (which I expect to be PG-13 or else I will have complaints).I am confident that the next two movies will fill in any gaps and missing pieces of the story that have been lost along the way, and that the story will culminate with many more pleased fans than there are right now. I think the ""haters"" of HP6 will realize in hindsight that this really is an excellent movie, but without the context of HP7 in place, it's hard to see the movie for the gem that it is right now.Final thoughts: What helped this movie out was that the 7th book was published before the movie was finished. Now they are finally able to do some good foreshadowing in the movie! The only major complaint I have about the series in general is that they should have had the foresight to have theatrical releases and then offer extended editions (like Lord of the Rings) on DVD for the mega fans. I can only keep my fingers crossed that they've done this for recent films and are keeping it a secret. Pretty please??!!",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
861,mr-florindi,Warner Brothers dropped the ball...,3,15 July 2009,"I'm really glad that people are feeling the same way as me.It seemed from the start of this movie that the plot was rushed and condensed. The best way to put it is how someone else on here put it: ""It was like watching a G-rated version of the movie through Cliffnotes."" Some parts of the movie were completely changed (like how Harry and Ginny first kissed). Some parts were completely left out (especially ones that I was looking forward to, like the fight in Hogwarts at the end). And some parts were added (the attack on the Burrow). Now I just read how the Burrow scene was a representation of the attacks, but seriously, the Harry Potter series got the status it has from being THE HARRY POTTER SERIES and people loving the books. They've pretty much changed the entire book in this movie. I'm praying that the seventh movie(s) won't drop the ball like this movie did.I'm extremely disappointed in this film...",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
862,bryanandbrya,When are the Avid book readers going get what we're looking for?,3,15 July 2009,"Like many of you, I went to see the Midnight showing of the movie. And like the 5 other people that I went with, we are left wondering WTF? We have read all seven books and own the movies on DVD. And I think that it's sad that while reading the books, we each envisioned the movie in similar ways. In the movies, the characters who are not important are the stars of the show! For the followers who are only interested in the movies, then you must be pleased. But I'm tired of being jerked around by the movie producers! From the Sorceror's Stone to Half Blood Prince, the movies have left out IMPORTANT PIECES of INFO! For example, where the hell has Percy been the past 4 years? In the books he's the most backstabbing individual in town! What happened with Creature, Dobby and the girl house elf (my apologizes for it slipping my mind right now)? What happened to showing us how the betrayal REALLY happened with the Order? How sick, twisted, disturbed and resentful Voldemort really was with his background and lineage? Im freaking over it! I wait years between movies only to get movie blue balls. PLEASE WARNER BROTHERS, FOR ALL THAT'S GOOD IN THE WORLD, GIVE THE INFORMATION THAT IS TRULY NEEDED FOR THE DEATHLY HALLOWS OR I WILL BE FORCED TO MAKE MY OWN COMMENTARY ON TOP OF THESE MOVIES TO TELL THE WHOLE TRUTH!

863,warlordmos1,Mike Todd,8,15 July 2009,"Hey Mike You missed the boat entirely. These books were never written as R rated and if you read that into them you need help. I will agree that the movies need to be more faithful to the book, but they did not leave the overall story line. All the major parts are included. Ron's romance with Lavender, Vane going after harry. The parts of the story you mentioned especially Tom Riddle's murder of his father and grandfather do not add anything to the story. We know that Tom is a bad seed. Are these scenes necessary i don't think so. you seem to want to make the many players much older than they are. You need to Remember that Harry, Ron and Hermione are only 16 and most of the other students are younger. Last but not least I think most people go to the movies to relax and enjoy not looking for a dark experience.Ken",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
864,sportsnut2004,Disappointing,4,15 July 2009,"Although I enjoyed this movie, I think it was meant more to amuse fans who choose to not read the books but to watch the movies instead. Having read from the 3rd book to the end I have obviously realized that under time restrictions they must pull some things out. Usually there are a couple big things left out, Prisoner of Azkaban they failed to explain that James and his friends were the creators of the Marauder's Map, Goblet of Fire left out the fact that Rita Skeeter was an unregistered Animagus which should have been relevant in Order of the Phoenix when he does his interview with her (which was also left out). Those being some things as well as a lot of House Elf scenes and S.P.E.W, Pigwideon, challenges in the World Cup, etc. As disappointing as some of those things were I would have to say that Half Blood Prince was EASILY the most disappointing. How do you take out the fight scene at Hogwarts when Dumbledore dies and yet ADD a completely irrelevant scene about the Burrow. The fact that Harry had no curiosity as to who the HBP actually was unlike the book got me annoyed. Was it necessary to make the film PG and cut many of the action scenes and put so much emphasis on the love theme of the book. Worse than leaving things out in my opinion is when they COMPLETELY change things from the book to the movie. Why have Luna find Harry on the train with no explanation when Tonks clearly explained how she found Harry in the book. Even main characters were pretty much taken out of the movie. DID NEVILLE HAVE ONE WORD IN THE FILM!? I don't think so. Would it have been terrible to explain more of what was going on in the Muggle word as far as Dementors go rather then having the first couple minutes showing Harry flirting with a waitress. After I read Half Blood Prince I don't think I ever thought of any character in anything of more of a dirtbag than I thought Snape was. I thought it was creepy how Voldemort grew up. I didn't feel that after the movie. Was Dumbledores arm even scratched in this movie? After reading I was truly scared of Fenrir Greyback's character. Not the same feeling at the end of HBP as they didn't even explain who he was, although he was scary looking. The scene when they showed Draco going into B&B was completely changed as well, in the book he talked about the vanishing cabinet while Harry Ron and Hermione were listening via Extendable Ears. Instead they decided this would be Draco's initiation as a Death Eater. The action, storyline, and emphasis on certain things was VERY poorly done in this film. The only times I felt at all suspenseful was during the death of Dumbledore and the Inferi scene. I didn't know the Harry Potter's was supposed to be turned into a Romantic Comedy. Unfortunately the last two films won't be done any better because the directors will see how many people went to see the film and think, ""Oh we must have done an amazing job on this one.""",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
865,vmatt3,Best One Yet!,9,15 July 2009,"This movie was amazing. Even with the changes that some people believe were way too drastic the movie remained true to the book without that rushed feeling that Order of the Phoenix had. I know some people think ""oh everybody likes the next one the best just because it's the next one"" but this was just really well done.The controversy over the absence of the fight scene at the end really shouldn't be as big as people are making it to be. The reasons for it not being there are fine because it would be fairly similar to the last scene of part 2 of Deathly Hallows. And yes the fire scene at the Burrow was completely random but it added a little more excitement to the middle of the film that wouldn't have been there. It also didn't really affect the next film all that much either. Yes, there should've still been a scene at the Burrow for when Harry leaves his house and for Bill and Fleur's wedding but really they didn't mention that they were getting married as they were supposed to in this movie and they will still be able to edit the storyline to work for them.The romantic issue between Ron and Hermione was also done well. It was fairly close to what happened in the book. The situation between Ginny and Harry was just weird though. It was sort of awkward and just cheesy. If they would've kept it like the book it would've been fine but it didn't have too big of an effect on the movie anyways so it was fine. It also allowed for more comedy I guess but it still just seemed abnormal.Speaking of comedy, that aspect of the movie really improved as well. It added a lighter touch to the movie and just entertained the viewers more.One last thing that was a little disappointing was the absence of a funeral scene at the end. I thought that would've added more closure to the movie as well as better transition to the next. The movie isn't ruined without it or anything but it would've been a nice touch.Overall, this movie was just excellent. I had a good balance of action, suspense, comedy, and romance that was very entertaining. Can't wait for the next one.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
866,singingamy09,Are you freaking kidding me!!?,7,15 July 2009,"I have been counting down the days since they moved this movie from its original release date. As the characters have grown older, the story line gets better, and I was hoping the same would go for the sixth movie. However, I am still completely confused about the decisions made for this movie. The movie is two and a half hours of ridiculousness. Yes, it has fantastic effects, and humor about the raging hormones, but who cares if the integrity of the story is completely diminished. Let's make a list of everything they cut out:1. The introduction of the new Minister of Magic and all that happens between him and Harry. 2. Dumbledore coming to the Dursley's house to give them a piece of his mind. 3. Harry, Ron and Hermione seeing Draco in the dress shop, and Harry getting his first idea that Draco had been branded into the Death Eaters. 4. The invisibility cloak was absent in almost every important scene besides the train. 5. Slughorn's parties (the first of which that was on the train when Ginny gets her first invite.) 6. Tonks finding Harry on the train. 7. Tonks and Lupin's relationship 8. Several key memories that help Harry find the horcruxes in the 7th book. Also the awkward arguments between Dumbledore and Harry about Dumbledore's whereabouts and what happened to his hand. 9. Hagrid and Thwarp10. Harry finding out that everything that Sirius owned now belongs to him (including the house that serves as the hiding place in the 7th book) 11. Several of the Quidditch matches and how Harry ends up in trouble and has to miss the final match. THIS is when Harry and Ginny have their first kiss when she becomes the seeker for the team and helps the team win. 12. Harry and Ginny's relationship 13.Fleur and Bill's engagement, and are completely absent in the movie. 13. Madam Rosmerta's role 14. Moaning Myrtle's role 15. THE FIGHT IN THE CASTLE!!!! ARE YOU KIDDING ME! The best part of the book and they cut it out. They deserved to be fired in my opinion. How could Rowling sign off on them doing this!? 16. Dumbledore's funeral17. Harry telling Ginny he could no longer see her...they couldn't have this scene considering they never showed them to be in a relationship.I'm sure there is a lot more, but you get the idea. All of these scenes were cut to add those that never even happened in the book. If you are an actual fan of the book, be prepared to be disappointed. If you haven't read the book, I'm sure it'll be great.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
867,Madcapfeline,"Eh, wish I'd gone to the matinée instead of paying full price :/",7,15 July 2009,"Once again, like so many other book-to-movie adaptations, this one feels a bit like a cliff notes version. I know, I know, you can't turn a book into a movie without leaving SOMETHING out. Books just have way too much information. However, the things that David Yates decided to leave out is virtually unforgivable, the supporting storyline came to the forefront way too often, and the things that never happened that were included, left me scratching my head. All I can say is Deathly Hallows had better be spot on, considering they get two movies to do it in.Standing on it's own, as if it were nothing but a movie about some kids doing magic, it's pretty entertaining. If you've never read any of the books, you'll probably like it. As a sixth chapter to a beloved series, it leaves much to be desired, too, too much, in fact.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
868,piscesgirl_14,I'm a huge fan of the books and i was not happy,6,15 July 2009,"i have to say that for someone who has not read the books, like many of the movie critics who have written reviews on this movie, it is a very good movie. for someone such as myself, i would have to say that i was quite disappointed that there was not battle scene at the end. the book is filled with intense dialogs of tom riddle and the questionable half-blood prince which all lead up to this awesome and absolute thrilling battle scene between the order of the phoenix and the death eaters. i did not understand why it was left out of the movie. i was absolutely shocked when i saw that snape led the death eaters out of howgarts without even a struggle, except for the couple of spells cast by harry, followed by a ""i am the half-blood prince"" by Snape which seemed to have been put in there for the sake of the title. i feel as though they replacement this, what was supposed to be a gripping scene, with burrow catching on fire and harry and Ginny running through the field. the burrow is not once set on fire throughout the series, in fact, there was supposed to be Charlie's and Fleur's (two characters who were missing in the movie as wheel) wedding in book 7. although it was an interesting scene, it begs the question on why Greyback and lestrange did so if they didn't even attempt to capture harry and kill Ginny. the other very important detail i am very disappointed in not seeing in the movie is the fact that Dumbledore did not explain how and why Voldemort chooses the objects he does to use as horcruxes and why the locket would be in that specific cave. the fact that they showed a picture of the cave in tom riddle's room is simply not a good enough explanation. Grawp's memory is not even in the movie and that is a crucial detail in how and why voldemort's horcruxes symbolically represent Slytherin, Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff. is it with this knowledge that Dumbledore left harry with that harry succeeds in finding and destroying the other horcruxes. this ties in the fact that harry, in the book, hides his potions book near a gargoyle in which he places a tiara on its head, a tiara in which he only realizes in the 7th book that it is Ravenclaw's tiara and of course another Horcrux. as a reader, i am very disappointed about these crucial details that were left out. i'm wondering how they are going to succeed in making the 7th book leaving so much out of the 6th movie. i believe that all this could have possible incorporate in the movie if it was not so concentrated with love triangles. j.k. rowling's half-blood prince is magnificent, detailed, and perfect, and i do not believe that movie did it all justice.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
869,Questioned,Simply irresistible.,8,15 July 2009,"Being a hard person to please when it comes to movies, this one did rather well. There were points where I said ""Wha'"" or ""Heeeehh?"" but there where only a few of those. There were definitely some parts that did not exist in the book, and parts that they left out from the book. There will definitely be some confusion in the duration of the movie for those who have not read the glorious book, but I heard somewhere that JKR knows what she's doing and it will be made up in the last/last two films. I could have heard wrong, or right. The actors again were a delight. Harry may go out of character for a while, but I promise it's pretty funny. The new Horace Slughorn (Horace is such a great name, by the way), played by Jim Broadbent, was entertaining. The romance and age in the movie were probably much more emphasized than the Tom Riddle's secret. Did I mention unnecessary additions? I thought they could have done without those and put more from the book in. I may sound repetitive, but that is the only downfall in the movie. Overall, being a Harry Potter fan, the movie was simply irresistible. Enjoy.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince

The book is a million times better and I'm hugely disappointed.They have added poor scenes and taken away integral parts of the book. Huge parts of the story have been missed. Pointless scenes have been added I imagine, to make it appeal to younger audiences or a wider audience.

Yes the part with Luna having such a large role made me angry to, but for all the people crying about how too much stuff was moved along such as relationships, they have to or people who didn't read the book would not understand. The acting was incredible, easily the best of all of them. Your just ignorant if you read the book and assume everything you wanted is in the movie.

874,vivian333999,TRYING to like the film,10,15 July 2009,"I have to say, after I watched OOTP, my initial reaction was ""I MUST WATCH THIS AGAIN RIGHT NOW!"" I was extremely confident that the following films are in good hands. HOWEVER, HBP was fast paced- but moved so quickly that I felt like I was being rushed from one scene to this next. Additionally, although the scenery was quite beautiful, there were many parts when the CGI just seemed too fake. On another note, I will get down on my knees if I have to in order to beg Yates and Heyman to put ROBES on the trio! Please! You wear robes at Hogwarts- not Muggle clothing! You wear robes in the Wizarding world! I beg you. This isn't a very difficult thing to accomplish. As for the score, I must say I am slightly disappointed. I loved Nicholas Hooper on OOTP. Unfortunately, is it just me or did I hear the same thing at Fred and George's joke shop? I head some beautiful tracks on the trailer that I'm not sure I heard in the movie. (But I could be wrong.) On the other hand, the acting was superb- with the exception of the despicable, ignorant Michael Gambon and Jim Broadbent. The trio's acting has improved immensely, and I am grateful for that. Alan Rickman's interpretation of Snape and Helena Bonham Carter's Bellatrix are both incredibly amazing. They have nailed their characters. Regrettably, I must say even though Broadbent was not a complete failure like Gambon, I wish he played Slughorn better by really obsessing over Harry and people with famous relatives. (SPOILER) I especially was disturbed at the part when Ron was poisoned, and Slughorn just stood shocked by the side and did NOTHING.! ABSOLUTELY NOTHING! Harry saved Ron! WTF! While Harry did yell, ""Professor, DO SOMETHING,"" in the novel, Slughorn did react! Now, onto Gambon. I never quite got over Richard Harris' death, but that's because Gambon is an EPIC FAILURE. (SPOILER) Once again, he showed the ""angry"" Dumbledore, which is non existent in the books, when he yelled at the students ""Get to bed!"" Dumbledore would NEVER say something like that! Alright, now onto the events... (SPOILER for the rest of the paragraph) I am so disappointed by the stuff they cut out. First, I must state that, obviously, I'm always disappointed by stuff cut out in the films. However, I could understand most of the stuff the previous films cut out. As for HBP, I have never been so appalled. I fail to see how burning down the Burrows helped ""advance"" the plot. It was an unnecessary addition, which the timing could have been used to better the non-existent climax. The ending was appalling as well. Why wasn't Snape angry when Harry called him COWARD! Instead of having so much romance, film makers should have focused more on the Half-Blood Prince. Have Hermione yell at Harry a bit more for using the Prince's book! And why is the invisible cloak non existent except for on the train in the entire movie! You need it for Deathly Hallows! Plus, Harry's character would have never stood by if Dumbledore's disarmed and Bellatrix and Greyback were in the same room! Speaking of Dumbledore, HOW THE HELL CAN HE APPARATE IN HOGWARTS! WHAT A LOAD OF BS! They didn't even explain Greyback as well! Plus, Tonks and Lupin's relationship were never explained so why did Tonks call him sweetheart! If you're going to leave Tonks and Lupin's relationship out, FINE! But don' have her do something random like that! Next, Harry and Ginny's kiss There's only one word to describe that. PATHETIC. Simply pathetic! Oh, and why was Harry's Quidditch captain position not explained?! Why was he lacking in leadership during tryouts! Harry always shows leadership! The DA for example! Why was Ginny standing by his side! She needs to try out as well! Oh, and the Horcruxes Remember that! Was that, what, only briefly mentioned?! How can they advance the plot in DH if Harry doesn't know SH** about the Hufflepuff cup, the Slytherin ring, etc.!!!! And Sirius's will!!! What the hell was the point of including bloody Kreacher, who had one line, in OOTP if he wasn't mentioned to be inherited by Harry. Sorry, that all of these events are not in chronological order. But back to Dumbledore Why am I not surprised that Dumbledore's death was not depressing? Oh hmm maybe because the actor who played Dumbledore said he wasn't sad when filming the scene!!! Fine, if you don't want to include the bloody funeral. But PLEASE, make the death sad!!! And since you didn't include nothing about Dumbledore's wand, please remember it in DH. And why didn't I hate Snape at all like I did after reading HBP! Another comment on the romance, Ron and Hermione's wasn't awkward enough. There just wasn't the right transition. And WHY did Lavender Brown sit at another table with other GRYFFINDORES in the Great Hall after her and Ron broke up? There four tables in the great hall and they are seated by the order of the four Houses! Why are there Gryffindores on two separate tables? What the heck? And Neville! Why did he only have one line! I would like to see less of that dimwit Lavender Brown! And how did Lupin know about Draco's mission?! Speaking of which, I finally have one good thing to say about the film. Tom Felton was amazing. They did Draco justice- although I would have hoped Sectumsempra (Sorry, if I didn't spell it correctly) was a little bit more dramatic. After all, it is of the Dark Arts. It would have been better if we could have seen gashes on Malfoy and blood spilling out as Harry waved his wand wildly like he was supposed to though the battle was not bad. But speaking of battles, taking out the ending battle was the worst idea Yates ever had.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince

Setup Harry Potter Seven.If you read the book and how Harry lost control of the Quiddich team to one player how do you expect Harry to be able to take on Voldermont? No problem. The movie ignored that!If you're ready for the big confrontation when Harry leaves his muggle house next year no problem since the movie ignored having that be setup!If you want to know the magnitude of the challenge that Harry has you have to have some sort of secret briefing since the movie ignored telling all the details.If you want to know that Dumbdorf had his actions planned because he knew he was going to die I must have fell asleep during the movie because I didn't remember it made clear.I can go on, but there are still some people who haven't seen the movie yet that there are going to be very disappointed.

I've been reading HP through 8 years, since I was 9... reading... analyzing... commenting... and with time I've learned that... when you go to watch the movie you have to separate the book of the big screen. Once you do that... you enjoy the movie respecting your idea of the book.Half Blood Prince is my favorite book of the saga... and when I entered the room I said ""you know what? I'm gonna enjoy it..."" and I freaking did. The movie is fast, without being a rush. Is hilarious and I love comedy, and shows a view of Harry, Ron and Hermione that any of the other movies had show. I was aware of the lack of some crucial scenes, as the funeral, the battle, the memories, so I was prepared for that and I could focus in what they put instead of what they threw away. Now, I have to say that they have to work hard in the plot of the horcruxes for the next movie because that was kind of blurry.I think that, compared to other films of the series... this follows the line of the book in a very good way, and the changes are clever. You can never have the same thing that happens on the book, but they knew how to adapt it. In this movie they did something that I liked very much that was introduce subtle advances of what will happen in the following chapters of the series. The actors, all of them, were brilliant and that was the motor of the movie I think.As a fan...

Also nothing was addressed about Dumbledore's blackened hand and the ring Horcrux.Also where was the major battle between the Order of the Phoenix, the teachers of Hogwarts and the Death Eaters.I felt that this was insulting to true Harry Potter fans and makes me wonder what liberties will be taken with The Deathly Hallows.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
879,dcunning-2,3 out 4 themes sacrificed for emphasis of 4th (teen romance/comedy),6,15 July 2009,"I enjoy the HP books immensely, but attempt to approach the movies from the understanding that they cannot be literal representations of the books. What should be included versus what should not boils down to whether it is important to: The main themes of the book and/or The mythology of the series as a whole. These things, in their order of importance, are:1. Insight into Voldemort's past in order to discover a way to defeat him. (What is a horcrux? What items did Voldemort select for his horcruxes & why did he select them?) 2. Harry & Dumbledore's relationship blossoming into a friendship 3. Harry's obsession with Malfoy & distrust/hatred of Snape 4. Teen romanceSomehow, the major themes and mythology (Items 1-3) were cut in favor of comedy and Twilight-like teen hormone material (Item 4). An example, instead of showing a brief clip of Ravenclaw's diadem when depositing the book in the Room of Requirement, we'll just have Ginny accompany Harry and give him a kiss. Another Harry: ""I can't believe Dumbledore's dead."" Hermione: ""Don't worry. Ron's OK with you and Ginny.""If you were 13 when the first book came out, then you were 21 when this book came out. And you are 25 now. The books got darker as the characters aged in accord with the audience. Why did the movie decide to skew so young?THE ASTONISHINGLY BAD:No discussion of what the suspected horcruxes are and why Voldemort chose them (i.e., 7 objects of tremendous personal or magical significance). Could have shown the diadem. Could have shown the memories concerning Voldemort's ancestry (his mother, his father, his murders, parselmouth, the ring, the locket) and provided the motivation for why the ring and the locket were selected as horcruxes. Why he selected the diary. Why he placed the locket where it was. That literally would have taken about 3 minutes of screen time post-Slughorn memory. Instead (and confusing), Dumbledore seems to not even be sure until the final memory that Horcruxes are in play. And he states that the trouble is that they could be anything. But yet he took care of some ring (could be random; no mention of its history). And he located the locket. Why? How? Instead of history or rationale because magic leaves traces we are told.Snape/Harry dynamic. Did anyone sense hatred between them? Harry just lets him walk right on by to kill Dumbledore. And Snape barely gets mad at the very end before stating that he is the half-blood prince. No class scenes. No showdown in the bathroom regarding the book. No overhearing the prophecy and Snape subsequently telling Voldemort the prophecy that killed HP's parents?!!No battle at the end. Why even show Draco mending the cabinet in order for the Death Eaters to get in if the Death Eaters do nothing but stand there on the tower and then walk right out?THE BAD: Harry is sent below instead of immobilized by Dumbledore under the cloak. His immobilization of Harry is what allowed Draco to disarm him. HP instead looks like a coward.Dumbledore/Harry dynamic. Their friendship should have been emphasized more. ""Did you forget to shave?"" Come on. No Dobby/Kreacher – OK for this movie, but how will that play in the finale? What was up with the blazing Burrough scene? No funeral?THE OK/UNDERSTANDABLE: Left out: Scrimgeour (PM & hounding of Harry), Lupin/Tonks melodrama, more Slugclub, OWL grades, Bella's doubt of SnapeTweaks: Substituting Bellatrix for book scenes with no-name or barely-named Death Eaters, lots of Draco&Snape scenes, more Luna, more emphasis on Slughorn's affection for Lily Potter (the fish story), showing what Malfoy was up to from his perspectiveTHE GOOD: Scenes, costumes, special effects, score. Acting was, for the most part, quite above average, though I have never warmed to Gambon's Dumbledore.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
880,shazaam8291,not what i expected,6,15 July 2009,"I had expected a bunch of magic, but what i saw was a bunch of relationships and making out. It seemed like half the movie was based on Ron and whatever her name is. Where is the action? Where is Hermione and Ron by harry's side? I'll admit, the beginning was awesome but once you reach the middle of the movie i was wondering what big event was coming up. It pretty much seemed like rising action the entire movie and then an abrupt ending.Yeah i get that in the next and final movie there is supposed to be a bunch of action but dude, seriously? don't spare the action in one movie.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
881,kassey-colton,What the hell was that??????,3,16 July 2009,"I can't begin to say how much of a huge fan I am of the whole HP series and I was so looking forward to this film. I went to see it the morning of it's release with 2 friends and we were all so disappointed with how the film had been adapted (more to the point NOT adapted from the book). Scenes that were never in the book were put in and very important scenes (so important the next film/films won't make sense) in the book were left out!!!!! The most important scene of all was the big fight at the end of the book. WHERE IS IT!! One of the key scenes to introduce important key characters for the last film/films and it was like it never existed. Also the random scenes they put in could have been left out as they weren't relevant or important. These could have been replaced with the final fight scene. The film was also extremely scattered, there was no flow it came across random and as if no-one was bothered to honour the book respectably. The only thing that saved this film was the acting, however, I felt the Lavender Brown character was played well but written like a love sick puppy. It's supposed to be a thriller not a chick flick!However I have to remember it could have be worse! It could have been directed by the guy who did the 3rd film and then we would all have been completely stuffed!",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
882,UndieGirl,Sonicly fun and entertaining... yet somewhat confusing?,8,16 July 2009,"I liked this film. I can see why people who are fans of the books (I am one too) might be annoyed with this film as it does take a few liberties with the plot. It misses a lot, and it would be interesting to know if people who aren't familiar with the books are completely confused by this movie. But then what it does, it does well: *Warning Spoilers Ahead* Harry's character is getting more depth, he's less of a good two shoes and more real. I am still not really believing his romance with Ginny, though Bonnie Wright was great. I just want to know what the hell was going in with his character at the start, riding around on trains and flirting with waitresses? Ron and Hermione's budding romance might annoy some, but as it is one of my favorite part of the books I loved it. It's awkward, sweet and it really manages to capture that strange and beautiful feel of teenage love. It might have been a bit obvious, but at least it didn't give away too much and it's still not right out in the open. Lavender is a bit over the top, but I think it works.Dumbledore is fantastic! Michael Gambon just pulls it out of the park and makes Dumbledore the approachable character we morn at the in the end. And cry I did, I would have liked to have seen the funeral, but I'm not sure if I could have coped with it... As a side note does anyone know what was up with everyone raising their wands at the end? It seemed a bit forced.Tom Felton's Draco Malfoy is quite possibly the best part of the whole film. The emotional change he has from cocky start to the terrified at the end is brilliant with the amount of time he had to do it. When he breaks down, well it upset me more then the ending.The journey with Dumbledore and Harry to the cave was great... I jumped right out of my seat when that hand came out of the water and I knew it was coming. Harry should have been immobilized at the end when Dumbledore was being attacked by Draco, because it is completely out of character for Harry to just stand there and let Dumbledore be attacked... especially if he was being attacked by Draco. But I guess they thought it would be too boring to have Harry frozen and invisible for the whole scene.All in all I enjoyed the film, it was funny, dark and entertaining. But there were a few things that really annoyed me: (Bare in mind this might just be my book fangirlness coming through) I didn't like the beginning. I liked the attacking the muggles bit, that was exciting and coolism with the effects. But they left out the first chapter, which is one of my favorite opening chapters in the books. The one with the muggle prime-minister. I know it's not really essential to the plot, but it works really well as a funny and witty catch up scene, which would help people to deal with the confusing plot that is to come. OK this one might just be me... and I would be willing to do with out it.What the hell was with the attack on the Burrow? I just don't understand where it fit into the plot. It comes out of nowhere and it leads to nothing. The only purpose I can see for it was that they needed something to break up Harry and Ginny's kiss. They obviously thought it had been too long without some kind of action. Which is cool, I get that it is a bit of an inward looking book (but if they can't deal with it in this one, how will they deal with the next). But how do the plan on starting the next movies, I guess they are going to leave out everything at the burrow and that's sad because I love a wedding. It was a silly and unnecessary waste of time that could have been used to flesh out the horcrux info.The last thing that really annoyed me was Tom Riddle himself. He was creepy, and when he was speaking to Slughorn I kept thinking; how do can you not see that this kid is evil. He like oozed evil! Anyone who has read the book will know that Tom Riddle aka Voldemort, was supposed to be handsome, charming and likable. In this film he was, there is no other word but scary.Most of the things I didn't like were problems not with the film making but with the translation from the book. So I think it's worth seeing and good fun.They are going to need two movies to fill in the plot holes left out of this movie, but I can't wait to see how they do it.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
883,hivenz1337,The worst movie... ever,1,16 July 2009,"I have to agree with every one who thinks this movie is the worst thing that happened in HP story.I really like the books and I was waiting for the 6th movie but I'm very disgusted by 'this', it's not a movie.Where is the real story ? I mean the good one and not this 'thing'. The end is horrific, no fight, no nothing, they walk calmly to leave the castle. The story about the horcruxes... where is it ? We just saw the first meeting with Tom Jedusor, what about the scenes showing he wanted to put his soul in good and powerful objects and not shoes box for instance? Where the hell are scenes between Ginny and Harry ? What the hell is this end with Ron, Hermione and Harry ? The fight in the fifth movie was great, the fight in the sixth should have been better... if it existed at least.Please, change the team for the 2 other movies, we want good movies which are as good as books (or a bit less good because it's hard to adapt a novel) and not this freaking thing who costs too much for what it is worth.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
884,rockstar369,Great attempt but not quite achieving what the film needs.,7,16 July 2009,"This film was directed well within its own choice of material but missed parts of the book which should have been included. Before I went to see the film I was on you-tube watching some of the interviews with some of the cast and other celebrities and I heard a comment from Graham Norton saying ""Why read the books, they make them into films! Why spend hours when you can watch them in two and a half hours... and it's in colour!"" This comment made me think whilst watching the film, i wonder how much of this you can really understand without reading the books because the films cut so much of the really important information out which is then difficult to grasp without the background knowledge. Unfortunately, we have become dependent on visual images now because of it being so easy and you don't have to put any effort into watching a screen. In the book of the Half Blood Prince there is a wonderful character, Fleur Delacour, who is marrying Bill Weasley. I can't understand why she should be cut from the film completely when she sparks such a range of emotions from the characters who meet her; the girls, Hermione, Ginny and Mrs Weasley find her unbelievably annoying and can't stand her yet in contrast Ron and Harry really like her which irritates Hermione and Ginny further. I just feel that she is an important part of the book and so she should have been cast in the film, especially when they have found Clemence Poesy who is cast perfectly for the role in the Goblet of Fire. When Dumbledore takes Harry to meet Horace Slughorn, the scene in which Dumbledore leaves Harry and Slughorn alone should be extended further as there are small passages of speech which are cut completely. However if the director had decided to put in a few seconds of speech then it may have made Slughorns decision to take a place at Hogwarts more understandable. The film shows it as Harry meets Slughorn and leaves, so Slughorn rejoins the school- just a tad abrupt. The film also cuts the fight involving Harry, Draco and Narcissa in Diagon Alley. This is a brilliant chapter in the book because it shows the reader just how big the divide between Potter and Malfoy is and even Draco's Mother Narcissa has a few insulting jabs at Harry which shows the hatred directed at Harry making him feel more alone. During the story Dumbledore shows Harry many of Riddle's memories to show Harry his life as a boy. The film shows Harry seeing one or two of Riddle's memories and doesn't at all explain why Dumbledore feels these are important for Harry to see. I understand that several scenes from the book will have to be omitted or the film would be several hours long. However, the director of a major film, which will hold many expectations from the book's fan-base. It raises the question whether there were any consultations with the author of the book or indeed whether such talks were ignored. Was the director simply handed a screenplay to work from? Certainly the director doesn't appear to have a grasp of the books depth. Without taking the book into account the film is excellent and very well produced with a decent set of special effects and very good at showing the characters feelings. However, anyone who has read the book is likely to be disappointed with the film as a portrayal of what J.K Rowling would have wanted. David Yates is a very good director and he has given the Potter films a new light which Alfonso Cuarón's cheesy take to the Prisoner of Azkaban would have never done. The first two films are very different from 4,5 and 6 but both sets are very good in their own way. The third sticks out as the least satisfactory even though it is enjoyable. The fourth, directed by Mike Newell, is well made but not as complete even David Yates manages to achieve in his two films and I look forward to seeing how the next book split into two further films are approached. I hope they demonstrate a more faithful realisation of the original stories.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
885,lesleyholody,"Good, even if different from the book",7,16 July 2009,"I had heard some relatively bad reviews of the movie before I went to see it, so I was sort of expecting to be disappointed. As an avid follower of all things Potter, I know the book very well and was anticipating that some elements wouldn't make it into the film. This has been true for all of the other movies in the series as well, so it wasn't a shock to me in this one. I was pleased to see the inclusion of some elements that I thought might go by the wayside, such as the Weasley brothers' joke shop, the brief romance between Ron and Lavender Brown (who, oddly, went unnamed in the film), and Ron's stint as Keeper of the Gryffindor house quidditch team. However, it was odd to see the scenes that appeared in the movie but not in the book. The incident at the Burrow, while certainly effective at instilling fear and urgency into the overall situation, was a complete invention of the film-makers. And some slight differences between the book and movie were puzzling to one who has read the books many times over. For example: why was it Luna Lovegood and not Tonks who discovered Harry on the Hogwarts Express? Silly, I know, but these things drive me nuts. I was also pleased to see that, even though this film takes place at a time when both the wizarding and muggle worlds are in nearly their darkest hours, there was still a fair amount of humor and light-heartedness. The entire ""Liquid Luck"" scene borders on hilarity, and Ron's encounter with a love potion had the whole theater guffawing. I think it was refreshing, too, to see Harry and Ron get to play some really funny moments - knowing what lies ahead in the series, I doubt we'll see much of that again, and these actors clearly have the chops to play comedy as well as drama. As for casting, the new professor on the block, Slughorn, was played very well by Jim Broadbent. Though Broadbent is a little less ""walrus-y"" than the Slughorn that Rowling describes in the book, he still played the character perfectly, a little unctuous, a little vain, a little absent-minded. Interesting to me was the choice of Helen McCrory (I recognized her as the top-shelf personal security maven Amanda from the NBC series Life) as Narcissa Malfoy, mother to Draco and wife to Lucius. She played her role here well, and she will get the chance to reprise that role in the final 2 films of the series. Though she was not styled the way I would have expected, she was still a good choice for the role, and I look forward to seeing her again. Speaking of style, what happened to Prof. McGonagall? Did they run out of magical makeup? And since when does she wear a set of robes reminiscent of an evil puffer fish? The film certainly had its head-scratcher moments, but overall was quite enjoyable. I would definitely recommend it to anyone, especially fellow Potter fans (who are going to see it anyway, regardless of reviews), but also to non-followers of the series. Unburdened by the knowledge of what the story holds for the future, the couple behind me in the theater speculated what the next 2 movies will contain while the credits were rolling. They didn't know what had been left out, and they can't wait to see how the story ends. Well, even though I know how the story ends, I still can't wait for the next movie to come out.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
886,wmiller-25,Garbage.,2,16 July 2009,"First of all, I have not read the Harry Potter books nor do I have any intention of doing so. I went to see this because my girlfriend loves the books, which means I had to. That said, I haven't had any problems enjoying or at least tolerating the previous movies. I even rather liked the first two, but this movie was trash. Absolutely trash.From my understanding, this book/movie is supposed to be the darkest of the series thus far (only surpassed by the seventh I assume). However, this is terribly executed throughout the majority of the film. Frankly put, nothing happened. The three main characters ran around having teen-aged romantic debacles, cracking jokes, and doing nothing. The movie audience laughed through the first two hours. IN THE DARKEST EDITION YET?!?! They didn't even try. I haven't read the books and could see that.While not wasting my time with totally overdone adolescent tomfoolery, the remainder of the movie is spent between a hodge podge of poorly explained plot building events (if you could call them that). Harry and Dumbledor trying to maneuver Horace into revealing a secret to them is sprinkled in just enough to be present without providing much plot line. Malfoy's sequences are repetitious (maybe they are in the book) and don't provide much insight into the evil forces of the movie, other than the fact that he's scared of whatever he's supposed to do. After the first hour and a half, I felt like nothing had happened and then suddenly D and H had to go someplace after Harry discovers the secret. The last thirty minutes should have been expanded into the entire movie.I had moderately low expectations which were terribly underachieved. Bottomline: waaaaaayyyy to much adolescent social networking. more wizards with intrigue or anything would have been nice.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
887,yahtzee10,"Great cinematography, consistency weak",5,16 July 2009,"My favorite part of the novel Harry Potter and the Halfblood Prince, which was probably my favorite novel in the series, was all of the subplots. We had the drama behind the Minister Magic and relations with the Muggle government. We had the quite humorous interactions between Dumbledore and the Dursleys. We had the whole memory of Voldemort's family - really quite crucial to the seventh book - and the memories of Voldemort finding the other Hogwarts founder items to use as Horcruxes. We had Bill and Fleur's relationship. We had Tonks's depression and patronus change, which led to Tonks and Remus's relationship. We had lots of interaction and conflict between Harry's house elves. We have Snape's constant suspicion of Harry. We have the complications with Madame Rosmerta. And we had so much in the end - Harry being trapped under the Invisibility Cloak during Dumbledore's death, an entire battle at Hogwarts, and Dumbledore's elaborate and meaningful funeral.All of that was completely and entirely omitted from the movie.What we do have is a weak plot involving an old Potions textbook that is featured about two times before Harry's friends convince him to do away with the book. Snape never punishes Harry, only reveals his identity in a brief scene at the end. The Order of the Phoenix is not mentioned at all throughout the entire movie, and neither is Grimmauld. We have a nearly sickening amount of teenage hormonal relationships - while some moments like harry comforting Hermione and Ron whispering Hermione's name in the hospital wing were well done, the growing relationship between Ginny and Harry was awkwardly portrayed. Additionally, they cut out the entire end scene - battle and all. One would think that a battle scene would attract even more moviegoers to the film, and the battle provided filmmakers a chance to show minor characters who weren't heavily featured. No, the movie ends with a weak scene showing the three main characters in a tower talking about next year. The same amount of foreshadowing could have been done within canon - Harry telling Ginny that they couldn't see each other anymore at Dumbeldore's funeral. But that certainly didn't happen.Oh, and do you remember the Burrow burning down? No? Well, it happens. It's a great scene, actually, very well done, but not remotely canon. The Burrow is integral to the plot of the seventh book. Let's see how they pull that one off.Actually, they seem to have been pretty obsessed with fire in this film. Hagrid's hut burns down as well.The cinematography, though, was excellent. One of my favorite scenes showed Harry walking up a staircase and Draco walking up a parallel staircase in the background. The lighting is effective, the various focus effects are absolutely magnificent, and the soundtrack, as always, is excellent. The film is a visual pleasure - perhaps lacking in action, but it is one of those films that one could watch several times extracting details from the masterful sets.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
888,lworrilow,Anti-climatic,5,16 July 2009,"Talk about a letdown, I just couldn't believe they left out the most important part of the book. Why did the death eaters even enter Hogwarts? They didn't do anything but watch and play around blowing some windows out when leaving. It was like the screen writers just forgot what this book was about and left the main part out. If they needed more time they could have left out scenes that were not even in the book like Harry and Ginny running through the talk grass in the burrow and the burning of the Weasley home. They could have saved at least 5 minutes there and I can think of many other things that were unnecessary. You would think they would query the fans before writing the final script. Where was J. K. during this process? I can't believe she would approve. I was very disappointed.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
889,kclynne,Poorly done...,4,16 July 2009,"I would have to agree. I feel that this movie was poorly done. Book 6 in the Harry Potter series is the first true acknowledgment that ""War"" has arrived. There was no indication of this in the film. There are scenes missing from the movie that are crucial to the development of other characters who become key in the battle between good and evil.As for the acting in this film, I would love to say that it was good. I would love to say how much these young stars, so full of potential, have grown and developed. I would love to say that the performances of the veterans were stellar. I can't say that. The interaction between the characters as portrayed by these amazing actors falls flat, is dull and is unemotional. There is very little natural reaction to each other and what is going on around them. It felt and looked like they were reading from a teleprompter, and I was greatly disappointed. Maggie Smith, Alan Rickman, Michael Gambon, actors of an immense caliber occupy this series, and they fail to impart any realistic emotion and interaction in this film. It is disappointing.I hope lengthening the time for book 7 by breaking it into 2 movies will allow the Writers, Director and Actors an opportunity to end this series on a strong note. Until then, this is a movie I will skip when I take my daughters and their friends to see it, and I have seen movies 3-5 at least twice in the theater.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince

Everything was beautifully composed and put together in the movie, and as all ways the killing curse was amazing. Second of all, I've read the books and I understand that they left quite a bit out, but honestly, this is really just build up for the 7th book, the only big thing that happened in this book was that Dumbledore dies and the horcruxes are discovered. Lets face it, no matter how good they tried to make this movie, the 7th movies will blow it away, there's so much more in the 7th book and thats why they are making two parts to it.

All I have to say is that Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince was good movie. We have to remember a few things here. First the movie was an interpretation of the story. Is it like the book? Yes. However there are some that think that the movie lacks certain parts. This is true it does lack certain parts, one of these parts are the big battle at the end, the funeral and other parts as well.Having said this I can see considerable attention to the details that were in the movie. We have to also remember the length of the movie is over 2:30. We cannot expect every detail of the book in the movie. We also cannot expect it to be like the book in every way.This movie is an interpretation from how the director saw it. It does not take away from the books vision or plot. It just adds a visual reference.So in conclusion although not perfect the movie does capture the same spirit as the book did. Let's see the movie as it is, an interpretation and not a replica of the book. Maybe we will all enjoy it better in the end.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
892,dhruminn,are you freaking kidding me????,2,16 July 2009,"This is one of the biggest s***iest movies i've seen and one of the worst book adaptations ever...If you are a harry potter fan and have read all the books, then i'll assure you that u'll loathe this film for several reasons of which these are a selected few...1). They left some major parts of the book like revealing that snape was the 1 who told the prophesy to Voldemort or the fight at hogwarts wbich is the major part of the book...u'll be surprised to find out that there is no freaking fight!!! 2). Dumbledore's death looks like it was copied from a c-grade movie...and there was no funeral which was largely explained in the book..3)When the hell was burrow destroyed??..4)Finally the characters..Dumbledore is seen as a dumb fool rather than the powerful mentor of Harry as shown in the book, there is no major role of Snape in the movie nor is there a place for Hagrid...The only positive part is the acting of the main cast who held their own in this poorly directed film..A MAJOR Disappointment!!!",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
893,showchoirnerd23,"Great movie, despite obvious plot changes",7,16 July 2009,"I am an avid Harry Potter fan, both of the books and movies. Obviously, a lot of Potter fans have been disappointed with this movie. However, they need to give David Yates & co a break. Although I was extremely disappointed that they cut out the big battle scene at the end of the book, which really wouldn't have added much more time and was one of the best parts of the book, Yates obviously couldn't have possibly put every single detail in the film without it being unbearably long. I do agree that the burning of the Burrow was unnecessary, although the short battle scene with Fenrir and Bellatrix was pretty cool, and the entire movie's plot line was changed from Voldemort to Teen Love Soap Opera. The amount of time they spent portraying the different love triangles could have been used explaining Tom Riddle's life and the Horcruxes. This felt like a ""Half Blood Prince Part I""; they will have a LOT of explaining to do in Deathly Hallows Parts I&II. Bill and Fleur's relationship was completely cut out, a lot of important Tom Riddle memory scenes were omitted, and the reveal of the ""Half Blood Prince"" felt like an afterthought. Severus Snape quickly said ""Oh, I'm the Half Blood Prince"" and then walked away. Dumbledore's death was rushed, and nothing really seemed to happen afterward, unlike Sirius' death in Order of the Pheonix. His funeral was not included, but I'm sure it will be in Deathly Hallows Part I. All that being said, I still think it was a great movie. The Tom Riddle scenes that were included felt dark and eerie, and correctly portrayed the beginning of his alter ego, Voldemort. Tom Felton did an incredible job as Draco, the audience could feel his fear of completing the task Voldemort assigned to him and the fact that old Voldy would kill his family if he did not complete it. He was no longer just this high school bully character who wanted to make Harry's life difficult; we saw more depth and emotion from him. Lavender Brown was just as obnoxious and overbearing as I expected her to be, and the scene in the train where she draws a heart on the window was equal parts creepy and hilarious. Overall, I felt the movie somewhat explained the true plot, but not nearly as much as it should have. Yates could have made an incredible battle scene at the end, and missed a huge opportunity by cutting it out. It was a valiant effort, and I did enjoy the movie. This was the first midnight showing I have attended, and I still believe it was worth the waiting and the cost.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
894,gamingirl51,What were they thinking????????????????,6,16 July 2009,"I took my grandsons to see the movie last night. I have read the series several times and was anticipating this installment with relish. This was, in my opinion, the richest, most informative chapter of the saga and explained so much.What I received was a smattering of the great story with special effects that distracted from what was given. Unless you've read the book, you have no idea what was happening in the opening scene. The story of Tom Riddle's ancestry is crucial to the understanding of the whole story yet NOTHING was included in the film. The horcruxes are vital yet they are minimized. Did anyone realize that the scene in the cornfield where Ginny was accosted by the hulking man was the introduction of the vampire Fenrir Greyback who plays a role in the final chapter.Much was made of the romance and that, like so many other points, was painted in such broad strokes that the viewer could not get a feel for it. WHERE DID THE BURROW GETTING BURNED DOWN COME FROM? Does this mean that there will be no wedding for Bill and Fleur in the final film? Dumbledore's death was glossed over, presumably to expedite it. The battle that occurred during that period could have helped to whet appetites for what is to come. Harry, Ron and Hermione standing on the turret and admiring the scenery was NOT a fitting ending. Why not end it with the funeral of the man who helped to shape the boy? Why minimize his loss? I have to wonder whether JK Rowling has lost interest in these projects to allow her work to be so trivialized.This movie was such a let down that I'm not sure if I want to see any more. I wanted to cry at the end but not because I felt anything while watching it. I wanted to cry over the desecration of a fine story that has not been done the justice it deserved.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
895,qqandanan,Something was missing!,5,16 July 2009,"I was looking forward to the battle at Hogwarts towards the end of the movie and when it didn't happen. It had such an anti-climax effect on me. I left the cinema feeling lost! The director obviously had done a great injustice to the book by adding new events (like the burning of the Burrow) while omitting others (the climatic battle at Hogwarts, Voldemort's family history, more details on the Horcruxes etc). I mean, why can't they just stick to the book?! By changing events, they now have to film other made-up events to fill in the gaps in the final 2-part movies.A huge disappointment!",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
896,kateharrison-1,Harry Potter and the.... love triangle?,7,16 July 2009,"Being a huge Harry Potter fan I was looking forward to seeing the 6th film as all the others had been brilliant. I have been impressed with the close relationship of the books and the films in the majority of the series. However it feels that the Half-Blood Prince was the least similar- hardly focusing at all on the main story line, missing key events out such as some of Harry's lessons with Dumbledore including the explanation for why the locket horcrux was hidden in the cave etc. It seems that a lot was either completely missed out or changed, which will to me possibly cause confusion during the next parts of the story line. However I can't deny that the film was brilliant in it's own way, all actors have matured greatly in skills, Rupert Grint was excellent in the HBP. However different it was to the book. The character relationships were built on using plenty of humour, this got the whole audience laughing, especially when Harry had taken liquid luck. However I feel a little too much time was spent on the romance other than the major plot. I feel that someone who had not read the books would greatly enjoy the film, however it is quite a let down compared to the book. I would highly recommend the film as it has some great moments in and truly is magic on the whole",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
897,hocking5,All is not as it seems in the best yet Harry Potter film,9,17 July 2009,"In Harry Potter and the Half Blood-Prince, Director David Yates' talent shines through the dark, deep, and emotional atmosphere to strike up a sure-fire blockbuster that will have the audience both rolling with laughter, and gripping the edge of their seat. With another increasingly stellar performance from the main cast (Danielle Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, and Emma Watson) who like wine, get better with age, Yates puts together a cast and set nothing short of genius. As huge Harry Potter fans go, they are notoriously critical of the movies, but this 6th installment will have them immensely satisfied at how true it stays to the book. Each character is perfectly unique for their role, including majors Michael Gambon as Albus Dumbledore, Alan Rickman as Severus Snape, and young Tom Felton as Dracy Malfoy, conveying nothing less than the defiant wisdom, sinister evil, and the longing for vindication, respectively, that makes J.K so brilliant. Although the plot has turned more complex, and the dark forces Harry (""The Chosen One"") and co. are up against are ever-present, the comic relief we get from the relationship of Ron Weasley and Lavender Brown and the raging hormones of Hogwarts students are consistent and hilarious. Although critics may say Yates has glossed over some details from the book, and may make one joke happen too many times, these minor flaws cannot stop this from being (for lack of better words), a truly magical film. Die-hard Harry Potter fans, all the way down to non- believers will be clamoring for the final two films being made into the final book, Deathly Hallows. How will Harry possibly confront his biggest enemy, when he loses possibly his most valuable asset, and even allies are turning evil? But then again, All is not as it seems.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
898,bejing1207,this movie sucked,1,16 July 2009,"I am a pretty big Harry Potter fan and i have for the most part enjoyed the first five movies, but the sixth installment is terrible. I think people who don't read the books and don't look forward to key moments and exciting battles probably enjoy the movie. I on the other hand was ready to get out of the movie theater when it ended it was the worst movie by far! The combination of plot differences between the book and the movie and the drug out romance scenes i was ready to scream. i thought for sure that this movie would be the best one yet due to the exciting story line in the book.In my opinion David YATES SHOULD BE FIRED!! he has messed up two movies already why give him another go? He was the only failure on the team because the acting special effects and filming are amazing! i don't understand how you mess up when you are given a book that good to turn into a movie",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince

Rowling sold her soul when she sold the rights to the movie. If she loved the characters she created as much as she claimed then she would not have sold out to the Hollywood machine. Did she sell her backbone along with the rights too? Did she sell any ability to speak up for her beloved story that made her the very rich woman she is today? For those of us that fell in love with Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone many years ago it is a sad day to see the butchering of such a delightful story. I would not even give this movie 1 star. I am so disgusted with the movie that I refuse to go see the Deathly Hallows when it comes out and my eyes will never again look upon the Half Blood Prince. I shall be content to read and reread the stories and play that movie out in my imagination. Shame on you Steven Kloves, screenwriter and you David Yates, Director, but most of all you J.K.

900,nen_girith,What can I say......,2,17 July 2009,".....it just was really really bad! I love the Harry Potter series and I was really looking forward to see this movie. During the movie I laughed and the dead water-people gave me a good scare, but at the end of the movie I was beginning to wonder what the movie was about...The whole story just didn't make sense. It was like watching a teenage romance/comedy! It looked like they made a bunch of video-clips, taped them all together and called it a movie. The actors are good, the special effects were good, camera-work was good.....but the storytelling was just really crappy! All kinds of different plot lines, and none of them is told well. Important plot lines and scenes from the book are missing which makes the movie like a unfinished whole. Where is the tension? It all happens so fast, that it isn't exciting at all. And what on earth happened to the fight in the castle at the end of the book?? It's just tragic! It looks like the director chose all the wrong plot lines out of the book and focused only on the romance between the main characters. Such a shame. This could have been e very exciting movie with lots of suspense....",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince

I wouldn't be a true Potterphile unless I had a few nitpicks where the film deviates from the book, but take a tip from Jo Rowling and understand that the books and the films are two different products and don't expect a word-for-word, scene-by-scene repetition onto the screen.HBP was the weakest book in the series because it's not really a ""stand-alone"", it's a set-up for the grand finale.Just enjoy, folks!",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince

Was far way more exciting on the book. things that was not in the book was on the movie.Simple deception I m thinking in not watch the last 2 movies (last book) just for not get deception again, and lost the pleasure of movies based on books.This is mine Commet about the movie.Howww JK ROWLING let that happens??",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
903,mehulbansal90,A not so intriguing Potter,6,17 July 2009,"I Solemnly swear that i am up to no good....The most awaited movie for me this year that is Half blood prince really disappointed by the standard it had set from it's trailers and from what actually was pictured. The movie had nothing new than what was shown in the trailers. The action seen in the trailers were everything which were in the movie rather than anything extra. The backbone of movie that is it's background score was not so professionally considered this time. The music at the main events like Dumbeldore being killed or Snape sending the killing curse didn't had any sort of excitement. Sectumscempra was so easily shown rather than any kind of duel which would have increased the level of curiosity.The casting was something to appreciate. The character of Lavender brown, Romilda vane along with all the girlish girls was very beautifully casted. Just a complaint was felt that The Hogwarts Voldemort could have been shown more smarter and at least as smart as in the IInd part. The screenplay was written as if just to let the viewers remember and catch up with the book. The dialogs were specially made to resemble the actual book dialogs along with some modifications in the plot so as to reduce the characters and maybe locations like Evanna lynch (Luna Lovegood) played the role what Tonks had to play maybe just to reduce the load of taking harry from Hogsmead to the castle. The Felix Felicis portion of movie could have been made more sentimental rather than a comic one. The character of Slughorn was deliberately made comic just to ease up the intense situations of the movie which never really got intense. The part of screenplay could have been worked harder, so as to expose characters and situations more convincingly. Emma Watson, Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint deserve a pat for their superb work. Emma played her role to convey the feelings for Rupert brilliantly and also Rupert with Jessie cave(Lavender brown). The acting part was not compromised and everyone pulled out the best of what they could. The VFX of the movie was something to cheer about for the viewers. The cave portion along with the storytelling while dealing with the memories.In all not the best of the harry potter this time. Maybe David needs to rethink about the faults he committed in it and try to produce something more better for the one's who have read Hp-7 a lot many times.Mischiefs Managed.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
904,snowcrazy25,Disappointment to Readers of HBP,4,17 July 2009,"I saw Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince on a Thursday afternoon. After watching the film, I'm glad I did not attend a midnight showing, for I would have had to bear witness to the stunned reactions of fans to what should have been a thoroughly absorbing film.Instead, I found myself wondering exactly where the magic of Book 6 had disappeared to. Of course, time constraints made it impossible to include every little detail from the books, but no judgment was shown regarding what details were excluded in HBP. Where is the mention of various Hogwarts founders' items that eventually become Horcruxes, or of Harry owning Sirius' home after he dies, or of Fleur and Bill's relationship, or of the battle at Hogwarts, or of countless other integral plot points? The plot points the director has chosen to play up are lackluster---are we supposed to take the sham portrayed on-screen as the true extent of Harry and Ginny's relationship? A kiss in the Room of Requirement and then it sputters out? Honestly, what book 6 of the Harry Potter series is about is a quest. It's a long lead-up through various memories of Voldemort until finally Dumbledore entreats Harry to journey with him to find a Horcrux. It's about entering the mind of Voldemort, not mindless love triangles and added scenes of the Burrow burning or of Harry at a train station with a pretty woman. It's not Dumbledore getting all chummy with Harry and telling him he needs a shave or wondering if his friendship with Hermione is more than a friendship (and let's face it, the Dumbledore of the books would know the answer to this question without needing to ask). The events of Book 6 are an integral set-up to those of book 7, and after watching this butchered movie I wonder how on earth they are going to pull off making two movies out of a book whose events they will never properly be able to explain.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince

So I looked at the comments posted and I thought, ""Man, some of these people really hate this movie, what complainers!"" But I went to see it anyway. And you know something, those complainers are all right! The worst installment of the HP movie series so far (and I thought OOTP was bad). It turned a truly amazing book into some sort of Twilight remake, but with a different story line! The comments that rate this movie TEN STARS have obviously never read the books. If I didn't love the HP series so much, I probably wouldn't even see the seventh movie. But I love the books so much, I feel compelled to go see and own all of the movies.

906,g-nirujan,No more a kids movie,9,18 July 2009,"The people who haven't read the book might have a hard time understanding the plot. This movie has less magic and action compared to the previous movies, so people who are expecting to see action and magic will surely be disappointed. Half blood prince is my most favorite book in the series, the movie had covered many parts of the book but has failed to explain it well which makes it difficult to understand for a non reader. The movie was too serious unlike the previous movies which were like kids entertainer. The acting of all the cast was excellent, specially Slughorn he was just like how i imagined him in the book. Even Dumbledore was portrayed how he really should be (matured and calm) unlike how he was in the 4th movie (very overactive and jumpy). The acting has seriously improved. Some of the things which wasn't there in the book was added, they could have removed it and added thing which were in the book, for instance the climax fight in the book was something i was looking forward, but was disappointed. At times when you feel bored the comedy brigs you back to the movie. When it comes to the romance the romance between Harry and Ginny was too sudden and something was missing. But i believe the movie would have been more fun if John Williams had composed the background score instead of Hooper, his soundtracks were good but it wasn't there when the movie needed it. My favorite movie in the series would be the 3rd one, it too had most of the book covered and also the plots were clear unlike here and the background score, action, magic all were in right proposition. In half blood prince some things were at their best and some very poor. Overall this is up to now the best movie of the year but wasn't good enough. My personal rating: Acting -- 10 Cinematography -- 10 Direction --- 7 Adaptation of book -- 5 Background score -- 5",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
907,beerchicka,Nothing at all like the book.,1,17 July 2009,"This movie was not at all like the book. The only similarities were the characters, a couple scenes in the movie, and the name. The director completely cut out everything that the books created. I literally stopped caring about the movie about ten minutes into it.The most important thing that viewers need to know about Harry Potter is that he is humble. Harry Potter would rather see the joy of others over his own. So when he tells Hermione that it's OK that Romilda Vane just likes him because ""he is the chosen one"", it strays completely from what his character is actually like.The fact that the director plays it out like Dumbledore had no idea that Tom Riddle had any horcruxes before he saw the memory is totally wrong. That completely changes his character as well. Dumbledore is supposed to be the man with all the answers, as they show in the seventh book. He knew from the beginning almost everything that was supposed to happen, and that is how he ultimately destroyed Voldemort. Also, it makes no sense that he has no idea, because he already had the ring and destroyed it.Another huge mistake was that he did not mention at all what the other horcruxes might be, and he did not mention that they are artifacts of the original houses. Harry should have no idea what to do now.There are far too many mistakes to point out, so I will restrain myself for now.I would have to say that my favorite scene in the entire movie would have to be at the end when they show the Great Hall completely trashed by Bellatrix. I do not like this because it is supposed to be a highly emotional scene that shows how bad off everyone is; I like this scene because it shows Gryffindor is ahead in points(even though the Death Eaters were supposed to have broken the Gryffindor hourglass as they left).After this movie, I'm not even sure if I'll go to see the seventh movie, because there is no way that it will do justice to the book.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
908,kushnir_l75,They did it again.,1,17 July 2009,"The 5 movie was bad enough to fire David Yates and to beg Alfonso Cuaron to come back. It was dull and sometimes really stupid but at least it was a movie about Harry Potter we know from Rowling books and about events which are in HP books. The Half-Blood Prince is not only a cinematographic failure but also is a complete disaster as screen version of the book. The book is simply destroyed. It's some sort of ""American Pie"" with characters named Harry, Ron, Draco etc. It's a piece of fanfiction written by Stephen Cloves and directed by David Yates. Being a huge Harry Potter fan I feel myself insulted by this movie. It seems Worner Brothers decided to make movie so idiotic to test people: is audience still want to see it and will they go to our next violation of HP? I wonder what's next. May be the next movie will be about Harry-Hermione-Ron's menage de trois during their lovely camping when they will be trying to find horcruxes? Of course, if Cloves and Yates would decided to leave such things as horcruxes in their next big thing. May be not. May be it's better just to let characters talk about how Ron is OK with Harry seeing Jinny. Because that is really important things and screw the rest. Bravo to mister Cloves, mister Yates and to whole Warner bros. You've managed to done something Lord Voldemort hasn't. You've killed Harry Potter.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince

Much of this film has dumble flying off with harry but when it really matters, he can't fly off?Harry and the 1/2 Blood seems to flip us the bird at the end and say, come back next year, suckers.

910,nickthegent,Worst of the lot!!!,2,17 July 2009,"This movie was terrible. I expected something much better from all the wonderful critics who must have been paid to create their praise of this film. I should have realized something was wrong when on opening day there were 12 showings of this film at my theater and the next day the showings were cut by half. Let's get to the movie itself. The book is huge and it looks like the director took enough scenes from the book to put together this snoozer. Unfortunately, the parts he took at times make no sense whatsoever without an explanation or reading the book. There was a sense to the movie that you should read the book first to understand what is going on in the movie. Even having seen all the previous Harry Potter movies does not help you to understand what is going on. Scenes begin and then they end without anything being accomplished. As for the plot it is fairly simple once you determine what it is but to get there you must plod along with a movie almost totally bereft of any action. And just to put a cherry on top at the very end the half-blood prince is revealed. Wow, this revelation has all the effect of a balloon slowly losing air. You will be saying to yourself, now what does this have to do with the plot? My suggestion? Read the book if you actually want to waste your money on this 2 hour mess.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
911,campos_amy,Half-Blood What?,4,17 July 2009,"I think the previous commenters have already covered everything that was omitted from this film. If you have read the books, at least you had some frame of reference for the action that was happening, but I pity anyone who was only vaguely familiar with the series because they would have been left totally clueless as to the reasons behind the action. Hello - the book is called Harry Potter and the HALF-BLOOD PRINCE. When did the ""half-blood Prince"" part become secondary to the plot? About ten minutes from the end of the film we have Snape saying ""oh, by the way, those are my spells and i'm the half-blood prince"" - the end? The book itself, which plays such an important part in the story, makes a short appearance before it is tossed away - much like other important plot points (Slytherin's ring?) and creates tension between Harry and his friends and also with Snape (with funny results).How hard would it have been to eliminate some of the Michael Bayesque effects like the bridge snapping and the totally unnecessary scene in which Ron's house is burned down (WTF???) and replace that time with meaningful scenes from the book. This would also have added some continuity in the story and left time to include the battle at the end. Because I'm sure the death eaters would have just kicked some tableware around and broken a window. Much more impactful than the actual story.This film was made to appeal to the lowest common denominator of ADD afflicted, CG-obsessed moviegoers who probably don't have the attention span or intelligence to read an entire novel. Obviously the director didn't bother to brush up on the story. It's too bad the fans of this series have to walk away disappointed when this could so easily have been the best film yet. Hopefully DH will live up to the final novel.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
912,theomega1-1,Disappointed,3,17 July 2009,"I was sorely disappointed in this movie not because it wasn't faithful to the book but because it felt like they just threw things in with the aim of a shot gun. Liked:The altered beginning, friendly discussions regarding the awkwardness of love, Luna's head dress(serious kudos to the designer) most of the cave action, music for Dumbledore and credits.HATED:The timing on the music was TERRIBLE!!! Music can make a good film amazing but cutting out music or when its done wrong(as in this case) it can make a climactic scene dead. Seriously; Snape say his important bit, turns walks away and THEN you started the dramatic music???Enemies take secret route into castle, kill a person, make LOTS of noise blowing stuff up and then take a different route home for some unknown reason, facing no resistance at all(except harry).I also hate how they are setting the final movie up with no real lead up or foreshadowing. :(Overall:So overall this felt like the worst of the series thus far. I can only hope that Yates does a better job with the two remaining films(especially the music)",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
913,mohrbeckh,You're kidding right? Worst 1 yet.,1,17 July 2009,"This was supposed to be the movie of all Harry Potter movies before the finale. Instead, they chose to completely leave behind every detail of the book and turn it into Twilight for Potter fans. What a disappointment.As far as I'm concerned, these filmmakers are finally in it for purely the money, because they didn't follow the book at all. This movie ell so short of the book... I don't even know how they can rekindle it for the final movie. I hope when this is released on DVD they add an hour of extras to it and actually get back on track.The other movies rarely missed the major details. They only ever left out small dramatics. This movie glorified all the little worthless nonsense that could honestly have been left out. Instead it was the focus for the entire 2 and a half hours. I'm not sure how this even passed the critics before the release. It makes me sick.You left out the BATTLE! WTF You left out every damn important thing, with the exception of the horcrux. Of course, why bother even putting that in? And what happened to the supporting actors? Did the budget shrink? You saw about 1.5 mins of Neville. 3 mins of Fred and George.Seriously disappointing. Pathetic.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
914,mWaz1,What happened to the end? Did they just run out of money or something?,7,17 July 2009,"I thought that this was possibly the best of the movies so far. I did not like that they cut out/ downplayed many of the minor characters ,such as Neville and Seamus Finnegan who only appeared a few times in the film and Percy and Bill Weasley and Fleur who didn't appear at all. Also, after the point that Harry and Dumbledore leave to find the horcrux the plot COMPLETELY diverts away from the book and does nothing but disappoint. Not to mention the ENTIRE final battle at Hogwarts which was my favorite part of the book, and didn't show the fighting skills of pretty much everyone. However, the mood in this film was the lightest since ,possibly, the first one, and was overall good.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
915,lgerman55,"""Blameless""",1,17 July 2009,"The sixth film of Harry Potter story was damaged by stage director, who added too much from himself to the Harry Potter story from read books. There were so much unnecessary details and scenes (ex: Wisley house burning,etc.). I wonder where are battles between good and bad in the end of the film? Because I think that it is preposterous that death eaters didn't catch Harry to take him to Volandemort when Harry was pursuing Snape alone!!! The romantic story of Harry and Jinny relationship was awful.Harry made the first step, not Jinny was showing her evident sweetheart!! Such scene as lacing Harry's shoes was impossible!What does it mean? Is it how Englishmen show their love? I want to admit excellent play of Rupert Grint and Tom Felton, the best actors from all young actors from the cast. Big number of stage director's gag has ruined all impression from the movie!And IT IS NOT A ROMANTIC COMEDY!!!Harry is sad because his godfather died, the whole magic world is afraid because Volandemort is back, and after all Dambledor dies what makes it even more sadder!! Therefore, I won't lean on a broken reed, 7th film of Harry Potter..",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
916,miss-pinkalot,Would be more enjoyable if you're not a purist - sadly for me,7,17 July 2009,"The first scene I was dissatisfied with was Horace Slughorn's appearance.Dumbledore had brought Harry to meet Slughorn (never mind the fact that he's thinner than Dumbledore and doesn't resemble a walrus at all), to convince Slughorn to return to Hogwarts.Dumbledore knew for a fact that Harry was one of his most loyal supporters, if not the most. Harry, without even knowing why Dumbledore had brought him there, managed to sway Slughorn.In the book, Harry tells Slughorn, with no motive other than because Harry fiercely believes in it, if indeed Slughorn was afraid of being harassed by Voldemort and his Death Eaters, then Slughorn should feel safest at Hogwarts while Dumbledore is Headmaster since Dumbledore was the only wizard Voldemort ever feared.What transpired in the movie, though, was only to portray Slughorn's ""collector"" side. Who would try to collect Harry as The Chosen One.Now this might not be so flawed, if this book wasn't trying to emphasise and highlight Harry's loyalty to Dumbledore.Harry has to be shown as being so loyal and supportive, almost like a dog, because that's exactly what is required of Harry in The Cave. Harry is supposed to trust Dumbledore fully, so that he can do whatever Dumbledore tells him, even if it is against Harry's very conscience.The most contradicting straying from the book was the chapter of Draco's Detour. Now, in the scene right before this, we see Narcissa Black begging Snape to protect and aid her son Draco in his seemingly impossible mission.Narcissa is desperate for Draco not to be harmed, to be left out of the task completely, even. She would, in fact, do anything for Draco not to be a Death Eater.That Narcissa disapproves, even condemns Draco's involvement as a Death Eater, is precisely why the chapter in the book is Draco's Detour, not Draco & His Mummy's Detour.In the book, Draco himself warns Mr. Borgin from Borgin & Burke not to breathe a word of Draco's visit to the store, ""not even to my mum"". It makes perfect sense, because he knows his mother is worried sick.Therefore, it is unlikely that Narcissa would tag along and assist him in Borgin and Burke - especially after all that hassle of making an Unbreakable Vow to ensure that Draco stays out of harm's way.I also wasn't satisfied with the first Potions lesson. The introduction to Felix Felicis wasn't dramatic enough - it was supposed to be ""the colour of molten gold, large drops leaping like goldfish above the surface"" - hardly what it looked like in the movie, which I remember was a clear liquid? In fact, I think they could've done a lot more imagery in the movie. Descriptions of objects were not fulfilled as best they could be.Speaking of which, Dumbledore's hand also hardly looked like it was dead and shrivelled! It was more like a black powdery substance had been rubbed onto it, instead of having been cursed with no antidote.The one thing that perplexes me till now is that there is a scene of Bellatrix and Fenrir Greyback harassing Harry and the Weasleys and burning down The Burrow during Christmas. That was a splendid display of effects - and nothing else! It never took place in Half-Blood Prince, nor in any of the books, and there was absolutely no point to it.It might be something the director wants to link to as a continuity in the seventh movie, but I highly doubt it.Now that I'm done with the criticism, I must say there were indeed some moments of pure enjoyment.My favourite scene has got to be Ron Weasley's crazy love/infatuation/obsession with Romilda Vane after having consumed her love potion meant for Harry. Ron's change in expressions, from vacant gaze to frustration at Harry's incredulity, his exclamation of ""oh, the moon!"" - everything was pure win! I laughed soundlessly for at least 2 whole minutes trying to catch my breath. I would so buy the DVD just to be able to watch that scene on replay countless times! I liked both Tom Riddle memories. Dumbledore's first encounter with the boy Tom Riddle left little more to be desired, it was quite explicit how cold and cruel Voldemort was even as a boy. Slughorn's memory also showcased the extent of Tom's manipulation and sucking-up to get the answers he wanted.This movie incorporated yet more dark elements. The scene in which Katie Bell had touched the cursed necklace and was being flung about in the air, that was horrifying.The Inferi in The Cave, ewww! I'd braced myself for it, and yet I still managed to be freaked out by them. Dumbledore's rising up to the occasion and creating that fire to protect himself and Harry was incredible, that was very nice effects, and thoroughly convincing.The most amazing thing was Dumbledore's death - I teared! I didn't tear while reading the book. I think the scene was very sentimental, with the Hogwarts population lighting up their wands to show respect. Extremely moving.The scene where Snape and the other Death Eaters are fleeing after Dumbledore's death, Harry tries to hex Snape. Snape deflects it but does not retaliate, saying to the others that ""Harry belongs to the Dark Lord"".Harry is thus further incensed, calling Snape ""coward"" and telling him to ""fight back"" - in this moment, you can see the internal struggle in Snape's eyes; he is not a bad guy and wants to help Harry, but he has to maintain his part for the Death Eaters' benefit. I found that quite convincing.I enjoyed the later part of the movie much more than I did at the start.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
917,lamisarawan,Disappointing,1,18 July 2009,"I was so disappointed by this movie. It cut out a great many important scenes and included insignificant things such as the teenage romance and angst. Where was the battle that was at the end of book? That was the most exciting part of book 6. It was cut to include a part where the Death Eaters burn down the Burrow. That was NOT in the book. What was the point of that? Most of the parts where Harry learns about Voldemort's past life are cut. The Pensieve trips are cut short and the horcruxes are not explained properly. And why does Harry act like a stupid coward hiding under a floorboard while Snape kills Dumbledore? He was supposed to be immobolised under the invisibility cloak!!!!!! This movie was lacking in action and suspense but overflowing with teenage drama that was not central to the plot of the story. As an adaptation of the book it sucked, big time.Though I must say, the actors' acting have matured and improved a great deal. Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, Emma Watson and Tom Felton have all played their parts well. That is the only redeeming quality in this horrendous film.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
918,eshchar,hp and the half-blood prince genre: romantic comedy,2,18 July 2009,"first i want to write that i registered to IMDb only so i could comment on this film...i'v never seen such a disappointing film before. the director took out ALL the important parts of the book and left us with only the insignificant touchy romance...seriously the entire room was laughing every 5 seconds of the first half (by the second everybody was asleep)...nothing happened. we learned nothing about Tom Riddles history and the horocruxes (wasn't that the whole point of the story), important characters were missing (bill, fleur, charlie, dobby, kreacher, etc) and what was the whole part of the vanishing cabinet...the came into hogwarts and got out, no huge fights seen at the end which would have saved the entire movie had it been there.however, the director did not hesitate to keep every scene which involved won-won and lavender making out, or hermione being SO obvious about her feelings for Ron. they should re-shoot this film, if WB know whats good for them",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
919,ikklejaneo,Sorry to disagree but this is one of the best Harry Potter films,8,18 July 2009,"OK, I've read all the comments on here and I'm aware I'm going against majority opinion here, in fact I read them all before I went to see the film last night and was therefore expecting the worst. But I was pleasantly surprised, I really thought for the most part they did an excellent job with this book and in fact I would say it's one of my favourite films. As everyone else has mentioned the acting was absolutely superb, the special effects, direction etc were all top notch. It seems what everyone has a problem with is the plot. I have read all seven books several times, and reread them just recently in anticipation of this film coming out. This is a tough book to adapt, really nothing much happens in terms of action or plot. It's predominantly background that is setting up the events of the final book and exploring the relationships of the main characters. For those who complain the film is focused too much on the romance and not enough on the story, reread the book, apart from the memories which don't translate well into a film and would bore everyone to death, and Dumbledore's death, the relationships are a HUGE part of the book! I think they did a fantastic job with it, the characters are all perfect, just how I imagined, particularly Lavendar who is just cringe-worthy. I thought in this respect they did a brilliant job. Dumbledore's death is also good, I disagree that they should have included his funeral, I though the way they did it was very good, very emotional, they didn't need the funeral in there. I also thought the cave scene in the movie was actually better than the book. Michael Gambon as Dumbledore was better than in any of the other films, much more like Dumbledore than the angry old man he comes across as in the other films. And the special effects and interaction between Harry and Dumbledore were great. The only thing that I have to say I felt should have been different was the death scene, although it was good, it could have been perfect had they stuck more to the book and had Harry immobilised and the battle with the death eaters. It did seem a bit strange that Harry would just stand there and let Dumbledore die, but I guess it reinforces the fact that he trusted Snape and didn't expect it to happen, but then his reaction when it happens is kind of delayed. Also the other death eaters don't really have a reason for being there without the battle scene, why did Draco bother letting them into the castle when he had Dumbledore alone anyway and Snape to help him? Changing that would have made it perfect for me. But as for the other stuff about the detail of the horcruxes and Bill and Fleur etc. I can understand why people are worried about how they will deal with it in the final films, but let's remember that they are creating two more films and wait and see how they deal with it there. In my opinion if they add the detail into the 7th film it will be better anyway as we will be finding out about things that are relevant to that story in the 7th film. We already know the wedding is happening as it has been filmed already, but I don't think it is necessary to introduce the characters beforehand. Finally, I think people need to remember that the books and films are separate entities, why bother seeing the films if they are just exactly the same as the stories in the books, this way we get to see someone else's vision of the HP story and have something that is different and stands alone. I personally think they did a fantastic job of a very difficult book to translate into film.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
920,stanko_yonchev,Harry Potter suffering from the Lord of the Rings syndrome.,5,18 July 2009,"What? You might say when you look at the title of my post. Well what is the Lord of the Rings syndrome? If you read the book and watch the film there are certain deviations and certain things that are missed or not mentioned. The main reason for that is that when a writer writes a book he doesn't think: ""Well, I won't write this because the movie will become too long, no descriptions because if they have to do a movie this scene should be at least 30 minutes long, and how much will the CG cost."" No wonder Tolkein never wanted the Lord of the Rings to be filmed, while he was alive. So back to the syndrome. You might say that the previous Harry Potter movies lacked some of the books contents, and it's true. But nonetheless they sticked to the plot. Even if not everything was put in there you felt that most of the things were there, or rather enough to satisfy all Potter fans. However some moments that they missed were used in the next books or were somehow connected to the story. So did they decide to fix these things, well first of all they can't start making flashbacks in the movie about the missing things so they had to twist the story.Rather than concentrating on what they've done I will concentrate on what will happen in the next 2 films. So the scene with the prime minister and the minister of magic was not in the film -> in the deadly hollows may be Kingsley will be guarding the Dursleys. The will of Siruis Black is not mentioned, and Kreature too -> The Harry Potter gang never visits number 12 in the Deadly Hollows, they discover the locket in an alley or may be in a forest. The Burrow is burned down-> no wedding between LeFleur and Bill-> Ron never leaves the other two-> no Delluminator. Ginny and Harry not getting together or rather missing on getting together-> no parting between them. Ginny hiding the book of the Half-Blood prince-> Ginny joins the other three in the search for the Hollows, or Ginny telling Harry right before the fight for Hogwarts where it is or leading him to it. Dumbledoor not explaining to Harry, what kind of objects Voldemort could have used for the Horcruxes-> may be some objects will be different, may be Nagini won't be a Horcrux. Other things that could be, they may cut the beginning with the many Potter, may be leave out the Life and Lies of Albus Dumbledoor, leave out the will of Albus Dumbledoor. Overall for me story was simply too long too fit in one movie that's why it is played in kind of fast forward, I think that that's why the Deadly Hollows will be 2 movies, but how will they spin the story after the Half-Blood prince and how much it will have to do with the book, we will only know when the films are out.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
921,puckleanne,Betrayal -- Is Yates really Voldemort? Is Kloves really Umbridge?,1,18 July 2009,"Sitting there in the dark watching this travesty,I just felt betrayed. It was like a death eater sucked all of the joy, magic and cheerfulness and lets just say it -- logic that should have been present in the movie away. The one star is because it was so hot outside and the theater was air conditioned. This movie is IN-appropriate, IN-excusable and IN-sulting!The magic that was lovingly put on every page and pored over endlessly by so many fans was missing. I didn't expect every detail that I adored to be on screen but I did expect to recognize the book I loved. I didn't think Yates could do worse than he did on HP5 - but he made a liar out of me. It was like he heard a rumor that someone else had heard there was a wizard that could have been called Harry Potter but he didn't believe them. I can't believe this is what Rowling signed off on. And if it is she betrayed us most of all. Didn't anyone wonder why Yates would be available to do ALL of the remaining movies!?!?!? Huge Clue. This guy obviously can't read any of the languages available on our planet -- because I'm pretty sure this book was translated into most if not all of them. It is apparent he can't hear (poor thing) because those same books are available in audio form in those same languages. It is evident he cannot see because this movie lacked vision. He can't lead unless it was to lead the actors into the land of blemishes on your career - because the movie was all over the place with pointless sub-sub-sub-plots. And our love of Potter is completely unfathomable to absorb because he was unable to tap into it -- even after 2hours holding us hostage. Warner Brothers should be aware that this type of greed leads to failure -- you really shouldn't kill the golden goose! There is still plenty of money to be made. Harry is still relevant I started looking at the movie prepared to accept what was on screen - but from the first scene I had to engage my book knowledge to make sense of it. The correct names were there, but many of the actions had no justification or logic behind them. For instance why was the Unbreakable Vow Bellatrix's idea? and since it was why have Narcissa there - why not do it herself? Why oh why was Neville a waiter at the party? What exactly is Ron supposed to understand between Ginny and Harry? As a viewer of this movie -- I didn't understand that there was something to understand. If Hermoine and Ron are involved now what will you do for book 7? Where was Scrimgour? And the death eaters only travel in groups of 2 or 3? and they were just able to land at the burrow - and why exactly did they go there? where was all the protection the ministry could provide? And that potions class -- no tables, chairs or equipment needed other than a book? Sorry there were inane females. McGonagal as hall monitor just telling students to go to a random class? Since when is apparating on school grounds allowed? What exactly is Harry supposed to be searching for next time because it was clearly said that a horcrux could be anything. Are Tonks and Lupin supposed to be together?!? How exactly did Snap persuade Harry to just stand and watch him kill Dumbledore -- evidently in silence? Why is Harry acting the coward? Why didn't Ron's parents come to the hospital? Why would a viewer have so many questions? Here is another --are Yates and Kloves really Voldemort and Umbridge? Kloves definitely wrote the magic out of a movie about magic, but since he was a follower of someone obviously employing every weapon in their arsenal to destroy Harry Potter, that must be who they are. There was no bridge from the previous movie to this one and none for the next movie to continue from. So it seemed that neither the hard core fans nor the casual fans were served. The reason books get made into movies is usually because it has so many fans. (Get a clue, the people dressing up as the characters; that go to the midnight showings; that read the blogs; that take the time to write their displeasure; that buy the games; that create and visit sites; that care about the subject even now -- they are generally known as FANS!) If any movie series deserved to be remade this one does. Even a television mini-series would be an improvement over the treatment Harry's many, many fans have received. The books are classics but the movies definitely are not. I wouldn't be surprised if there was a plan to have a fan uprising to direct a truer version of a loved Harry!",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince

923,thewheezeofcheeze,A book readers nightmare,4,18 July 2009,"This movie was a let down. It was my favourite book of the series, but all of the scenes I was looking forward to seeing were done overwhelmingly poorly. It is unfortunate that the movie needed to be tame enough for youngsters to enjoy it, but the movie lacked punch in the vital scenes. The addition of scenes not in the book may have been necessary to complete the plot, but that is not the case for the ""burning of the burrow"" scene. It had no purpose and was disappointing in that the death eaters lured out their prize, then just gave up. What was the point? And since when can they all fly? There seems to be a lot of new fiction to the story that is going to make it interesting to see how they can blend this into an acceptable finale. Seems to be a lot of important plot left out, and senseless waffle included.I would like to know the opinions of other book devotees.I for one left the cinema disappointed",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
924,djalali59,Only god knows how disappointed I am...,1,18 July 2009,"Hey guys, I got to see the HBP at it's midnight screening. I was so excited about it, I practically bought tickets two weeks in advance. After 2 and a half hours, I was awestruck. Not with delight, but with utter disappointment. As a die-hard HP fan, I was looking forward to this movie more than any of the others, such as the battle of Hogwarts, Dumbledore's death and funeral, as well as the journey into Riddle's past. Quite unfortunately, almost all of the above plot elements were cut out of the movie. Now, we have all had our experiences with cutting out plot points in HP movies, but the entire point of HBP was Riddle's past! They barely included any of that stuff! Now, I can't remember all of the points they missed, but you can look at any of the other reviews and find out. At that point, I thought it couldn't get any worse. I was wrong. It's one thing to cut out things, but to add in stuff that never even happened!?!?! When I saw the scene of the burrow burning down, my thoughts raced, thinking, did that ever happen? Did I miss a chapter? Then, I realized there was a general sense of confusion in the theater. Yet another downside to this movie was the almost complete lack of deep emotion. Add that to the cheap and one sided humor of the completely un-important Lavender Brown, and you had a disaster. The main point is, if we don't want a complete mess up of films 7, both parts one and two, David Yates better get his act together, or else Harry will have been killed.Now, as the trailer deceivingly states it is ""the best Potter yet"", don't be deceived. It was definitely the worst.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
925,rylack,David Yates is Harry Potter Franchise's biggest mistake,1,18 July 2009,"Overall the worst among the series. From start to finish the plot is dull, dreary, and unbearable. To kill Dumbledore without the burial that marked his quality as being the greatest wiz of all time is just downright a scam. Might as well just let him willingly jump off the Astronomy tower.I am not a professional movie critic; this is in fact my first IMDb post.But man, David Yates just destroyed Harry Potter. Now we know why they delayed the release of the movie.

926,g_carotenuto,I'll just pretend this film wasn't made,3,19 July 2009,"As a movie in its own right, its mediocre. If you have read the book, unless your memory is damaged or your sense of taste is alien, you can only agree with one fact: this was the worst HP movie script ever made.The only thing that saves this film from an even lower mark is the photography, which is actually quite stunning at times. So, basically you are better off watching some stills of the film, save yourself the time and the ticket money. I fear that if the people who made this shameful waste of a wonderful story are the same ones that are taking care of the last two films, i am going to have to consider the HP film saga dead.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
927,heatheraislinn06,Important Parts Or Not So Much?,2,19 July 2009,"Was it just me or were some major parts with a LOT of importance left out of the movie when compared to the book? I mean I understand that it is almost impossible to include EVERYTHING in the book, but what about the major parts? Why leave those out? Am I mistaken when I say that Harry finding out that since Sirius died, Harry owns all his belongings, including Kreacher, is an important fact in the book? I mean, Kreacher is the one that helps Harry later on, why not add this? What about the whole Dumbledore joking around about Hogs Head and how he knows the bartenders? And why in the heck is Dumbeldore's wand just sitting on his desk after he dies? That is a HUGE part, later on, that it was laid to rest with Dumbledore. Speaking of, where was his funeral? It didn't have to be long, but him being laid to rest was a pretty siginificant part too. Some things didn't make sense either, for example: Snape being The Half Blood Prince. If you didn't read the book, there is NO explanation why he is The Half Blood Prince. And the whole fight and attack around/at the Weasley's house. Why was that in there? NOTHING came from that. And WHERE was the fight at the end? Was I the only one looking forward to that part of the movie? It never came. Like the Death Eaters could just stroll out of Hogwarts with no one to at least try to stop them, besides Harry. Little action, too much cut out (like more of the memories of Voldemort, including the one about how he came back to Hogwarts to be a teacher), it wasn't a HUGE mess, people that didn't read the book liked it, but they don't know everything they missed that could help set them up for understanding the events that happen in the next two films.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince

HP has become so successful now that as many people like to stick the boot in, as those who rave about it.Strip away all of the hype and you have a great film. A story that is well told and constructed that makes 2 1/2 hours fly by. You care about the lead characters so much you feel every emotion they feel.The added scenes of the attack on the bridge and the Weasley's house were necessary. The book has very little or no action and needed adding to. The extra scenes added to the story and the building tension.I felt a little let down by the ending. However thinking this through, the ending of HP7 was very similar to HP6, so I think the makers want to capitalise on the ending of the series, and not be open to claims that it copies HP6. It also leaves the way open for a dramatic start to Deathly Hallowes Part One.Highly recommended.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince

When I went to see the movie I though the general movie on the teenagers was fine but sooooo much was missed!!! It doesn't match the book, there is so much un said/ shown. My husband who came to watch the movie with me has watched the previous movies but had not read the books yet thought the movie was rubbish and so did most the cinema. The extra scene at the Weasleys was rubbish, is was random and showed that the protection that was mean't to be on the house wasn't. The order was hardly in the movie... The Big flight, moaning Murtel etc was not in the movie. They didn't even show them crossing the lake in the cave. The small things and information is what makes the movie.

930,bsutapa-ece,A disappointment for the Harry Potter book lovers,2,22 July 2009,"The special effects of this movie are good. VERY Hollywood. But why did the director tamper so badly with the wonderful universe created by Jo? 1.Why was Harry reading The Daily Prophet sitting in a Muggle restaurant? At the beginning of Half Blood Prince, Harry is recovering from the unbearable pain and grief caused by the death of his godfather, who was a father figure cum best friend to him. Then why oh why, did we have to watch Harry flirting with a restaurant waitress in a ""I-am-sixteen-with-raging-hormones-and-serious-need-of-dating"" way? This was just an example of how the characters have been made shallow. They do not follow Jo's wonderful original characters. 2.At last Luna and her father have got a supporter of their weired theories. The director of this movie actually SHOWS us wrakcspruts!!! 3.The Burrow was burnt down. It was being used as the headquarter of the Order, surely it should have had some strong protection? What purpose did this scene (which was not in the book) serve?And in the scene right after this,Ron and Ginny are acting all normal. 4.What about the battle at the end? 5.Where are the other memories which contain vital information about the Horcruxes? 6.WHERE IS THE CHEMISTRY BETWEEN RON AND HERMIONE? Examples: Can you imagine Hermione herself telling Ron about snogging Krum, and then getting drunk? She tells Harry that she chose Mclaggen to annoy Ron, but he never seems to have known who her date was! This list will go on and on and on, so I stop here. I happened to enjoy this movie because - 1. I was sitting in an otherwise empty theatre with my boyfriend and we snogged whenever the movie got annoying. 2. I enjoyed the special effects.If you are a devoted follower of HP books, this movie will thoroughly disappoint you. After getting home, you'll surely seek refuge in your copy of the dear old book. Just like I did. After all, books are man's best friends! P.S. I have never liked Michael Gambon as Dumbledore. This movie is no exception.

931,pineaux1481,Half Blood Prince: Good but not Great,8,19 July 2009,"This HP movie was overall very good. It had the very best acting of any of the other Potter films. All the young actors have really improved their range and look completely at ease on screen. I was afraid when I heard that this movie was going to focus on romance that it would stink. Everyone did a superb job with the teenage love interest, making it funny and sincere at the same time. This movie had more funny moments than previous HP films. It really helps lighten the story (that is overall fairly dark).Luna is a riot and I was very glad to see her featured. The casting was excellent especially with Broadbent as Slughorn. This movie made me care about the characters. Felton did an excellent job as the tormented Drago(even though he looked 25). While the action was lacking in this film some of it was very good. The beginning was better than the book and the part inside the cave could not be better. Thank goodness that they brought back Quidditch, they did very well with that part of the film. While some of the story line was changed, not all of it was bad. The kiss between Harry and Ginny ,while not the same as the book,was very sweet and I think that considering they had barely developed Ginny's character in the other movies Yates did pretty well with it.Let me first state that no movie will be able to capture a 600 page novel in two and a half hours and if you do then you will always be disappointed. Still major things were omitted that would have added to the story and would not have diminished the relationship driven plot at all. First some minor complaints. 1). Through most of the movie I forgot that everyone is at school, it would have been cool to see Snape acting as Defense against the dark arts teacher. 2). I thought the Sectumsempra spell would look way better and I understand that to make PG rating they can't show Harry cutting up Drago but still I think it is missing something there. 3).Show a least one more Riddle memory (its the driving thing in the book and it could explain more for the average person who has not read the book). 4). While they do a good job at the beginning, the story is about how Voldemort's forces are destroying the wizarding world. They could have added Harry, Ron, and Hermione talking about disappearances in the paper or something with dementors. 5). In the book Harry really distrusted Snape and they did a lackluster job showing that. It could have helped build the emotion of the climax. These are all things that probably have to be cut to make the movie watchable but these several major complaints turn this potentially best film of the group into 2nd or 3rd best.Why on Earth would Yates add a fight scene at the Burrow during Christmas? This makes no sense at all and creates some holes going forward to the next movie. They add this unnecessary part to the movie and take out the extremely awesome fight scene when Snape is escaping Hogwarts. What was the point of bringing the death eaters into Hogwarts if they barely do anything. This lack of action and drama after you know who dies hurts the climax of this film. I am fine with no funeral but don't change the end of the book when it was so cool. If they did it to save money then it is a shame and with the record amounts they are getting from this film Yates better put that cash into making the next two movies as visually stunning as it should be.Overall I can't fault the actors, who really make this film enjoyable to watch. If Yates can make the action parts better in the next two films ,than in this one, it will be worth the wait. If you want to see a good movie and not an action fest then go see this movie!",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
932,leilanikohia,Total lack of...,4,19 July 2009,"They could have made this movie into one of the best Harry Potter films. Instead they made a mediocre film that lacked emotion. Such powerful and moving parts of the book turned out to be full of nothing but bad direction and awful screen writing. i was moved more to tears for Cedric in the Fourth movie than i was for Dumbledore in the sixth movie; which as we all know should be the opposite- Dumbledore being away more important character. Not only that, it was also lacking one of the best fight scenes at the end of the book that they chose not to put in the movie. complete mistake- if I were you i would wait until it came out on DVD and save your 11 or 16 dollars.oh yeah, and whats with the odd displays of affection from ginny? would a teenage girl actually bend down to tie a boys shoe or feed him on the couch. the director chose such odd ways to show the growth of their relationship (or lack there of).",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince

I've been reading hundred of comments on this film and all I can say is: guys, were you ever taught that books and films aren't the same thing?! All this talk of ""murdering the screenwriter"" and ""killing the director"" makes me ashamed, because this film may not a masterpiece, but it has moments of cinematographic brilliance.Who said HPHBP was the best and most important HP book? It may add a hundred more items to the Harry Potter encyclopedia, but as far as I know, this book is much more about character-development and emotional catharsis than about plot advancement, and is one of the least crucial one of the series, even if Albus's fate is highly affecting.What the film-makers tried to do, I think, was to put together a film which would stand on its own but which would echo the overall mood of the book. I'm sure many people will agree that the dark atmosphere and the insight that we get into some of the characters' minds (Harry, Riddle, Ginny, Dumbledore, Snape) and some of the most comic and poignant moments too (Hermione, Ron...) make this a film which isn't so much about plot and action than about character and mood.Even if not containing all the thousand details that all ""true"" Harry Potter fans seem to want to get in every film, this movie made me remember why I enjoyed and was highly affected by the book: it shows character-development while giving us a gloomy (and beautifully shot) picture of Hogwarts and the rest of the magical world as it falls into the shadows of He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named's new rising.So, if you can leave the book at home and enjoy a film which is about character, atmosphere and emotion, then go and see this film. If not, then please stay at home and read the book and spare us all your grief. If you do go and see the film and are disappointed, then do something even better: try to make a film and when you realise how hard it is, give these film-makers a bit of respect.I think this is by far the best HP film since Prisoner of Azkaban, which is still my favourite.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince

Two hours of teenage sexual innuendo and Ron Weasley comic relief jokes. So many key parts of the book are missing they are just too long to list. The missing parts make the remaining parts just stupid, confusing, anti-climactic, and unneeded.I want my money back and JK Rowling should be ashamed of this movie.

It was a quick death that made me sleep more than feel for the man. the book had me sad for weeks.They even left out major details from the book on the movie. Some of the battles, the flashbacks. they even left some character completely out of the the movie.The director, publishers, writers, crewmen, cast, and everyone that had to do with the making of this movie should be disappointed with this horrible display.They better redeem themselves in the next movie and the few people that liked this one that will see the next one better have good reviews or i will not waste the $11.50 i spent and waste the 2 hours sitting in a chair. If a director or someone who has to do with this movie is reading this, please don't disappoint me and disgrace the name of these great ""Harry Potter"" books by making another sequel as bad as this one.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
936,katie-vallin,Don't Forget This:,9,19 July 2009,"It has occurred to me that many of you commentors have forgotten that Rowling agreed to every change made to her own work for the movie. If you trust in her ability as an artist, as you who write things like ""I am an avid fan"" and ""I love the Harry Potter series"" do, you then must trust those in whom she has confidence! Like many of you have said, they cannot possibly involve every ounce of flavor from the books into the movie, and therefore they must set up the final two films.There was no meeting with between the ministers because in the books it is merely an interesting way to show a review of the preceding novels, just like she has done in every book.There is no mention of Fleur and Bill's engagement because in the end it is not key in the plot, and thus only adds movie time.They show Tonks and Lupin together, because Harry becomes a godfather to Theodore, which is key in the end.They skip the battle because they didn't have the feature length time. Personally, if it were a choice between seeing a 20 minute battle (with many more excluded book points), a much too short battle scene which would do it no justice (because we all know we'd complain about it's shortness), and skipping it all together because the point was that the death eaters were there, killed Dumbledore, and ran off, I'd rather it be the third - and clearly so would Rowling, because she agreed to have it done.The only point of there being a burrow in the final movies would be for the wedding, and that is not an elemental point of the book, which as we know is the destruction of Voldemort.I imagine the funeral will take place in the beginning of the 7th movie. ;) Besides, this is not an ""IMDB Review of the differences between the book and movie Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince"" comments section, this is a section for the review of the movie itself.We fell in love, we laughed, we cried, we were frightened out of our pants, and we shared it all together; that is what makes a good film. <3",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince

938,leeroyle-1,Very disappointed,3,20 July 2009,"As a fan of the books I entered the Cinema full of hope and anticipation, sadly leaving the Cinema was a completely different story.(As is the Film)....... I have always wanted to enjoy the films despite the sometimes necessary changes to plot, but for me this film was a step to far!!! The total lack of explanation regarding Dumbledore's condition and its Acquisition was one of many major omissions that left me feeling totally disconnected with his and Harry's journey. None of the books exploration of Dumbledores ""Brilliance"" and connection to Harry are covered and the ""Half blood Prince"" seems to have been reduced to a film title, with barely any of its relevance being covered and a clumsy explanation thrown in at the end!! The finale to the film is nothing short of ""Terrible"" Once you look past the special effects (which are spectacular) and the brilliant job of the actors as they fight to pull it all together I was left wondering why so many truly important scenes could have sacrificed at the expense of so many pointless ones and why so many plot changes could be allowed that had I not read JK Rowlings books I would be left wondering what ""all the fuss was about"".................",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
939,darrenbh,Feeling slightly cheated.....,5,20 July 2009,"Highly unsatisfactory ending to an otherwise gently amusing film. Other niggles:1) Why bother redesigning the look of the Burrow? 2) there was no running end battle between the baddies, the order and the teachers, therefore there was no sense of urgency to getting in and out of Hogwarts. 3) The liquid was a murky dark colour instead of clear green. Why bother changing that? 4) They had enough of a job condensing the book into the film, so why add bits which were never in the book such as Harry being rescued from the water?There are a lot of films that can be mended. This is one of them. Overall there was gentle amusing interplay between the ""teenage"" characters which was delivered like a build up towards a grand finale. Unfortunately, as that never happened i went away feeling slightly cheated. Redo the finale and this film would be better.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
940,les_coccinelle,Where was all the magic?,6,20 July 2009,"I don't know how to feel about this movie. I had so high expectations, but I must admit that I was really disappointed.The first half of the movie evolved around a lot of love drama. There's Ron hooking up with a random girl - resulting in Hermione getting jealous. There's Ginny hooking up with a random dude - resulting in Harry Potter getting jealous. At the same time there is another girl who's in love with Harry. I mean what the? For me, Harry Potter was never about love-drama. Of course there's love, but never this teenage BS. It's about MAGIC - so where was all the magic? This was a poor excuse of a HP movie.The only point where all the drama mattered somewhat to me, was when Hermione had a hard time cooping with Ron. There's a scene where Harry sits with Hermione and comforts her - that scene showed me the effect of real friendship, but other than that it was pure BS.Then there's Dumbledore's death. Why didn't they give him a proper funeral? It was like.. Poof! And then he was gone. I never got the sad feeling cause it happened so fast! I could have used a better explanation of the book. I know it was Snape's, but it was like it wasn't the essential of the movie. Shouldn't it be? Since the movie is called Half-blood Prince? According to the book there's suppose to be an attack at Hogwarts - Why did they leave that out? Maybe it's just me, but I am really sorry that I spent money watching this in the cinema. They drained the life out of Harry Potter, unfortunately.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
941,harnar_rules,Worst Harry Potter film by far.,3,20 July 2009,"As a massive fan of the Harry Potter books, and films alike, I was really looking forward to seeing the Half Blood Prince. As one of millions of people who love the books I was expecting something at least on par with the previous films. I was bored and confused as I watched my favourite book be badly directed, badly written and cringing at times.As I sat down to watch the 6th book in the series I was impressed with the graphics at the beginning and was expecting a highly entertaining film. If I had not read the books before hand I would have no idea what was going on. In the book Dumbledore shows Harry key memories from Voldemort that will help Harry defeat him. Dumbledore explains in great detail why Voldemort went after Harry and that it is up to Harry to kill him. Exciting stuff!...In the film Dumbledore shows a memory of Voldemort at school and there is a hint (and no explanation) that Voldemort has made 7 Horcruxes. Harry just accepts this and asks no questions as to what the remaining Horcruxes could be. In the film, Dumbledore dies before he can tell Harry what to spend the next year looking for. I guess Harry will just randomly guess where the rest of Voldemorts soul is hidden?!My next main problem is the ridiculous, time wasting made up scene in the middle of the film in which the Burrow gets burnt down. Need I actually say anymore? The scene is totally useless and left me thinking...'ehhh.....where are they going with this'. No-where, the scene ends and our characters return to Hogwarts un-fazed.In the past film I found Hermione Granger (Emma Watson) badly acted and Ron Weasly (Rupert Grint) great to watch. In this film, Hermione steals the show. Fair enough it is not Oscar worthy but compared to Ron who kind of sits about looking miserable, she is awesome. In the book, Ron's shining moment is when he wins the Quidditch cup for Griffindor. I was pleased to see Quidditch was back on at Hogwarts but alas, there is one game and we never do find out if anyone really wins the cup. Its just another scene added in to tick a box. Quidditch. Done.The rant continues... Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) spends most of the film just creeping behind walls listening to people while Malfoy spends his time on screen flipping a sheet of the vanishing cabinet. Seriously, someone please count how many times that sheet comes off, its the same camera shot and everything! Remember Fenrir the werewolf in the book? The really sad scene where we think Ron's brother Bill might become a werewolf too? Don't worry because Bill's not even in it and all we know of Fenrir is that he is a hairy extra with yellow eyes. Correct me if I'm wrong but do they ever mention he is a werewolf?!? Dumbledore Dies. A chapter in the book where I actually shed a few tears. There is a battle between good and evil at Hogwarts which results in Dumbledores death as well as Bill Weasleys mutilation. But not in the film! The death eaters just kind of waltz into Hogwarts, not even the teachers and aurors patrolling the castle notice. They quickly kill Dumbledore, kick some cutlery, break a few windows, burn Hagrid's hut they even put up the dark mark and yet everyone in Hogwarts just sleeps on. That is until randomly EVERYONE in the school just appears outside to look at Dumbledores dead body. I have ranted long enough. Ultimately, the film is not just a very bad attempt to re-make J.K's classic but its also just boring. I found myself checking my watch to see how much longer I had and getting embarrassed at the awful scriptwriting (ie Dumbledore ""you need to shave Harry""). Come on now guys! The story is there, the script is there all you need to do is chuck some money at and its done!",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
942,a_reviewer,The best so far - but why change some of it ?,6,21 July 2009,"Firstly, I have read each and every Harry Potter book, but I understand that a film is never going to satisfy each reader, as everyone imagines scenes in their own way. However, I thought this film was one of the best HP's so far, for several reasons. I felt the actors really managed to excel in this film. Daniel Radcliffe actually seems to become 'harry', rather than an awkward teen actor only portraying a two dimensional character. Emma Watson ends her excessive over-acting and becomes much more likable as Hermione, and Rupert Grint shows himself capable of comedy in many scenes which verged on slapstick. Jim Broadbent and Jessie Cave were spot on in the role of Slughorn & Lavender, Tom Felton perfectly portrayed the desperate and tortured Draco Malfoy, and for once, I felt Michael Gambon actually did justice to the character of Dumbledore, an area in which I have always thought he has failed in the past. Bonham Carter, as always, was flawless as Bellatrix Lestrange. However, where some characters were allowed to reveal themselves, others who could have developed even further, such as Neville, became insignificant and almost a joke. The cinematography,also, merited this film as the best so far. After a thrilling and chilling first sequence of shots opening the film, each scene was shot so artistically and fittingly, that it made up for any confusion I may have felt! There were plenty of tense moments throughout and I especially liked the effective way the memories in the Pensieve were shot. Having Yates as the director of the fifth and sixth book has managed to prevent each of these films from having the cheesy edge the first couple seemed to have. However, I have noticed in both this film and in the previous one, that many important details were unnecessarily omitted.In the first few minutes of this film, I was completely perplexed. Having last read HBP nearly two years ago, I did not completely remember how it started - but I was finding it hard to recollect when, watching the film, so many original details were actually completely changed around anyway. Having come back and found out for myself how it started, I get confused as to why the changes were necessary. Why not have Harry at the Dursley's in Privet Drive? With Dumbledore revealing the contents of Sirius' will? It would only mean less backtracking and explaining are needed in 7 to explain why Harry owns Grimmauld Place. Many details such as these were left out, and other scenes were changed from the way they were presented in the book. However, I managed to become flexible in my expectations, and got into enjoying the film (which was enjoyable partly because of the balance of humour and seriousness - although not a particularly light-hearted book) until the scene of the burrow burning down. I did not see the point of this scene at all. It merely took up 5 minutes where more important but small details could have been fitted in.The film leaves a lot hanging where the book does not. In the book, by the end, Harry has at least some idea of what to look for in his search for Horcruxes, thanks to the help of Dumbledore. Nevertheless, in the film, the concept is covered in a few sentences (and, I imagine, would have been difficult for a non reader to understand). Several crucial moments for the next book, such as Harry noticing the diadem, are not even hinted at, meaning more flexibility will be needed in the final two films. Also, what I especially enjoyed about J.K's novel, was the way we started to learn more about Voldemort. We saw him as less of a one-sided character, and started to the see the reasons for the way he was. However, in the film, this didn't seem to come across at all, many of the memory scenes having been taken out.I understand the importance and difficulty of translating a massive book into a reasonably-lengthed film. I thought many parts were very well done, exactly as I imagined when reading the book. Although not every scene echoed exactly the way it happened in the book, the essence and meaning were still there. My only complaint would be the pointless scene of the Burrow burning down, where plenty of meaningful and important or even gripping parts of the book could clearly have been added. The beautiful and moving scene of Dumbledore's funeral could have been included, or just slightly more relevant facts.I would not advise seeing this if you have not read the book - I am only just beginning to realise how difficult it would be to follow - however, if you're not too obsessed with the directors following the book word for word (which, let's face it, which film adaptation ever succeeds in doing? Readers will always be slightly disappointed) go to see this film, purely for 2 and a half hours of tense, moving and amusing cinema.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
943,j23521,Opinion of someone who hasn't read the book before,1,20 July 2009,"--- NO SPOILERS FROM HERE --- Some people claim this movie is perceived better if you hadn't read the book before because you don't expect certain things to happen, so the sole fact that movie is different from the book (which isn't bad by itself alone) doesn't make you angry. Well, exactly for this reason I never read the Harry Potter book before I see the corresponding movie, so I watched Half-blood Prince being as clean as possible, without any expectations whatsoever. And guess what? Even from this point of view, this movie just SUCKS!!! I won't write long lists of things that were present in the book but not in the movie, like other fans. These didn't actually annoy me when I watched the film, for the aforementioned reason. You can just count on a lot of things being unexplained and completely unclear, simply leaving a lot of loose ends and some things don't even fit. If you haven't read the book (like me), you won't understand plenty of things, and if you have read it - better keep away from the movie to not ruin your mood.--- SPOILERS START FROM HERE --- For the first time in Harry Potter saga, I didn't understand what's going on there, what's happening? What happened to Dumbledore's hand? Yeah, that's amazing - but the film provides no explanation though the hand is shown in the film several times. Why was Slughorn so ashamed of the memory he has hidden? Why Slughorn still gave this changed memory to Dumbledore in this case? Who tried to kill Dumbledore and why - I would like to see some investigation, what instead? Some cheesy love stories and stories of students feeding themselves with love potions for 2.5 hours! The apotheosis of this was a scene in the hospital wing, where Dumbledore and Slughorn and Snape start discussing who might give the poison meant for Dumbledore to Slughorn, and then - voilà - Lavanda Brown appears and again the pathetic ""love"" plot line slips in without ever resolving the main line. This was awful. In fact, filmmakers definitely think playing hormones and love potions is the main plot of the film, who cares about fighting with evil when Ron is being torn apart between Lavanda and Hermione!!! Indeed.This movie is not some Romeo and Juliette to admire the ""love"" plot either, by the way. Pretty pathetic.And finally, some things don't fit after being changed from the book. If Dumbledore didn't knew that Voldemort used horcruxes, how the hell he managed to destroy the ring-horcrux already? I also wonder how Harry will look for other horcruxes in future films not knowing how they should look like? Though since the next movies are directed by the same director, I guessed it - it will be just unclear as things in this movie. Harry will ""just know"", I guess. Sixth sense! So. Basically I think David Yates should suffer from Cruciatus curse for releasing this rubbish on screens. The movie being waited for so long was killed! This is definitely the Disappointment of the Year.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
944,pugh0909,"I'm a huge fan, but what were they thinking?",4,20 July 2009,"Like other posters, I am very upset that they chose to eliminate the pivotal fight scene only to include something that was never part of the original book. Perhaps they did so to eliminate Burrow Scenes from the next two movies but that would be devastating as the Burrow figures so prominently in the next film. Seconly, I really hated their decision to have Harry just stand by while Dumbledore was killed, in the book he was immobilized by Dumbledore and under the invisibility cloak I don't see why they thought it necessary to change that critical part. I certainly hope that Yates or his team is paying attention to what we have to say and he makes corrections in the next two films. I would be devastated to learn that he ignored our input and ruined the final two movies. JK wrote an excellent book, directors shouldn't be allowed so much creative license. I am very disappointed.

945,sacrawford24,This Movie Lost the Plot!!!,4,20 July 2009,"We all know that when going from book to film some creative liberty has to take place, however the makers of this film took a very well written book and turned it into a teenage kissing fest.The best thing about the previous 5 Harry Potter films was that for the most part they were true to the books, not this time. This movie completely lost the plot of the book and focused mostly on teenage hook-ups. JK Rowling's writing does not need improving upon, if they can make an Order of the Pheonix movie that is true to an 800 page book, I'm not sure why they couldn't get Half-Blood Prince right! Key parts of the book are left out. Right from the start they change the opening Dumbledore/Harry scene, I was so looking forward to the Dersley's meeting Dumbledore, didn't happen, in-fact the Dersley's are not even in the film.Then there is the middle of the movie, where for some reason they decide to burn down the burrow, again not in the book and a pretty important place in the last book and presumably the next movie. This added scene served no purpose, in-fact in this scene Harry goes bolting from the burrow after Belatrix, but at the end of the movie when Dumbledore is outnumbered by Death Eaters and Snape, Harry just hides like a coward and does nothing to help or save Dumbledore. Stick to what was in the book, its far better.Also omitted is the Wizard battle at Hogwart's leading up to Dumbledore's demise, again another crucial part of book 6 that was not included and was sorely missed.If you did not read the book you will probably like the movie, however if you read it, and are a fan of JK Rowling's writing and great story telling, you will be disappointed.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
946,kittspalace-1,Decent tho still lacking,8,21 July 2009,"I really liked this movie, it was far better then Goblet of Fire but was still lacking in several departments, causing some minor disappointments. First and foremost there is the lack of information on the Half-Blood Prince even Snape revealing he is the Half-Blood Prince is kind of melodramatic and confusing, why where did the name come from etc. If you hadn't read the book the reason it is titled such. The other major disappointment is that Dumbledore has been so unrelatable and disconnected in the other movies that unlike his book his death was not even sad or really all that moving. I felt more when Sirus died then Dumbledore I'm not sure this is a discredit to this particular movie or the series as a whole, that Dumbledore is not all that relatable in the movies which is one of the many major contrast from the books and I have a feeling in another up and coming death in the next movie, that I will not feel as close to those characters either for it really to effect me. Other then that the acting was great the movie was excellent and really is far better then the goblet of fire and was more on par with the first two films of the series.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
947,mattcolbert18,"Good, but not the book!",7,21 July 2009,"Just before I start i want to say I actually did enjoy this film, but there were a lot of problems!My biggest issue with the film is the end... It is such an anti-climax and does no credit to the book or J.K. Rowling's story at all! Also, the comedy! The Potter films are not comedies, and there was way too much focus on the jokes and not enough on the actual story! The relations between Ron & Hermione and Harry & Ginny are developed way too obviously. In the books they happen slowly and subtly, whereas here Hermione speaks of her feelings for Ron... THAT'S NOT HOW IT's SUPPOSED TO HAPPEN! The Quidditch is short, totally pointless and not very funny and is a waste of screen time that could be used on the ending! the same can be said for the burning of the Weasley's house, and that doesn't even happen in the book!Of course there were a lot of positives too; as usual the cast were fantastic, especially Helena Bonham Carter and Emma Watson! The cave scene is done extremely well and the memories of Tom Riddle are brilliant and scary!Overall this is a good film, but I did expect way more, as Order of the Phoenix was a brilliant job! A good movie, but it does not do the book justice!",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
948,headacheking,"Solid movie, excellent cast, storyline sometimes questionable",9,21 July 2009,"If you are a fan of the books (as I am) and want to give yourself a treat by watching this movie: forget about the book (and don't think too much about the 7th of the series) and simply enjoy the cinematography!They made a lot of changes regarding the subplot of the Horcruxes, the end scene and left out the house elfs (and a couple more). -> But: It doesn't matter! A film does not live from stuffing in as much details as possible, so this time the producers seem to have made to choice of changing the plot so much that the film can be viewed as a stand-alone by the general audience and consequently cutting many references to the previous and (probably) following sequels. There is only one scene that I cannot make very much sense from: the burning of the Burrow: However, this makes me believe, that maybe they have already written the complete script for the two sequels (deathly hallows is split in two) and have good reason to do so.Let's come to the praise: The acting of the whole cast, save for Radcliffe, is superb. The editing absolutely wonderful (leagues above the abysmal job done for OoTP) and the lighting, colours and special effects solid. The 3D scenes are eye-catchers, while costumes and masks are impressive.There's loads of teeny romance, but it never really bothered me as all the scenes were hilariously funny and well acted (again, save for Potter and Ginny), besides we should remember, that it *is* a children's book after all.To sum it up: A well crafted movie for the light entertainment featuring many of Britain's greatest actors of the time, remotely based on the HP6 book and probably mainly intended for a teenage audience.Ceterum censeo Peter Jackson should one day do the adults version of the series!",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
949,proinsiasmatthews,Not Fair to the Book Lovers,1,21 July 2009,"After the previous Harry Potter films generating an unimaginable amount of money isn't it only fair for the men, women and children who have read the books to expect an epic portrayal of one of the greatest fantasy books ever written?Sadly The Half-Blood Prince never came close, much like its predecessors. The characters were never fully developed and some critical plot points were left out completely. Not enough emphasis was placed on the danger that Harry was in outside Hogwarts and the Burrow being burnt down at Christmas? Where was that badly conjured up from? The Rufus Scrimegeour visit is much more important because it shows how helpless the Ministry has been against Voldemort and how they wanted Harry to be their poster-boy and the whole event was replaced by an awful chase that came from nowhere and left the Weasleys house in flames!The connection between Harry and Voldemort was disregarded also and the moment when Dumbledore almost shouted at the screen that Harry might also be a Horcrux was pitiful.Dumbledores death was, at the very least, poorly done. It was on the wrong tower and under the wrong circumstances. Does anyone really believe that Harry would of just stood there and watched? And leaving out the greatest wizard of all times funeral is criminal!Bill and Fluer's relationship wasn't there at all either, along with him getting maimed by Greyback in an epic battle in Hogwarts that was also left out!The memories were the all important part of the story and too many were overlooked. Not showing how Voldemort is a descendant of Salazar Slytherin was a poor choice of judgement and didn't show that he prided on the pure-blood side of his family.I don't like to pick on the actors for their part in it because they can only perform with whats been given to them. I feel sorry for Rupert Grint who had to portray Ron as a bit of an oaf. The Quidditch scenes were awful. Did they read any of the book that said Ron was a great keeper and it was only confidence that was lacking?If you want a good movie this is not it. If you want a good portrayal of a book in movie form this DEFINITELY is not it. As a movie : 3/10. As a Book being brought to screen 0.5/10. and thats generous. The only hope for anyone who fell in love with these books as I did, is that they get remade sometime in the future with a good script. Who cares if we have to sit there for three hours?

950,javitopete,"Pity, disappointment for great expectations",5,21 July 2009,"I think I need to watch the movie again. I don't trust my first impressions, lately. My only sensation during the film was disappointment. Not only the awful adaptation, but also the imbalance as a film which could and should have been great. That makes me feel angry. I understand what a book adaption for a film is, and I value the effort made by filmmakers. It's been successful until now. This has been little awful.As many of you have said, the problem is the importance given to the romantic plot while damaging the real, dramatic plot around Voldemort's past, which is totally important in the final book and into the whole story. I've seen one of you wrote this film needs a do-over. I agree. Pity it's quite impossible now... I wonder how J.K. Rowling could allow to shoot that script... The whole movie es imbalanced, I insist. Please, it's only 2 minutes what we listen about Horcruxes!! and yes, that awful comment in Hermione's clever lips, at the end, ""Ron is OK with you dating Ginny""... please... There is also some good scenes, like the ones in the cave, they're fantastic. But the climax at the astronomy tower...? It was almost perfect, and then, here comes Snape shutting Harry's mouth, and later, appearing there to kill Dumbledore. What is that?? If J.K. Rowling made Harry to be petrified while Snape kills Dumbledore is because she knows how impulsive he is. In fact, he runs after Snape and company once he's free from the petrificus totalus charm. That's a mistake in Harry's character... Besides, I've always get emotionally involved in Harry Potter's films, and I've been too with this one, but much less. Especially with Dumbledore's death. No one can be moved with something that has no emotional background at all. The growing relationship between Harry and Dumbledore during this episode is the most important thing, because Dumbledore knows about his own death, approaching, and has to prepare Harry for the great task he'll left him in the next book, with horcruxes. Of course, when Dumbledore dies, no tears fall down my cheeks, as they did while reading. And that's just because we haven't seen any dramatic, deep relationship between D. and Harry. That plot is what moves the story of this sixth episode, that and Voldemort's past, not the nonsense, stupid love issues; at least, not as much as in the film. Also the half-blood prince's mystery is completely wasted (that non-dramatic chase after Snape and the death-eaters, and Bellatrix behaving like a silly, childish woman, bursting Hagrid's hut into flames with no apparent reason...¬¬).It's a shame that the talent developed by Daniel Radcliffe, M. Gambon, R. Grint, Emma Watson, Jim Broadbent, and even Tom Felton, who is great here, has been wasted. And last, the soundtrack by Nicholas Hooper... Instead of improving his satisfactory music for The Order of the Phoenix, which is correct and pretty good (not as much as Williams' or Doyle's at all), in the current movie music is as imbalanced as the plot. Hooper gets very emotional moments (the beginning, that track ""in noctem"" with beautiful choirs, or precious ""farewell aragog"", and the powerful transition from the castle to that cave struck by giant sea waves). But it was supposed to be a much better soundtrack, improving the previous. Though beautiful sometimes, it sounds poor and repetitive -even he copy music moments from Order of the Phoenix and stick them into this film, and personally, that says to me how worry the film makers were for creating a good, original, dramatic story.Hope they don't screw both next ones, especially with the plot - and I hope J. Williams comes back to write the suitable and magnificent music Potter deserves.Hope!! It's what we have now.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
951,mrblonde889,one of the most stylish potter films,8,22 July 2009,"Many people will comment on the large chunks of the novel the film has missed out, however most people do not go to see a Harry Potter film purely for the story (if you only like the story of Harry Potter then just read the books as it is impossible to successfully tell the story in 150mins). People go to see the directors vision of that story. And in this sense the 6th Harry Potter film is truly successful. David Yates creates a visual style that shows his unique vision of Harry Potter and makes a film that truly stands out from the rest in the series. This style can clearly be seen in the flashbacks that are some of the best bits of the film where an inky blackness is used and where Tom Riddles voice always echoes slightly. If you liked Alfonso Cuaron vision of Prizoner Of Azkaban then I highly recommend this film.Although in my opinion there are problems in the story telling (the ending felt a little rushed to me) this is a truly great, stylish film and a must see.The regular cast are always improving with every film but there are some unexpected fantastic performances, Alan Rickman is a fantastic Snape as he has been since the first film. Helena Bonham Carter is, sadly, not in the film enough and I spent the whole time wishing to see her on the screen again, she is perfect for the role and like Alan Rickman adds her own unique style to the character. Tom Felton creates a much deeper Malfoy than in previous films creating a fully fleshed out character. Jim Broadbent, although very different than his character in the book gives a surprisingly subtle, touching and truly excellent performance. The soundtrack features some new fantastic pieces of music especially 'Malfoys' Mission' and 'Ron's Victory' and a piece that is associated with Ginny and I now consider these my favourite pieces of Potter score, however some of the score was a little stereotypical such as 'Farewell Aragog' but the large number of great tracks make up for this.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince

It was really boring,",1,23 July 2009,"I had watched all the Harry Potter movies but never the books so I was watching it with no hangover.I was therefore shocked to see how boring it was - both my brother and wife fell asleep half way through it. I was still wondering till the very end when the story will pickup after the rather exciting opening.Most of the scenes had no meaningful purpose, there were parts which just left us hanging there with no explanation whatsoever.To us lay people, if a movie can bore one to sleep, its a failure; simple as that. Such a terrible letdown and waste of film time.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
953,shinjuu-1,"Best book, worst movie",1,23 July 2009,"This movie lacks subtlety. It's just one sequence after the other in a mad race whose goal is quantity rather than quality. The characters are sketchy and superficial. Dumbledore looks like an old fool with absolutely no sense of humor and no clue about the whole horcruxes business. The half-blood prince(in spite of the title) is almost irrelevant, a joke between friends. Snape, whose revelation ""I am the half blood prince!"" is almost comical since nobody really wondered about that, is almost transparent(a crime, considering he's a key character and the role is played by an outstanding actor).While in the book romance is a welcome distraction from the darkness of the story, in the movie is inexplicably the focal point, making everything else (half-blood prince and horcruxes included) look unimportant. The whole attack on the Burrow scene is just a waste of time, and that's upsetting if you consider the amount of things that were cut for lack of time. All in all, I feel like the movie missed the target altogether, and I wonder if J.K. Rowling read the script at some point... IMO this is the worst potter movie made so far, and that's a pity because the book is spectacular. And now I am really worried about the two final movies...",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
954,stevebommarito,Fantastic Segway...,9,24 July 2009,"Whether you will love or hate this movie seems to depend almost entirely on whether or not you can accept that it is in fact a movie based upon (rather than a literal translation of) the book. If you recognize that the screenplay writers needed to take extreme ""poetic license"" in order to cram the ""essence"" of such a long book into just 2.5 hours, then you will most likely enjoy this movie tremendously. Furthermore, you will leave the theater anxious for the next installment because this movie does a great job of setting up for the Deathly Hallows. Like the five HP movies before it, this one strays greatly away from the book it is based upon; however, it does a wonderful job of communicating the overall ""message"" of the book. I loved seeing how each of the characters has evolved and I must admit I've become quite ""emotionally attached"" to them in that I cared deeply what happened to them while I watched the show. In addition, I am really looking forward to what happens in the next movie. The only reason I wasn't so upset at Dumbledore's demise at the end (as I was the first time I read the book), is because from book seven, I now have the benefit of knowing why as well as what will happen next. For me, this is arguably the best Harry Potter movie so far and I may even head to the theater again (I usually wait till DVD release to watch them a second time).On the other hand, if you are a literary ""purest"", you will most likely pick this apart for all that is missing and/or different from the book. There are plenty of other reviews here that go into great detail on this topic so I won't elaborate. I suggest those of you that fall into this category don't waste your time and money seeing it, because you will only leave the theater frustrated and maybe even angry. For the rest of us, this is pure Harry Potter Bliss...",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince

Very like the fourth , fifth movies. The lack of information in the movie can be found contained in the book. This movie relies very heavily on visual effects and romance.Despite the negatives,there is some very good acting from Tom Felton and Michael Gambon, a great interpretation of Lavender Brown by new comer actress Jessie Cave. This movie has missed vital aspects from the book, everything is thrown in. Making the movie very difficult to understand.

958,spragginsgjr,The movie was OK but having read the books I didn't like the changes!,5,26 July 2009,"I just finished watching the movie and found it disappointing as compared to the completeness of the storyline in the books. The movie characters did an excellent job in their individual performances and interaction. The photography and visual effects were once again a pleasure to watch. The movies' storyline was OK but the changes made by the director/screenwriter subtracted substantially from the original story without any enhancement. The movie also eliminated several areas and characters of the book that are of importance in the final book. I would prefer to watch a 3 hour movie than to lose vital portions of a story to editing. Hopefully the individuals who made this movie will be far away from the final 2 movies or add a disclaimer to the beginning that states, ""if you enjoyed the books and their details you will find these movies OK for entertainment but not accuracy!""So my overall opinion and recommendation would be, if you enjoyed the other Harry Potter movies you will no doubt enjoy this one as well as it is very entertaining, moves along at a good pace and keeps you captivated. However if you have read the books and enjoyed the detail, the interweaving of critical characters, sub-plots and intricacies, then this movie will leave you somewhat on the flat side and wishing that Rowling would not allow people to change an already proved storyline.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
959,rooneywayner-1,Why change a plot?,5,26 July 2009,"For an avid fan of the books this movie doesn't live up! Its changes are so dramatic and drastic that it twists the original plot and destroys the settings for the next two movies. This book was set up to have a very dark plot with comedic scenes. However the director focused more on the comedic scenes and completely straying away from the dark themes. I understand it is essential to cut back certain scenes from the book in order to make a concise film. However the film is approximately over two and a half hours. It seemed like that the director choose to leave out the key defining moments of the book and focus on the smaller details. Emma Watson is a great actress for her age, however it seemed the director portrayed as a crazy jealous girl. The subtleties from the book are completely ignorant. Rupert portrayed Ron with some quality. Daniel Radcliffe, though many may disagree, is very one-dimensional and has trouble shifting from happiness to uncertainty. They never developed the relationships between Tonks and Lupin they sort of just throw that at your face. There is absolutely no chemistry between Ginny and Harry! This is unfortunate but was an essential characteristic of the book. The memories, why cut the backbone of the plot. This was essential in explaining the horcruxes and sets up Harry's adventure in the next book. They took only two memories which were shown with great quality. They never explain what apparition is, and again just throw it out at you. The movie uses lot of elements from the book, however they never explain anything. Why is Dumbledore allowed to apparate into Hogwarts? This was a stupid change, even if he is the one of the greatest wizards in the wizarding world. Why does Harry watch from below like a true coward? All the film portrayal's of Harry is one of action, why do they change that? It made so much sense in the book that Harry is physically frozen and immobile due to Dumbledore's sacrificial nature. They portray Dumbledore as a weak coward, that Malfoy can disarm? Why do they burn the Burrow, what significance is that, that is such an important setting in the next book! I read that Yates wanted to keep the fighting to a minimum in this film, as the next couple of movies are centered thematically around battle scenes. They even say that Dumbledore's funeral is the opening of the next film. Lets hope that the next two films are more accurate to the plot. Its an adaptation, not a creation on its own. Lets hope that the screenplay and direction and overall plot is not changed to such an extent that hurts the original plot! On the whole this movie is fairly enjoyable it in it as a film, leave out the book and appreciate the movie for what it is. As a true Harry Potter fan don't hate the movie entirely. Lets just hope that things change in the forthcoming films.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
960,fiedly24,Harry Potter Gives you the Finger,1,2 August 2009,"HP Giving you the Finger? I was happy to see Wormtail get a little screen time, his part in the book was about as big as his part in the movie. While there are differences in the book version and movie for this scene, there is one glaring detail that both HP book fans as well as HP movie fan can both agree on. We see poor Wormtail is living with Snape, he opens the door to greet Snape's guest and what do we see, a stubby little hand missing a finger wrapped around the door. Wait a second, that was the hand he cut off to bring back Voldemort in GoF, the hand that is now a brilliant silver fully functional hand.But don't be disappointed just yet, this is only one of about a thousand liberties (or glaring mistakes) you will find in this movie. I had to wonder, after seeing the film, if the script was written from a version of Cliff Notes.So I'm sure it's no surprise that I tell you, Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince is a major disappointment. This is by far the worst HP movie to hit the silver screen and David Yates and Steve Kloves should truly be ashamed. While the movies have taken liberties in the past, none of the other HP films have ever been this horrible and disrespectful to JKR's books.Riddle me this? We get a small look into Tom Riddle's life as a boy. I have read many of the reviews where people claim this was an excellent look into Tom Riddle's life, what a wonderful job. Well hate to burst your bubble, but these little flash back looks into the pensive where not just to get a look at little Tom Riddle, they were the clues to lead Harry to the locations and items Voldemort used to as Horcruxes. If you read the book, you get to see much, much more of Riddles life and the items that he found worthy. However if you only watch the movie, you will be left on the sidelines along with Harry who now has no clue where to look and what to look for.The Durseys In the past this family you love to hate has been set aside. The Dursey family has always been a wonderful mix of comedy and a look into Harry's past. While a disappointment to not see the family again, one must accept that some bits of the books need to be cut to meet the time requirements allotted to the film and we know JKR has grown to write some very long epic tales.However I doubt anyone expected to have the Durseys replaced with the underground train scenes. This scene added nothing to the development of the movie development, however it did a fair share to degrade it. Harry ignores the fact that he has never had any Muggle money and spends most of his summers riding trains in London. Less we forget that there is a huge war going on and every Death Eater is looking for him and those on the side of good are risking their lives to keep him safe, but a summer of train rides and hitting on muggle girls fits in the movie well.To War or Not to War If you read the book, then you notice there is a huge war going on, people killed and gone missing, villages uprooted by giants, people everywhere are scared. The effects of this war are not just in the secret wizard world, but are felt everywhere. The movie opens with a decent scene of a bridge collapse and a kidnapping, but after that tiny bit of information you would be hard pressed to think there is a war going on.To be continued....",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
961,koko-kolev,The worst Potter movie EVER !!!,3,29 July 2009,"I read pretty much comments here and most of them found the sixth installment of Harry Potter for ""beautiful"", ""dark"", ""mature"", ""great adventure"", etc.Well, people, I totally disagree. I am fan of the books, so it's not the Harry Potter universe - it's just the movie - which went terribly wrong.First let's see what we had in the book - two amazing and breath-taking battles - one around the Ron's house and the second at the end of Hogwarts. We have very dark atmosphere, some evil plans, a lot of Snape and Slughorn, a lot of Snape's story and most important - a lot of the book of the Half-Blood Prince. Let's don't forget the unforgettable funeral at the end of the book and the nice time spent in the book with that particular hero.What we saw in the movie was a total disaster. The characters were playing like some idiots at 50% of the time, because of the incredibly stupid script, which focused on the Ron's and Hermione's love story and their personal problems. I admit there is such a story in the book, but hey - it's not the core of the Half-Blood Prince. We receive almost noting from Snape, almost no Quidditch. The first battle is around 1 minute and shows just NOTHING! The second battle is more interesting, because it's just MISSING.All scenes shown in the film are half-made, the whole script is half- made, the music which used to be heart-melting is awful, the whole action has been cut, all the important parts of the story are missing (the evil plans, Ministry of Magic involvement and the new Minister, the Aurors and much much much more). The only thing you get is the story about the horcruxes. In fact - the film uses 1/3 of the book - that 1/3 that every other director and writer would cut from the script. On the theater's exits most of the people was still wondering what was the Half-Blood Prince, why is that name, what is the story, and all that kind of stuff. The phrase ""What just happened?"" was almost everywhere.In this film happens nothing. I believe they left some for the first part of the Deadly Hallows, but then again this sixth movie was completely unnecessary and pointless.If this director and this writer are involved in the last two movies, no one of the true fans will watch that crap. Be sure of that.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince

Trust me this Harry Potter does not disappoint.There was some things left out of the book such as the funeral, the battle at hog-warts & some memories which was disappointing but it was nevertheless was a faithful adaptation of J.K. Rowling magnificent book.The Acting: Daniel Radcliffe as usual gives a stunning performance of Harry Potter. Michael Gambon steals the show as Professor Dumbledore, this man is one of the best actors I've ever seen to portray a character such as he has. Alan Rickman is such a classic actor & he is great as Snape. Jim Brodabent was perfect for Slughorn and was truly a great choice. Rupert Grint was funny as Ron Weasely. Emma Watson is great & very sexy as Hermione granger.This Harry Potter was not only the most entertaining & saddest.

The visual effects were top notch and you see acting that can only come from people who have basically grown up together. You can tell that they're not only friends on the set but off the set as well, but I digress. I don't really need to give a basic plot line but I will anyway. Harry and friends are back at Hogwarts and Dumbledoor has Harry after Voldimorts secrets via. memories. Anyway It was an enjoyable film and I recommend it. The only reason I wasn't able to get into the series was because I thought it was geared toward a younger audience and that the first three films were a bit childish.

964,sandreuz,"Horrendous movie, Disastrous adaptation",2,3 August 2009,"I cannot remember when I have seen a worse movie than Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince... As a movie it is really bad. It lacks pace, finishes on an anticlimax, and it has no plot, absolutely none. As the screen adaptation of the sixth installment of the Harry Potter series, it is a disaster. All the important stuff has been cut out and the movie is made out essentially of some of the secondary subplots of the book. I mean, we see the Quidditch match that starts Ron's relationship with Lavender, but what about the Quidditch game that starts Harry's relationship with Ginny? And then, ironically, while so much of the book is missing, they had to actually invent scenes that are not in the book to get some action going! And it's not even good. I mean, how come Bellatrix and Fenrir (who is not even introduced, but it doesn't matter because he never meets Bill anyway) just show up one night at the Burrow ? So much of the crucial stuff is missing out (many reviewers have listed what is missing on this site already that I won't repeat it here), that it is hard to understand how those who have not read the book can actually follow the story, or appreciate why Harry and the Half Blood Prince was such a brilliant book. The scenario is one of the worst ever. Just imagine: Harry suspects Draco to be a Death Eater just because he saw him in Borgin and Burkes. After Harry uses Sectum Sempra on Draco, Snape just stares at him and lets him walk out without even saying a word! When Dumbledore takes Harry to the cave where a Horcrux may be, we don't even know how the cave was found. But the worse is at the end, when Hermione says to Harry just after Dumbledore has been killed that ""Oh by the way, Ron is OK with you dating Ginny"" (AAUUUGHHH !!), when actually the movie completely misses out on the building of Harry and Ginny's relationship. That line just killed me, and it has to be one of the worst ending dialogue in a movie ever.Worse still, it is hard to imagine how they will make a good 7th movie (or movies, as the rumors go) with this one as an introduction. Think about it, we are not even being told what the Horcruxes are, so Harry does not even know what he is going to be looking for! I anticipate then, that the next installment will be as awful as this one. Amazingly enough, this movie is rated 7.7/10 on this website at the time I'm writing those lines and those who have given it good reviews praise mostly technical things such as its cinematography, its soundtrack, the close ups...Since when have these things been enough to save a movie with no plot or storyline ? Being a Harry Potter fan and having read and reread the books many times, this is not why I go watch a Harry Potter movie. I go because I want to see put onto screen the great story and characters of the book, and in this, this movie is an utter failure. I have never written a comment about a movie before, but this one left me so angry and disappointed that I had to do something to get it out of my system. How could JK Rowling let this happen??",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince

Couple of thingsSeverus sneep, was there a plan? why did he kill dumbledore? if he did so at all?(guess he did according to the book. The Werewolf teacher from previous parts told harry that it maybe so that sneep is helping evil in order to learn more about it . No buildup there... What about warning dumbledore? didn't that cross his mind at least once?? he had months to say it to him right????Harry found a a book that said "" this is property of the half blood prince . Oke so the halfbloodprince is some nerd who scribbled a nickname in his book? has it got any more meaning other than that? the film is called the half blood prince, and i still know diddly squat what the half blood prince really is, other than that Severus is the halfblood prince . But why halfblood prince? is he halfblood? is he a prince of some kind? Why the secrets?This movie makes no sense what so ever and was too predictable and cuddly for anyones good . Draco, sending trinkets that are cursed or poisoned to dumbledore... and than not able t say the words avada kadavra? what the.. and severus sneep coming along and killing dumbledore. Couldn;t he have foreseen this?The killers strunt through school like proud peacocks and nobody notices? apart from the guy being swung out of the door by sneep?

They didn't show dumbledore's funeral.And more things but hey, like I said before, they can't fit everything into it and it has to make sense to the part of the audience that hasn't read the book. It has to connect with the other movies. This is a movie, not the actual book. It has to be interesting and exciting to all audiences. And some of what they added to the movie made the movie very exciting and funny! Even a seven year-old enjoyed it! The producers and screenwriters did a great job with the movie.

In The Order of the Phoenix, the fight scene at the Ministry of Magic was all about Harry even the the Order and the DA were helping him. Now we have the Burrow, which is in the middle of a field not surrounded by trees, burning down courtesy of Bellatrix. Why was this scene even in the movie? Or why was Bellatrix shown destroying the Great Hall? Not in the book. Or the ending, when Harry chases after the Death Eaters. NOT! But done to ""focus on Harry"". Those 3 scenes could have been taken out and Dumbledore's funeral shown instead. Harry doesn't have to go it alone until the end of book 7. Crikey people.

I really don't see how anyone that is a fan of the book can possibly like this P-O-S. Why they continue to allow David Yates to ruin the Harry Potter series is beyond me, what a mistake. All that tells me is that the producers don't really care about the content of the film just that they look flashy - AT BEST or that JKR is just a complete sell out and doesn't give two sh*ts about HP anymore (then why should I?)

Not disgusted by the fact that certain key things got left out of the movie like Bill and Fleur, Scrimgeour, the massive action packed end fight or Dumbledore's funeral or the fact that Greyback was in fact not just a regular death dealer but a werewolf, which are not just critical parts of book 6's story but also critical for book 7.

Not disgusted by the fact that the main focus group was girls of the age of 12-16. No I felt sad about all that, what I felt disgusted by was MYSELF because I had helped fund this piece of garbage and no matter how much I regret paying for my ticket, they already have my money, I also regret the fact that I already KNOW I'm going to 7 just in the off chance that they won't **** it up like they did with this movie.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince

However, the wonderful novel lies in its ability to stimulate readers to text ""translation"" into the image, as to the quality of finish you made from your own dishes, and the silver screen version of the slightest mistake would be like a factory produced canned or box. Look at ""Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"", I suddenly have a mind of such a thought: Since when large is no longer so excited and we look forward to it? ""Transformers 2"" failed to achieve the expected positive, wish I could get to see a large number of pleasure, but out of theater, I still can not help but be disappointed, perhaps, that is, there is a large free word-of-mouth box office era. Film begins, only the destruction of three fresh dead bridge scene in London so I was impressed, the screen smooth and compact, quite magical epic style, even if similar scenes in other types of movies often appear, nor the audience have a delay of tension and mental stimuli.

Rowling would like to take the case on the magical children's novels are psychological and delicate imagination, but the film and the novel The biggest difference is that, in conjunction with the various elements of a proportion of a coordination, rhythm and accurate image works, it is clear that it failed to achieve this. Gloomy picture for the pursuit of effects and music so that it turned into a horror film. It does not matter, it is necessary to know the horror film has been in the West, with its huge market, integration of the magical elements of a horror film should be the pursuit of its direction, before that, a lot of viewers have criticized the film in the series of long-winded and tedious, and it To regain favor, but also should focus on the performance of the magical world of magic, rather than the emotional world. Wrong movie magic to a youth large as to make a romance. Can not see the movie to see We can not recommend to see is a difficult task, my personal view is that it is spending the summer together with the film feast, but also to see from time to time to see a movie, watch and do not depend on whether you are ""Harry Porter, ""the avid reader or movie fan, whether or not to stand against the entertainment business brought about by the temptation of large. I believe many viewers because of this trend can not stop the arrival of the manner in which the concept of shadow into the theater, being the case, then they would have to have a certain degree of tolerance to its heart. Special enough to put together the story When a large audience of the screen it started to pay more attention to the neglect of the plot and atmosphere, it can be basically found in the continuation of a number of film, the creators have the wits --- ""Ha 6"" This apparent . ""Drama is not enough special effects to take care of"" and the modern advanced technology to help the film ""Ha 6"" entertainment through a crisis because, if not throughout the whole film and suppress the context of gray tones, the film will lose more viewers at home.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
974,Tita_gervasi,Do not understand why Yates felt the need to rewrite the story,5,8 August 2009,"While I understand that the director had a limited amount of time to try to fit in the details of the book, his interpretation of the film fell flat.The director has done an injustice to the vision of the book.Besides badly rewriting various portions of the movie, the climax should have culminated with the battle in the castle between the students and staff of Hogwarts against the death eaters following Snape's killing of Dumbledore.Dumbledore froze Harry to the wall under the invisibility cape where all he could do was helplessly watch Snape's killing of Dumbledore. To say it was ""lame"" to tell Harry to go downstairs and have Snape approach Harry and ask him to ""shush"" is ludicrous. Harry's character would never have allowed him to just stand there and watch without intervening.In the rewrite, the death eaters enter Hogwarts through the vanishing cabinet stroll in and stroll out of the castle. That made absolutely no sense whatsoever since the whole premise of the book was based on the entry of the death eaters through the vanishing cabinet.There were other areas of the movie in which the director could have chosen to cut back on and concentrate his efforts on leaving the viewer wanting more rather than the sense of ""did that just not happen?"" Maybe Director Yates needs to read the books. I am hoping that perhaps if he does, then maybe he won't feel the need to think he can do a better job of rewriting it.In future, if you are not going to stick to what the author wrote and insist on diluting it, save us all a lot of grief and don't bother to make a movie about it.Disappointed.T.

975,D-girl92,Hello.,1,9 August 2009,"it was the worst movie I've ever seen!!!!!!!!!!! The movie was a disappointment, the other HP's have been very good, so i expected much out of this to. The beginning was confusing, and didn't make so much sense! And the whole point of the movie... the only thing that we got to know is that Snape was a death eater ore whatever and Malfoy become a death eater as well. and that Dumbledore died, + all the romantic CRAP that was in it -.-''' HP is not a romantic film, so what was that all about? well, lets just say that the whole film was boring, and didn't make sense. So you'd better do a really good movie next time, I mean HP 7, or else u're gonna loose a lot of customers...",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
976,abdelrahman_92000,Not very good movie,4,9 August 2009,Hi i watched this movie a month ago i wanted to comment but i didn't read the novel back then so as most of people said the movie missed a lot of the action that were in the novel and some which is really important for the 7th part one of the things that really made me mad the burning of the burrow scene which was completely out of the book!!!! Also a lot of the memories that dumbledore showed harry isn't in the movie and of coarse the fight in Hogwarts isn't there too which was going to be really good if it was there also harry and Ginny relationship was no where to be found except a kiss!!! well a lot of people said if u haven't read the book before u watched the movie u will find it gr8 well i haven't of coarse it was fun but after all its a Hp movie and i excepted more of it!,Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
977,cathys-7,HBP is a wonderful movie,9,10 August 2009,"I found Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince to be a movie filled with humor, thrills, and suspense. Now to address some gripes some reviewers had with this film.-The destruction of the Burrow was added to put in some action. JK Rowling herself said that she had even considered putting this in her book, but went with the meeting between Harry and Scrimgouer instead. Besides, filming for the wedding for Deathly Hallows I took place on August 10 so, yes, there will be a wedding.-Ginny hiding the potions book instead of Harry in the Room of Requirement.... Did it occur to anyone who complained about this that she may very well have hidden it in the same location Harry hid it in the book? All she has to do is tell him what to look for.-Harry not being immobilized under his Invisibility Cloak....Harry doesn't have his Invisibility Cloak with him for this scene. And even if he did, how, pray tell, would the audience know that a nonverbal spell had been cast? Just because something can be in a book doesn't mean that it can be readily duplicated on film. Dumbledore telling Harry that he is to stay below and not say or do anything without his consent works just as well.-Why the presence of the Death Eaters when then wasn't going to be any battle? IMO, the few that did sneak into Hogwarts via the Vanishing Cabinet were there solely to witness that the job got done. In other words- sneak in, make sure the deed gets done, then get out.I give Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince a 9/10.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
978,alang_1111,"Finally, a Harry Potter FILM not a collection of memorable book scenes",8,13 August 2009,"This is the first film to me that felt like a proper film rather than a collection of favourite scenes from the book, jumping from one to the other and hoping you didn't notice as you kinda enjoyed seeing them come to life.This film stood on its own, it didn't get drawn off down side avenues, it gave the characters who needed to be seen room to be seen.I actually really liked this as a film and it didn't feel like a dragged out cram it in experience. It made its own choices, it decided what was important. It refused to do much pop-candy oh we must show how wonderful the wizarding world is.Liked it a lot, and the choice of actor for Slughorn was inspired.Now I really look forward to the conclusion.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
979,anian06,HP fans,1,13 August 2009,"If you are a fan of HP and haven't seen this movie yet, consider yourself lucky. Don't even think of watching this one. This movie is surely not meant for HP fans. Its purely for M&B fans..!! I amnt sure why the director got so obsessed with the teenage romance. He shdnt have messed up with this one which is one of the most important books among the HP series. In this book, there is complete change in the life of all the characters and thats hardly brought out in the movie. Dumbledore dies and you don't even feel it..!! So much happens to Draco Malfoy and thats hardly brought out..! The movie makes one feel as if HP is all about romance and that the other things are just ""pass on"" events! Grave grave injustice to the very essence of this book and to the HP fans. I really regret having given my money to this movie by watching it. Real pathetic direction and screen play.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
980,tarynw-1,Was a bit disappointed...but still good.,7,14 August 2009,"Well I have always been a Harry Potter Films & Books and have always loved them. So i was so excited to see this film, I read the book again for the 3rd time before I went to see the film.In the beginning I was rather disappointed, you could see a lot of ""fake"" things in the film, i'm sure all this could have been fixed with a little more effort in editing. Editing holds so much you can do for a film. Especially when Harry walks with Dumbledore in the alley, you can see it's not the sky above, you can see it was filmed in a warehouse. Also the little places along the street, there was one shot in the film where I am sure you can see that it was cardboard made.But as the movie started flowing, I started to like it, Ron was extremely funny in this movie. But i would have preferred Harry to kiss Ginny after the Quidditch match and not in the Room of Requiremnts. It was just so much exciting, also in the film Ginny kisses Harry and not Harry Kissing Ginny. So yeah they did get off track at times with the story, little things they could still have kept in the movie.Eventually in the middle of the film, I was a bit lost to what is happening, because when i watch the movie i follow the storyline of the book in my head. And as it seems they left a lot of the story out, yes I do understand that they need to stick to a certain time window. But the movie wasn't in a straight story line, it was a zig zag story line for me.Yes very violent, I was cringing in my seat when I saw the little kiddies watching it too. They should've had a strict age restriction.But with Harry, Ron and Hernione good acting skills, and my love for Harry potter films, it made up for my huge disappointments. Sometimes I think that the 4th and 5th film was better than the 6th film, especially in the area of editing and preparing proper props for the film. Such film takes huge preparation and i think they were a bit lazy, as if they took shortcuts with Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince in certain scenes.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
981,andreaschess,this movie emptied the book from any meaning,2,16 August 2009,"I've waited a while for this movie, and like most, I've seen two trailers. The first one was focusing on Voldemord and let me foresee a movie focusing on the genesis of the dark lord. It felt quite exciting and chilling. The second one seemed more spectacular, but composed of ill-assorted bits of intrigue, and suggested chaotic writing and an obvious lack of purpose. After watching both, one after the other, I felt rather confused about what to expect from this movie... It was either bound to be brilliant or messy. Too bad, this movie is awfully messy.A good thing to know : This movie has absolutely no subject.Understand me well, I'm no terrorist of missing details in on-screen adaptations of novels. For instance I thought ""Watchmen"" was too faithful. But here, absolutely no subject is treated. The rise of fascism? No. The genesis of a dark wizard? No. Harry's fascination about the Half-blood Prince book? Hardly drafted. The political aspect of public opinion manipulation (with Scrimgeour)? Hahaha, let's laugh a bit: not even suggested. A love story? Even though the movie seems to focus on this aspect, this point is also a failure. For instance, Ginny is supposed to be popular, an important social aspect in high-school psychology, and a strategic effort for her to get to Harry. Once again completely missed!This film talks about nothing! The book developed so many interesting threads that it is difficult to imagine how the writer managed to dodge them all in order to do such an incredibly dull movie!Other details also annoyed me, but they're lost in this immense nothingness, like: - When Harry takes the felix felicis potion, was it intentional that he should walk like he's drunk or retarded? - After casting the sectumsempra spell, Harry flees like a coward instead of calling for help and taking responsibility. This aspect is particularly inconsistent with Harry's character. - Young Tom Riddle is supposed to be smart and seducing. In front of Slughorn, he is just cold and posh. - When Dumbledore is in the cave, underneath the cliffs (hadn't we read the book, should we wonder why the hell they go there in the first place), he knows at once that he has to spill blood on the walls. We're not far from Ed Wood's movies here! - The photography is one of the few good points but the editing is brutal, unimaginative and trailer-like.Like many here, I'd like a redo or at least that they change the team before doing the last episode. Director Yates told he wanted to do a funny movie with the half-blood Prince. What a weird idea, for a start! And secondly, it is not even funny, but most of the time plainly caricatural. On the contrary, Alfonso Cuarez 's interpretation was far more darker and funnier at the same time, which suits rather well Rowling's writing. Please Mr Cuarez, come back! Harry Potter really needs you!!!",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
982,star_325,Not great,2,17 April 2010,"Lets face it, films are never ever going to be as good as their books, because books can have so much more detail that films can't have due to time restrictions. However this does not mean that you can just veer off from the book completely, I mean, there are only several things that are remotely close to the book:1) The Ron-Lavender relationship is pretty much what I thought it should be... 2)Slug-Club, It isn't really that much of an important plot point and they spent just enough time on it... 3)The Horcrux at the cave- I liked this bit the most, I thought they did it really well...But there are so many more things that outweigh those few good things:1) The whole Dumbledore death thing is horrible, i mean Harry is just standing there doing nothing while his mentor is being threatened by death-eaters 2) Harry-Ginny, this has got to include some of the most awkward scenes EVER filmed, they were truly cringe-worthy. 3) Dumbledore collecting Harry, just randomly collecting him from a train station with no explanation as to why, and no justification why he has to return next summer 4) Horcruxes(the memories) these weren't explained at all, is Harry just going to stumble luckily across the remaining Horcruxes? 5) The revealing of the Half-Blood Prince, summed up in one word: anti-climaticAnd then there are just random bits added or removed:1) The Burrow burning down- eh? 2) Luna finding Harry on the Hogwarts Express, and Tonks & Lupin's relationship completely removed- okay in fairness this isn't that important in the long-run so I'm not going to deliberate on it. 3) Bill and Fleur's relationship, how , how, HOW? are they going to start the next film? All in all my least favourite HP film.Sorry for the lists, it's just an easy way of summing everything up.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
983,simon15-1,The book - great steak -- the movie - not even hamburger,3,24 August 2009,"I agree with the other parties comments on this specific movie. Half-Blood Prince was extremely chopped up, jumped around scenes too quickly, and was too focused on romance. I've read and listened to the unabridged audio book of HP #6, and there was not enough information in so many of the scenes to make heads or tails of things. Granted the movie was about 2 1/2 hours long, it could have stood for some axing of the romance, or putting in another 15-30 minutes of scene filler to give more definition of what was going on. I tried to take it in the view of a person who had never heard or read the series, and I think that person would have thought the director had a channel changer remote control mentality or some sort of attention deficit disorder. The Order of the Phoenix movie suffered some of that as well, but seemed to have a better following story line than this one. And with Deathly Hallows being a two-parter, I hope the story line is not so chopped up.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
984,tomsleath,Good but not as good as number 3,7,13 September 2009,"I found this potter film relatively good and I think it is the second best. It is dark and funny with some superb performances.This film is different to the others in the sense that not much action happens until the very end. This one was a lot more like a romantic comedy by making the love lives of the different characters the central plot for a significant part of the film.This film didn't live up to Harry potter and The Prisoner of Azkaban probably because the 3rd book is shorter and can include more of the book's plot. The third one may have a cleverer plot but this film has more emotion.The performances by the actors generally good with yet again a superb performance from Alan Rickman. The three main kids, especially Emma Watson, have turned out to be quite actors have have left there days of overacting from the first couple behind them. Tom Felton gave a particularly good performance as Draco Malfoy and was incredibly convincing. However there was a poor performance from Bonnie Wright who immediately spoilt the illusion of the film with a wooden performance which is a shame because she was good at playing the nervous Ginny in the first few. Finally the newest actor to join this franchise is Jim Broadbent as Horace Slughorn who frankly didn't fit the part in my opinion. He is a very credible actor he just wasn't how I pictured Slughorn.Overall I would say this film is worth the watch and I would recommend it. 7/10",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince

They talk about stuff they haven't even explained so you probably wouldn't know what they were talking about in the movie if you haven't read the book. It's ridiculous! And to think I got excited to go see this movie. I sat through the movie thinking: where is Bill and Fleur? Why didn't they even talk about Horcruxes? Why was the Burrow burned down? Where was the wedding? Where is Scrimgeour? When did Lupin and Tonks get together in the movie? AND WHY IS THERE NO BATTLE AT THE END OF THE MOVIE!?!?!?!? I am confused as to why J.K.

987,ssquires1104,Terrible!!!,1,8 October 2009,"I was so disappointed in this film. I counted down the days until it's release and went to see it on opening day. What a waste of time and money.This movie completely butchered the book. Why even have ""Half Blood Prince"" in the title if you leave out the critical parts of the story that revolve around and eventually reveal to you WHO THE HALF BLOOD PRINCE IS? The final scene with Snape was complete rubbish.Snape is an important component to the entire series and to butcher this story is to basically butcher the entire series. I don't even think I will bother going to see the last two films but rather wait until they come out on DVD and rent them from red box for a dollar. It's complete utter nonsense that they are making it into TWO FILMS anyway. It's only a money making scheme so that WB can milk HP a little bit more.The butchering of the story aside, the acting was TERRIBLE in this film. The scenes didn't seem to flow and the dialog seemed slapped together. It was almost amateur.This movie sucked bad.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
988,smilensodaz,As a fan of the book I find the adaptation to film didn't mesh well.,6,17 October 2009,"Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince was an amazing book that contained central ideas which were not faithfully and accurately represented in the film. Firstly, Harry is guided by Dumbledore through different memories of specific events concerning the antagonist Voldemort. Harry is asked by Dumbledore to take special classes that involve understanding the true nature and development of Tom Riddle as he evolved into the story's antagonist Voldemort. The story as it was told in the book was a complete dissection of Tom Riddle's character. It showed how Tom lacked genuine positive affect towards his peers at school. Harry learned how truly focused Tom Riddle was on the manipulation,coercion,and domination of individuals at school. Later on as the memory lessons continued Harry is exposed to a new Tom Riddle one who has become destructive and murderous. Dumbledore reveals to Harry the true extent of Tom Riddle's obsession with power leading to the eventual transformation into Voldemort. Not much of this is in the film as to lead one to wonder why such a main part of the story was left so bare of any life. The director, David Yates does not faithfully explore the triangular relationship between Harry, Voldemort, and Dumbledore that is so pervasive in Harry Potter's world most notably as to the fact when he fails to distinguish how important all of Voldemort's memories are to Harry's own view of himself. The problem is that someone who hasn't read the books or seen the other films can't decipher how much of an impact Voldemort's personal development and actions have affected Harry's own individual thinking and behavior in Half Blood Prince. The memories that Dumbledore reveals to Harry are so important that to ignore the viewing of one leads to an incomplete preservation of each of those character's foundation, story, and film. As to not seeing all the memory scenes as a fan who is looking forward to them it is disappointing and sad as they are not in the film. Also, keep in mind that the essence of who Tom Riddle has become drives Harry and Dumbledore's emotions and actions in their final quest together. Consequently, not to include all the memories takes away from the importance that memories have in making Harry and Dumbledore go search for the last Horcrux.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince

J.K. created a masterpiece and then sold everything down the drain for money, I will try to remember the books as they were and the characters as they were described, I hope you will too.

The popularity has been decrease compiler to the previous movies . I think that people are annoying but I hope they won't be for the last . It is supposed to be the Harry Potter which has most of actions. My favourite part was the intoxication of Ron with the love filter while he had completely lost his normal behaviour and also cruising professor Slughorn.

It was not a bad film but in contrast to the book so much (what i would see as vital) information has been omitted. I find this really sad and now wonder how much is going to be left out of the final film considering they have shut doors on plots from this one that finish in the next one. Do they intend to incorporate everything important to the story line, omitted from film 6 into film 7? If this film is a taste of things to come then i think the last film will not quite live up to previous Harry Potter films, and will thus end an brilliant series on a very poor note.

Whilst Chris made two very accurate adaptations and set the tone, David Yates has not only captured the feel of the sixth book but also added a lot to it so that the movie becomes an entirely separate entity. For those who have already read the book this movie will be a good surprise because they will find that the director takes several liberties in terms of the plot but all those for the first time don't destroy the movie but enhance its effect and those who haven't read the book are in for a treat because the movie has some amazing special effects and some really good performances this time around.

993,klane1995,"Artistic masterpiece, but wrong atmosphere",6,7 December 2009,"I'm a reader of the books so this might be a tad biased. I enjoyed the movie very much. It seemed more mature than the other movies in way, just the visual effects and stuff. Artistically speaking this movie was beautiful. My favorite scene was a panned view from outside the castle. It went from Hermione and Harry sadly sitting downstairs, a moved to show Ron running upstairs with his girl friend and then zoomed out to show Draco on a balcony staring over the school grounds. It was perfect; the lighting, the way the feelings of the characters were displayed and it all just fit in wonderfully. Besides a few scenes like that though, I found it had the wrong atmosphere. All of Hogwarts now knew that Voldemort was back and killing yet there was so much joking around, it didn't give the movie the seriousness that it deserved. I felt like they were making it into a joke, and that would have been find if it was any other movie but the Half-Blood Prince. The flashbacks were filmed and acted quite well. I must say I really liked Tom Felton as he acted Malfoy. This movie was more centered around Draco and Tom Felton did a terrific job of depicting the character; he was very creepy. When Harry and Dumbledore were in the cave the inferni (dead people) came out of the water I liked how the inferni looked and how it gave that ""jumping"" feeling. I found that after Dumbledore's death, the funeral and everything was much too rushed to be sad and that the movie failed to depict the relationship between Harry and Dumbledore so that when Dumbledore died and Harry was all sad, anyone who didn't read the book was left think ""Okay, why is he so sad? He barely knew the guy..."" To abbreviate I liked the movie's filming but it wasn't all that well paced near the end and I found the atmosphere wrong for the story so because of it's flaws I'm only giving it a 7/10.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince

I didn't go and see it at the cinema, as I heard bad things before it's release. My kids went and my daughter told me it was bad. Just to make things clear, I am a huge fan and have read all the books more than once. I finally saw it and was horrified. The only two things that were even close to the book, were Slugthorne and Katie Price. I understand that things do get changed, but this was completely re-written. I'm presuming that Harry has moved to London, as there are no train subways in Surrey. Where on earth did you get that Harry loved riding trains. Blowing up The Burrow, was so wrong and so pointless. Nothing was anywhere near. How can that mess of a story carry on into the next films. I am presuming that you haven't read the books and therefore don't have a clue what your doing. I will not be buying it and I will not go and see the last two. It has been completely spoiled and I have never been so disappointed and angry in my life. The end was so bad.

Such as fenir greyback, Hermione creating the canaries, and many small details that can also be found in the book. Also many of the things missing at the end of the movie are going to be put into the beginning of the next movie, such as the funeral. I think we should stop concentrating on what the movie is missing, and focus on what it has. No book can ever be perfectly made into a movie and include every single detail, that is just impossible, so as a whole the Harry Potter movies have done a pretty good job in incorporating the books into the movie and not having us sit in the theater for 5 hours, though some of us wouldn't mind that.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince

I read the book, although it was years ago since it took so long for the movie to be released, but I really had a hard time following the movie because the book wasn't fresh in my mind. My husband, who has never read the books, had no idea what was going on and lost interest fairly quickly because he just couldn't follow it. I thought this was a terrible movie, due to a lack of a clear plot and just utter confusion from scene to scene with no transitions. We really had no idea what was happening through most of the movie. This director is terrible. He ruined the 5th movie and it appears he has no plans to improve. It's a shame.

It's been done over and over.I'm here to just throw in my two cents about how disappointed I am with this movie. I'm an avid Harry Potter fan. I have waited with the baited breath every time a book or movie has been released. I entered #5 like every other time but left disappointed. It caused me to be apprehensive about the release of #6 and rightly so! I'm aware that at times movie-makers have to take certain liberties when translating a book to the silverscreen but come on! This was a horrible fiasco! Is Warner Bros. seriously going to allow David Yates and Steve Kloves to ruin the end of this series? HP fans should unite and let the studio know that we want to have creative times that honor the integrity of the novels!Yates is a oaf for creating such a vile, unrepresentative and clumsy version of Half-Blood Price. Kloves is a hack that was hand a wonderful story and managed to mangle it and destroy the work of J.K. Rowlings.Shame on the both of them. I only hope that Harry Potter fans of the world never let them forget it! And one more thing, the cinematography was horrible! I had to wait for the DVD so that I could rewind and focus on the dark corners of the screen and see some of the things that go on. I know it is supposed to be dark but it should at least be filmed where people can see the film!",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
998,ash_and_dylan,Shockingly bad adaptation of a great book,1,28 December 2009,"Wow, that was truly awful.I'm not even remotely connected with being a screenplay writer or Director but know 100% for certain I could've done a better job than those clowns. How did they get away with this travesty of a film? I agree with others, it needs to be redone. Whilst film eps 3,4 & 5 weren't great for those who read the books, they were at least acceptable. This however, was absolute rubbish.Nothing made sense, nothing matched up, key plot points left out, key characters just missing, key scenes missing, irrelevant scenes put in & extended. Its as if the makers deliberately tried to make the worst adaptation possible.Bad. Just bad.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
999,frenchbread81,"Good, but missing key points",6,1 January 2010,"Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince was my favorite of the Harry Potter series, however the movie was a big disappointment. The very beginning is what got me the most. I was looking forward to see Dumbledore tell the Dursleys to quit treating Harry horribly, but instead, they show Harry being completely reckless during the summer, and Dumbledore just picks him up at a train station, which didn't happen in the book. I was also disappointed how a few of the actors played their roles. Daniel Radcliffe didn't seem to play his role as Harry Potter as seriously as he did in the previous movies. Emma Watson also seemed to lack. The actors who I thought did the best were Alan Rickman, Michael Gambon, Tom Felton, and Jim Broadbent. The story focused on too much of the romance instead of Dumbledore showing Harry about the Horcruxes. I recall Dumbledore showing Harry only two or three memories. Dumbledore showed Harry many more in the book. And the Weasleys' house burning down? Where's the wedding going to be in Deathly Hallows? The movies also started to lose the magic that the previous ones like Sorcerer's Stone and Chamber of Secrets had. I was pleased with David Yates' interpretation of Harry Potter and the Order of the Peonix, but after seeing Half Blood Prince, I am a little worried how (Even though it is being split into two movies) Yates will interpret Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows. Overall, as a movie itself, I think it did well, but compared to the book, disappointing.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
1000,thelostone2009,How are they going to fix there mistakes,1,7 January 2010,I understand that the next movie will be split into like Kill Bill. Too bad Tarenteno cant direct the next one. They did such a bad job I see no way that the next movie can even fix what they did. No funeral. Thats where the elder wand is at. And Ron's house burning down. Half of the 7th book takes place there. Jk Rowling should sue those bastards for destroying her book. But I guess she still gets paid. I would like to take this time to thank Warner Brothers for doing such a shitty job. I'm not even sure I will see the next one. I hope and pray that they will do justice. Or let Chris Columbas do the next one. He seemed to know what he is doing. Note to all don't buy this movie. If you never read the book you should like. If you did boycott the next one with me if they do a shitty job like this one,Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
1001,prun5,honest review WITHOUT spoilers,10,20 January 2010,"In the 2009 screenplay, written by Steve Kloves, Harry Potter is brought into a new light. He must choose between the paths of a normal teenage life or follow to be ""the Chosen One"" and destroy the lasting remnants of Lord Voldemort. Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince is the new action, fantasy, and adventure movie of the year, with just a hint of romance and mystery. Staring Daniel Radcliffe as the lead role of Harry Potter, Rupert Grint (Ron Weasley), and Emma Watson (Hermione Granger), the trio set off in their 6th year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.Traveling on the trains of London, taking his mind off things, Harry runs into his headmaster, Albus Dumbledore (Michael Gambon). As Dumbledore is trying to convince Harry to continue his studies at Hogwarts, he also takes him to retrieve the former Professor Slughorn (Jim Broadbent) and bring them both back to learn and teach at the school. Beginning his first days of school Harry is encouraged to take potions under the teaching of Slughorn. Not expecting to take this class, Harry is forced to use a tattered old book, which he finds, belonged to the ""Half-Blood Prince""; this book gives him a serious edge over the class. Besides schoolwork Dumbledore has also asked Harry that he get into a closer relationship with Slughorn. In a meeting with him, Harry learns of a memory Sulghorn has tampered with, concerning very dark magic, and how it might be the key in which to destroy Voldemort. Taking advantage of winning a luck potion in class, Harry is able to retrieve the actual memory. With his presumption being correct Dumbledore takes Harry to find the next Horcrux. On their adventure to obtain the Horcrux, they experience mind-altering liquids to drink and the wrath of inferi. With Dumbledore weakened, both return to find Death Eaters ready to fight to Voldemort and back up Draco (Tom Felton). What will the outcome be of Harry's close friend and mentor, Dumbledore? And have they solved the mystery to defeat the insurmountable Voldemort?Along with great acting there has to be great people behind the scenes working to put the movie together. The special effects in this movie are what develop the entire feature, which intrigues people to watch. An example of some of their amazing work is showed at the very beginning when the Death Eaters destroy the Millennium Bridge. This real life bridge was matched and ruined all by HDRI imagery and a crew of up to 20 people to animate and build the bridge all in 3D on computers. Another special effect added was the inferi. These zombie- like reanimated corpses are not your typical zombies. Using Industrial Light & Magic (ILM) the inferi came to life in art, a 3D maquette, and computer animation. Motion-capture technology was combined with hand animation to create the final product, with special lighting to make them look fleshy. It took 6 people 45 weeks to create the inferi, then a team of 25 artists to complete necessary shots, ALL for a total of 2 minutes of very impressive screen time. This is only the beginning of all the things that director David Yates used computers for to bring this imaginary world or wizards to life; like Dumbledore's decaying hand and the Weasley's joke and candy shop.I thought this movie was a great representation of exactly what goes on in the book written by J.K. Rowling. It won a numerous amount of awards including the PFCS Award and the Teen Choice Awards, and was nominated for the Grammy's, People's Choice Awards (USA) and the Satellite Awards. From the music, to the acting, to the special effects, this movie really came alive in the arms of all the Harry Potter fans, making them even more intrigued for the next movie to come out. I would HIGHLY recommend this movie for any family; as it is the wonderful story of a boy and his troubled years to discover who he is and who he ought to be.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
1002,falcondreamer90,"Torn, But Over All, Not Very Good",4,14 February 2010,"I found myself very torn with this movie. I am an avid HP book lover and have not been too happy with the adaptations since David Yates came into play. However, Half-Blood Prince was my favorite book, barely beating out Deathly Hollows, so I went to go see it when it came out.I suppose if you haven't read the books, or you have the capability to forget everything about the book and just focus on the movie, the screen play would have been excellent. The visuals and acting are phenomenal. The jokes are really funny. It's a great depiction of the characters growing up and facing normal teenage problems. Smaller characters are brought to the front and given their due.However, for those, like myself, who've loved the books, it was a major disappointment. They left out crucial plot points – not just for HBP, but for DH as well – and added scenes that were not needed. There was no battle at Hogwarts. There was no Dobby and Kreacher being ordered to follow Draco. Indeed, Dobby and Kreacher (and Hagrid, Bill, Fleur and Percy) were noticeably absent and Harry was not as crazed about Malfoy as in the book. There was very little about the Horcruxes, the entire basis of the seventh book, and barely any background on Tom Riddle. Harry hid under the floor boards, completely unlike him, while Snape killed Dumbledore. The Burrow burns down, despite the fact that there would have been numerous protections around it to keep everyone safe. Lavender and Ron's relationship is grossly centralized, while Lupin's and Tonks is randomly thrown out there and barely mentioned. If memory serves me correctly, the fight between Snape and Dumbledore (mentioned by Hagrid in the book) is not anywhere in the movie, even though it adds to the suspicion about Snape in the rest of the book and following book.Some people may say that these things are small, but they add to the plot and over all story line.The only thing I can say is that I hope Mr. Yates finds a way to fill in these major plot holes in the seventh and eight movies. Perhaps he should follow the books more closely, or at least not edit out so many important scenes.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
1003,dizzymizzyk5,Don't be over dramatic!,7,22 February 2010,OK. so i may not be the biggest potter fan in the world but i think you're being slightly over dramatic! The wedding between bill and Fleur is not exactly vital. and as for not being able to understand what is going on it is plain enough... i have read each book albeit only once but i still understood what was going on throughout the whole thing. and as for overplaying the whole thing between Ron and lavender they had to somehow downplay the dark side of the book so that it was still suitable for the younger audience and somehow i think they well have to do the something with the seventh and eighth film unless they plan on cutting off half of their audience. If you want the full story your obviously not going to get it in in 2.5 hours! there's only so much they can put into the film... and people enjoy the films... so they read the books as well. As for the battle scene although it wasn't fully panned there was still a hint of it and the reason Snape did nothing and didn't fight back is because HE'S ACTUALLY A GOODY!!!! The funeral scene however i agree was essential and missed out however since the next one is 2 films i would care to venture the guess that the opening of the first one will be the funeral... just as a way to remind people what happened at the end of the last film!,Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
1004,elankw,Disappointing,5,20 July 2009,"Visually, this film was beautiful. All of the actors were at the top of their game (special nod to Helena Bonham Carter - scared the heck out of me). My one problem - and it's a big one - was the ending.SPOILER ALERT!!!!!What the heck happened to the battle scene? Didn't they have a funeral for Dumbledore? Where was Bill Weasley? Why did the Burrow burn down? How the heck are they going to transition into the next film? (I'm not even going to get into the fact that they completely skipped the storyline describing Tom Riddle's biological parents)The book ended on such an exciting note. My heart was pounding as I cheered the good guys and cried for Dumbledore. This film robbed me of that. It ended with a fizzle. The best part of the book was completely ignored. I honestly don't know how JK Rowling could have signed off on this script. David Yates - you got some splainin' to do!",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
1005,kissiebobissie,"OMG, What Happened ?!",5,2 April 2010,"Can somebody please tell me how JK Rowling allowed this ?! This movie is rubbish ! Out of the HP series HP 6 is my favorite. Why ? Because of the action parts, the comedy, and of course the romance. But how come this movie focused on ROMANCE AND COMEDY ?! What the hell happened to the ACTION ?! It's gone, the BEST part of the book ( The battle in Hogwarts ) IS NOT IN THE MOVIE !! But, wanna know what's in the movie ? The BURROW BURNING DOWN ! I mean seriously WTF ?! That WAS NOT in the book so please tell me why it's in the movie ?! I am mad at the director not just the director but the whole crew for ruining what could've been my FAVORITE movie ! I watched this movie because I was expecting loads of action scenes not romance and comedy ! Sad to say I wasted my money on a movie that had disappointed me. Don't get me wrong I enjoyed parts of the movie I liked HP 6 a bit, but then again I HATE it ! PLEASE, I beg you, DO NOT ruin HP 7 because that is also one of the best books in the series. I am expecting HP 7 to be a great film because it's cut into two parts meaning they have ALL the important details on the book ! So please HP 7 better not disappoint me, and all the others who are avid fans of the books.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
1006,ilovetowatchmoviesandtvt,Where is the magic?,3,6 April 2010,"As a big fan of the books, I have to say that ever since the third HP movie it's a really huge disappointment.Despite all the plots they are missing out (for example: the funeral, the battle in the end ), and all the weird plots they added in (the burrow burning down, Ginny tying Harry's shoe laces???it's a really awkward scene......and a lot more), I just want to focus on the set of the movie-- the world that was supposed to be full of magic.1. Do you remember the enchanted ceiling of The Great Hall? 2. All the ghosts are missing in this movie( for example: moaning Myrtle was suppose to screaming in the scene where Harry and Malfoy was fighting 'cause it's in Myrtle's bathroom)3. The paintings aren't moving anymore, where's the Fat Lady????4. The staircase aren't moving anymore:(5. Where is Dobby and Kreacher and all the house elves??? 6.Was Fawkes in this movie? I can't really remember . And all the other magical creatures 7. They aren't performing any spells in there classes there're aren't any Apparition Lessons 8. I really hoped to see the house of Gaunt and so many other things that Dumbledore was suppose to show Harry in there classes~ 9. Ohhh, and there's a vampire in the book, Sanguini, in Slughorn's party. But it's pretty OK that he's not in the movie since he's not the most important part ..just thought it might be interesting . 10. Crabbe and Goyle and Fleur and so many other characters are gone. And there are lots of other small stuffs that make Hogwarts different-it's a ""MAGIC SCHOOL"", but instead, in this movie I just felt that Hogwarts is a really beautiful ""Muggle"" castle that happens to be full of students holding wands as props~ they could really do better.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
1007,maisie-mullings,People Need To Calm Down,7,2 July 2010,"People need to calm down and stop whining about the film. They are so obsessed with what they think the film should be like they don't want to accept it. I feel people are expecting too much, they build up fantasies where the film will be an exact translation of the book. Who wants that!? It would be completely boring and the film would be far to long. It is fine if you feel they should have included more (i agree) but there is no need to get so angry and write of the whole movie. It would be interesting to see how many complainers could fit a fairly large book into a short space of time and satisfy both readers of the book and people who have only seen the films while keeping the mood and setting the tone and plot up for the next book. Also the next book is being made into two films, they might want to make this film more light-hearted and romantic because the next two will be dark throughout most of it. They might squeeze more of what was missing in this film into the next.I really like the film and am reviewing from just watching the Deathly Hallows trailer (which looks amazing!) I loved Slughorn, he was perfectly played and consistent through the film. Loved the Felix moments, which allowed Daniel space to show a different Harry. Tom Felton was brilliant as Malfoy even though he did not have much screen time. Not enough credit given to Jessica Cave for her wonderful performance as Lavender, which really gave the movie some laughs. Rupert Grint was very funny as the love struck Ron and Emma played the heartbroken lonely Hermione well. The mood of the film was constant and beautifully done, bleak landscapes and the amazing opening shots. I felt that the battle should have been included, or at least a smaller battle and more details (the Dursleys). I hated some of the moments between Harry and Ginny, but I never really liked them as a couple. Overall very good movie, brilliant Acting and camera work, needed some improvements, but I can look over those",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
1008,sreihani,Loved the book but extremely disappointed with the movie,3,3 July 2010,"The movie just like the last, is a complete disappointment. I started watching the Harry Potter movies when the second movie came out. I could not understand the fans and the whole excitement surrounding the books. One day with the suggestion of a friend to read the book and not judge J.K. Rowling based on the films, I picked up the books and literally could not put them down. They are masterpieces and fun for all ages. They are extremely well written with so much to give. Unfortunately the films are the opposite. The books were one better than the previous as they came out, the movies were one worse than the previous. I just can not understand how J.K. Rowling allows such destruction of the books? It is a betrayal to the readers and the fans of the series. If you see the movie and you are a fan of the books you will be VERY disappointed. The message of the book in butchered out of the movie and the story in not there and its torn to pieces. Just a Hollywood production with dollar sign in mind. If you just like to watch the HP movies it is a So So experience for you. The last HP book did not disappoint the finale to a timeless masterpiece. It is with fear and anticipation to be disappointed again that the HP fans are waiting for the next two movies to come out representing the last HP book in the series (the only hope is that if you watch the movies on classical literature such as Charles Dickens, they remake them. So may be for the future generation(s) we would get a better production based on the HP books). In summary I loved the book but was extremely disappointed with the movie!",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
1009,ramuknurak,Worst adaptation from HP books,3,11 July 2010,"This is the worst of all. Lack of screen time cannot be a excuse for this. They wasted so much time in showing Romance. Rowling uses Romance as a diversion in the books. Half Blood Prince is about Voldemot and how to kill him. Harry has to understand his weakness and find ways to kill him. This is the simple theme of HP6. Director just simply forgot this. The beauty of the books are the plots are water tight. One simply cant find a hole in it. While in the movie,there are huge plot holes. How are they going to explain how Harry is going to find the Horcruxes. This movie is just a one time watch and we just have to hope that the next one will be good,given that they are taking it as 2 movies.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
1010,sklemens,This Movie is a Travesty. Don't Let Your Kids Be Brainwashed by This Drek,1,9 November 2010,Its just terrible. The acting is choppy. Dumbledore has lost his charm. Hes not funny or original hes gay. The old dumbledore was gay but he was mad good too i think i could act better than this guy. Harry has a strained relationship with harmoney. I never was the biggest fan of harry potter but i enjoyed his early years. He was all over the place doing cool s$1T with cool people like haggard and fred and george. Everyone has lost their charm. Save the money and go on a bike ride with your kids. These actors are always putting each other down. In conclusion if you want to watch good harry potter keep it to four and below.

1011,littletasteofpandie,Disappointment and Shock,1,21 April 2011,"When Harry Potter first came out, I was immensely impatient to see it. Each time a new Harry Potter movie was advertised, I would sit there, counting down the days, until it was released on DVD so that I may purchase and watch it. See, where I live, our movie theatre does not support the means for the deaf and hearing impared to benifit from watching movies in the theater and therefore, while everyone else is rushing off to the movies to see something, those of us whom are hearing impared must wait for it to come out on DVD so that we may activate the Subtitles. Today, I finally got around to watching Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince. Actually, now that the newest movie is out, I decided to refresh my memory and watch each and every one of the previous movies, prior to going out and purchasing the latest movie. So, imagine my shock and disappointment, when I made it to Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince only to discover that, unlike it's previous movies, this particular Harry Potter movie did NOT have English subtitles for us hearing impared individuals. Therefore, I was unable to watch this movie, and see little to no point in purchasing the next one, or the one that will be following after that. After being an avid and loyal follower, and ensuring the purchase of every special edition of the Harry Potter collection of movies, I was thoroughly disappointed to discover that Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince differed from it's previous movies in failing to provide not only English Subtitles through the DVD language menu, but compatibility with a televisions Closed Caption option as well. I cannot tell you HOW this movie rated as far as storyline and acting. I cannot tell you if it was BETTER or WORSE then it's previous movies in the Harry Potter series... I can only tell you that I could not watch it because they failed to take into consideration that even the deaf are loyal followers... It is with deep regret that I must say goodbye to my love of the Harry Potter motion pictures... And all because they could not take the time to consider the fact that they started with Captions and Subtitles in English, and thus they should continue to do so...",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
1012,JulM1963,Too choppy and not enough 3D,5,21 August 2009,"I am a huge Harry Potter fan but I was highly disappointed in Half Blood Prince. While this director did an amazing job on the last film, this one presented too choppy in my opinion.I saw it twice at a regular theater it's first full day. I really hated the way they shortened the relationship of Harry & Ginny as well as the whole loss of the Dumbledore funeral scenes. It just didn't seem to have the flow that the last film had.In my opinion it wasn't worth the higher price ticket to see it in 3D when only the first 15 minutes or so was wearing the 3D glasses. It had the potential to be so much more spectacular, yet failed miserably. How thrilling it would have been to see the Horcrux retrieval scene in 3D or the fight between Harry & Malfoy in the restroom.The last film had such amazing effects that this one did not even come close to the potential was a severe let down.I hope the next two films are more fluid.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince

1014,peters87-231-644373,Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince: A Continuous Battle between Good and Evil.,8,6 December 2011,"The 6th movie in the Harry Potter collection, this movie is another journey of Harry, Daniel Radcliffe, in a struggle against evil. His close friends, Ron played by Rupert Grint, and Herimone played by Emma Watson join Harry to try to find the person who is responsible for the treacherous acts at their school against Professor Dumbledore and who is the mysterious owner of Harry's textbook called the Half Blood Prince, join Harry. The movie keeps the viewer entertained with the finding of clues and puzzles to solve in order to find those who are part of the notorious band of Death Eaters, those that have pledged allegiance to Lord Voldermort. Through the film, certain romantic relationships unfold. While these events take a back seat to the main plot, they hold importance in the characters normal lives and future. The end of the movie will have the audience wanting to grab the next Harry Potter movie as soon as possible to find out what happens next. It seems that there are similarities between Draco Malfoy played by Tom Felton and Harry. They come across as total opposites but both are powerful wizards that have the support of different groups. Each has their own agenda to be fulfilled, though each stands in the way of the other. They are destined to be enemies. Professor Snape looks after Draco and Professor Dumbledore looks after Harry throughout this film. Again, Snape and Dumbledore are very different from each other in their behavior and appearance representing good and compassionate to insensitive, cold, and vicious. The majority of the Potter movies have played upon this same theme. The previous Harry Potter theme in The Order of the Phoenix was very similar to this one. It involved Harry and his friends trying to stop the evil followers of Lord Voldermort from enhancing their position to become more powerful and destroy those wizards that attempt to stop them. There is some humor in the movie but for the most part it is dark film and tragedy arises in this film with sacrifices made in order to stop Lord Voldermort. The movie used interesting color effects to portray the theme. The color was almost non-existent to the point of a black and white hue. I feel the director wanted the viewer to focus more on the actions of the characters. This use of low color hue helped us from being distracted from pretty scenery and kept our attention on what is unfolding throughout the film. This low color filming also seems to help enhance Harry and the others struggle against the evil forces working against them. The music helped to enforce the themes in many of the scenes. There is a fight scene between Draco and Harry. The music is fast paced, as is this action scene. Harry and Draco are chanting deadly spells at one another as items around them blow up or are destroyed. The music is loud and encompassing with the sound effects of the spells increased to increase the battle between the two. There is another scene where Harry and Ginny battle the Death Eaters out in a field. The music is again tense and evil sounding reflecting the presence of the evil characters and their devious intentions. The movie has twists and unexpected outcomes that catch the viewers off guard. The struggle of good and evil continues throughout the movie and is reflected in movies' use of color and music. The editing and use of camera work bring this fantasy world to life and make us feel we ourselves are part of this everlasting struggle to conquer the evil the Lord Voldermort and his followers. I have a great appreciation for this film they way it was created and presented the theme throughout the film.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
1015,ellen88,99% disappointment,2,17 July 2009,"To begin with I would like to say if anyone has an address to write to David Yates so I can tell him what a mess he has made of the best book in the series could you please let me know. This is the first time on any film I have truly been angry enough to want to say something about it. Some previous comments say only the most die hard fans of the book won't enjoy this film. Well firstly thats not true, I know a few people (bearing in mind today is only the third day of release at my cinema) that either hated or were extremely disappointed with the film. Secondly I would have thought the fans should be the people who were considered the most important to please. As far as I'm concerned, there has been little or no thought towards how much the fans needed this film to be mostly like the book. Naturally they could never fit everything in without making it into two films, but the fact that as far as I can remember, every scene in the book between Ron and Lavender was put in the film but the most important ones like Riddle meeting the Gaunts, his father, Hepzibah Smith, the importance of where HARRY NOT GINNY leaves the Princes book in the room of requirement were all left out. The ending was an utter disappointment, when I read the book I was so upset, the film... nothing. Harry was left to stand by like a coward whilst Dumbledore was killed. The Death Eaters walked off site without a care in the world, Harry shows two attempts to get back at Snape, it was absolutely dreadful. I lost pretty much all hope with the lame additional scene at the Weasleys, if they hadn't put that in we could have seen the battle at the end of the film and Dumbledores funeral. Another irritation is the fact that not once is Dumbledores black hand explained, the way Harry and Ginny REALLY got together, the fact that they are actually broken up at the end of the book. Key characters were either non existent or practically ignored. I can only guess that Bill and Fleurs wedding is off since they weren't even in this film. I'm outraged that Nevilles only line was 'I didn't get into the Slug Club'. In the book he does. In my opinion Neville has been made to look like a loser in this film as he was in the first few when in fact as he showed in the 5th film he is brave and a brilliant wizard... just like his parents. One final point, I'll be intreagued to find out how Harry works out what the horcruxes are as the Hepzibah Smith scene being missed out means Dumbledore could not give him the clue that Voldemort liked to use great and powerful objects to hide his soul in. In the book Harry knows what the majority of Horcruxes are likely to be. My only hope is the fact that number 7 is two films means they won't have to cut too much out and they won't mess around with the plot. I sincerely hope JK Rowling was not party to this film because if she agreed to even 10% of it, she is a complete sell out.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince

In my humble opinion, no true Harry Potter fan can be satisfied with this movie. The sad truth is that this is a bad movie. I am stunned that even with an enormous budget, fantastic story to tell and a cast of seasoned actors Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince fails miserably even to slightly amuse. I am very disappointed and if this was a service or product I'd had purchased I would consider asking my money back.

1017,Max_Gercke,Captured the feeling and characters,9,29 January 2012,"Out of all Harry Potter movies I like this one the best. It captures the characters and feeling of Hogwarts better then any other movie of this series. The atmosphere is thick and lets the viewer dive right into Hogwarts and the magical world it contains.The cinematography is top notch and sucks the viewer right into the movie. The colors are magical without popping out to much. I love the brilliant, sharp style that most of the scenes have, though some others go in the other direction and tend to blur out.The score is good but not excellent. It supports the action more then leading it, which is a good thing. Nicholas Hooper does a good job capturing the complex mood of the film.Rupert Grint is the star of the movie. He delivers his lines and jokes perfectly and adds a lot humor to the film. Emma Watson has her best appearance but still seems a bit stiff sometimes. Daniel Radcliff has both good and bad moments. In some scenes he is brilliant and witty in others his arms just dangle around and seem useless.Plotwise I loved the movie. I am so glad that the director and screenwriter decided to rather capture the feeling than trying to cramp all the story in two hours.

Director David Yates learns from his mistakes, coaxed better performances from the young leads and visually made the movie far more arresting than ""Order of the Phoenix'.This may not be for the fan base, as much is cut from the book and a fair number of changes made. However, on a cinematic level I found it entertaining, occasionally moving and a good lead-in to the final installments that came later.I won't go into the plot for fear of giving spoilers to those who have not read the books, but the movie is well-balanced this time out - the Potters have got progressively darker as time as gone on - here there is shading, with plenty of laughs to offset the darker moments. Rupert Grint appears to be developing some talent as a comic performer.Indeed, the actors all seem much improved after the listless Order Of The Phoenix. Michael Gambon at last makes Dumbledore his own, and Tom Felton gives his best performance so far as Malfoy. But Jim Broadbent steals the show as Horace Slughorn; along with Imelda Staunton in Order Of The Phoenix his is the best showing in the entire series. I also thought the music score was excellent after a few mediocre outings in the previous films. The film actually felt epic in a Lord Of The Rings kind of way; the first time I've experienced that with the Potter films.8/10",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince

1021,jparana,Nothing like the book!,2,19 July 2009,"I couldn't wait to see this movie, in fact, this was the 1st Potter movie I ever saw in the Theater! I went with 3 other people and out of the four of us, I liked it the best and I would give it a C-! The visuals were great and the acting on a whole was very good! If you hadn't read the books or watched the other movies, you will have no idea what is going on! Voldy in his adult form is not in the film and neither are a majority of the characters from the book or they are subjected to very minor roles! I want to state that I understand that you can't put everything in the book into the movie but cutting things and then make up things and include them is just stupid! This is done throughout the film and it doesn't help the story. In fact, it bodes ill for the next two films because it eliminates characters and places from them! A scene with the Burrow being attacked by the DE and it burns down! Yates put this in for a action scene instead of the climatic battle at the end at Hogwarts because he said the last movie will end with a battle like that and he didn't want to repeat it! We won't see the last movie for 2 to 4 years and by then the technology will advance plus it would have given Yates an opportunity to do a better battle scene than he would have done in HBP and lastly, the two battles are totally different! In the end by excluding the battle scene in HBP, the ending is very flat because Yates changes everything about Dumbledorf's murder. From the appearance of the scene to the actions of Harry and Snape, plus makes the whole story of Draco sneaking in Death Eaters a waste of screen time because there is no battle! He has Luna save Harry on the train instead of Tonks, I don't understand that switch. Ginny/Harry romance is totally different than the book, I thought the book did it better. Very little back story is done of Voldy/Riddle and horecruxes. The story The Half-Blood Prince is totally forgotten in Yates pursuit of teen love as are every other major and other sub-plots! I really enjoyed the romance in the novel and I did enjoy some of it in the movie but not at the expense of everything else! I love the Harry Potter movies but this one was so disappointing on some many factors! I can't believe Rowlings allowed them to do this to her novel! This movie will make millions but I think in the end it will hurt the franchise because I don't see many people going back to see it again and that is what defines a great movie!",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
1022,shadowofthesphinx,"Not the best, worst of them all.",6,13 July 2009,"Although this movie did have some great moments, they are far outweighed by the bad. It left out a lot of things that occurred in the book. I do understand that not every word of the book can be translated into the movie, but I definitely feel that they shouldn't have left out some of the things that they did. If you've read the book, you're well aware that Dumbledore shows Harry the memory of Tom Riddle's grandfather and mother. The movie left this out. It also left out the part where Dumbledore explains what items could possibly be horcruxes. The bathroom fight scene between Draco and Harry is mediocre, and not at all what one would expect.Bill Weasley and Fleur Delacour are not mentioned, Percy Weasley and the new Minister do not visit the Weasleys during Christmas, and the Minister does not try to get Harry to tell him where Dumbledore's been going off to. Slughorn is not short and round like he has described in the book, though I do admit that the actor was quite good at portraying the character. There is no mention of Eileen Prince, no Hermione telling Harry to give the Potions book to Dumbledore, and no detention with Snape. Quidditch is only mentioned twice, once at the tryouts (a very short scene) and again when Harry 'slips' Ron some Felix Felicis. There's no quidditch scene with Cormac injuring Harry with a bludger, and no mention of Ron Weasley dominating the final and helping his house to win the Quidditch Cup. No house elves are mentioned. Harry doesn't tell Kreacher and Dobby to keep watch on Draco, and it only shows Harry staring at the Marauder's Map once. The trio immediately know in the beginning that it's a cabinet that Draco was looking at, but those that actually read the books know that the trio don't know about the Vanishing Cabinets until Dumbledore's death.The list could go on and on. They changed a few things as well. Luna's the one that finds Harry on the train, not Tonks. Tonks doesn't look mousy and worn out at all. In fact, she looks as good as ever. Harry isn't petrified by Dumbledore while on the tower. In fact, Dumbledore tells him to hide underneath the room, by the stairs. Every avid Harry Potter fan knows that Harry would not just stand by and watch Draco and four Death Eaters kill Dumbledore. There's also no fight going on downstairs while Draco and a few of the Death Eaters are staring down Dumbledore, which is a shame, really. The producers and director of this film also decided to add a scene that doesn't take place in the book. I guess they did it to make non-readers of HP like it more. It just made me sick to my stomach. It seems that the makers of the Harry Potter movies are no longer concerned with pleasing those that were fans of the series long before the first movie took place. They are now focused on pleasing those who don't read the Harry Potter books, and would much rather wait to see the films instead of diving straight into the books.This is certainly my least favorite movie of the series. It was a waste of time and money. Let's just hope that the seventh installment is much better than the sixth.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
1023,gregghathhorn,Not Good Not Bad,6,15 July 2009,"When i finished the book, i was excited to see how the movie would turn out. The Book featured a lot of information critical for the next book, and well the movie seemed to forget some of it.i understand that its hard to fit all of it into a movie, and keep it entertaining. but Please don't make up things that were not in the book to move it on.. in the 10 minuets or so they made footage up, they could have fit some more important things in!The Harry + Ginny romance was rather... confusing. The Quiddich was way to short.. some things don't burn down in the book.. AND WHERE ARE THE DUELS???? i was excited to see all the fights, the first real action in the movies! but unfortunately :( Bottom line i feel if i didn't reed the books, it might have been a little better. i was expecting much more out of this movie, and suggest to all the people who haven't read the book, READ THE BOOK its much more entertaining and it may help you for when the next one comes out! its worth watching, but is not that great, really",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
1024,Rudolf-Fluetsch,Worst movie in the series,1,3 August 2009,"I don't know the HP books, this makes it probably easier for me to be forgiving about everything that's left out. Unfortunately enough despite this I did not enjoy the movie one bit. In all the other movies there were really at least as many nice episodes/details as to make the movie enjoyable overall. This one is the exception: It is not really fun. Taking into account that I do enjoy fantasy movies a lot and typically rate them higher just because I like the genre, I really think that this must be one of the year's worst movies if you are not a HP fan or a sucker for fantasy ... On the positive side: It's most frustrating when a series ends with the worst movie. In this case that is almost impossible :-)",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
1025,huimin_xuhe,"A Good Movie, but An Awful Harry Potter Adaptation",1,13 July 2013,"As a movie, the film is decent, but as a Harry Potter Adaptation, I think it completely butchered the book. I'm fine with the writers and directors cutting out parts of the book and changing other parts to accommodate for the subsequent plot holes because it is extremely difficult to create a 100% faithful film adaptation. That said, they spent so much time on other things and IMO didn't get those things right. Firstly, the Ginny/Harry relationship was awkward, underdeveloped, and not faithful to the books. Harry Potter falls in love with Ginny Weasley for her humor and sense of fun. In my opinion, the Movie-Ginny is very different from the book-Ginny and they didn't stay true to her character because Harry would not have loved the Movie-Ginny.Secondly, they added relatively meaningless events such as the Burrow burning down, while extracting key events such as Dumbledore's funeral, the Pensieve memories, etc. Moreover, the Burrow burning down violates some of the key ""laws"" of the Harry Potter universe. If the Death Eaters could burn the Burrow down and penetrate the Order's defenses, they could also kill everyone who was there. These changes which happened not because of a shortage on time or budget, but because the directors or writers thought they seemed interesting, take away from the integrity of the book and sometimes completely violate rules of the harry potter universe and remind the viewers that the story isn't real. What bothers me most is that the writers or directors replaced some of the key aspects of the 6th book such as Tom's background and the battle scene, with a Lavender-Ron romance which was really well done, and with a Ginny-Harry romance which frankly was unbelievable, unfaithful, and underdeveloped compared to the book's when they could have just followed the canon.Basically, the writers not only cut out highly emotional and important scenes from the book, which is sometimes understandable if you have to simplify the story, but also added in things which were completely uninspiring and unfaithful to both the books and the characters. Cut if you have to, but PLEASE keep the story intact.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
1026,khamsin59,A pivotal film,10,3 January 2010,"I think Half Blood Prince is quite an achievement as a film, which I think was Yates' intent. He has stopped trying to make books on film and started making cinema. HBP is, in a way, the end of the previous Potter series and the beginning of a trilogy that will stand on its own as great films that tell a truly Epic Tale. You can see the succession clearly if you watch the last three in sequence: Goblet of Fire, Order of the Phoenix, and Half Blood Prince. Each is darker than the one(s) before. In each, the main characters lose a bit more innocence (in a way, the first three were about Harry the abused nephew regaining a sense of wonder and innocence). The Harry Potter that emerges in HBP is not a boy-wizard anymore. He is a man, grown too soon. He is The Man who must defeat Voldemort. And he, Hermoine, Ron, and their friends must do it on their own, on the strength of what they have learned and the innate talents they possess. I am *really* looking forward to the last two films because Yates has now put his own stamp on the telling of the tale, and I love it. The young actors have matured in their characters and their craft to the point that they can handle the challenge of making film instead of a book projection.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince

The climax... there was none. Why... all of a sudden .. where those people in Hogwarts? There was no building up to it...The line delivered by Snape was so... poorly done. I mean COME ON! The only positive of this movie was Slughorn. The man who played him brought an interesting and fun life to this character.

All the Harry Potter movies are a disservice to the books and I wish they would all be redone someday. Nobody will read the books because of the movies! Read the books! The movies are badly done!! I didn't like the quirkiness and stupid jokes littering this movie or the fact that emotional and moving bits of the book were left out. Additionally I don't know if the way Dumbledore acted was supposed to add to the stupid humor or if they were trying to make him like that, it was dumb. The music on this movie was very fitting to the nostalgia of the books and the movie did get very emotional.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
1029,prikazsky_de_la_porte,HBP falls short of expectations....,6,1 August 2009,"I was quite disappointed by the outcome of the movie. The trailer seemed so promising...but then again, trailers ARE made to promote movies.It's a decent movie, if you're not a big Harry Potter fan. But for those faithful followers (and I'm sure I speak for most of them) this movie would, sadly, fall short of excellence.I think David Yates is a decent director. Far superior than Mike Newell (to this day, I still do not understand why he was chosen to direct GOF). Yates really has a knack for what looks good on screen. Meaning, he knows how to film things from certain angles, using different techniques to accentuate a scene. However, I think Yates lacks in his sense of storytelling. He really doesn't know what info is considered important. I was very upset to find that the movie only showed three memories of Tom Riddle (one of which is the one Slughorn tempered with, so in reality, only two memories). In the sixth novel, if I recall correctly, there were at least six memories, all of which were essential for the story arc. Without four (or more)of these memories, I feel like there are important puzzle pieces missing to the story arc.Tom Riddle's back story in the sixth book was the hook for me. The fact that there wasn't a defined back story in the movie upset (even offended) me. JK Rowling doesn't write just to write. There was a reason she put the back story in the novel, because it was essential. Without the back story the audience is left to do guesswork with only bits and pieces of information. This missing piece really changed the whole story and made (no offense) everything slightly lame. There was a back story for every single horcrux, explaining their significance. However, in the movie, they made it seem like Voldemort chose random objects to put his soul into. When Dumbledore and Harry arrive at the cave to search for the locket, the audience was left confused. Why is this cave significant? Why would Voldemort hide a horcrux in this particular cave? In the novel, all of these things are explained with in depth detail. In this aspect, the film lacked greatly.Sure, sure, because of the issue of time, the novel has to be crammed into a 2 hr 30 min. film. However, I feel they still could've squeezed in more essential information. For example, the added burrow scene was absolutely unnecessary. I felt like without it, a lot of other essentials could've been added in. Heck, they could've even shortened a couple of the Ron/Hermione/Lavender scenes to put more info in.Speaking of the Ron/Hermione/Lavender scenes, I have to say that I was also slightly disappointed. In the movie, I felt like Hermione was far more interested in Ron than Ron was of Hermione. It wasn't very Hermione-like to have her admit her feelings for Ron to Harry. In the novels, Hermione (and Ron) is written as a completely bull-headed and stubborn person who would never admit her feelings. So I felt the film portrayed her slightly out of character. And as for Ron, I was annoyed at his a-hole behavior. In the novel, the only reason Ron dated Lavender was because Ginny was dating Dean. So this aspect in the movie also upset me.With all that said, I feel the movie could've been much stronger. 6/10.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
1030,ambern-reynolds94,Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,8,24 April 2014,"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, directed by David Yates and screen play by Steve Kloves, is a captivating addition to the series. For those who have not read the series and only watch the movies, the movie definitely had enough in it to keep you interested and did not leave room for questions. However, for Harry Potter fans who have read the books, it is clear that the movie is missing some essential pieces that provide a lot more information to the plot. In both senses, it was still a good movie that was well produced with remarkable actors and actresses.Overall, Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince had an interesting plot, but still left some questions up in the air for those of us that have read the book. The Burrow is burned down in the beginning of the movie which was not a part of the book. The fact that they chose to add this in is confusing. When viewing a film that is an adaptation of a book, you do not expect to be surprised by new plot twists such as this one. When you go in expecting to pretty much know what will happen and something new is added in, it can be hard to wrap your head around. The movie really seemed to draw out some parts that were more minuscule in the book. For example, the infatuation between Lavender and Ron was much more significant in the movie than in the book. In the film this relationship between Lavender and Ron seems to take a lot of focus away from the plot of this installment. It is understood that when a book is turned into a movie there will be some things that can simply just not be included in regards to the length of the film. With that being said, I do not understand why Yates and Kloves chose to include and draw out things so minuscule to the plot and completely exclude and disregard such key parts that include depth into the characters and the understanding of the plot. I feel that the funeral scene should not have been omitted. That scene was important as Albus Dumbledore was a main character and so influential. The way they chose to end it instead did not to Dumbledore justice. They ended the movie with Hermione, Ron, and Harry on the tower talking about their plan and Hermione casually mentions Ginny and how Ron would be accepting of their relationship. Meanwhile, Ron is sitting right there still crying and mourning Dumbledore. Harry was much closer to Dumbledore and I do not feel that this scene made much sense.Though, I do feel as though this film did an adequate job of fulfilling most of the important elements. It is easy to follow along and it is by no means boring. This film is still a success as far as I see. Yes, you have a different view when you read the book and have certain expectations. Even with that being said, this is still an enjoyable movie. I know that it is hard to stay true to the book and I respect that. I feel that they had good intentions and wanted the audience who had not read the series to be just as engaged. All in all, the movie was well done. There were a few things that I feel could have been different, but my view is slightly skewed since I have read the book. It is not an easy task to turn a book into a motion picture. It is impossible to make it 100 percent like the book. Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince as a film accomplishes the standard of being a good movie. It is filled with a mixture of serious and funny bits. This balance is important so that it is not too heavy as a younger audience is the primary target.For the viewers that have not read the book, I feel that this installment to the series will be an excitement. For anyone, this film is most certainly enjoyable. It is nice to see the different side to Ron this film portrays as well as the strengthened bond between Dumbledore and Harry. There is also the ever present lingering of Voldemort as his return seems inevitable. I would recommend watching this movie. If you have read the books, it is important to try not to expect everything to be included and to have an open mind. I believe that that will really help when viewing this film and as you realize the differences.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
1031,seekquaze125,Harder and harder to understand,4,27 July 2009,"I watched this film over the weekend without reading any reviews to hopefully have a clear mind. Unfortunately, I was still disappointed.Starting with Prisoner of Azkaban, key plot points of history have either been severely underdeveloped at best if not mentioned at all. This film continues with that tradition with several of the key memories required for the set up of the next book as to where the horcruxes are or what they even look like are totally ignored. The plot with Snape being a death eater that would have be nice to have some set up in the previous films came totally out of nowhere.Instead of having a story that makes sense we have one that jumps around all the time with often only a single line of explanation (if that much) leaving audiences confused.I understand that in any book certain plot elements have to be cut, but instead of focusing on the main plot and cutting subplots we had the opposite. It turned what was supposed to be one of the darker films in the series to a light-hearted comedy with some darkness thrown in at the end.I suppose the visuals and acting are meant to make up for it, but they do not serve to make up for the confusing story. You have to read the book to get anything close to the depth of what Voldemort is or to even understand the film. I wish they would have selected a different director for this film and the next one. With so many undeveloped plots remaining I am left to wonder how they will tie them all up.Finally, Alan Rickman is a great actor, and I may be one of the few people to think so, but his portrayal of Snape throughout all the films has been disappointing. Whereas in the book Snape comes across as truly evil and emotional in the films he is just irritating. Harry's reasons for hating him are undermined or totally left out.What would have taken maybe about another ten minutes or some slight alterations is instead given to pointless comedy. I wish when making these films and remember to focuses on the plot, not the subplot.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
1032,Cinemateq,"Whoever has read the books and still liked the film, must have skimmed the books.",1,23 July 2009,"I am still reeling from the triteness and awfulness of this travesty of an adaptation. I noted that someone said that she had just finished reading it then went to see it and thought it was good! Cannot understand why. Perhaps she read it like Yates must have read it, with one eye blind and the other closed. Missing in Action: Head Boy and Girl, all the other memories, Ron's disastrous Quidditch episodes which would have explained why Harry needed to give him lucky potion; regarding potion - Harry did not take all of the potion, he gave it to Ron, Ginny and Hermione, which is why they didn't get killed in the final fight scene - oops, sorry there wasn't this scene in the film, and the stupid fight at the Burrows - not in any of the books that I read, Dumbledore also paralysed Harry at the end, under his cloak - I could go on and on; Ginny and Harry breaking up - what happened to that - not that they got together properly - I am so upset about this film.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
1033,thelovelygeek,Harry Potter & the Half-Assed Movie,4,29 July 2009,"I didn't hate it like I did PoA. It was a good movie. Great? No. Best out of all the movies so far? Hardly! Better than the last movie? Yes, in some aspects.Prior to seeing the movie I had finished re-reading the book to refresh my memory. As most of you know this is quite a sad story, which is why I haven't re-read Deathly Hallows since it first came out. Before I glanced at the what-will-be-cut portion of WikiPedia's page on the film, I was very optimistic about the film; however once I realized some VERY crucial scenes were cut I was already annoyed.If anything, this movie was supposed to be about Harry learning more about Voldemort. Instead, it was overshadowed by Ron and Lavender snogging all over the place! I understand that for the sake of budgeting and time, some scenes have to be cut. What I don't understand is changing around and adding stuff in the scenes you do include. By now the changing things around is really compromising the integrity of the film therefore leaving a lot of people who haven't read the book confused. My sister was confused. Joshua was confused. Joshua's brother was confused. I tried to keep the book out of my mind, and even I got confused! I expected the first chapter to be cut. The second chapter was included, but it wasn't the first scene. The Dursely's being cut I was understanding, but why couldn't they have Dumbledore picked him up outside of #12 Privet Drive and make some reference to the spell? WTF was with him being picked up at a train station after flirting with some black chick? Kinda reminded me of the train scene in Prince Caspian.I did like how they touched on the bridge being messed with and showing Harry numb from the events in the previous film. I loved Horace Slughorn and basically every scene involving him was great! Him as a sofa, hah! Now was it just me or was there a lot of emphasis on the pond near the Weasley's house? Harry apparates via Dumbledore there. The extremely UNNECESSARY and infuriating scene during the Christmas holidays was by the pond. Um, what? Diagon Alley was great with the Weasley's shop until they decided to go after Malfoy. There were key things that happened with Malfoy which supported Harry's theory Malfoy might be a Death Eater. In the movie they cut these small things out so when Harry expresses his thoughts on Malfoy being a Death Eater it sounds like he pulled it out of his ass. And unless you happened to take a really good look at the wanted poster, you'd never know quite who/what Fenir Greyback is.The whole Ron/Lavender bit was funny at first, but then it just got annoying. As one reviewer put, ""It seems that the producers of Harry Potter were aware of the growing popularity of the Twilight phenomenon and wanted to make their own teenage romantic love story as part of the series."" So true! The portrayal of Harry and Ginny's relationship was extremely disappointing. In the book Ginny didn't kiss Harry. Harry kissed her upon realizing she won the Quidditch match replacing him as Seeker. Any scene with those two made me want to barf because it was so over-dramatic, not to mention didn't happen like that at all in the book. They didn't even touch on their Peter Parker/MJ-like break-up.My biggest heartburn out of the entire film? The lack of memory scenes (which are a HUGE part of the plot and next book) and the insertion of the Death Eaters burning the Weasley home. In no way shape or form did anything remotely close to that occur to the Weasley house in the book. Didn't happen AT ALL! Why was it in the movie? What point did it serve? None. By only including 2 out of about 6 or so memories did the film makers waste 2hrs explaining one fact: Voldemort split his soul into 7 Horcruxes. And because there is no explanation the audience is only going to be further confused on how Harry goes about finding these Horcruxes.Here's the thing about the Potter series. Books 3 through 6 give thorough explanation on why Voldemort went after Harry, why his parents die, how Voldemort came to power, and how he can be destroyed. If you didn't understand what was going on throughout the book, Dumbledore was there at the end to explain everything. They have failed again and again to give the audience that same courtesy in the movies. Even if things like Dumbledore's funeral, Bill and Fleur's wedding and such are supposedly going to be in the next one, they're going to be wasting a lot of time in the 7th film to try and explain what wasn't included in this to make sense of the last two films.Bottom line: Cutting scenes to save time/money is one thing, but cutting scenes that are crucial to the plot and explain things is what makes this movie a poor one.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
1034,beatnik24601,Left Feeling Frustrated,6,16 July 2009,"As the title of this review indicates, I left the theater yesterday feeling frustrated. Because this film was so close to being great, had so much potential, and just didn't follow through, in my opinion.There were a lot of positives: visually the film was great: the photography/cinematography was beautiful, I really loved the color palette, the fx were the best of all the films, the art direction, set design, etc was brilliant. Also, the acting was much improved in the younger set of actors. I really enjoyed Tom Felton's performance in particular. Also, the older actors were great as always; Broadbent was a great addition to the cast. As far as the director is concerned, I thought he did a great job with the comic scenes, but...and now here are the negatives, I just don't think Yates knows how to tell a coherent story, or at least, not a Harry Potter story.To me, the movie felt like a bunch of disjointed scenes that had little to no connection to one another. The added burrow attack scene did nothing to advance the plot, didn't affect the characters and was never mentioned again, quidditch (while fun) added nothing to the story; the half-blood prince storyline was stunted to the point of being ...well, pointless, underwhelming and probably just confusing for non-book readers; it also made Harry's use of 'sectumsempra' less effective because there was no sense of betrayal because the movie never built up a relationship between Harry and the Prince. And other things, like even Draco's working on the cabinet was rendered pretty pointless since Yates omitted the final battle sequence, i.e. there was really no point in the Death Eaters even being there. And just little things bothered me that could've been easily solved with one line of dialogue: like they never explained who Fenrir Greyback was.I certainly don't mind omissions or changes from the book - if I want an exact copy of the book I'll just re-read the book - in fact, I probably would've cut out or changed more,in order to further develop plot points that'll be important later on (like a hint to what the other horcruxes are) or to further develop important characters (like Snape). I just question the effectiveness of the changes they did make...because for me they lessened the emotional impact of the story. This movie made me laugh, but it didn't make me cry and it should have, and easily could have with just a few tweaks.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
1035,darthmaul199,"Pretty Good, but let down by plot holes and over the top romance",7,18 July 2009,"Allow me to begin this review by saying that I am a fan of the Harry Potter novels and films. The books are sensational and the movies are fairly solid. Half Blood Prince was my 2nd favourite novel, so I was very eager to see the film adaptation. I'll focus on what is enjoyable about the film first, and assess the weaknesses thereafter.Firstly, unlike Order of the Phoenix, this film didn't feel rushed. It progressed at a fairly steady pace, giving the audience the opportunity to absorb new information. The opening was quit good; the death eaters attack on Diagon Alley and destruction of the Millennium Bridge nailed home the point that the Wizard and Muggle world is in a state of crisis. Dumbledore's random appearance at a muggle train station is highly irregular, but let's accept this is part of a film adaptation. Not everything can follow the wondrous work of J.K. Rowling. Dumbledore and Harry's Acting was very good; Alan Rickman as Severus Snape was sensational, Gambon was good as Dumbledore (though I still prefer Richard Harris) and Broadbent portrayed Slughorn in a very powerful and convincing manner. A fine actor indeed. Grint was highly amusing as Ron Weasley, as well. Tom Felton was good as Draco Malfoy, conveying the troubled youth very well.Sadly, this film was let down in several key ways. Ron's relationship with the obsessive Lavender Brown was a bit over the top. I have no problem with Yates including this in the film (after all, Rowling spent a few sentences in the book on it), but let's not waste valuable screen time on this very small sub-plot. Too much emphasis is spent on Harry's growing affection for Ginny Weasley, as well. These scenes are all well and good in isolation, but I object to including these scenes at the exclusion of more important plot points. Voldemort's horcruxes form the basis for the entire Deathly Hallows film. It is pivotal to nail this point and I really don't think this was given the priority it deserved in this film. This is a highly subjective point, but I believe the exclusion of the Battle of Hogwarts and Dumbledore's funeral really let the film down. The Death Eaters infiltration of the castle should have been met by opposition from the Order of the Phoenix. Bellatrix, et al. roamed through the castle without facing any resistance whatsoever. Dumebldore's death was very quick; the funeral would help emphasise the significance of his death and its subsequent affect on Harry.Overall, the film was pretty good. It wasn't outstanding, though, and definitely isn't the best film in the series. Deathly Hallows needs to be much better for me to be completely happy with the film series.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
1036,calljb,Very Disappointing...,3,20 July 2009,"As a person who read the books, I was incredibly disappointed in this film. Although I did think the acting and overall production value of this film was top notch, the writer who adapted Ms. Rowling's book should be struck with the Cruciatus curse! Instead of focusing on the story arc of Harry Potter vs. Lord Voldemort, he decided to spend his 2.5 hrs. focusing on Harry and Friends' ""coming of age"". i.e., he chose to focus on who was hooking up with who. (Kinda like Harry Potter: High School Musical Edition...). Although this was in the book, the primary focus was on Harry discovering Tom Riddle's history, the discovery of the Horcruxes and the assault on Hogwart's by the Death Eaters resulting in Dumbledore's murder. None of these things were properly represented in the film, with the exception of Dumbledore's death.In the book, we found out who Tom Riddle was and how he grew to become Lord Voldemort. We learned his history, his lineage, the significance of the ring that Harry so briefly touched in the film. We also learned the significance of the cave and the locket. ALL MISSING FROM THE FILM! Another key element to Harry Potter books (and films for that matter) is the revealing of a mystery or mysteries. In the book, there were two primary mysteries that I recall. One is the revealing of Horcruxes which is revealed in the film, although not to any degree of satisfaction. The other is what Draco Malfoy had been up to over the school year (i.e., fixing the transporter closet). This is revealed towards the end of the book when an ARMY OF DEATH EATERS use it to swarm the castle, resulting in a massive and, for the reader, all engrossing battle on the grounds of Hogwarts. This part of the book even includes the burning of the Room of Requirement along with the death of Malfoy's henchmen, Crabbe and Goyle (one or both, I can't recall...). Instead the screenplay writer elected to reveal Malfoy's intentions early in the film then robbed us readers of this great battle scene that we, or at least I, were looking so forward to seeing! I told my kids who were fidgeting during the film out of boredom, ""Wait 'til the end. There's gonna be a huge battle!"". What did we get? NOTHING!!! And then to not include Dumbledore's funereal at then end was additional insult to injury! For those who just watch the movies --- READ THE BOOKS!! They are far more satisfying. I sincerely hope they treat the final book with more respect...",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
1037,mattmontag1,Changed the fundamental elements of the novel,2,18 July 2009,"While the movie was visually stunning, the plot line was awful, in my opinion. For me, the sixth book was about many things, but the dominant storyline was Harry's increasing knowledge about Voldemort (as guided by Dumbledore). His knowledge base grew by frequent meetings with the headmaster and particularly as seen through many memories in the pensieve. The movie only contains two such memories and little else involving this particular quest.Horcruxes were poorly explained, at best, and the movie removes all conversation about Voldemort's personality, habits, or why he chose the objects he did for the storage of his soul. This movie does a poor job of setting up the seventh movie(s) in that respect. Unless they do a Star Wars-esquire word opening for Deathly Hallows, I fear those who didn't read the novels will likely be lost, or they will have to be caught up by new writing that will be haphazardly presented by those not named Rowling.Rowling's masterful series was indeed written for 11 year old children...when it began. The first couple installments had little complexity and were more light-hearted. As her readers grew, however, so did the complexity of the plot lines and the levels of darkness within the story lines. It seemed to me that the producers of this movie were still catering to an 11 year old crowd, and not the maturing people that have been following the stories since Harry was only 11 himself.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
1038,ja_porms2,Stop whatever you're doing and see this movie!,10,17 July 2009,"The movie can be described in words Ron Weasley can say, ""Bloody Brilliant"" This film is worth the money. The film really balanced the romance and darkness well. For its running time of 2 hours and 30 minutes, it didn't drag and you'll find you're entertained and thrilled. Interesting enough, each scene offers crucial or minor information for the audience to grasp. The story is easy to follow for non-readers. The character-development moments are the best moments. The cave scene is the cherry on the top of this wonderful movie. I had to admit that there were some flaws but no film is perfect, right? The movie will leave the audience desiring for the upcoming sequels.I am getting tired of complains such as why was there no battle at Hogwarts or why was there no funeral. Every time I see a review here with a title including why there is no battle, I wanna shoot them with a shotgun (Joke!). Fans should learn how to watch these films without having the book in mind. Having a battle in this film would make the battle at the last film redundant. Just look at Transformers 2, the forest battle was awesome but the battle at the end seems repetitive and no drastic effect at all. Personally, I like the changes made. If this film wasn't a book, people can appreciate it more. I hope fans can see it this way.Let's discuss the acting in this film; it was such an improvement especially in the part of the trio. The trio seems really like friends than forced actors to befriend each other. You can see the depth in their relationship. Blind are those who cannot see it. Jim Broadbent makes an awesome performance while Michael Gambon steals every scene he is in. This is the first time I can see the ""Dumbledore"" in him. Alan Rickman is always perfect as Snape. Helena Bonham Carter, Maggie Smith and Robbie Coltrane shines in their scenes. Tom Felton is great in the material he was given.This is an Oscar-worthy Harry Potter who has a chance on this year's Oscars for achievement in Cinematography, Art Direction, Original Score, Visual Effects and Sound Mixing. Hands down for Bruno Debonnel's jaw-dropping cinematography! The film looked as if a beautiful work of art. Hogwarts feels like another character part of the film. It was given life and majesty. Another salute for Stuart Craig for the best set designs in the series so far. The effects are a visual feast. The score is great for the ears thanks to Nicholas Hooper but I think Williams could have done better. I have now faith in David Yates for the last two films. He really made-up from the mess he did in Order of the Phoenix.This is not only the best Potter film so far but one of the best films this year along with Up so stop whatever you're doing and watch this film wow you.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
1039,DLC80,Love it but do not know why,9,24 November 2009,"I love this film but I do not know why.With the exception of the two first film I have always found the films the minimal representation of the books - whom I adore.The previous films have missed key points of the books - often sacrificed for mind blowing, but unimportant special effects. I have hated these film - feeling that important sub or main plots have been lost in the script adaptations.But this time it is all different - I love this film - either the changes have been right up my ally - or I have finally grown accustomed to the narrative stile of the Harry Potter films, that has reduced the books into a 2-2.5 hours film format - although the four hours Lord of the Rings format would have been more appropriate, for the amount of information needed to give a accurate representation of the information in the books.The final explanation may be that I started to watch this film with the firm believe that I would hate it and it could only exceed my expectations and it did.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
1040,necrocter,From a Hallmark director to Hollywood Hallmark director,2,16 July 2009,"Well I hate the Order of the Phoenix because the bad direction and the TV movie style of the photography (like a Hallmark movie) with this one the director improve in this point but he forgot to told the actual story of this book. He was more worried about the teenage loves than the Half-Blood prince and Tom Riddle stories, well with this parallel story of the book Harry doesn't have a clue where to start to look at the horcruxes because he barely know something about the past of Tom Riddle. The director needs to back to TV.It was like see 3 hours of nothing it just deserves 2/10 and just because like always the actings are superb.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince

1042,ocalituzo,Makes a magnificent novel look bad... more than disappointing,8,16 July 2009,"I have been reading many user's comments and I agree with most of them: the movie is a horrible Harry Potter story wannabe. Among the things that disappointed me are the terrible omissions to key parts of the plot, not only for this novel but for the development of the next installment's plot; turning a dark drama into a stained comedy, focusing in the wrong things; and other already mentioned fails from the overall story. As for the filming, David Yates should leave!! As a Harry Potter fan, watching the 5th film after reading the 5th novel was heart-sinking. It was awful. I thus had mild expectations from this film, hoping of course it would improve; but it just disappointed me again (although it was a little better than the last). I thought the editing was really bad (not much could be done since must of the story was chopped off), and the soundtrack was, again, terrible. Nicholas Hooper has no imagination whatsoever, reusing tracks such as ""Fireworks"" from his score of the previous film and even altering a magnificent work of art from John William's third score for the Quidditch match. No doubt, fans should unite and scream to JKR that these men stop butchering her babies. David Yates should be gone, ALFONSO CUARÓN should come back, work with Steven Kloves and the composer should be the epic JOHN WILLIAMS!!",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince

The only thing that REALLY happened was that the old bloke with the long white beard spread himself on the fine Hogwarts cobblestone. There were two and a half excruciating hours of ... well... nothing ... except a lot of CGI, quite useless, if you ask me. Maybe I'm not a true fan of Harry Potter, but if i were, I would have really felt disappointed after watching this. I felt like the producers went hand in hand with the popcorn sellers .In the cinema i went there was a pee/popcorn brake. The pee brake was the most rewarding sequence of the whole movie, which could have been summarized in one hour tops. I can hardly wait for Harry Potter blah blah blah 2... NOT.

1044,eirikajones,Surprisingly good,8,14 May 2016,"*** CONTAINS MAJOR SPOILERS**** I'm a HUGE Harry Potter fan and I fell in love with the books, so when I decided to watch this movie I had high expectations. And I wasn't disappointed!! (mostly) As usual, the cast were outstanding, Luna was brilliant, and Hermione (Emma Watson) was sassy and easy to connect with. I'm also a Draco Malfoy fan (I know he's got a lot of haters, but I think he's great) and Tom Felton was perfect once again! Throughout the whole film I knew what he had to do and felt so bad! I was choke-sobbing in the sink scene and yelled at Harry for using ""Sectumsempera!"" on him. Innocent, Harry? I beg to differ. Felton's delivery is great too. Although my favourite Dumbeldore actor is Richard Harris, Michael Gambon did very well here, as always, and delivered a rich performance. I started crying again when Dumbeldore died! This scene also had me going ""aw, yes, go, Malfoy!! It's so sweet you can't kill him!"" and ""You GIT, Snape!!"" Alan Rickman is fabulous here as well. Delivery once again amazing, and bitterness true to the character. If you're a Harry Potter fan, (books, movies or both) I think it is crucial you see this movie, so long as you see 1-5 first! Long live Harry Potter and happy watching!",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
1045,Fairy_Queen_99,Tragic and awful movie barely saved by brilliant acting,3,15 July 2009,"I was 11 when I read my first Harry Potter. I have stood in queues at midnight waiting to buy the books. I have seen the previous movies and, though not completely impressed, I appreciated the effort that was made to bring the story to the silver screen.And then I beheld this absolute horrific tragedy of the film. Steve Kloves managed to convince himself that he is a better writer than Rowling, and thus (I can only imagine) decided to not even deign to read the book before setting out to write the script. Not to say that what happens in the film doesn't happen in the book too, but a writer might at least make an attempt to keep the main theme of the book in the forefront.What should have been an suspense thriller is turned into an angsty rom-com, where dramatic characters are dismissed in favour of the ridiculous, even to the point of never even mentioning the names of some love interests. It escapes me why the comedy angle is so emphasised, since anybody who ever read the books can tell you the series is not a comedy but a gut-wrenching drama...Just about the only good thing about the film is the acting. Dan Radcliffe has developed into a good actor, both in terms of comedy and drama, and the supporting cast is brilliant. Tom Felton deserves special mention here, trying his absolute best to turn the movie into the drama it should have been.Thinking back, I should not have been surprised. The movie was obviously made for people who didn't read the book, and therefore no attempt was ever made to make the movie live up to its brilliant inspiration. Therefore, if you didn't read the book - by all means, go see the Harry Potter version of Twilight. If you did read the book - wait for the DVD and avoid the disappointment I felt.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
1046,roger01-1,Fine performances save the production,6,24 August 2009,"I have read every Harry Potter book, have viewed every movie in theaters and purchased every DVD. I and my other 3 Potter fans have enjoyed the way the books had been faithfully presented on film until now. All four of us rate the film as a 6 out of 10. We understand that this chapter in Harry's adventures is a setup for the last two films that are in production. But whoever made the decision to try to cram Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince into one production made an unfortunate decision. The book has far too much information to ignore. Two of my friends who had not read the Potter books thought the film to be disjointed. I had the same thoughts about the script and editing.What saved this production from disaster was not the special effects but the performances. The actors having to deal with this fabrication of what was actually written must have been a veritable acting challenge. Our highest praise for the performances by Radcliffe, Grint, Watson, Gambon, Smith, Rickman (my favorite), Broadbent (terrific), Thewlis and Bohham Carter. They are the true winners of this film. We hope that a far better endeavor results in the next two films.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince

Yet somehow they managed to add parts to the movie that didn't actually happen in the book, the burrow exploding, come on.Also fenrir greyback barely features, bill and charly have yet to make an appearance, fleur was almost none existence, tonks and lupins romance was just added in with no explanation of why or when, they just carry on as if its the norm.For anyone who hasn't read the books it is yet again another enjoyable summer blockbuster that will 'spellbind' you, but it has raised some serious doubts in my mind about how well they will be able to conclude the series!",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
1048,recycled_bookworm,Good but disappointing,7,14 July 2009,"Let me start by saying this book is my favorite so I had high expectations for the movie. Sadly I was disappointed that this movie seems to be the only movie that changed major plot lines for no apparent reason. I can't believe they made Ginny Harry's ""dirty little secret."" It takes away from the end when Haryr has to give Ginny up. The movie makes it into such a trivial encounter that no one who hasn't read the books will understand the passion that was there. Also I cannot understand what they were thinking when they decided to totally eliminate the battle at the end. It took away from Dumbledore's death. The Death-Eaters would not have wasted entering Hogwarts just to watch Snape kill Dumbledore, they would have made a big show of things, hence the battle.Minus those to things (which were pretty big things) the movie was good, really funny, everyone at the screening was laughing. I am glad that they played up the Hermione/Ron relationship, I love them.True fans will be disappointed, I talked to quite a few outside the theater, but if you separate the books from the movie and not compare the time it can be enjoyable.I wish they would change the director, he makes bad decisions!",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
1049,Professor_Dumbledore,Polished Film that somehow lacks a certain Gusto,8,20 July 2009,"The film is arguably one of the biggest summer blockbusters of all-time, especially seeing it's the first Potter flick that has been released since 2007. After watching the movie, I cannot pin-point as to why this great film lacked a certain ingredient that could've made it a classic.As with most posters on this reviewing section of the page, I will not bother to go into detail about the plot but I will comment that the plot, although gave us a rough indication of what was going, never got into that much detail and lacked careful consideration for the overall story of the book. It often rather leaned towards teenage romance and that could confuse non-readers of the book. As for the deletions from the book that have separated movie fans and purists for the past week or so, I must say that the film worked surprisingly well with the deletions and filled those gaps with similarly fitting scenes such as the attack of the Burrow and the wand-in-the-air ritual after Dumbledore's death as both created a mood that only a film could create. Substantial character development was also present.Onto the performances...this film was definitely top-notch on performances. Every single cast member played his or her role to perfection including all supporting cast. With particular recognition to Michael Gambon, whose endearing performance brought to life a Dumbledore that we've been longing to see for the past eight years. To Jim Broadbent whose performance as Slughorn was as spot on and faithful to the book as can be and to Alan Rickman who always plays Snape to perfection. Of the younger actors, Rupert Grint showed comic genius as a a lovelorn Ron, Emma Watson as an ever-crying and jealous Hermione and Jesse Cave who was perfect as Lavendar Brown in terms of ickiness and annoyance. However, large amounts of praise must be bestowed to Daniel Radcliffe himself, who has improved leaps and bounds with his emotional scenes and is hilarious in his Felix Felicis scenes. However, the best thing about 'Half-Blood Prince' was its phenomenal production values. Obviously Yates and his crew have spent plenty of time thinking about the value of such a large project and it has obviously paid off. The cinematography was one of the highlights of the film with Bruno Delbonnel's beautiful camera work with the panning in and out of Hogwarts's dark but dulcet tones ultimately effective. Direction from David Yates was much improved from 'Order of the Phoenix' after his clearer view of what he wanted his style of Potter to be like. Nicholas Hooper scored a much better soundtrack from his previous attempt with the highlight being the track, ""Dumbledore's Farewell"" ,which played with my emotions endlessly. Steve Kloves continued to prove his is competent with adapting the series and was welcome back after Michael Goldenberg's pedestrian attempt at the series, but there is still plenty of space left for improvement.All in up, this film was perfect from start to finish in terms of production values, acting and all that makes for a great film but some certain missing ingredient stops it from being on its way to being a classic.GRADE: A- STARS: 4/5THE LOWDOWN: A dark and stunningly shot film with superb acting and beautiful scenery that lacks an ingredient that could've made it perfect.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
1050,luna_oscura,A well-crafted adaptation that will surely displease fan boys,8,3 August 2009,"When I walked into Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, I expected a terrible adaptation of quite possibly one of the weaker books in the series. When I walked out of Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, I was pleasantly surprised with a well-crafted adaptation that bursted with life and vitality, and restored my faith in the Potter franchise. As a film, Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince succeeds on many levels. From the cinematography to the set-design, from the acting to the direction, this is by far the strongest Harry Potter film to date. However, to fan boys, the film will be seen as terrible, and one of the worst adaptations ever created.The fan boys aren't entirely incorrect. As an adaptation, it is incredibly unfaithful. Entire subplots, main plots, and themes are changed. Vital characters are ignored, and minor ones are given more prominent roles. Yet, this all works to its advantage. Screenwriter Steve Kloves augments the romance and downplays the action, while director David Yates directs his actors (especially Emma Watson and Alan Rickman) to quietly powerful performances. This pairing creates a film that is much more slowly-paced that previous Potter films, but it allows the actors and the audience to explore the characters in more depth than we've been previously allowed. The ending is particularly effective in this sense, as the grandiose battle sequences of the novel have been traded off for two quieter scenes in which startling revelations are made, and loyalties are questioned.For fan boys, the film acts as a stepping stone to what will most likely be another book- ruining adaptation. For us regular film goers, the film acts as a stepping stone to what will be most likely the strongest Potter adaptation of the weakest novel. Harry Potter is no Godfather or Dark Knight, but in Half-Blood Prince, he comes mighty close.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
1051,sniperkylet,Overall Good Film,10,31 July 2009,"I love the books but have learned to just enjoy the movies for what they are: loose interpretations and have enjoyed every film of the series.The successes of this film are numerous. The acting has drastically improved from seemingly all of the actors and with especially marvelous performances by Tom Felton and Alan Rickman. Michael Gambon does a fine job of portraying Dumbledore's final endeavors and takes his character to new heights not scene in previous films. The Trio had a great performance all around and their comedic timing gave us more laughs then any other harry potter movie. While their performances were no where near flawless they certainly sufficed.Another strong point of this film is the beautiful cinematography and superb special effects.While the sound track was not terrible, it did the job and was nicely used throughout the movie however it was quite forgettable compared to John Williams.Now... The only big problem that i had with this film was the screenplay and writing of Steve Kloves. While the actors excelled there were several scenes where awkward lines were thrown in (Harry/Ginny was a big culprit) and conversations that sounded scripted rather then flowing nicely. (i.e. trio on hogwarts express) It is no where near the strongest writing the series has seen and that is a shame because everything else has been raised to top notch.While book loyalists will complain, it is understandable and regrettable. So much was cut out which only means that so much more will be cut out of DH and that really is a shame.Go to the theater with a mind ready to be entertained and entertained you will be.8/10",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince

1054,anssijauhiainen,Lord of Cuts,8,29 July 2009,"Having seen this movie just few days ago... must take its toll. And thereof i MUST see the DVD release (hence making the second look) before making any permanent opinions. But as first look opinion here is mine.HBP stands out as one potter movie, and as such i never expect anything magnificent that way disappointments can be pinned down to realistic level. As fan of the books... it is hard but i try to see why and what was the idea in the film.The HBP was great, finely cut film. I am at bit shock why some considered the cuts to be so horrible. Most likely due to the fact how they loved those scenes. For me however, i loved the movie because while it could cram everything in it, it would cut to following scene with pace and harshness I've never seen in potter film before. Editing deserves points.OK the scene of burrow getting burned WAS deviation, but really it easily connected the tread outside the school and most importantly the pure injustice and evil which Helene B.C. so effectively portrays. Also, for the future films (and near end scene) Greyback was introduced in there. Which i though was huge plus. :) The mood of the film reflected well of mixed feeling which young boys and girls go trough at that age, and in times like this (in HP's world) they tend to do just what i saw. Slughorn character was probably my second favorite in the movie... but whom was my favorite actor in this one? Tied. Between Snape and Draco.Those 2 really got to do some darn wonderful performances. I've seen Tom felton carry over his role always in the Background, but now he came up front and delivered his best Draco performance I've ever seen; he really showed me how young man unlike Voldemort feels when conspiring murder, in the fear of his own death. He was so good, i honestly couldn't find flaws in his acting :D Snape. Yup, he got shared place too. His slow yet brooding voice took a toll in my judgment. Why you might ask? Because Alan made Snape as mysterious, as dark and as two-faced cold wizard anyone could ever dream of. As Fan of the books, i don't feel regret that movies didn't have everything, or even some bigger scenes. Because i enjoy movies as movies. Books as books, really... i don't WANT to compare them too much because when filming book to film there is only one way you could do it: To make it your own way.Plus, if Rowling likes it and agrees how it was put together, i see nothing wrong with liking it. Then again,,, its just me :D",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince

1056,wraymond-1,sumptuous telling of a careful tale,10,2 August 2009,"While I can appreciate the reservations of some of the earlier commentators, personally I find this to be one of the better in the fairly good series of Harry Potter films. I think this film is one really for those who have enjoyed the books in that it captures the texture -- if not all of the details -- of the imaginary world of wizards and Hogwarts School. The purpose of the film is not to reproduce the book but rather to tell a story in a very different medium and, please note, with the full artistic collaboration of the authoress, JK Rowling.Best to my mind is the much improved overall acting in this 6th Harry Potter adventure. Harry and his buddy Ron (Daniel Radcliffe and Rupert Grint) are quite good in this film. Ron and Harry are notably on target when respectively under the influence (presumed or real) of the potion ""felix"". Emma Watson's portrayal of Hermoine while still a bit wooden (to say the least) is quite satisfactory. I am particularly fond of Maggie Smith as Minerva McGonagall. Alan Rickman's portrayal of Professor Severus Snape is as sharp and complex as we have grown accustomed to expect, and Tom Felton has grown tremendously in the equally conflicted character of Draco Malfoy.All-in-all a delight, again, particularly for those who love the story.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
1057,quicksilvervz,Worst movie in the series... so far,4,21 July 2009,"Being an avid fan of the Harry Potter books, I have made sure to see all of the movies, and, as with any movie based on a book, can accept that the movies do and sometimes must deviate from the original text. With that said, the deviations presented in this film are beyond my ability to forgive. I honestly must ask why J.K. Rowling allowed this to be released; this is not the longest of the movies, and with so much covered in the sixth book, it could have used to be 30 minutes longer.{SPOILER WARNING}Where were the memories showing Voldemort's necessity to associate himself with great wizards and grandeur (a fact that is pivotal to the search for Horcruxes in the seventh book)? Where was Harry's discovery of the knowledge that it was Snape who overheard Trelawny's fateful prophecy, and that it was Snape who conveyed this information to Voldemort, hence ensuring Lily and James' demise? Why was it not shown that Dumbledore was extremely weakened after their return to the Astronomy Tower? Why was the Dark Mark not cast before their return to the castle? Why was Harry not bound by Dumbledore on the top of the tower (the casting of that spell allowing Draco to disarm Dumbledore, and not leaving Harry feeling as if he had done nothing to prevent what happened, but instead had been forced by Dumbledore into non-action)? Where was the battle between members of the Order of the Phoenix and Dumbledore's Army with the Death Eaters at the entrance to the tower and out of the castle (on that note, the use of the Felix Felicis potion was glazed over as well)? Where was Fenrir Greyback's attack on Bill Weasly? Where was the funeral and Harry breaking up with Ginny? The time line for Harry and Ginny getting together was way off too (Harry's use of the Felix Felicis potion having a hand in ending Ginny and Dean's relationship). And they also did a poor job of showing the misery that Dumbledore was truly in whilst drinking the potion at the center of the lake (a seemingly minor fact, but it does prove to be important in the seventh book).This movie was by far the most disappointing so far in the series to me, and has left me with little desire to see the movies on the seventh book (my only motivation at this time is to see if they are able to right their wrongs and actually convey more than a brief modicum of facts, and focus more rigidly on the story).Here's to the hope that serious fans of the books won't be disappointed by the two movies that are to be released on the seventh book (with double the time to delve into the story line, they had better get it right. Anything less than a stellar retelling of the story would be simply unforgivable after this travesty).",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
1058,yalcintasalper,The Half-Blood Prince is the most successful film in the series so far.,8,29 January 2019,"Here's a small essay on book-to-film adaptations under the guise of a film review. Anyone who read a single book and watched a single movie in their lifetime should know that a five-hundred-page novel can not be squeezed word-by-word into a two-hour movie. Actually, I should say 'should' not be squeezed. That's because a five-hundred-page book, no matter how much of a page turner it might be, will most likely end up as a boring and monotone viewing experience if it's translated to the silver screen chapter by chapter, scene by scene. The first example that comes into mind is the film version of The DaVinci Code.The biggest reason of this shortcoming stems from the fact that movies can't enjoy the luxury of relatively unlimited scope and size that the book form enjoys. Let's take the immensely popular Harry Potter books as an example. As someone who haven't read any of the novels, my familiarity with the boy wizard originates solely from the equally popular film adaptations. Maybe that's why my reaction to each cinematic entry in the series is usually opposite to that of die-hard Potter fans, who have every single novel memorized like those book people at the end of Fahrenheit 451. The more Harry Potter fans complain and dislike each new movie, I enjoy it that much more purely as a cinematic experience.I'm not a big fan of the first two films, generally admired by Potter fans. Besides being rather visually flat, especially compared to the later episodes, the most prominent reason for my indifference comes from the screenplay adaptation being almost a scene-by-scene transcription of the first two books, or so I've heard. Because the films really take their time introducing each character and situation in great lengths, the way a book would, the end result might be a glorious visual celebration of the books for the converted, but it ends up feeling too slow, unfocused and episodic for the general audience.Each filmed episode of the Harry Potter series is about two and a half hours long, yet each book is much longer than the previous one, which means in order for each book to be adapted into a screenplay of the same length as the previous installment, more and more details from the book, sometimes entire sub-plots and characters have to be removed. Because of this, each new Harry Potter film turn into more focused, fast paced and emotionally engrossing experiences in a pure cinematic sense, independent of the books.About The Half-Blood Prince, the sixth entry in the series which reserves the necessary time and space for its characters to fully develop before we arrive at Harry's magic and special effects driven final battle against Lord Voldemort. After watching it on opening day and proclaiming it to be the best 'film' in the series, I came upon many complaints from fans of the books about the movie. The main focus of these complaints were of course the exclusion of many scenes and sub-plots from the book.The first question that comes to mind is this: If as a fan of the book, the reader expects every scene from the book to be visualized beat-by-beat, then what's the use for our own imagination? If we require the images created by our minds after reading the book to be conveniently spread in front of us by a third party film crew, then why should anyone bother reading?The second subject about this conflict harkens back to my first thesis. In order to adapt the epic-length book by J.K. Rowling to the silver screen, director David Yates, who is the best thing that even happened to the franchise, and writer Steve Kloves, who adapted all of the Harry Potter books except one, focus mainly on the main storyline and the main characters. Therefore the end result is more suitable for cinematic consumption, with a more brisk pace and economic storytelling.Yates and Kloves dial down the magic part of the story a bit in order to turn Harry and his friends into three dimentional human beings. Therefore enabling the audience to care as much as possible for its characters before we inadvertantly arrive at what I guess will be full of impressive special effects and explosions. During the sixth film Harry, Ron and Hermione's confusing and sometimes painful bout with love, which is an obligatory rite of passage for any teenager suffering the woes high school, is given almost as much screen time as the main plot, which involves Harry and Professor Dumbledore's quest to find Voldemort's vital weakness. In that regard, Harry Potter and The Half-Blood Prince might be the most human and character-driven episode of the series.Without further ado, Harry Potter and The Half-Blood Prince is the most successful film in the series so far, independent of the book it adapted. It's visually stunning and does its job perfectly well when it comes to character development. As an epic blockbuster fantasy, it's a 'movie' that makes all the right magical moves.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
1059,ninthwarrior,Where did the plot go?????,3,28 July 2009,"I have been waiting for this film to come out for the past one and a half year and to say that I'm disappointed would be putting it really lightly. What happened to Harry Potter? What happened to the plot? The whole time I was sitting and waiting to see a coherent story telling about Tom Riddle's past, which has led him to becoming the dark lord; the emotional bonding between the characters and not some lame jokes about puberty and growing up; the grand fight at Hogwarts at the end of the book, where once again you come close to realizing that this is true, that you might lose everything in just a matter of minutes, and which brings Harry to the emotional peak, where he's finally clear about his mission as the chosen one; Dumbledor's funeral with the centaurs, which is a very touching scene in the book, but all of these were cut out of this two hour movie adaptation of a teen written fan-fiction based on the Harry Potter realm. The movie was weak and I don't mean the acting.Maybe they should just bring Chris Columbus back on the set, as obviously Harry Potter and The Philosophers stone remains one of the most magically rich and plot wise logical movie out of the whole franchise.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince

Totally deviated from the original story, and trying to make a youth generation movie. All the actors are acted well but there dialogues are senseless. I Liked the other previous series of Harry potter and previous ones are really fantastic. When this movie started, I thought now something exciting scence will coming,ho ho ....waited and waited. But they are all trying to concentrate more on parties and love stories, no real deal of harry potter adventure, they have too much prolonged unnecessarly. This movie represents lack of imagination, and seems like director was in too much hurry. The film has 'A' class production value, but script wise, its a complete disappointment. The movies is high production and people will see with high hopes, but unfortunately going to bring disappointment. inspite over all these this movie will be hit, because name of harry potter will be enough, and I think its a important part of the series which links the other upcoming series.

1065,trista7984,An affront to fans of the book,1,20 July 2009,"This movie falls far short of any expectations I have had. I have read the books several times and have found the other movies to at least attempt to follow the book. This movie did not follow at all. For one thing they left out several key characters. You never see Bill Weasley, Fleur Delacour, Rufus Scrimgeour, and Kreacher. All these people come into play into the book in a major way so why were they not in the movie. Second they left out key points in the book. Such as Fudge being sacked and replaced by Scrimgeour, Bill and Fleur being engaged, Harry inheriting Sirius' house. They added one scene that was never in the book. The scene they added was at Christmastime when the Deatheaters attack the Weasley home. That never happens in the book. In the book Scrimgeour visit and accuses Harry of being ""Dumbledore's man through and through."" They also left out some key scenes from the book. They never show the final battle between the Deatheater and The Order of the phoenix and D.A., they never show Dumbledore's funeral. As a fan of this book I find the whole movie completely terrible. If you have never read the books then you will find this movie enjoyable but other than that I would suggest to not go see the movie.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
1066,zvette929,Key points missing!,6,15 July 2009,"If you love the series like I do you will know that in every movie they have to cut parts of the book out. Most of the time they manage it without compromising the integrity of the film. This time they fall very short of the mark. For those that have not read the book this movie will impress. The effects are top notch and it is a very engrossing film. I understand the need to cut the movie in order to fit it into a realistic time frame. In doing so, it seems as if they cut key parts in order to allow for more comedy. They also cut out a large action scene at the end of the movie. This scene could have been added if not for the adding of a scene in the middle that was not part of the original book. Furthermore, the scene makes no sense because during which they destroy something that is key to the book in the seventh volume. Not only do they cut scenes, but they change others to suit what purpose you might ask? The unfortunate answer is I don't know. Another minor point that I noticed during the movie is, although there is not as much violence as previous movies the overall film includes adult content that in my opinion warrants the pg-13 rating.Do not misunderstand me. I recommend seeing the movie as it is enjoyable, but trying to change a masterpiece like J.K. Rowling's book is a mistake and I think this movie suffered from it. If I didn't have the book to reference I would've rated this movie an 8, but the simple fact is I do and it unfortunately falls short.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
1067,nh_1990,Smells Like A Stale Cauldron,1,15 July 2009,"Sadly after a decade of experience and billions of dollars in revenue the franchise would have perfected its movies - but sadly not.I found the acting wooden and at times laughable whilst the script did nothing to help. With too many ""Harry no!"" moments it feels as though the writers aim the movie at people who have never heard of the Harry Potter franchise and I was left believing perhaps people who live under a rock may enjoy it! This movie also managed to ruin my views of successful actors. Alan Rickman for example (whom i always thought to be a competent actor) played character ""Severous Snape"" managing to deliver one word per hour sounding like an intoxicated sailor on leave. I expect this is supposed to build suspense but due to context it just made me extremely bored.Harrys decision to mention ""voldemort killed my parents"" during a conversation about potions I found strange and at moments like those Daniel Radcliffe looked as though he couldn't believe the garbage that was coming out of his mouth (that's one thing we have in common).There were several LOL moments in the movie (although there weren't meant to be) where i was left in stitches - the fact that so many people take the series seriously scares me! ...after two and a half hours of stimulation famine i am left wondering if the success of these movies is down to the rose tinted glasses worn by its besotted fans, which allows the people involved in the movie to do no-wrong or if the millions of people are seeing something other than the stuporous motion picture i have witnessed.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
1068,jesper_andren-90458,Adding fluff removing essentials,2,28 December 2019,"I'm a huge Harry Potter geek and have read all the books several times. I got to say that this movie was the biggest let down so far from the franchise, and was the reason that made me wait 5 years to watch the next one after its release.
From PoA to OOTP it felt like they cut out nonessential moments but in general kept the things that made Harry Potter what it is. Magic, friendship, wonder, family, with dark overtones but still with light, happy and silly moments. Ofc you could always wish for more in all the movies (Dumbledores explaination of the prophecy in the end of OOTP which is my favorite) but hey, it's a long book put into 2 hours of screen time, something's will go out. But not in HBP.
Here they instead added things that wasn't in the book and made the people who only looked at the movies miss out on huge impactful moments. And not only that, it completely F'd up a lot of the rules and boundaries which is a corner stones for every fantasy world.
As a reader, you know that in DH how shocked they all were at Voldemort being able to fly like a ghost when they chased the 7 Potters. Here in the start, all death eaters can fly like black vapor through the sky and no one thinks it's a big deal. Dumbledore can apparate inside Hogwarts grounds. Firstly, one question that has been through the whole story so far has been, who is the strongest when it comes to just pure use of magic, is it Dumbledore or Voldemort? Everyone on the good side says Dumbledore, but I feel like Voldemort is probably a stronger magical user he has tapped into dark magic that Dumbledore never would dream of doing. But Dumbledore like Harry, has the ability to love, which is the strongest form of magic. They have only once come face to face with each other so far we know, and that is in OOTP and there they are equals. This is key factor to why they are safer at Hogwarts than anywhere else, cause Dumbie is there and ... YOU CAN'T APPARATE INSIDE HOGWARTS GROUNDS. This create big plot holes. Why couldn't Voldemort just apparate inside Hogwarts with his army and kill them all? Cause for all we know they are equals in magical use, so if Dumbie can, why can't Voldie? Love has nothing to do with apparition. The reason why Draco spent the whole frigging book slaving away repairing the cabinet is because of this reason.The Fidelius charm, you know the one that makes a space unplottable and makes anyone unable to see/enter the area unless the caster allows someone to do so. Presented beautifully in the OOTP movie, not explained so good but presented nicely is completely F'd too in another mysterious and controversial add to the movie. The legendary burning up of the Burrow. The weird little chase through the cornfield and for another huge plot hole. If Harry is there, and they know he is there and Bellatrix and Grayback can enter and leave as they please, and Dumbie isn't there why wouldn't Voldie and his whole army just come there and kill him and all other high ranking Order members? Why are they content with burning up a house? It makes no sense what so ever to add this. Only reason I can find cross the webs is that it adds action to another somewhat dull and slow story. Well, if the reason is that it isn't enough action in the movie. Then why the H isn't the Hogwarts fighting scene no where in the movie?! A thing that actually happened that has things relating to the plot in the movie?The speech from Dumbledore about the prophecy in this movie is taken away in this one too. Where Harry understands the difference between HAVING to follow the prophecy cause it's inevitable in the way that he has no say in the matter and WANTING to be the one that finishes Voldemort off, not because he has to but because he wants to stop him and get revenge for his parents and every life he has destroyed.It feels like this is such a Hollywood rom-com, action fluff movie.
Emphasising on the less important parts and doing it badly. Harry's growing interest for Ginny is done so clumsily, some eyeing and looking away instead of the turmoil he is in for feeling affection for his best friends sister.
Ron's and Hermione's growing affection is completely out in the open, whilst in the book it's more subtle.
When I say less important I'm aware that the book is about love and relationships too, but that is a background story, not the main thing to capitalise on when you have 2 hours to tell a story. The main thing in the book is foremost Tom Riddles aka Voldemorts past, the growing question of who this potions master and dark magical user the Prince really was and ultimately the horcruxes. Everything is done badly in this movie, it does not live up slightly to this extremely informative dense and touching book.
Leaving out all actually touching moments. Harry's speech with Ginny at the funeral, oh which they also didnt show. The beginning when Dumbledore talking to the Dursleys about not being anything resembling a family for Harry. Instead he is flirting with some chick at a cafe?!
Harry's sadness of losing Sirius is not prominent at all. The closest to a father figure he has ever had.I have already gone on for a while but this is just the things that is the most infuriating for me.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
