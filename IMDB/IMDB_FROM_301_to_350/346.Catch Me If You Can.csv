0,MartinHafer,"Incredibly watchable and enjoyable, but it really glorifies criminal behavior.",7,2 October 2021,"""Catch Me If You Can"" is a very slickly made and entertaining film. It's about a young guy who had a history of impersonating various careers...like Tony Curtis in ""The Great Imposter"". If you watch it, you are almost guaranteed to like it as everything about the production is top notch. However, I should add one important thing. The main character is a criminal...a very bad man who hurt a lot of people....though the film makes him look pretty cool and clever. I've dealt with a man just like Frank from the film....and they aren't cool but selfish and vicious. They are sociopaths who have no conscience and leave a LONG trail of injured people due to their behaviors. So, by all means watch the film but understand that there are a lot of imposters like this but there is no way they ever could have done what they did without hurting a lot of people....a lot....especially when they pretend to be doctors, dentists, psychologists, preachers and more.Overall, an exceptionally directed and acted film, but one that might leave you with the impression that such individuals are not as harmful as they actually are. I would actually love to see a film like this that actually focuses much more on the hard the imposters have done instead of glorifying their misdeeds.",Catch Me If You Can
1,TheLittleSongbird,A film well worth catching,9,31 January 2017,"'Catch Me if You Can' has such a talented cast, the true story is a fascinating one and while Steven Spielberg is an inconsistent director he was a big childhood influence and he has proved several times that he is capable of masterpieces of iconic status.While 'Catch Me if You Can' is not quite one of Spielberg's best films (in a list that sees the likes of 'Schindler's List', 'Jaws', 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' and 'ET'), it is one of his better later films, for me that's since 'Schindler's List'. There are occasional lapses into overly-sentimental schmaltz with the depiction of Abagnale's family life, not the first or last time with Spielberg and a long way from the worst case, but that is the one fault that was had for me.Spielberg directs impeccably, both in visual style and dramatic momentum, a directorial job that just screams of pure class. 'Catch Me if You Can' further benefits from as always beautiful cinematography from Janusz Kaminski and 60s period detail that not only looks sumptuously handsome but also evocative to make one think that it is more than just a film with a 60s setting.John Williams' score is not one of his best or most memorable, but still fits really well and has the right amount of slick jazziness, whimsy and understated pathos without over-emphasising (over-emphasis was the reason why his score for 'Amistad' was a rare misfire from him). The story takes a fascinating story and makes a ceaselessly engrossing film out of it, from the ingenious opening credits sequence to the heartfelt ending, the film is long but never feels it.This is further helped by a script that has a deft mix of genuinely funny comedy, poignant emotional moments and nail-biting suspense. The characters are intriguing. Can't praise the performances enough. Leonardo DiCaprio is movie star charisma personified, and brings wit, larceny and charm to a character that is a true crook in every sense but it is easy to see why one would fall for his actions.It is easy to overlook Tom Hanks, due to the role being not as colourful or as showy, but he brings charismatic command, generosity and doggedness in a role that could have been really bland and annoying in lesser hands. Of a sterling supporting cast, Christopher Walken is especially superb, particularly in the latter parts of the film as his life is ruined. Martin Sheen and Amy Adams are memorable, and Nathalie Bye solid.Overall, even if 'Catch Me if You Can' is not one of Spielberg's masterpieces it is one of his better later films and one of his most purely enjoyable ones. Well worth catching. 9/10 Bethany Cox",Catch Me If You Can
2,bkoganbing,"Nyah, Nyah, you can't catch me",8,21 February 2006,"Catch Me If You Can should be seen back to back with Tony Curtis's performance in The Great Imposter. They are both excellent films and both deal with a protagonist who's a brilliant and charming fellow and a quick study who masquerades in many disguises.In The Great Imposter the whole story is told from Tony Curtis's point of view. And it's more lighthearted in its treatment of Ferdinand Waldo Demara than this is of Frank Abagnale, Jr. Curtis's father Gary Merrill only has a few minutes in the beginning of The Great Imposter, but enough to establish the relationship there. Leonardo DiCaprio and Christopher Walken as son and father have a great deal more screen time together.And of course in Catch Me If You Can we also have the point of view of the man trying to catch young Abegnale, FBI agent Tom Hanks. Remember this was the Sixties and J. Edgar Hoover was running the agency. Hanks is great as the uptight, buttondown agent in the Hoover mold. One of the best scenes in the film is DiCaprio conning Hanks out of an arrest by pretending to be a Secret Service Man and humiliating him in the process. He also turns Hanks into a man with a mission. DiCaprio is a middle class kid from Westchester County whose father suffers some business reversals like Gary Merrill did in The Great Imposter. He refuses to accept a change in lifestyle and because he's bright, he develops into a master check forger. He masquerades as an airline pilot, a lawyer, and a doctor and steals millions of dollars and lives high on the hog. Another scene I like is DiCaprio entertaining a high class model at a five star hotel and then we cut to Hanks doing his laundry at some cheap laundromat.Steven Spielberg allowed Walken to develop his father character a whole lot more than Gary Merrill did in The Great Imposter. This man for whom the American Dream became a nightmare got a deserved Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor.The Great Imposter with its accent on entertaining never allowed Tony Curtis to develop Demara's character as DiCaprio did with Abegnale. Basically DiCaprio finds it easy to con people because people do want to believe the best in you. Ironically he develops a telephone relationship with his pursuer in the same way Curtis had with his parish priest, Karl Malden. The reason is simple, Hanks is the only guy who knows what makes him tick. And in the end Hanks is the guy who provides a useful outlet for DiCaprio's talents.I like the way Spielberg developed his characters in this film. We get good three dimensional portrayals from DiCaprio, Hanks and Walken. It's a great film about another amazing adventure.",Catch Me If You Can
3,Leofwine_draca,A fine film,7,25 March 2018,"CATCH ME IF YOU CAN is one of those films that it took me ages to get around to seeing because I thought I wasn't going to like it. I'm no huge fan of Steven Spielberg and the lavish devotion he attracts, even though he's made a lot of films I enjoy. It seemed to me to be a vehicle for a smug Leonardo DiCaprio outwitting the authorities at every turn. Now I've watched it, I admit that I was completely wrong. DiCaprio plays a thoroughly sympathetic character whose side you are on from the outset thanks to a clever set-up involving his relationship with his father, a decent Christopher Walken. The viewer can then sit back and simply enjoy watching him as he attempts to beat the system by becoming a master fraudster. The fact that this is a true story helps a lot too. It's not as assured as Spielberg's deadly serious fare like BRIDGE OF SPIES and MUNICH, but it's much better than his twee, sentimental body of work.",Catch Me If You Can
4,SnoopyStyle,light hearted romp,7,10 November 2013,Frank Abagnale Jr. (Leonardo DiCaprio) is a con man with a colorful career and father issues. Carl Hanratty (Tom Hanks) is the FBI agent who doggedly hound Frank.Director Steven Spielberg has instilled a sense of play in this true story. He could have made this a more intense thriller. But it ends up being a light hearted romp. I'm not deducting points for that. It's a choice Spielberg made for this movie.Leo has all the fun. He is that guy. He is the suave playboy who can get all the girls base solely on his charm. This was probably happening even before he made a name for himself. Leo is Frank Abagnale Jr.Tom Hanks is a little different. I am unconvinced that he is that guy. Tom is more light hearted and it adds to that prevailing sense. Would you be truly scared to be chased by Tom Hanks? No! He's my accountant.Overall it's a light weight entry in Spielberg's list of accomplishments. Nobody will put this in the highlight reels for him but it's a good fun watch.,Catch Me If You Can
5,Hitchcoc,"Like Father, Like son",9,8 January 2017,"This is a very good dramatic film. Frank W. Abignale is a successful con man. Sometimes he uses his skills by design; sometimes he uses it to get away from threats to his identity. This is a young man who is so traumatized by his parents' divorce, but because his father knew how to con people, he learned to do what his father did. He is not a mere con man, but a young guy with incredible skills. He passes himself off as a doctor, a lawyer, a teacher, and on and on. Leonardo DeCaprio plays Abignale and Tom Hanks is the rather humorless FBI agent who makes Frank his number one project. The interaction is interesting because the two begin to like each other. Abignale actually starts to find a father figure in Hanks' character. This is based on a real character, the object of an autobiography.",Catch Me If You Can
6,Horst_In_Translation,Catch this if you can,8,28 November 2014,"""Catch Me If You Can"" featured 3 big names: Spielberg, Hanks and DiCaprio. So it was a bit surprising the film scored only two Academy Award nominations despite great reviews. Christopher Walken (playing the main character's father) lost a probably very close race against Chris Cooper. Spielberg had worked before with Hanks (""Saving Private Ryan"") and worked with him afterward again (""The Terminal""). In terms of Spielberg/DiCaprio and Hanks/DiCaprio it stayed the only collaboration. The book that this movie is based on was actually written by Frank Abagnale himself and he even has a small cameo playing one of the French cops who arrest ""himself"".""Catch Me If You Can"" is a true quality movie. It delivers in terms of comedy as well as drama (the scenes with his girlfriend's dad, the talk about the dog's name, his mother's cheating, the divorce scene, the scene at his mother's house at the end...). Even if it is illegal, it is so much fun to watch Abagnale Jr. trick the FBI and also everybody else. Scenes I found particularly funny were the French class scene very early in the movie, the prostitute scene, the first meeting with Hanratty or the scenes at the hospital where he gets sick just like he does in the cockpit. Oh and lets not forget about Abagnale's first appearance in court and the judge's reaction to his actions. I laughed a lot. And even when there is no DiCaprio on screen, there is occasionally some humor despite Hanratty being such a serious character, like when for example Abagnale's mother wants to take care of her son's wrongdoings with a quick check. The quiz show intro was a nice idea too.There is so much love to detail in this movie that you could watch it a dozen times and would most likely still find something new. Abagnale is a fascinating character. Despite his illegal actions, he is likable to the audience just like he is likable to the newspapers mentioned in the movie. Maybe that is because all he actually wants is peace within his family: first his parents, then with his girlfriend. Every time he erupts and commits a crime, there was some trigger before that disturbed the peaceful family life. It all starts when his father and mother get a divorce. The way he runs away and hopes for them to make up throughout the whole film reminds me of the scene early on when his mother spills some wine and there is some trouble. He leaves the room to get something to clean it up and when he returns his parents are dancing peacefully. When he is about to have his own family much later, he does not want to do anything illegal again, but is haunted by the ghosts of his criminal past. He even tells his girlfriend his real name when she asks him to. The ""Has anybody here seen Kelly""-scene is one of the most memorable of the movie. This is when Abagnale lets loose, loses his restlessness and truly transforms into a family person.I liked Amy Adams here a lot and despite everything she has done afterward, this may very well be my favorite performance of hers. Another very good performance here comes from Christopher Walken, who plays maybe the most interesting character here. He definitely brings the best quotes to the table (why the Yankees win, the mouse metaphor). You cannot look away when he is on screen. You could almost call him a partner in crime to his son. His look at his son after the school principal tells Abagnale's parents about his son's pretending to be a teacher says it all. Later on, he tells Abagnale to keep going with what he does as he really caused trouble to the FBI big guys. Reason is probably his own struggles with financial authorities and he loves his son bothering them successfully. Apart from that, he is a really caring father and husband. While his wife immediately tells the FBI guys about her son, the father tells Hanratty he'd never do or say anything that could hurt his son. Sadly, at the end, we find out that the father was in fact the first mouse, the one that drowned and not the second who lived. The way he died is interesting too given the father-son talk about the car/train choice earlier. He fell down the stairs at the train station and broke his neck.Finally, there is the relationship between Abagnale and Hanratty. Even if Abagnale becomes more and more Hanratty's Moby Dick, there seems to be a strange bond between these two. They talk to each other several times on Christmas as they both have nobody else to talk to. They are both slightly tragic characters. The prostitute scene against the launderette scene was pretty funny as it summarized their lives in a nutshell at that point (and how they got into contact with female underwear). And then there is the ending of course where we see how Hanratty saves Abagnale's life and even makes him his employee. He really seems unable to build up a relationship with his colleagues, but with Abagnale somehow it works at least to some extent, maybe because they are so good at what they do, even if their approaches are completely different and initially even at the opposite sides of the law. And they both have a sense of family as we see by Hanratty still with his wedding ring on and Abagnale asking him near the end to swear on his daughter.There is really not much about this film that could have been better. I might have liked it even more if it had been completely chronological, but that's just me. I highly recommend watching this film. One of 2002's finest.",Catch Me If You Can
7,Prismark10,Catch Me If You Can,6,20 December 2020,"Steven Spielberg has taken the story of con man Frank Abagnale Jr (Leonardo DiCaprio) and turned into a 1960s style caper.Frank started off as a teenager trying to pass off forged cheques. Then figured out that dressing up as a Pan Am airline pilot would give him the gravitas to carry out his cons. It also meant that he could attract girls who liked a man in a uniform.Before long the cool as ice Frank pretended to be a doctor in an emergency room and later a lawyer.However hot in his trail was FBI Agent Carl Hanratty (Tom Hanks) who was on to Frank but had no idea that his prey was still a kid.Catch Me If You Can is slickly made. Spielberg has really gone for a stylish 1960s setting. He has a great performance from DiCaprio and Christopher Walken as his morally dubious father who seemed to tacitly approve of Frank jr's conduct.When I first watched this movie I did not like it as much. It was skillfully made but it was empty. I also thought Hanks was the weak link, he was trying too hard to make something of a character who was a non entity outside of his doggedness.Spielberg tried to push a father/son link between Frank and Carl and it did not work especially as Frank's father was more interesting.Second time around, I appreciated the upbeat frothiness. I still wished Spielberg could keep it light but it gets bogged down at the end with a stodgy ending.",Catch Me If You Can
8,claudio_carvalho,The True Story of a Successful Con Man in a Time When Persons Were Very Innocent,8,21 November 2003,"Frank Abagnale Jr. (Leonardo DiCaprio) is the beloved son of Frank Abagnale Sr. (Christopher Walken) and the French Paula Abagnale (Nathalie Baye). One day, his father has a problem with IRS. The Abagnale family looses all their assets for the government, becoming very poor.  But his great deception happens when his parents decide to divorce. He leaves home with nothing but his checks and a few clothes, and moves to New York City. There, it is very difficult for a boy alone get a job, so he decides to use his checks without funds. Then he pretends to be a Pan An pilot, a doctor and a lawyer, being chased by Carl Hanratty (Tom Hanks), but always escaping. He becomes one of the greatest con man of USA, being in the list of the most wanted. Carl only arrests him in France. A movie directed by Steven Spielberg and with Tom Hanks, Leonardo DiCaprio and Christopher Walken in the cast is the synonym of a good and high quality movie. This one, about a con man living in a innocent and romantic time (like Butch Cassidy was a romantic bank thief), is also a great entertainment and very recommended for any audiences. My vote is eight.",Catch Me If You Can
9,kosmasp,Going Places,9,29 July 2021,"When I first watched this, I was not too fond of it as I remember. I did not like it as much as I did now with the rewatch or second viewing one might say. I would not have said that I didn't like it from a technical point of view, but I think I was in a ""don't like Di Caprio"" phase. Which is something unfair - especially to the movies he has made. Don't know his personality, but that wasn't the reason I wasn't fond of him - it was just the usual reaction to someone being hailed as the end all and the best and so forth.Which I reckon you can still disagree, but he is a great actor. His private escapades aside, it is about his acting and nothing else. Well in this case it is about a real life character and story ... and what a funny and great one it is too. Great overall cast and so well made ... Spielberg is behind it, isn't he? Well that man knows a thing or two about making movies ... even if I am not fond of all his movies, it is more than enough. And this is also one of them ... I don't think this surprises anyone who is his fan already, so just sit back and enjoy the fun you can have with this totally strange and wicked story ...",Catch Me If You Can
10,classicsoncall,"""They're never going to catch you, Frank.""",7,30 November 2017,"Well, I've seen the movie but I still can't believe how a teenager pulled off the stunts that Frank Abagnale Junior (Leonardo DiCaprio) got away with. It's probably a good reflection of how clueless society must have been in the Sixties, a time when I was in high school myself. Frank Jr. had a pretty good role model for his conniving ways in the person of his father (Christopher Walken). I guess you could say like father, like son in this instance, although DiCaprio's character took it to the nth degree impersonating an airline pilot, doctor and lawyer.Obviously one can't doubt that a lot of this chicanery went on in the life of the real Abagnale Jr., but the picture is very much a superficial glossing over about what the guy got away with, for the amount of time he got away with it. As the detective hot on Abagnale's trail, Carl Hanratty (Tom Hanks) starts the picture out as something of a caricature of the bumbling FBI agent that gets suckered when he first meets up with his quarry, but eventually settles into his role as the responsible guy who brought the faker to justice. What I would like to have seen was some closure to the opening scene that had the 'To Tell the Truth' tease. That looked like a real clip of Dorothy Kilgallen asking a question, and it would have been cool if the film makers had used the rest of it to show the real Frank Abagnale, Jr. Instead, and I found this to be a fascinating piece of trivia, the real Frank Abagnale Jr. appeared in the movie as a French policeman taking DiCaprio into custody. So I guess you can add 'actor' to the list of his other dubious aliases.",Catch Me If You Can
11,lee_eisenberg,Catch this film if you can.,7,19 January 2006,"I'd never heard of Frank Abagnale Jr before ""Catch Me If You Can"" came out, but what a guy! Watching the movie, one really grows to admire him, partly because of Leonardo DiCaprio's cool portrayal. Abagnale forged checks and assumed a number of false identities during the '60s. Tom Hanks is equally cool as FBI agent Carl Hanratty, doggedly searching the world for Abagnale. This isn't Steven Spielberg's best movie by any stretch, but it's sure a neat one. There is one scene that's probably there for comic relief (hint: it involves shirts). Also starring are Christopher Walken, Nathalie Baye, Martin Sheen, Amy Adams, and James Brolin. Cool.",Catch Me If You Can
12,jboothmillard,Catch Me If You Can,8,11 March 2005,"Director Steven Spielberg (Jaws, Raiders of the Lost Ark, E. T. the Extra-Terrestrial, Schindler's List, Saving Private Ryan) had charmed and affected audiences all over, but there was no sign of a film based on a true story, that is until this one came along. Basically, FBI agent Carl Hanratty (Tom Hanks) is picking up his inmate from French prison, Frank Abagnale Jr. (Golden Globe nominated Leonardo DiCaprio), and through a series of flashbacks we see how he became the youngest and one of the most ruthless con-men in America. Hse has his mother Paula (Nathalie Baye) and father Frank Sr. (BAFTA winning, and Oscar nominated Christopher Walken) separate, and just before turning nineteen, he runs away from home. He is determined to regain every penny that his father lost, and he successfully takes on many false identities in order to con his way to millions of dollars. In the process he passes as a history professor, airline pilot, a doctor and an assistant attorney general (lawyer). He also manages to have a one night stand with hooker Cheryl Ann (Jennifer Garner), before finding true (if that word can be used) love with nurse Brenda Strong (Amy Adams). Eventually his movements are being clocked by the FBI, led by Hanratty, who at one point comes face to face with his culprit, but he does get to him eventually. In the end, after many escapes and more attempts, Frank finally decides to stop, and finds a very good way to compensate by helping his now friend Carl catch other cons for the FBI. Also starring Martin Sheen as Roger Strong, James Brolin as Jack Barnes and Slither's Elizabeth Banks as Lucy. DiCaprio is fantastic as the young con, Hanks of course pulls his role off with ease, and Walken is a very good choice as the con's father, it is funny, moving and most watchable, a good fun biographical comedy drama. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Music, Original Score for John Williams, and it nominated the BAFTAs for the Anthony Asquith Award for Film Music, Best Costume Design, and Best Adapted Screenplay.

13,ccthemovieman-1,Pretty Interesting Look At An Impersonator,7,25 April 2006,"This is kind of an odd story, another one of those based-on-a-true life tales. This was hyped up a little too much for me because I expected more than what the film delivered. However, it was still a decent yarn about a kid who impersonated people in different professions and forged checks along the way. He did all of this in his teenage years.Leonardo DiCaprio plays his normal cocky role while Tom Hanks is the straight- and-narrow looking FBI man on his trail. Although not a tense thriller, the movie holds the viewer's interest throughout the 2 hours and 20 minutes with the last half hour being the most interesting, capped off by a satisfying ending.

14,Tweekums,"He wasn't a pilot, a doctor a lawyer but he posed as all three",8,1 January 2013,"In the opening scenes we see protagonist Frank Abagnale Jr. as he appears as a guest on a television show; then we flash back several years and see him being extradited from France by FBI agent Carl Hanratty we then go even further back and start to see how an apparently ordinary teenager would become the most wanted fraudster in America. He leaves home when his parents' marriage fails then tries to cash cheques but nobody will except a cheque from an unknown teenager; then he hits upon an idea; he will become an airline pilot! Not a real pilot of course but with a uniform and a fake ID getting cheques cashed is easy; he also learns that it can get him free flights on other airlines. As he racks up the miles and cashes more and more cheques Agent Hanratty takes an interest in him and at one point almost catches him. It is time to hang up the uniform but Frank isn't going to stop his game; he spends time working as a doctor and then a lawyer before he is forced to run; eventually he is caught of course we'd seen that at the beginning. That isn't the end of Frank's story though .This is essentially a caper movie with Frank trying one scheme after another; if we weren't told it was based on fact many parts would be unbelievable if it weren't for the way Leonardo DiCaprio plays Frank as a person with extreme confidence. We get an hilarious example of this early on when Frank arrives at a new school and passes himself off as a substitute teacher for two weeks! Equally good is Tom Hanks' portrayal of the dogged Agent Henratty. There are well known actors doing fine jobs in minor roles too; these include Christopher Walken, Martin Sheen and Amy Adams. The story contains plenty of laugh out loud moments and little to offend although some may consider it somewhat amoral as Frank is such a likable character it is easy to want him to get away with his crimes! Overall I'd say that this was well worth watching; it may be over two hours long but that time just flew by.",Catch Me If You Can
15,moonspinner55,Superficial whiff of an idea,5,21 December 2002,"Although taken from an intriguing true story about a teenage con-man, this Steven Spielberg film is neither funny enough to be a comedy, dramatic enough to be a solid drama, nor suspenseful enough to be a good caper. It's blandly straightforward film-making, hurt mostly by a script that needs us to fill in the blanks and a one-note performance by Leonardo DiCaprio in the lead. Tom Hanks is far superior as the head Fed on the case, while Jennifer Garner has a superfluous role as a model-cum-prostitute and Christopher Walken is unable to create a convincing character as Leonardo's father. The period detail is careful but disappointing, and the overlong film takes a good 40 minutes to kick into gear. **1/2 from ****",Catch Me If You Can

Based on a true story, DiCaprio is the young Frank Abagnale, a great impostor who teaches school, becomes a pilot, a doctor, and a lawyer as he floats bad checks all over the country and seems to be impossible to capture.The film is beautifully paced by Spielberg and absolutely fascinating as you wait and see what Abagnale is going to do next. When his father gets in trouble with the IRS, the family lifestyle changes, and Frank has to go to a public high school. He insists on wearing his private school jacket on his first day. He promptly takes over a French class as the substitute teacher and dismisses the real one, saying there must be a mistake. When he's discovered, his parents are called in. ""Frank has been teaching French for the past week,"" the principal tells them. ""Today he scheduled a field trip to a French bread-making factory. You see my problem."" His father (Christopher Walken) admires his son's chicanery but refuses to take advantage of it, even as his financial state worsens.Tom Hanks is Hanratty, the FBI agent who chases Abagnale all over the world. He is fabulous as a lonely, hard-working, insightful man who gets a call in his office from Frank every Christmas. ""I know why you called me,"" he says to Frank. ""You don't have anyone else to call."" The two develop a strange bond. The baby-faced DiCaprio does a magnificent job as Frank. He's totally magnetic, charming, and also sad, exhibiting Frank's pain over his parents' divorce and his father's downfall. His goal is to get ""everything back again"" but then it becomes a game he can't quit. As his father, Walken is excellent as a proud man faced with the loss of his property, income, and family.A well-cast, expertly directed film all the more intriguing since it's based on a true story. The opening scene is Frank Abagnale's appearance on ""To Tell the Truth."" We don't get to see if he fooled the audience, but he probably did - telling the truth is something Frank, while on the run, never did particularly well.",Catch Me If You Can
17,Quinoa1984,it did make money over its time... entertaining,9,25 December 2002,"...but did Steven Spielberg's latest Blockbuster-fodder, Catch Me If You Can, have to be released now? The two leads, Leonardo DiCaprio and Tom Hanks have already turned in their best for the year (Gangs of New York and Road to Perdition, respectively), even if those performances weren't great, and Spielberg's other chase film released during the summer, Minority Report, was one of his best films. While the release date shouldn't directly effect the film itself, it might've given Scorsese's Gangs a little chance to breath without having this and that as two Leo films at once during the Christmas-break film rush. Catch..is inspired by the story of Frank W. Abignale Jr., who as a teen became a con-man, impersonating an airline pilot, doctor, lawyer, etc, and was finally caught in France. DiCaprio plays Frank, and tries to play him as a suave, if occasionally panicked, teen, and while there have been worse performances this year, it is very clear that the better work for him is in Gangs, not here- he's often too straightforward with his emotions and only hints to that he's someone outside of a conniver. Hanks, on the other hand, does a decent job, with a keen accent and demeanor, and Christopher Walken, who plays Abignale Sr., turns in the best performance of the film, and shows more depth than his son in the few scenes he has. Overall, there are some moments of fun that shine through, like when Frank Jr. does his first con as a school teacher at 16, or when he fools Hanks at the Miami airport, yet it can be seen in many scenes that more challenging material was manipulated by Spielberg and company. Still, it should appeal to the mass market of movie-goers.....this is a re-edit some four years later. On repeat viewings, the film works better. DiCaprio actually works as more effective with his character, and even Hanks becomes more interesting than just 'decent'. B+",Catch Me If You Can
18,wes-connors,A Flash of Lightning from Leonardo DiCaprio,8,2 August 2009,"""Flash"" comic book reader Leonardo DiCaprio (as Frank Abagnale Jr.) is devastated when he learns loving parents Christopher Walken and Nathalie Baye (as Frank and Paula Abagnale) are divorcing. Unable to choose whom he'd rather to live with, Mr. DiCaprio decides to run away, like DC Comics' ""The Flash"". A natural impersonator, DiCaprio assumes a secret identity, and develops amazing check-forging skills. This attracts the attention of FBI agent Tom Hanks (as Carl Hanratty), who is determined to put DiCaprio behind bars. Incredibly, DiCaprio gets jobs as an airline pilot, a doctor and a lawyer. But, Mr. Hanks is hot on his trail ""Catch Me If You Can"" finds Steven Spielberg and his DreamWorks team in the middle of an incredible string of well-produced films. When seen in context, their success secret may be offering the public a variety of entertainment, alternating the familiar with the unexpected. ""Catch Me If You Can"" isn't rollicking, inspirational, or filled with special effects; it's just wildly appealing. Spielberg regulars: cameraman Janusz Kaminski, musician John Williams, editor Michael Kahn, etc are ""state of the art"" in film-making. The cast performs exceptionally. Most valuable player Williams is especially noteworthy, helping an incredible opening ""credits"" sequence start the film.In hindsight, this may be considered one of DiCaprio's very best performances. Certainly, it's one of the only times when casting a 10-years-too-old actor in a part makes perfect sense, as you'll see upon viewing this film. DiCaprio fits the role like a glove, handling his character's charming to disillusioned development with precision. The character is extremely likable. Spielberg sets the perfect mood by opening the film with a ""To Tell the Truth"" game show appearance, and flashback. We know approximately how the film will end; but, like a ""Flash"" comic book story, we enjoy the adventure, and feel the danger.Obviously, they were going for a ""PG-13"" audience; and, the sex scenes aren't offensive. The one following DiCaprio's viewing of the James Bond film ""Goldfinger"" is particularly well done. It involves his encounter with a high-class prostitute. By returning to DiCaprio viewing the film, back in the theater, the entire sequence could be artfully turned into a fantasy. This would support the very idealized way DiCaprio views relationships; they should be like comic book couple, like Barry and Iris Allen. Our hero fantasizes he's ""James Bond"", but he's really very ""old-fashioned"". He can't accept his parents' break-up; and, has idealized, failed relationships with women.There is some thoughtfulness as ""Catch Me If You Can"" explores the relationships DiCaprio's ""Frank"" has with his parents and Mr. Hanks. The film would be stronger if the protagonist's innocent idealism and ideology were more developed. A key moment, for ""Frank"", is when he discovers his parents are not the perfect couple he (and we viewers) have been accustomed to seeing. Later, after a period of promiscuity, our hero has his failed relationship. He learns couples are not like idealized; but, this thread of the film lacks a proper conclusion; a scene with mother Baye, or the introduction of a new romantic interest, would help.******** Catch Me If You Can (12/16/02) Steven Spielberg ~ Leonardo DiCaprio, Tom Hanks, Christopher Walken",Catch Me If You Can
19,michaelRokeefe,Innovative false pretenses.,9,10 April 2018,"Steven Spielberg directs this fun to watch cat and mouse race about a teenage runaway turned con artist, Frank Abagnale Jr. (Leonardo DiCaprio). The young man is quick witted and innovative enough to pull off a carefree spree of convincing people at various times that he was an airline pilot, a doctor, a college professor and a legal prosecutor without even a high school diploma. And to support this giant pretense is his ability to create and cash millions of dollars in fraudulent checks. All this brilliant deception puts FBI agent Carl Hanratty (Tom Hanks) on and off his almost allusive trail. This crime, bio flick is not without its humorous moments. A real nice soundtrack helps keep this two hour plus flick running smoothly. Some swell tunes by Dusty Springfield, the Lettermen, Erroll Garner, Frank Sinatra, the Chiffons, Stan Getz and Nat 'King' Cole are featured.The cast also includes: Christopher Walken, Martin Sheen, Amy Adams, Jennifer Garner, James Brolin, Elizabeth Banks and Nathalie Baye.Well crafted, high quality scenery and a pleasure to watch!",Catch Me If You Can
20,sunwarrior13,A Teen-age Con Man,10,9 January 2012,"A gifted forger and confidence man attempts to stay one step ahead of the lawman determined to bring him to justice in this comedy-drama from Steven Spielberg, based on a true story in this film entitled,Catch Me If You Can.It is a biographical comedy-drama film based on the life of Frank Abagnale, Jr., who, before his 19th birthday, successfully performed cons worth millions of dollars by posing as a Pan American World Airways pilot, a Georgia doctor, and a Louisiana parish prosecutor. His primary crime was check fraud; he became so skillful that the FBI eventually turned to him for help in catching other check forgers.It stars Leonardo DiCaprio as Abagnale and Tom Hanks along with Christopher Walken, Amy Adams, Martin Sheen, and Nathalie Baye.Frank W. Abagnale Jr. is a 16-year-old high school student who finds himself emotionally cut adrift when his mother, Paula, leaves his father, Frank Abagnale Sr., after Frank Sr. falls into arrears with the Internal Revenue Service. One day at school, Frank Jr. attempts to pass himself off as a substitute teacher, and easily makes the subterfuge work. His small-scale success gives Frank some ideas, and he soon discovers bigger and more profitable ways of hoaxing others, passing himself off as an airline pilot, a doctor, and an attorney. Along the way, Frank learns how to become a master forger, and uses his talent and charm to pass over 2.5 million dollars in phony checks. Frank's increasingly audacious work soon attracts the attention of Carl Hanratty , an FBI agent who is determined to put Frank behind bars. Frank seems to enjoy being pursued by Carl, and even goes so far as to call Carl on the phone to chat every once in a while. While posing as a doctor, Frank falls in love with Brenda Strong, a sweet girl working as a candy striper. When Frank asks Brenda to marry him, he decides to assume a new identity to impress her father, Roger -- who happens to be the District Attorney of New Orleans, LA.The scene then flashes forward to a plane returning Frank home from prison, where Carl informs him that his father has died. Consumed with grief, Frank escapes from the plane and goes back to his old house, where he finds his mother with the man she left his father for, as well as a girl that Frank realizes is his half- sister. Frank gives himself up and is sentenced to 12 years in prison, getting visits from time to time from Carl. When Frank points out how one of the checks Carl is carrying as evidence is fake, Carl convinces the FBI to offer Frank a deal by which he can live out the remainder of his sentence working for the bank fraud department of the FBI, to which Frank accepts. While working at the FBI, Frank misses the thrill of the chase and even attempts to fly as an airline pilot again. He is cornered by Carl, who insists that Frank will return to the FBI job since no one is chasing him.On the following Monday, Carl is nervous that Frank has not yet appeared at work. However, Frank finally shows up and they discuss their next case.The ending credits reveal that Frank has been happily married for 26 years, has three sons, lives in the Midwest, is still good friends with Carl, has caught some of the world's most elusive money forgers, and earns millions of dollars each year because of his work creating unforgeable checks.Steven Spielberg turns in another hit, with help from a strong performance by Leonardo DiCaprio, in this stylish, breezily entertaining, and surprisingly sweet story of real-life wunderkind con artist Frank Abagnale.It was a gently funny, sweetly adventurous film that makes you feel genuinely good, that is to say, entirely unconned by false sentiment or sharp, overmanipulative Hollywood practices.Also,it was an excellent account of FBI's youngest Most Wanted.In summary,the movie works at all levels.",Catch Me If You Can
21,studioAT,Catch it,3,24 June 2017,"Spielberg/ Decaprio/Hanks - just those three names alone are enticing enough to get viewers into cinemas to watch this film, based on true life events.I can't fault this film. It's entertaining, it's well performed and well directed (of course!), but it just didn't grab me in the same way my favourite films do. Perhaps I found it hard to root for a character who is clearly breaking the law, I don't know.I would recommend it though, because it's a pacy, fun film that is entertaining enough.It just sadly didn't do much for me.",Catch Me If You Can
22,hitchcockthelegend,Two little mice fell into a bucket of cream.,8,2 July 2010,"When his parents announce they are going to divorce, Frank Abagnale Jr. (Leonardo DiCaprio) runs away from home and embarks on a career as a conman. Originally only armed with some blank cheques, Frank cons his way into being airline pilot, a doctor, a lawyer and into a couple of million dollars. But hot on his trail is dogged FBI agent Carl Hanratty (Tom Hanks).Frank Abagnale Jr. a real guy, who did these real things. Sure there's some liberties taken with the adaptation from Abagnale Jr's own book, but regardless it's a fascinating story that transfers very well to the screen. Directed by Steven Spielberg, the film is perhaps a touch overlong as he slots in an on going father/son relationship that didn't happen, a classic broken home theme close to his heart of course. But this is no popcorn fodder piece. It's a black comedy that's tender at times but also also rather moving, even as the humour starts to kick in, we get plenty of reminders that Frank is running not just from the law, but also his unhappy past. There's no shirking from some of the darker aspects in the tale too. Infidelity, abortion and parental pressure all show their faces, never mind the troubling point of airline security eh!.Clocking in as it does at over two hours, the plot and its little thematics required the highest calibre of acting talent to keep the audience interested. Here's Spielberg's trump card. A fine ensemble gather and reward the bearded one with some of their best work. Certainly DiCaprio hasn't been this good since Titanic, while Hanks continues to live up to the Jimmy Stewart of his generation tag with another, yet different, everyman performance. As for Christopher Walken as Frank Abagnale Senior, well, get the hankies ready for you will have to have been cut from granite to not let Walken pull your emotional strings. Good support comes from Martin Sheen & Amy Adams, while Jennifer Garner pops in for a sultry and sensual little cameo.A great story is given exceptional treatment by some of Hollywood's biggest hitters.

23,Theo Robertson,A Dishonest Movie,6,17 January 2006,"!!!! MILD SPOILERS !!! Much hyped as a true story on its release CATCH ME IF YOU CAN tells the tale of con artist extrodanaire Frank Abagnale Jr and FBI agent Carl Hanratty's attempt to catch him but the cold facts are this is not a true story - It's a Hollywood story inspired by real events and therefore the audience are required to do nothing more than pay their money at the box office , sit back and be entertained . Certainly they won't be expected to ask questions such as why is con man Abagnale being portrayed as some sort of misunderstood little boy lost Right from the outset we're shown Abagnale's ability to con people as being a force of good . Check out the scene in the school where he takes the class bully down a peg or two "" Ah "" thinks the audience "" Frank's a good guy , he's a man of morality "" but I'm afraid he's not because he's a con artist and the story telling technique doesn't allow much thinking to be done by the audience . What about the scenes where he passes himself off as an airline pilot . Can anyone explain to me how he did this for many months and was never ever suspected of being a fraud ? Didn't anyone ever ask him seriously technical questions about flying a jet that caused alarm bells to be rung ? These questions are never answered Abagnale also passed himself as a doctor where he falls in love with a young nurse lacking confidence called Brenda and this sub section of the story caused a few alarm bells to be rung in my head , so after I saw the movie I conducted some internet investigation only to find that while Abagnale was posing as a doctor a baby almost died under his care due to his own lack of medical knowledge . I ask you if the screenplay included this scene how would you feel about Abagnale then ? Exactly . All through the running time we're shown Frank Abagnale as some kind of cheeky chappie , a little bit naughty but hey he's a young good looking kid with no real harm in him . As John Ford said - "" Always print the legend "" I can certainly understand why people enjoyed CATCH ME IF YOU CAN and won't criticise them for it and I can also understand why Spielberg and company decided to make an entertaining movie that doesn't dare get involved in any type of morality . It is unfortunate however that the director and everyone else involved are involved in fundamental dishonesty themselves",Catch Me If You Can
24,jotix100,Witty con man.,10,24 January 2003,"From the opening credits design we get in the mood of this very entertaining film. They create the tone for what will follow. Steven Spielberg is in rare form directing this movie that doesn't have a dull moment.Mr. Spielberg has found a perfect actor to fill the shoes of the con man with the perfect casting of Leonardo DiCaprio. It's very easy to see why all the women fall prey of this charmer. He was a fast talker and a slick operator. He exudes charisma to fill another couple of movies.
It's a welcome sight to have Mr. DiCaprio working in a vehicle that shows his talent as Frank Abagnale, a man of many faces. He plays a game of hide-and-seek throughout the movie with Hanratty, the FBI agent that is in his trail. Tom Hanks shows great assurance and gusto with this character. Of course, the DiCaprio magnetism dominates the action with the many ironic twists and the miraculous and narrow escapes he pulls with an aplomb that's bewildering to the Feds, who are on his tail all the time.The minor roles are equally important. Christopher Walken as the father starts out as the prototype of the con man, but he's too decent to do wrong; his business fails eventually. His marriage to Natalie Baye, the fine French actress, ends in divorce because obviously she hates being married to a loser.The action doesn't stop for one moment. This film is great fun to watch with the winning combination Mr. Spielberg assured hand gives us this time out. Mr. Spielberg can thank the genial Mr. DiCaprio who responds obviously to his direction and makes this con man endearing even when he is committing crimes.",Catch Me If You Can
25,Boba_Fett1138,Fun...,7,22 August 2003,"The movie is great fun to watch, however the quality isn't that high.The amazing thing is that the movie is based on true facts. If you don't know this the movie seems totally unbelievable and silly. It's great fun to see how Frank Abagnale Jr. (Leonardo DiCaprio) commits fraud time after time and impersonated several professions that he is not qualified to. However it feels like some lose events that were glued together in order to make an 2 hours+ movie. I think that the story of the real Frank Abagnale is much more interesting.The actors are perfect. Leonardo DiCaprio is perfect for the role and he even manages to play a convincing early teenager, certainly his best role till date. But the one that steels the show is of course once again Christopher Walken. It's wonderful to see him again in a non-psychopath role. Tom Hanks also gives a nice performance however i have seen him done better. Certainly some nice casting work!Visually the movie is eye candy because of the costumes, sets and especially cinematography.There are some typical Spielberg things in the movie which makes it worth to watch. Like the comical elements of the movie that are done brilliantly in a way only Spielberg can do. Bad thing is that the movie doesn't seem like one to watch over and over again.Not a must see but still a fun movie to watch.7/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",Catch Me If You Can

28,neil-476,Engaging,8,23 January 2009,"In some ways a rather slight film, Catch Me If You Can takes on considerable weight by virtue of the quality of the contributions made to it by its actors, writers, and director.Tom Hanks and Leonardo di Caprio are always credible as the young fraudster and his dogged FBI pursuer and deliver performances of solid commitment, only to be outshone by Christopher Walken. The relationship between Walken (father) and di Caprio (son) is at the heart of this movie. The other cast members are all very good, too.Which is not to say that the events covered aren't attention grabbing too. One watches open-mouthed at the effrontery, nerve, ingenuity, and sheer gall exhibited by someone who realises at a very young age that, if you're going to lie, lie big.The 60s period detail feels authentic throughout.This film was engaging, both in the everyday sense of being entertaining, but also in the sense that it fully engaged me throughout its 135 minutes running time.

My biggest complaint might seem like a nit-picky one, but regular Spielberg collaborator Janusz Kaminski handles the film's cinematography all wrong. Kaminski takes the same approach to lighting his films no matter what the subject: washed out color, backlit interiors. This works for gritty stuff like ""Saving Private Ryan"" or ""Schindler's List,"" but doesn't for something like this film. But whatever....Tom Hanks plays the FBI agent on Abagnale's trail and Christopher Walken gives a heartbreaking, Academy-Award nominated performance as Abagnale's washed up dad.Grade: B+",Catch Me If You Can
30,Uriah43,A Resourceful Con Artist versus a Tenacious FBI Agent,7,1 July 2021,"After his father ""Frank Abagnale"" (Christopher Walken) is penalized by the Internal Revenue Service and his family is forced to move from a large house to a apartment things change for the worse for a 16-year-old boy named ""Frank Abagnale Jr."" (Leonardo DiCaprio). For starters, the financial strain on his parents is beginning to show and to make matters worse is the fact that his mother ""Paula Abagnale"" (Nathalie Baye) has begun to have an affair with an old friend of the family. So when they announce their divorce he decides to run away with the hope of somehow making enough money to bring them back together. To do that he resorts to forging checks and impersonating people in various professions which include pretending to be an airline pilot, a doctor and a lawyer. Eventually, however, the FBI gets involved with one specific agent by the name of ""Carl Hanratty"" (Tom Hanks) being particularly tenacious in his efforts to arrest him and have him imprisoned. Yet as hard as Carl works, Frank Jr. Seems to always be one step ahead. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that even though this film was based on a true story there were several embellishments to make it more entertaining to the viewers. A typical Hollywood practice. Even so, I thought that both Leonardo DiCaprio and Christopher Walken put in fine performances and combined with an exciting plot made this an enjoyable film all things considered.",Catch Me If You Can
31,ferguson-6,Dragnet meets The Fugitive,7,2 January 2003,"Greetings again from the darkness.  Spielberg delivers a very entertaining romp through the life of Frank Abagnale,jr.  I have not read the book yet, so am a little unsure what is fact and what is Hollywood, but it did seem strange that he was captured 3 times.  Interesting performance by a New England accented Tom Hanks, who seems to be giving us his best Jack Webb impersonation.  Leo is solid as the con on the run and was a nice selection with his natural charm.  However, nowhere near as dynamic a performance as he gives in ""Gangs of New York"".  Stealing every scene was Christopher Walken.  Known mostly over the last 20 years for his goofing as frequent host of Saturday Night Live, Walken reminds of why he was thought to be a real up and comer in ""The Deer Hunter"".  I got chills as Walken swells with pride in his son as he realizes Frank has the establishment on the run. Really thought many of the scenes with his fiance and her family were idealized and were there to show how Frank missed being part of a family unit.  Again, I don't know the facts of the case, this is just a perception. Spielberg gets some nice supporting performances out of Mr. Barbra Streisand (James Brolin), Martin Sheen, and Jennifer Garner.  Mostly this is an entertaining film that the masses will enjoy and there is nothing wrong with that.",Catch Me If You Can

Leonardo DiCaprio plays Frank Abagnale, the youngest person to appear on the F.B.I. most wanted list. His father was arrested for tax fraud, which led to the loss of their home and a divorce soon afterwards. Frank splits and learns the art of impersonation and becomes an airline pilot, a professor, and a medical physician all while dodging the law. Great work by Steven Spielberg who also scored with Minority Report the same year. DiCaprio is superb with the impersonations and lifestyles as he attempts to elope as well as stay ahead of authority. Tom Hanks is funny as an F.B.I. agent propelled by his unwillingness to be outsmarted. This leads to a lot of humour and an unlikely respect. Christopher Walken is terrific as Frank's father whom himself was a fraud but not as successful as his son. His wife is having an affair, which trails to his unfortunate fate. Martin Sheen appears as a potential in-law who sees through DiCaprio. More of Sheen would have been great. Amy Adams plays a nurse whose abortion caused a division between herself and her parents until DiCaprio enters their lives. It seems to reference old spy films, and is styled similar to The Pink Panther and equally curious. Score: 9 / 10",Catch Me If You Can
33,Sylviastel,A little too long but still a great thrill ride!,9,27 April 2008,"Frank Abernagle Jr. becomes one of the most successful con artists of the last century. He likes to fool people into believing. If he had studied acting, he would have probably gone very far. Frank is played by Oscar nominee Leonardo DiCaprio and Frank Sr., is play by Oscar winner Christopher Walken. The cast is first rate which includes French actress, Nathalie Baye, as his French mother, Ellen Pompeo before Grey's Anatomy, Kitty Carlisle as herself, and the Oscar winner Tom Hanks. The film is directed by Steven Spielberg. The film is quite detailed about Frank's life conning everybody from his parents to everybody else. The film earned several Academy Award nominations. It's a smart film but it's too long. It does bring back the Pan Am airline legacy even for a little while. Before 1991, Pan Am Airlines was the king of the airlines before it closed down due to poor mishandled financial matters and weak security which helped cause the 1988 disaster.

34,SimonJack,"An unbelievable film, yet based on a true story",7,11 August 2019,"As unbelievable as it seems to be, ""Catch Me If You Can"" was based on a real person and his exploits. That included, by the time he was just 19 years of age, passing himself off as a major airline passenger jet pilot, a medical doctor, a lawyer, and a prison official. Frank Abagnale Jr. told his story in a book co-written by Stan Redding in 1980, by the same title as this film.Of course, in order to get away with any of his imposter roles, Abagnale had to look older than he was. And, the tricks and traits he developed for conning banks, businesses and people took imagination and some skill to learn. His story is a fascinating one and ideal for a very entertaining film. As the movie shows, Abagnale eventually was caught and spent time in jail. In reality, he served short sentences in France and Sweden before being extradited to the U.S. And, as the film notes at the end, he eventually turned his experience into a lucrative career and later business. He helped the FBI, banks and businesses to spot and protect against fraud.Leonardo DiCaprio plays Abagnale in this film, and Tom hanks plays Carl Hanratty. His role is based on the real FBI agent who was the chief pursuer of the cagey con man. That was Joseph Shea, who later was a close friend of Abagnale's until Shea's death.",Catch Me If You Can

36,JamesHitchcock,Spielberg's Most Successful Comedy,8,3 September 2009,"Films directed by Steven Spielberg tend to fall into two categories. On the one hand we have large-scale action blockbusters like ""Jaws"", ""Jurassic Park"", ""War of the Worlds"" and the Indiana Jones films. On the other, there are those would-be Big Movies about Big Subjects like racism (""The Color Purple"", ""Amistad""), war (""Empire of the Sun"", ""Saving Private Ryan""), the Holocaust (""Schindler's List"") and life after death (""Always"").""Catch Me If You Can"", however, does not fall easily into either category. It is a light-hearted comedy based on the life of Frank Abagnale Jr., a young man who, while still in his teens, successfully impersonated a Pan-Am pilot, a doctor and a lawyer, and who managed to dishonestly obtain millions of dollars through cheque fraud. He was so skillful that after his arrest and imprisonment the FBI secured his release on parole so that he could work for them as a counter- forgery expert. He is today a millionaire, having made his fortune as a consultant advising banks on how to counter cheque forgery.This was the first film which really convinced me that Leonardo DiCaprio could act. Previously I had not always been his greatest admirer; he struck me as an untalented pretty-boy when I first saw him in ""Titanic"", and there was little in ""What's Eating Gilbert Grape"", ""Romeo and Juliet"", ""The Beach"" or ""Gangs of New York"" to persuade me to change my mind. Here, however, he was able to turn his boyish good looks to good use. He was 28 when the film was made, but always seems credible as a teenager- an important point, as Frank's youth is a vital element in the film.The film is set in the 1960s, the period which has gone down in popular culture as the Age of Youth or the Age of Rebellion. (This is emphasised by the animated opening title sequence, a witty pastiche of those favoured by sixties filmmakers). Frank's form of rebellion, of course, is rather different to those who were protesting against Vietnam or in favour of the legalisation of cannabis, but he can nevertheless still be seen as a youthful rebel. The main influence on him is his father Frank Abagnale Sr, a businessman who has got into trouble with the authorities because of a series of tax frauds, which have led to the family living in poverty and to the breakdown of his marriage. Frank Jr sees his father as being the victim of unjust persecution by the authorities, and resolves to continue his father's war against ""the system"". It is notable that Frank Jr is from a broken home, as divorce and family breakdown seems to be something of a Spielberg trademark. (Ray Ferrier, the protagonist of ""War of the Worlds"", is for example a divorcée).DiCaprio here succeeds in the difficult task of making a criminal seem sympathetic. It helps, of course, that Abagnale's crimes were non-violent and that his main victims were large corporations, but the main reason why he is the hero of this film and not the villain is his youth. What in an older man would seem like rank dishonesty becomes, in a teenager, an almost admirable nerve and daring. Frank carries off his deceptions with such style and aplomb, remarkable in one so young, that we see him as a likable rogue rather than a villain.There is a curious relationship between Abagnale and Carl Hanratty, the FBI agent charged with tracking him down. Whereas Frank is quick-witted and formidably intelligent, Hanratty seems slow and plodding. Although Frank outwits him on a number of occasions, Carl continues to pursue him with dogged determination. Although the two men are on opposite sides of the law, there is nevertheless a bond between them. Both are loners; Hanratty is obsessively dedicated to his work, although he is well aware that bank fraud, his specialist area, is not regarded as glamorous or particularly important by his colleagues in the Bureau. A curious ritual develops whereby Frank calls Carl every year on Christmas Eve. It is perhaps unsurprising that the two eventually become friends after Frank's release from jail.DiCaprio receives good support from Tom Hanks as the dogged Hanratty, Christopher Walken as Frank Sr. and Martin Sheen in a cameo role as the father of Frank's girlfriend Brenda. (She is a nurse in the hospital where he is posing as a doctor). The film may not have the moral worthiness of some of Spielberg's Big Subject movies, but it is witty, stylish, fast-moving and often amusing. In my view it is Spielberg's most successful attempt at comedy. 8/10",Catch Me If You Can

With Spielberg in the director's chair and A-listers leading the way, you'd expect something a little better than this story about a kid who conned his way into jobs as a Pan Am pilot, a lawyer, a doctor, and into some serious money. Reasonably entertaining and well crafted, this film runs a tad long and is smeared with comedic overtones making it difficult to take seriously. It might have worked better as a serious rather than playful drama. Nonetheless, worth a look by anyone interested in stories about scamming.

Other than telling you that the film opens when Frank is sixteen and runs away from home after his parents (Christopher Walken and Nathalie Baye) have a messy divorce, you pretty much have the setup for a light, fluffy, and altogether fun film.Frank is played by Leonardo DiCaprio, and the man hot on his trail, agent Carl Hanratty, is played by Tom Hanks. There isn't really a Carl Hanratty in real life, but it adds to the story. Frank, on the run, actually starts to become friends with Hanratty, who realizes Frank is just an adolescent and does not realize the eventual outcomes of what he is doing. Hanratty sort of adopts Frank, even after he is caught and thrown in a French prison. He helps him get transferred to an American prison, and then even gets him a job in the FBI for spotting fraudulent checks.I read Frank William Abagnale, Jr.'s true-crime memoir, which was released a few decades ago. It differs from the film at times, and it isn't always as light-hearted as the film is. But in terms of pure, fluffy fun at the movies, ""Catch Me If You Can"" is a sure-fire hit. At times it seems to stray a bit too far off the path of realism, unlike the book, but that's part of the fun, really.The film is entirely watchable, and doesn't try to become an epic. Steven Spielberg creates a real dazzler here; it is effortlessly watchable and even at two and a half hours long, it doesn't become overbearing. I thoroughly enjoyed it, and, unlike most critics, I thought Tom Hanks did a great job in his role. I especially like how Spielberg captured the image of the '60s so well here, and John Williams' score fits the part of the film very well. And as for the cast, they are all matched perfectly to their characters. I especially liked Christopher Walken as Frank Abagnale, Sr., who steals every scene he is in. His performance was worthy of its Oscar nom. If you just want to sit back and relax, ""Catch Me If You Can"" is the perfect film for you. There's nothing all that special in the film, but the film kind of becomes special because it is so easy to watch. I recommend ""Catch Me If You Can"" to anyone who can enjoy a movie for what it is.

41,sddavis63,"Good Fun; DiCaprio's Best Since ""Titanic""",7,19 July 2003,"This movie earns a good rating if only for bringing to light the unbelievable and yet true story of Frank Abagnale (played by Leonardo DiCaprio), a young scam artist who bilked banks out of millions and who, having been captured and come clean, eventually put his talents to work in the other direction. If you can get through what I thought was an agonizingly boring animated sequence that runs during the opening credits (which seemed to go on forever) you'll enjoy this.The movie is about Abagnale's criminal days, and takes the viewer on a roller coaster of situations which Abagnale manages to lie, swindle and cheat his way through, all the time being pursued by FBI agent Carl Hanratty (Tom Hanks); thus the title of the movie. It's a fun story (particularly, I thought, his very first ""scam"" - as a student at a new school, he manages to convince people that he's a substitute French teacher and actually ""works"" in that capacity for 10 days until he's discovered!)In my opinion, this is DiCaprio's best performance since ""Titanic."" I haven't been impressed with his work since, but here he really managed to become the character of Abagnale (much as he did with Dawson in ""Titanic"") rather than simply looking as though he were acting a part. He was clearly the star of the movie. Tom Hanks, on the other hand, quite surprisingly disappointed me a bit, and I would rarely say that about such a talented actor. Perhaps it was the part of Hanratty, but Hanks just didn't stand out to me. It seemed as though a hundred actors could have played the role without anything (except the name Tom Hanks) being lost. So, my normal expectations of the two stars were reversed here, which made the movie all the more interesting.It's an enjoyable way to spend an evening.7/10",Catch Me If You Can
42,FeastMode,my notes,7,24 June 2019,Great movie with a great story. i really liked the dynamic between the two leads. (about 4 viewings),Catch Me If You Can
43,ElMaruecan82,A cat-and-mouse chase that doesn't know which direction to take ...,7,28 October 2011,"""Catch Me If You Can"" is a fitting title because I really tried to catch the appeal of the film and I almost managed until a final act that confirmed me one thing: a good story doesn't necessarily make a good film, a pity because the movie had great potential but  only as a comedy. This is the film's problem; it's so ashamed of its comedic tones that it uses the moodiest drama as a counterpart. You have two levels in the film, when it's funny, it raises the humor to the level of greatest comedies reminding of good old Billy Wilder or Frank Capra's classics, and I mean that for the two acts, but when it's dramatic, boys it's so depressing I wonder if it's still the same film I'm watching and if it didn't actually convince Scorsese to hire Di Caprio as his new protégé. If only for one thing, I blame the film for having introduced Leo's new serious side.I'm aware that Frank Abagnale Jr.'s back-story carries many serious undertones, but come on; the guy is a con artist, and the premise is so entertaining, why should we care for the whole torment inhabiting his heart? Although I admit I love the whole father-and-son relationship and I thought Christopher Walken delivered a great performance, the story of Frank Abagnale Jr. was begging for more and more comedy. The material was shamefully wasted in Spielberg's attempt to make a serious character study out of this. And if it remained true to the first comedic premise, who else could have done a better job as a 'straight man' than Tom Hanks as Hanratty? He was a constant enjoyment as long as he was fooled by Leo -their first encounter is one of the funniest movie moments of the 2000's- but when the cat-and-mouse situation turned to his advantage, and Frank ultimately decided to help the FBI and become a new Hanratty, I couldn't help but be disappointed. I was waiting for the punch line, but I know, I know  this is a true story.Well, let's admit this is not any con artist, this one was real, but that would have provided twice the excitement, even as a drama. Franks impersonated an airline pilot, doctor, assistant attorney general and history professor, and some of these exploits were made before he was 21. Well, I'm sure if a poll survey was made after the film's viewing, the majority would agree that the 'pilot' part was the most covered, with the most details about his growing craftsmanship as a fraudulent checks' maker. But how did he live as a doctor? How did his life consist on when he was a secret agent? The different chapters of his lives were so unequally covered that all we had to do, is to trust Leo's talent and sex appeal: if he did it once, he can do it anytime. I'm sorry but when you spend so much time on very depressing parts, why do you apply shortcuts on the most exciting ones?And are we supposed to believe that Frank's talent relies more on his sex appeal than a developing expertise? I'm certainly not a feminist, but the way women were depicted in the film was offensive and killed off all the charm of seduction. There is a part where the flight attendant welcomes the pilots with a sort of sexy wink in her eyes: if at that moment, you can't guess that Leo will bang her in the next scene, you haven't seen enough movies in your life. There are absolutely no redeeming female characters in this film, their whole purpose is to serve as a foil for Leo's charm, falling in the most obvious and degrading traps like compliments about their eyes, or a necklace. What was a cute running-gag became a blatant exploitation of women regardless of their differences: from the sensitive nurse to the over- glamorized hooker, not to mention the poor flight attendants applicants, all smiling around unknowing that it's only their sexy butts that are used as a cover.The whole film works as a fantasy anyway and not just for the chicks. It's so stylized that it was impossible to get any hint of realism even in the scenes that rang true, script-wise. The movie had one of the most memorable and stylized opening credits, the whole setting was trying so much to look 60's to the tiniest details, the cars, the clothes, the girls fashions, everything was aesthetically great looking, but at the end it was just like too 'sanitized'. I had the feeling I was watching an idealization of the 60's rather than a true biopic, maybe Spielberg is more at ease with World War II when it comes to the realism of a setting, but ""Catch Me If You Can"" was a fantasy on that level. This is why it should have kept the comedic tone, and spends more time on the other chapters of his life, yes, it wouldn't have fitted the title, which was about a cat-and-mouse chase, but let's face it, at the end, after two long hours, it was becoming too redundant. Once he's caught, another time, he escapes etc. etc. and any attempt to focus on the deep relationship between Hanratty and Leo was just bullshit, one was doing her job and the other wouldn't have cared less of becoming his friend, or working with the law. He was in a dead- end and had no choice. So at least the film, could have been an entertaining story of how you can fool the system with a nice creativity, but it chooses to be a biopic with cringe-worthy voyeuristic value. A nice try, an excellent premise, but a movie that doesn't know which direction to take, and this is saying a lot, coming from a Spielberg film.",Catch Me If You Can
44,paul2001sw-1,No kind of everyman,6,29 August 2009,"The story of Frank Abegnale Jr., teenage conman extraordinaire, should make for an entertaining movie; but in Stephen Spielberg's hands, the story falls a little flat. Partly this is due to the casting of the dull Leonardo di Caprio in the leading role; and partly because the careful reconstruction of the 1960s is too familiar from countless other movies to be interesting in itself. Mostly, however, the film loses impact because of Spielberg's apparent determination to weave boringly quintessential themes into his story; instead of an epic tale of derring-do, at times it unfolds like a dull tale of a kid who loves his family trying to live the American dream. This may or may not be how it happened; but personally, I think there would have been more interest in the movie without the attempt to depict its frankly remarkable anti-hero as some kind of everyman.",Catch Me If You Can

'Catch Me If You Can (2002)' is well-made and enjoyable throughout, the kind of flick to put a smile on your face and keep it there.

46,dromasca,Spielberg having fun,8,8 February 2008,"Steven Spielberg seems to have had some fun doing this movie, and he is trying to make the viewers feel the fun too. I am no big fan of the true crime stories, but this is the second I saw recently (the other was the more recent 'Zodiac') that I really liked.The charm of the movie lies mostly in the recreation of the 60s with techniques of the 60s movies and some quotes from the James Bond movies for example, all combined with the fine story telling skills of Spielberg. Added here is the excellent performance of Leonardo DiCaprio which I have quite mixed feelings about generally but who fits here perfectly playing at 28 the role of a teenager who incarnates 28 years old characters. Together with Leo we can see Tom Hanks and Christopher Walken, whose relationships with him as the detective following him to obsession and as his father are key in the logic of the character and of the film.Spielberg is now famous and proved everything he had to prove. In the last ten years he tried different genres, and seems to do a good job in most of them. The one thing that we may lose is who is the real Spielberg, what is this strong voice trying to say. For this we need to go back to the 70s and the 80s, or maybe see again 'Schindler's List'. Between those we may also have some fun seeing a fun movie like this one.",Catch Me If You Can
47,g-bodyl,Very Entertaining!,10,9 October 2008,"Catch Me If You Can is a very entertaining film. Even though there is not much action, the whole dilemma of the con artists is good enough. The plot is about a con artist named Frank Abagnale Jr and the way he tried to avoid authorities including Carl played by Tom Hanks. The acting in this film is very good. Leonardo DiCaprio and Tom Hanks had very good chemistry together. I liked the way how DiCaprio was able to perform Abagnale. The whole concept of this film is highly interesting. it's nice to learn how con artists operated back in the 60's. The music by John Williams is another classic but it is different than his usual music. You can tell that it's by Williams, but the music has more of a jazz sound. Overall, this is a very good drama by Steven Spielberg. I rate this movie 10/10.",Catch Me If You Can
48,lesleyharris30,"An Impressive Cast and a Well Thought Out Story,",9,5 January 2013,"Catch Me If You Can is an amazing movie with a very well developed plot and an outstanding cast. It is beautifully directed by Steven Spielberg, who puts so much detail, thought and scope in to every scene. No moment feels lazy, no location feels ""chosen at random"", everything is beautifully put together with great energy and dedication. This story seemed like a very complicated one to put together in to a movie that is easy for a modern day audience to understand, and the entire cast and crew managed to do so in a way that made it look effortless. There are moments where things get a little dull. There are long periods where everything is very fast paced, and there is absolutely no problem with that however, it will then suddenly stop to add humanity to its characters and develop them further, but it is underwhelming to a degree that the audience feels cheated after how much action we had been given prior. It had pacing issues at times. The performances are flawless, Leonardo DiCaprio shines as the mischievous, charming Frank Abagnale Jr. and Tom Hanks brings in great characterisation, as well as a beautiful screen presence, as Carl Hanratty. What makes this movie so enjoyable it that it has two stories in which two of Hollywoods greatest actors are the main characters, and it's impossible to get bored when we are jumping back and forth from a Hanks movie to a DiCaprio vehicle. A well developed, intriguing story. Well acted and developed, Catch Me If You Can is a largely entertaining movie that I would recommend to anyone looking for a good drama or crime film.

51,tabuno,One of the Best Dramas with Humor,8,26 January 2019,"29 December 2002. This is one of the best dramas I have seen that incorporates humor. While audiences have been offered horror genres that have humor and comedies that have dramatic elements, Catch Me If You Can is one of the few dramas I have come across that includes a wry sense of humor that isn't tacky or add-ons. Christopher Walken delivers a great performance and a real award-winning performance. The editing and the placement of scenes in flashback fashion is timely. This really is a feel good movie with substance, with real drama. This is entertainment at its finest. DiCaprio is making the transition from Titanic in grand fashion and making a statement that his earlier performance wasn't a one time deal. He must have a fabulous agent. Now only if Tom Hanks had an accent that was...different in the movie.",Catch Me If You Can
52,ironhorse_iv,Catch it if you can. I concur this movie is good.,8,16 April 2014,"Catch Me If You Can is a pretty interesting movie that is supposedly based on the life of Frank Abagnale, who, before his 19th birthday, successfully performed cons worth millions of dollars. He was allow to pull this off, by posing high income jobs, and forging payroll checks. The movie by Steven Spielberg is really trying hard, not to say based off true events, as the movie use 'inspired by a true story"" in order to avoid controversy similar to other past biographical films, which deviated from history. In my opinion, the movie doesn't deviated from the autobiography of Frank Abagnale too much. The movie stars Leonardo DiCaprio as the teenager Frank Abagnale who after witnessing his parents awful divorce, run away. When he runs out of money, he begins to rely on confidence scams to get by. Soon, Frank's cons grow bolder and he even impersonates an airline pilot, a Georgia doctor, and a Louisiana parish prosecutor. He drew attention by the FBI Bank fraud agency lead by Det. Carl Hanratty (Tom Hanks). Soon enough, it become a game of cat and mouse, with Frank trying everything to try to escape, and Carl trying everything to try to catch him. Set in the 1960s, the movie has this early James Bond type spy genre escapism theme going with it. Even the opening of the film by Olivier Kuntzel & Florence Deygas, looks something out of a 1960s spy film with its one of a kind title sequence. The slender Lowreyesque stamp style animation figures run through environments that symbolize key plot points from the film to the 1960s jazz-era score by John Williams is amazing and memorable. The movie was shot with bright vibrant colors, bringing out the world that no longer exist, built on trust and a firm handshake. There is a few historical anachronisms, but nothing really standing out for too long. The movie is pretty predictable as it gives you the whole story in the opening shot of the film. Approximately 80 percent of the movie is true based on Frank Abagnale Jr's account, but there were some stuff, they didn't mention on the film, the producers change or Frank just make it up. After all, Frank is indeed a consummate liar. Lots of plot holes or scenes never truly explain well. There is one outlandish scene with him looking for female airplane attendant recruits just in the space of one day and another one escaping a jet through the toilet. You have to hold, suspense of disbelief here. There was a stint, not added to the film, where Frank was professor of sociology at a college in Salt Lake City, Utah that was supposedly cut due to time constraints; but the truth is, the college, Brigham Young University, repudiates this claim that he never did teach there. The film, somewhat change it to him pretending to a French teacher in the beginning a local New York school. Another thing is his relationship with his father. In the film, Frank has a strong relationship with his dad. His father love that his son is stealing from the government and business, because they didn't support him when his business went under. Not in the case of real life, as his first victim was indeed his father stealing $3,400 from him in credit card fraud. Also, Abagnale never saw his father after he ran away from home, unlike the film. Other minor changes is that, the movie omitted his two jail attempts to get away from prison and his time in France. It would be nice to see that, both the movie would had been long. One more thing, FBI officer who was chasing Frank was really Joe Shea. Frank Abagnale Jr. used the pseudonym ""Sean O'Reilly"" in his book because Joe Shea was still in the F. B. I. He has since passed away, but the movie still used a new name, Carl Hanratty. I love the relationship between Frank and Carl in this movie. The chemistry in their respective roles is what breathes life into this film. There is a great scene at a motel between the two. The whole act was so risky. Leo play Frank with integrity and accuracy. He got the suave playboy down being bold and stylish. Tom Hanks was great as Carl. Season actor by this time, going toe to toe with a then, still-green, Leo. There is another great scene where both of their character call on Christmas. You can really tell the lack of family in Leo's character making him sympathy giving him a Freudian excuse. As less, he wasn't unlikeable. Catch me if You Can deals with themes of broken homes and troubled childhoods so well. The female characters played by Jennifer Garner, Ellen Pompeo and Elizabeth Banks were alright, but in my opinion, I have to say, Amy Adams as Brenda Strong was the best. Amy Adams as Brenda Strong gave one of the best performance in the film, as the emotional Brenda. I felt sad on what happen to her character. Also check out, the real Frank Abagnale as one of the French police officers toward the end. The music is great. I love the way, they use Frank Sinatra 'come fly with me'. Full of fantasy glam. The movie comes with a good moral message. Overall: Highly Informative and Incredibly Life Changing, Yet Subtly Descriptive and Wildly Entertaining. Worth the watch. So catch it!",Catch Me If You Can
53,The-Sarkologist,I can't believe he actually got away with all of that,7,12 November 2011,"This is a movie based upon a true story of a young con man who, in the space of a few short years, made millions of dollars cashing dodgy checks and passing himself off as an airline pilot, a doctor, a lawyer, and many other things as well. The movie is pits a determined FBI agent against this slippery criminal in an exposition of how hard it actually is to catch fraudsters. It is a very amusing movie, especially the scene where he walks into the French class of his new school and passes himself off as the teacher for an entire week (and he is able to do this because his mother, being French, has already taught him the language).I'm not a big fan of Spielburg Movies, meaning that whenever he releases one I generally feign acknowledgement and then go off an do something much more interesting. Indeed I find most of his movies are either boring feel good movies (ET, Close Encounters) or simply movies demonstrating how wonderful he thinks he is. However, this movie was actually quite a surprise. It was funny, absorbing, and the characters were quite intriguing.I remember when Tom Hanks was a comedy actor, though I would never put him in the same class of actors such as Eddie Murphy or the like. Once again, a lot of his old movies tended to be very light hearted feel good movies. However, he changed his direction with Philidelphia to more challenging roles. I can't say that this movie is one of those roles, since his character is very much like a cardboard cut out. However, this could simply be because the character that it is based upon is like that. He is an FBI agent that is determined to get his man and since he actually has nothing else for him (his wife left him) this is all that he has to define who he is.De Caprio has actually come quite a long way. He definitely is no Brad Pitt, but a number of movies that he has been in (Inception for a start) are starting to catch my attention. However I am still ingrained with the concept of the teenie bopper heart throb that I suspect he never intended to become (particularly since The Basketball Diaries was one of his first movies). In this movie he also plays a character who is alone, however his loneliness does not arise from his dogged determination to succeed, but rather because he is always on the run. He cannot stop, and Hanks will not stop chasing him. This is not surprising because he is a crook, and the FBI will not let crooks (or at least the poor ones) escape. He is caught in the end, but the end actually provides a further twist. Still, I thought the whole enemies talking to each other on Christmas day, when both were alone, did emphasise the loneliness of both characters.",Catch Me If You Can

Leonardo Di Caprio delivers a great performance, Tom Hanks is his usual reliable self, even if his accent wobbles at times, but it's the wonderful Christopher Walken who steals every scene he is in, and whilst he is not in it a lot, his presence looms large. It seems as if it is over long, as it gets a bit repetitive at times, but it is never boring and whilst it is full of the Spielberg trademarks, some are switched on their heads.

Christopher Walken does well in his own awkward way, but it's Leonardo Dicaprio who really exudes the boyish charisma needed to bamboozle everyone. His improvised schemes combined with his immaturity lead to an endless series of ever-escalating moments where he twists his plans on the fly to escape the FBI, surprising the audience constantly.

57,Dr_Coulardeau,Hackers from all over the world unite!,10,23 January 2018,"A funny film about a faultless fraud, a perfect forger who manipulated bank checks and stole a real fortune in the 60s when he was not even out of high school and at the same time he impersonated all types of professions, pilot, doctor, lawyer, and many others all around the world, or nearly, and he ended up in prison in Atlanta for twelve years in total isolation. And yet the FBI who finally caught him in France got him out of the prison in which they had locked him up, because he was the best-qualified forger on the market and they needed him to catch as many of these forgers who were myriads and legions in those years when the two ways to pay for anything was either cash or a check. Very entertaining in a way though of course, the depth of the story is that you better be a good forger because then you will have a beautiful career in the FBI. The more advanced cases of fraud today is no longer forgers of checks but hackers. The best of these hackers are recruited to work for all kinds of security services, both public and private. It is good to be reminded at times that the worst frauds and the best forgers of anything, hackers or Internet fraud-artists, are often working for the CIA, the FBI, Homeland Security or the big corporation like Apple, Microsoft, Google, and Facebook. And with Artificial Intelligence it becomes ever easier to set up a scam of any sort that can access millions of computers in the world and create chaos here or there. At the same time, it is often a lot easier to counter such actions with Artificial Intelligence too. The attack from the USA against the nuclear centrifuges in Iran some years ago was identified and blocked by other hackers and AI specialists from Belarus, California and a couple more places.That should make us think twice before launching any propaganda against such frauds, actions, cyberwar acts, because if a digital system is attacked, it's because its security is underdeveloped, or if a social network is used to spread fake news or whatever rumors to influence public opinion here or there, it cannot be stopped nor prevented except with censorship, and even so there is always a way to go around this censorship and reach a disturbing objective here and there, in any country you can think of. Cybercrime and cyberwar are the prices we have to pay for cyberspace and cyber communication. It is better to build some efficient defense than to cry, yell and scream because after a while no one believes there is a fire in the house or there is a wolf in the poultry yard. Dr. Jacques COULARDEAUPrevious review on AMAZON.COM Society as a factory of criminals
By Dr Jacques COULARDEAU on March 31, 2003In this film Steven Spielberg wants to entertain us with a simple plot, a simple situation, a great chase around the world. He wants to entertain us with two characters who are highly attractive. The young man who becomes a criminal because his father is harrassed by the IRS and whose wife is stolen away by his best friend can easily become a symbol of fighting back, resilience, rebellion, intelligence against a system that tries to crush all those who may be antisocial, or just appear to be antisocial. The second character of the cop who is chasing this young man is just as attractive. Divorced, having lost wife and daughter, abandoned and isolated in his personal life, living the life of a hermit, of a monk of the law against crime, he easily becomes a father substitute to the young man and chases him with real paternal care and even maybe love. This relation between the criminal and the cop is amazingly reassuring. The young criminal becomes a hero because he attacks the economic system and is more intelligent than the businessmen and CEOs of this system. The cop becomes a hero because he is not viciously chasing a criminal he is ready to kill if necessary, but he chases him to protect him against his own desire to fool the system, and to give him the opportunity to really become « social » by using his talent and his intelligence against the criminals who attack the system. This will lead me to the conclusion on this point : this film is in a way a denunciation of the economic and political system that tries to destroy its opponents by all means available, including in their private life, due to a total lack of ethics on the side of the proponents of this system. Why does our system produce such a phenomenal highjacking of intelligence into crime ? But the film also has another interest. Leonardo Di Caprio reveals himself as able to impersonate many characters and personalities in this film and this is the proof that he is improving and developing. He is able to become, in the near future, a good and even great actor, provided his body and face are put aside and his acting talent is emphasized. That is all the more important because he is getting old and will no longer be able to play the handsome and lovable teenagers he has played so often. He is entering the real profession : he is enabled by this film to show that he can act with his soul and not only with his body.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University of Perpignan",Catch Me If You Can
58,zkonedog,An Entertaining Period Piece Based On A True Story,8,7 March 2017,"Usually, movies of this day and age are separated into two distinct classes. There are those that ""make you think"", and then those at which you just ""sit back and enjoy the show"". ""Catch Me If You Can"" manages to combine a little bit of both of those strategies in order to create an excellent little period piece that will almost completely absorb you into all its little nooks and crannies.For a basic plot summary, this film focuses on Frank Abagnale Jr (Leonardo DiCaprio), who at the age of 17 breaks away from his divorcing parents (played by Christopher Walken & Nathalie Baye) and becomes a sort of grand impersonator. By specializing in forging checks and projecting the utmost of confidence, Frank becomes an airline co-pilot, a doctor, & and lawyer during the 1960s...without the credentials for any of those positions! While defrauding multiple institutions as well as the U.S. government, Frank is pursued by agent Carl Hanratty (Tom Hanks), who is continually astounded by the kinds of things that the young Abagnale is able to get away with.There are three primary ways in which this film becomes very much a classic upon first viewing...First, it is an incredible ""period piece"" dealing with the 1969s. The clothes, decor, attitudes, music, & personalities of the decade are very convincing and will make you feel as if you were actually transported back in time.Second, the story is engrossing, compelling, and will have you thinking about its multiple themes the whole way through. Frank Jr. is not just a cardboard-cutout character...he is given the same contradictions that we all have, both good and bad.Finally, the acting is tremendous. DiCaprio steals the show pretty much from beginning to end, while Hanks is his typical solid self. Smaller roles from Walken & Amy Adams are also very interesting and well-played.Overall, ""Catch Me If You Can"" is a fun little romp through the 1960s that (per the usual with a Steven Spielberg production) is very well-rounded and contains something for everybody. My exact rating would be 4.5 stars, as it truly will transport you away from the world for the entire runtime.",Catch Me If You Can
59,filipemanuelneto,Entertains and amuses the audience.,10,15 November 2020,"Directed by Steven Spielberg, who achieves with this film another success for his already long list of cinematic successes, this film is based very slightly on the life of Frank Abagnale Jr., a well-known American con man who, in his youth, stood out for the skill with which he forged checks, to the point of working today as a security consultant in this sector. The film follows the origins and life of the main character, as well as the original and daring way in which he escapes justice until he is invariably caught.In addition to being an extremely fun movie to watch, with a game of cat and mouse full of comedic moments and some familiar melodrama to add some dramatic density to the main character, it has two extraordinary actors at an excellent time in their careers: Leonardo Di Caprio is charismatic, talented, and still young enough to give life to a teenage character; Tom Hanks appears more restrained and in a role of maturity but charged with charisma and personality Both actors are good and complement each other, sharing the protagonism and creating a good and pleasant collaboration to feel. The film also features Christopher Walken and Martin Sheen in secondary roles. Walken stands out particularly, with an appealing character and dialogues loaded with impact and meaning.I didn't feel that the film stood out for the more technical aspects. Its value is based on the performance of the actors, the story told and the way it entertains and entertains us. However, it is a film directed by Spielberg and that usually means quality: in fact, the film has excellent cinematography and was very well shot. The color, the light, all the camera work and editing were done with excellence and attention to detail. Because it is a film set in the Sixties, it also has a series of details that transport us to that time (used cars, scenarios and furniture that are emerging, the presence of some iconic brands and emblems of the time, namely in what concerns commercial aviation, clothes and costumes, fashion and hairstyles), which exude credibility, verisimilitude and historical rigor. I believe that I must also highlight the ingenious and fun way in which the initial credits were conceived, being an element that, right from the beginning, announces the tone and ambience of the film we are going to see. Last but not least, the good soundtrack, signed by John Williams.",Catch Me If You Can

Being a reader of the American Ads art-book, I feel all the flavors of this era, in the firework of colors, and the carefree spirit of the people.And this is what I remember of this movie: the strength of freedom.With courage, you can do everything, like Frank Jr. And if you are caught but the intention is pure, the fate would recognize it. And this justice is the same value for Spielberg from his first movie to its last: the family, the kids. On the fun side, everyone knows the love of Spielberg for planes, thus the choice for this particular story must have been evident for him.That's why Spielberg is great: The fundamental philosophic message is always delivered with impeccable techniques and a sincere humanity. The circle is closed...",Catch Me If You Can
61,TheMovieDiorama,Catch Me If You Can is a classic cat-and-mouse chase that feels refreshingly whimsical.,8,27 February 2018,"Spielberg is damn versatile. He is able to craft some of cinema's hard hitting dramas (Schindler's List), biggest blockbusters (Jurassic Park) and child-friendly tales (E.T.). This film is rather overlooked in his filmography, which surprises me considering the talent on screen. Part biopic and dramatisation of Frank Abagnale Jr's youth where he was able to utilise the power of deception to successfully disguise himself as a pilot, doctor and prosecutor in order to check in cheques. The youngest counterfeiting fraudster in America at the time. The greatest compliment I can give the story, is that it doesn't take itself seriously. This could've been a melodramatic crime thriller, but instead Spielberg twists the style and turns it into an exciting watchable chase that consistently put a smile on my face. Would it have been more poignant and resonating if it was powerful? Perhaps, but the film successfully entertains and sometimes that's just what the doctor ordered (no pun intended). There was only one actor who could pull off the suave deceptive con artist, and that's Leonardo DiCaprio. An absorbing performance that gave him an opportunity to be slightly cheeky yet maintain a sense of class which I'm sure paved the way for his role in The Wolf of Wall Street. I loved the use of psychology and how the human mind can be convinced through simple sleight of hand gestures. A story of how living in a lie can often feel better than residing in reality. Utilising false identities to reinvigorate one's self and change their way of living, albeit being extremely illegal. Tom Hanks plays the FBI agent tasked with hunting down Frank Jr with what is one of his lighter performances. A young Amy Adams was also likeable. Spielberg is a chameleon. He can take any genre and create an excellent film without the need of over-stylisation. His techniques just blend in. Also, the opening credits scene was hypnotising, adored the animation. An irresistible light hearted tale.",Catch Me If You Can

It's a more empathetic version of Spielberg's usual father-issues motif, though the child still struggles with his father's selfishly poor decisions.

64,Anonymous_Maxine,"Note to self: Make a lot of fake checks, buy James Bond suit, work for FBI.",9,18 January 2003,"The latest film from Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks is much more than a vehicle for Leonardo DiCaprio, who is granted the most screen time by far, it is a massively entertaining film about the true life adventures (and I should think that the word adventures' should apply here in all possible meanings) of Frank Abagnale Jr., a brilliant young man who's con artist abilities are revealed in a thrilling early scene where he impersonates a substitute teacher, going so far as to turn away the real substitute when she shows up to teach class. We are not shown how he is caught after committing this relatively small-time offense, because the last thing we want in our minds about this character is how he gets caught at something. Instead, we see his parents sitting in the principal's office, where the principal reveals to them that their son has been teaching class for the last week, assigning homework, having parent/teacher conferences, and was even planning a field trip. His mother is furious, as most mothers would be, being, I think, the real rulers of the house, while his father was proud of his son's sneakiness as, I also think, many fathers would be (except for the uptight ones, of course). I know MY father would have loved it if I managed something like that in high school. (spoilers) It seems that Frank has a brilliant mind that he applies to not the mot legal avenues, and his home life is less than wonderful. He comes home one day to discover his mother having an affair with one of his father's friends, and when he eventually finds out, instead of writing a name on that little form to choose which parent he wanted to live with, he jumps out the window and runs away, beginning the adventure that we learn about during the rest of the movie. Granted, Catch Me If You Can is one of those films where the plot from beginning to end is revealed in the preview (kind of like Pleasantville), but it is still a thrilling ride, which is a testament to the talent involved with it.One of the most interesting elements of the movie is the way it is structured. It knows that it is a predictable film, not only because it starts at the end but because it is a true story and true stories that end tragically are not made into movies (at least not by Spielberg), so the chronology is mixed up at several points during the film. We start at the end, go back to the beginning for a while, go back to just before the end, a little past the end, back to the middle, etc. Not necessarily in that order, but the way the chronological order of events is skewed in the film makes it refreshing even if we already know what it going to happen.
The only problem that I had with the movie was that, despite its ending, there were several things about the movie that were just too convenient. As only a single example, there is a scene late in the film when Frank is being transported back home from France to go to prison in America, and after finding out that his father fell down the stairs and died, he runs into the bathroom, escapes from the plane Commando-style in broad daylight, and runs on foot all the way back to his house. I realize that the movie takes place before cell-phones and even in the early days of two way radios, but you would think that it would not take the FBI the ENTIRE DAY to get to his house, the most obvious place that he was headed. In real life, there would have been squad cars waiting for him long before he jogged back, which makes me wonder how this particular detail played out in real life, if it did at all.Either way, it is clear that this scene is, as they say, dramatized for effect, which makes you wonder how much of the rest of the story is as well. There is also one other scene that sticks out for this reason like a bright red flag. About two thirds of the way through the film, virtually the entire staff of the FBI are at the Miami airport, because this is the only airport that Abagnale will use (the only reason given for this, by the way, is because this is the airport where Hanratty, the agent assigned to capture Abagnale, has set up his stake-out). They are looking everywhere for Abagnale to show up, and after his girlfriend sets him up, he goes to local universities signing up a whole crew of flight attendants for a two-month flight attendant training tour throughout Europe.We are never told how he managed to get PanAm to let these fraudulent attendants on the plane when they show up at the airport, or where their uniforms came from, or whether they were all on the same flight or PanAm was nice enough to spread them throughout their entire airline corporation, but the gimmick is that Abagnale is able to walk through the entire airport surrounded by gorgeous young women, and all the police officers and FBI agents their to capture him would be so distracted by all the hotties that they wouldn't even notice him. So here's problem #1: Abagnale is going for the art of invisibility, and there are few things less invisible than a lot of beautiful young women wearing matching pink uniforms. Very few things, in fact, would attract MORE attention to his little group of followers. Problem #2: If you see a whole group of beautiful young women wearing matching pink uniforms walking in a grinning little group with only a single male within the group, that male attracts at least as much attention as the women. Meaning, if you see that many women walking and giggling together and they are only with a single man, not many people wouldn't be scrambling to see who that man is. In both cases, Abagnale might as well hold up a blinking sign with his name on it.Of course, as with many other scenes within the movie that are just entirely too convenient, Hanratty is on the  phone and facing away just as Abagnale walks by with his big pink group of buddies, but has the brilliant foresight to have a look-alike waiting outside with a big sign with Hanratty's name on it, another little detail more than likely added to the story for our amusement in the film version. Like I said, a lot of this stuff is not very likely to have happened, at least not exactly as we see it in the movie, in real life, but it's also not entirely without effect and not entirely unappreciated.  Spielberg is America's most popular director, and in this movie he proves that he knows how to present a chase. A good chase film has to be structured with a series of close calls and more comfortable moments. You remember this in The Fugitive, for example, when Richard Kimble is cornered by Sam Gerard in the tunnel on the dam, only to escape by jumping off right in front of him. There is a wonderful scene in Catch Me If You Can where Hanratty finds Abagnale's hotel room and bursts in with a gun, at which point we are sure there's no escape, but Frank manages to impersonate a CIA officer right in front of Hanratty, an agent for the FBI, and narrowly escapes, to the audience's great delight. Again, not exactly the most believable stuff in the world, but it sure is fun.Leonardo DiCaprio has made a tremendous leap both in his choice of roles to play and in his acting skills as a whole. He has certainly come a long way from his chokingly awful performance in Titanic, to play a role in Catch Me If You Can that he seems born to play. The only problem with him in this role is that he is a 28-year-old actor who happens to be able to pass for a 16-year-old kid, when what the part needs is a 16-year-old actor who can, when necessary, pass for a 28-year-old man. Tom Hanks, on the other hand, is absolutely flawless in his role as the driven FBI agent determined to capture Abagnale, even if he asks him nicely to leave him alone. And I don't want to hear any complaints about Hanks' accent, because he captured it beautifully. If you really want to whine and moan about a well-known actor doing a fake accent, watch Thirteen Days. Overall, Catch Me If You Can has some flaws, it has a few scenes that go beyond the expected suspension of disbelief, but these scenes seem to have just been too ambitious in a movie that maybe was turning out even better than expected. In that sense, these scenes are little more than a slight excursion over the top, while the movie as a whole shines and entertains, even for the slightly lengthy running time. It was a sad and moving scene when Frank's father's death was revealed, and his mother strangely disappeared in the movie into the oblivion of her marriage to her father's friend (the one she had been having the affair with), but as a whole the movie is wonderful entertainment for the whole family.",Catch Me If You Can

Will Di Caprio pull of the perfect con and stay free from persecution?",7,21 February 2019,"The bad: this movie does last about an half hour too long to be really captivating till the very end. Because when all the con tricks have been played out, the magic of this upbeat con story has somewhat faded. At 2 hours and 15 minutes this movie overstretches it's attention span.The good: cheery, upbeat story about a boy who wants to be succesful and figures out a conning way to do so, when he knows that the honest way to achieve succes is out of his league, because of poverty problems. By simply impersonating pilots, doctors and lawyers this boy succeeds in achieving the succes he always dreamt of. It is a very alluring story about tricking your way into succes and the constant chase between Di Caprio and Tom Hanks makes for a suspenseful game of cat and mouse.
Really enjoyable watch for young and old, with a romantic interlude with the very young Amy Adams.Biographical end note: director Steven Spielberg parents got divorced, when he was a kid. Many of the themes in Spielberg's films are about single parents and this movie is no exception. It is striking to see that this movies plot is also about a boy, who sees his parents struggle with financial problems and end up in a divorce. The boy copies his father's behaviour to solve his financial difficulties, by trying to con his way out of debt, in order to bring home the bacon.

66,Vartiainen,Charming,8,19 December 2013,"This was the movie that personally convinced me that DiCaprio had a future as an actor beyond Titanic. People used dismiss him as that kid from Titanic, I did as well, but he has grown to become one of Hollywood's top actors and I personally saw this coming while watching this film.Catch Me If You Can is also one of those films that I'd recommend if someone had no idea who Steven Spielberg was and wanted to give one of his movies a try. Because in many ways it has a lot of his characteristics in it. It's seemingly light-hearted, has an A-list cast, has a great score and the story is pure entertainment, yet the movie also takes it time, here and there, to address slightly darker themes - in this case the reason why Frank Abagnale Jr. (DiCaprio) grew up to become such a trickster.The movie rides heavily on the charisma and acting abilities of its two main stars, DiCaprio and Hanks, and in this case there's really nothing wrong with it. The story is decent enough to support these two and it's a valid choice to have your movie focus on the characters, especially if they're interesting enough, like they are in here. That's the essence of a heist movie, which this movie really is, even though it's not about a single con.And that's this movie. Its focus on entertainment keeps it from being a solid nine or ten star film, but only just. As it is, it's a fun little romp that you're sad to see come to an end.

At least two scenes are exceptional, memorable: the one with DiCaprio and Jennifer Garner, when she gives him those $400, change to the fake check of 1,400, and the scene between DiCaprio and Amy Adams, when she jumps into his arms and begins to kiss him like crazy. There is also the scene when DiCaprio is sneaking among the police and FBI agents at the airport, surrounded by that group of stewardesses.

Tom Hanks and Leo DiCaprio are charismatic enough to keep things lively and entertaining, but their roles feel so stiff and rails-bound that there isn't room for them to add much in the way of extra spice. For the most part, the film's happy to ease back into simple escapism, embracing DiCaprio's shameless con-man tendencies as heroic and admirable, even when the repercussions couldn't have been pretty. Particularly uncomfortable is his stretch in residency as an MD, largely played for laughs, where he toys with more than just bankers' checkbooks. Christopher Walken appears in a throwaway role as the escapee's hard-luck father, but fails to pluck any of the intended heart strings and thus barely registers as more than an extended cameo.

73,Chris_Docker,"Polished, highly entertaining - and cleverer than it seems",8,30 January 2003,"Which of us hasn't dreamed of succeeding in lots of fabulously high-profile careers? Doctor? Lawyer? Airline Pilot? For the past generation, the role model of escapist high achievement was given full power in the shape of James Bond, an ordinary looking upper class Englishman that achieved the impossible through fantastic gadgets and penetrating responses to life-threatening situations. But in the present day, the believability of a Bond-like secret agent is wearing thin. Similarly, the vicarious glamour of Hollywood stars is no longer a panacea to the wish-fulfilment dreams of working class drudgery. Enter stage left, appealing to everyone's slightly less than moral urges, Mr Frank Abagnale Jnr. And just to reinforce how it was possible to fake being a pilot, doctor and public prosecutor, we are reliably informed that it is all based on a true story.(Minor plot spoilers): A sudden victim of a broken home, the adolescent Frank Abagnale Jnr (Leonardo DiCaprio) hightails to New York, blagging a pilot's uniform to get a bit of respect, and brilliantly forging increasingly large cheques. He also fools the airlines. Tiring of parading and cocking his pilot hat to the infuriated airlines, he poses as a doctor, learning the lingo from the TV show Dr Kildare, before moving on to become an assistant public prosecutor. To evade escape, he recruits a bevy of eye-candy airline stewardesses', and leaves the country under the noses of dozens of FBI agents. Capture and prison sentences follow, but he gets off lightly and becomes a respected, megabucks-earning hero at the same time.Leonardo DiCaprio has tackled this real-life spoof with a professionalism that helps to make the film one that will possibly spawn look-alikes. His attention to detail included face to face research with the real life Abagnale and, even if the part does not demand the range of acting talent that instantly cries `Oscar', the skill with which he has executed his role marks him out as a very polished actor. Likewise Christopher Walken (as Abagnale Snr) turns in a first class performance and brings a range of emotion to his part (the beleaguered father) that is rare in Walken characters. Tom Hanks' performance, as the befuddled FBI agent trying to chase low-life Abagnale Jnr (who is patently of much higher intelligence than his pursuer), has restored my confidence in him as a Grade A actor  especially after his rather wooden `Road to Perdition'. In the Director's chair, Spielberg has tackled something outside his usual stomping ground: Catch Me If You Can is a light-hearted romp at heart, but delivered with such panache that it wins as an action thriller and psychological drama at the same time.

However, hot on his heels is moody FBI Agent Carl Hanratty (Tom Hanks) who doggedly pursues Abagnale in order to bring him to justice...Based on Frank Abagnale Jr's own book, Spielberg delivers Catch Me If You Can with a mostly light-hearted playful feel (which given the source material was arguably the best way to pitch it). Di Caprio does a wonderful job in bringing Abagnale Jr to life (he's charming and charismatic but with a sympathetic edge - he's trying to help his family which never renders him unlikeable at any point). Hanks has a trickier job in his role as a rather dry FBI Agent, but at times this is used to good effect when his attempts at being funny hit a brick wall. Amy Adams is the real surprise here as the dim-witted love interest to Abagnale and even a cynic like me felt some sympathy towards her later in the film.As I've already mentioned, the light-hearted and playful tone is the film's biggest asset and this is what ensures that the film remains entertaining and enjoyable. Abagnale's elaborate ploys and Houdini like escapology are certainly imaginative and for me the film rarely misses a beat (despite its generous 120+ minute running time).Given the fact that the real Frank Abagnale co-wrote the script and Spielberg directed the film I did wonder if the film may have been slightly embellished in the name of entertainment i.e were the FBI really that incompetent and did Abagnale really manage to impersonate pilots, doctors and lawyers with such ease?

One example: setting up his print shop in the French town his mother was from. He had five million dollars. He could have gone anywhere.

He turns the fascinating but also inconsequential true story of Frank Abagnale Jr and makes it as enthralling, cinematic and deeply sad as his high concept or important historical pictures. The pacing feels reminiscent of Hitchcock's North by Northwest, with opening credits that'd make Saul Bass proud. Every technical decision, performance and piece of writing here is on point.

How to justify the enormous amount of money and talent that went into creating a slight entertainment with zero significance? As my son pointed out -- the idea was to make a profit and they doubtless are. The cleverly done details overwhelm the substance, almost hiding the lack of any.The opening credits by Nexus Productions are a marvelous salute to similar animated openings, like ""The Pink Panther"" and ""The Man with the Golden Arm,"" period classics by noted graphic designers like Saul Bass.John Williams captures the Mancini feel of ""Peter Gunn"" etc. with the finger clicking accompaniment to the opener. The cinematography by Janusz Kaminski, costumes and art direction stunningly continue the period feel, as well as expensive use of appropriate songs like ""Look of Love,"" so we really do see all the money on the screen. Because Steven Spielberg doesn't spend $1,000 where he can spend $100,000. The camera is constantly moving back to reveal huge, decorated sets, and swooping around to show us just how much environment has been re-created. This is to Spielberg's oeuvre what ""Ocean's 11"" is to Steven Soderbergh's. It feels like Spielberg was trying to do a tribute to Billy Wilder, without the cynicism that he simply can't do, but the film is dedicated at the end to the late Bruce Paltrow. Wilder would never see family deterioration and recreation as a motivator as Spielberg does, with a recurring theme of Christmas Eve reunions, complete with a wide-eyed little girl (with a similar divorce propulsion as in ""E.T."").Leonardo DiCaprio is much better cast here than ""Gangs of New York"" as a protean teen-ager, while Tom Hanks is his usual obsessively dedicated employee. Christopher Walken is marvelous in a small, fatherly role and even gets to dance very briefly.But I kept wondering whether this story would have held up as a little indie film and decided it would not without the gloss.

79,Catherine_Grace_Zeh,Excellent biopic about a very sly con artist,10,27 November 2006,"CATCH ME IF YOU CAN, in my opinion, is an excellent biopic about a very sly con artist. If you ask me, Frank (Leonardo DiCaprio) was a very sly criminal and con artist. I just can't believe he did it for a stupid reason, though. If you want to know the reason, you'll have to see the movie. However, I could relate to how he was feeling, albeit I didn't do what he did. I would never commit any kind of a crime. Even if I had been set up for a crime, I know someone would get me off the hook. Before I wrap this up, I'd like to say that Leonardo DiCaprio and Tom Hanks make a great team.

82,slokes,Going Places,8,17 March 2006,"Steven Spielberg has what you might call D.W. Griffith disease. If he can't make a monumental film, he makes an insignificant one. I thought that, anyway, until a second viewing of ""Catch Me If You Can"" convinced me I was wrong. Like many great artists, Spielberg doesn't have to swing for the fences to make an indelible impression every time out.Indelible impressions are the sort of thing Frank Abagnale Jr. is good at, especially on the kind of phony checks that fool bank security. After his parents' divorce, Frank (Leonardo DiCaprio) sets off in the Big Apple, making his way as an airline pilot, a doctor, and an assistant district attorney, all by means of fraudulent credentials and irresistible charm, not to mention the ability to stay one step ahead of the law, as represented by FBI Special Agent Carl Hanratty (Tom Hanks).A film that owes a debt to Alfred Hitchcock by way of Henry Mancini, ""Catch Me If You Can"" zips along on its own kind of sneaky charm, making us root for a character who would probably steal our life savings if given half a chance. At the same time, Spielberg avoids the pitfall of relativism by making sure Hanks as Hanratty keeps some amount of our rooting interest, however much we feel for this crazy kid with his naive belief that, like the mouse stuck in a bucket of cream, he can churn his bucket into butter and crawl out. It's a trick every bit worthy of the subject of this engaging tale.From the opening moments of this film, featuring the best-ever Spielberg titles sequence (courtesy of Kuntzel-Deggas) and a very unusual but entrancing John Williams score that uses shushing sounds and finger snaps in place of his normal bombast, we realize we are in unusual territory for a Spielberg film. Right away, the theme of mistaken identity is introduced courtesy of a ""To Tell The Truth"" clip with host Joe Garagiola giving us three Frank Abagnales to choose from. We think we know which one he is, but we don't know as much as we think.""You know why the Yankees always win?"" asks Frank's father, Frank Sr. (Christopher Walken). ""It's because the other team can't stop staring at those damn pinstripes."" Walken, like Spielberg, works against audience expectations. Sure, he's a criminal, much what we expect from Walken, but he's got a good heart and a beguiling innocence. He believes in the American dream, even if he cons innocent ladies with phony jewelry to get what he wants. Ultimately he's a victim, and a lesson to his son about why the straight and narrow isn't the way to go.DeCaprio gives a solid, impressive performance, the best I've seen from him, playing a consummate conman who succeeds because he believes his cons as much as his victims. He finds the drama in his character, but also the comedy, in a film that shows Spielberg can be funny even when he involves us in a dramatic story. As we watch him fake his way aboard a cockpit, in an operating room, and even in a bedroom with an expensive callgirl played by Jennifer Garner, we shake our heads at what he gets away with but smile because he's succeeding.The film also benefits from an immersive sense of the period in which it is set. Williams' score, along with the costumes and set design, present us with a view of the 1960s in its more sophisticated adult form, with Dusty Springfield and Frank Sinatra providing the music rather than the pop and rock acts we think of when we think of the time.Does ""Catch Me If You Can"" go on longer than it should? Yes, I think tougher editing would have made it better. But I don't miss the mawkish attempts at uplift that pock Spielberg's lesser work, and the few poignant moments Spielberg throws in amid Abagnale's ruses ring true, especially a moment involving Frank and a little girl at a window near the end of the film that only Spielberg would try to get away with, because he can and does.No, this is not a great film, just a very good one that might have slipped past a few people on its first release, as it did me. But give ""Catch Me If You Can"" a chance, and you may find this as a con you not only enjoy being taken by, but wish to experience again just to see how the masters, Abagnale and Spielberg, make their plays.",Catch Me If You Can
83,MrFilmAndTelevisionShow,Catch Me If You Can,9,16 July 2021,"Funny, intriguing and makes you wonder what is about to happen next.

84,Agent10,Nice piece of fluffy drama,7,11 June 2003,"This was the first film I have ever seen where I wasn't totally disgusted by Leonardo DiCaprio's presence. Maybe it was the fact that Tom Hanks was in the film, or it was the fact that DiCaprio actually acted well in a role. Either way, this movie was rather nicely done and well put together. The story also proved to be unique enough to grab someone's attention. Steven Spielberg also made a welcome change of pace, getting away from the sci-fi genre for a nice little foray into a light drama. What would have been really interesting was if the real Frank Abagnale was somewhere in the film, considering he looked nothing like DiCaprio. Anyway, this a was a pretty good film overall.",Catch Me If You Can
85,Boyo-2,Leonardo is Superb,10,24 January 2003,"Fully realizing the acting opportunity he was given, Leonardo acts his tail off in this true story of a real crook.  He's not as cold-blooded as, say, Angelica Huston in ""The Grifters"", but he's ruthless, unstoppable and sharp as a tack.  In many ways, he was just ahead of his time. Today he'd be on talk shows bragging about his conquests and would seem right in time.  Back then people were more decent and trusting and he was able to exploit that. 
Steven gives the movie a lot of style.  It all looks and feels correct to the period but you are not assaulted w/this.  Christopher Walken, Martin Sheen and Jennifer Garner are terrific too.  Even Tom Hanks doesn't come across as annoying and self-important as he usually does.  Leo baby, I missed you.  Thanks for coming back to the big screen. 9/10.",Catch Me If You Can

Not that it isn't entertaining, it is quite entertaining, but once the effects of this sugarcoated, high-gloss 'true story' wear off, it makes you wonder why we should really care about some kid who ran around the globe forging checks and seducing girls with low self-esteem to get ahead in his extortion scams. Tom Hanks shows up once again (*yawn*) with his typical 'martyr of purity' shtick; I would've preferred less of him and more of Christopher Walken's impassioned (and far more brief) performance as a long-suffering father.6/10",Catch Me If You Can

He runs away and becomes a professional con-artist, posing as an airline pilot, a paediatrician and a lawyer, and scamming millions of dollars' worth of phony cashier's cheques. Eventually however, reality comes crashing in on him, along with the Federal Bureau of Investigation.This is an amazing true story about a consummate escape-artist, who crammed a lifetime of criminal adventure into his teenage years, paid the price for it, and started a second life on the other side of the law. It's hard not to like Frank, who genuinely seems to care about people, and whose obsession with stealing and fooling the authorities is more of a behavioural aberration than a desire to get rich quick. DiCaprio is iconic in the lead, with excellent support from Walken as his beleaguered father and Hanks as the workaholic Fed on his case. The charm of the picture comes from the ingenious and increasingly sophisticated methods Frank employs to commit his forgeries and realise his fictitious personalities. There is also a wonderful attention to detail in recreating the mid-sixties atmosphere, particularly in the groovy title sequence and the playfully tense Bernard Herrmann-style score by John Williams. A slick, enjoyable chase film, based on a book by the real Abagnale, who acted as a technical consultant and has a cameo as a French cop.

Abignale, Jr. who is just a kid as he pretends to be a schoolteacher. After his father and mother get a divorce he runs away and starts pretending to be a co-pilot, a doctor, a lawyer. The way he does this is funny and brilliant.I am not a big fan of Leonardo DiCaprio who plays Frank but in this movie he is perfect. He gives a very fine performance. Tom Hanks is the FBI-agent Carl who is after him, and as always Hanks is good.The story is inspired by a real story. I don't know in how many ways it is true but watching this guy all I wanted to see was him pulling more of his nice little tricks. The scene where he pretends to be a schoolteacher is just great.

Using the old show as a frame, it takes the audience's already owned recognition of DiCaprio to start telling the story chronologically. I really like how the movie immerses the audience in Frank's story. The movie moves forward nicely from event to event to depict the milestones in Frank's check forgery career. Also the cinematography at times indulges the audience with great moving shots. The acting work in overall is a great work. Having the cast comprise of an ensemble is a good thing to balance DiCaprio's acting in the scenes and also grab attention for them. Leo DiCaprio, despite his older age, managed to grab the youthful energy as an adolescent here. Tom Hanks did also well in portraying the relentlessness of the agent.",Catch Me If You Can
91,rosscinema,Very good film has those Spielberg edges!,7,18 March 2003,"At first I thought I was going to see a lightweight film from a great director but instead I watched another impressive achievement by Steven Spielberg. A few things stand out and of course the performances are terrific. Leonardo Dicaprio is believable as a guy that can convince people that he's someone else. Dicaprio is a charmer and is very smooth as we watch his character do some fancy talk to the young ladies. Tom Hanks as the FBI agent reminds me of his cynical character that he played in ""A League of Their Own"" and his mere presence adds more to this film. The sign of a great film star. And Christopher Walken gives one of his best performances in his already interesting career. The last scene of him as he talks to his son in the restaurant is so moving that it reflects on the great talent of Walken. You can understand why Dicaprio admires and loves his father. Walken conveys these emotions and makes the audience react just accurately. I'll be rooting for him at Oscar time. Another impressive thing about this film is the beautiful cinematography by Janusz Kaminski who's a real artist with a camera and has worked on several Spielberg films. One shot in particular stands out. The ray of sunshine coming in through the kitchen window on Walken. Very thought provoking. And of course since its a Spielberg film its very personal. Spielberg was interested in the Frank Abagnale character because as a youngster he also came from a broken family and wanted to be someone else. Spielberg would sneak onto the studios and tell people that he worked there. Also, the real Frank Abagnale jr. appears as a French police officer. Well made, extremely well acted and sharply written. Viewers seem to forget that this is really a film about the breaking up of a family and the aftermath. This really is a personal film from Spielberg, and a very good one.",Catch Me If You Can
92,raulfaust,Getting Away With Murder,7,1 May 2014,"Well, first I'd like to comment how easy it is to lure spectator into this movie, due to the great names involved in this project. Steven Spielberg, Leonardo DiCaprio and Christopher Walken are what made me wanna see it. To be honest, the film as a whole is good. Frank Jr. is a guy who is willing to do anything in his power to make easy money, even if it means stealing and cheating all around. There are plenty of moments in which the spectator gets to think ""he won't get away with it"", but, surprisingly, the well written plot always allows him escaping from the FBI. However, sometimes the way DiCaprio's character gets away feels over-the-top, considering that people wouldn't be THAT dumb in real life. I mean, how would Frank Jr. work as a physician in a hospital without EVER being asked about diseases or something related to it? Wouldn't Brenda's family make questions involving medicine? So, in my opinion, ""Catch Me If You Can"" is a well directed movie that entertains the spectator for the whole time, but sometimes admits to be just a movie and not a real thing.",Catch Me If You Can

Leo is unusually engaging, but leftyst mouthpiece Tom Hanks is so serious it unbalances the tone of the movie. And then, as if unable to help himself, Leo has a crying and puking scene. Is it in his contract?Ultimately, what should have been a light-hearted, 90-minute romp turned into a night-long grind. I felt relief when it was finally over.

94,eric262003,One To Keep You Engaged,8,17 June 2013,".The inspiration of the movie ""Catch Me If You Can"" must have lingered in director Steven Spielberg's mind for decades after knowing the amazing misadventures our protagonist Frank Abagnale Jr. encountered throughout his very highly interesting life. Spielberg who as a youth in the 1960's used to get past security at Universal Studios just to sneak in and marvel at the art of filmmaking.Leonardo Di Caprio as Frank Abagnale Jr. is seen in the midst interviewing a Pan American supervisor to get a full report on the careers of airplane pilots for the purpose of writing an article for his high school paper. What's really going on is he's seeking knowledge on the many activities Pan Am pilots as he tries to successfully do everything he could to mimic them. Along with his savvy ways of impressions and conjuring up bogus cheques, the FBI is left high and dry as Abagnale Jr. leaks out millions of dollars from the banks. His pilot uniform gives him the advantage to cash in cheques globally.Christopher Walken is Frank Abagnale Sr. who at one time was a thriving businessman from New Rochelle, New York and is now been reduced to eating very little but his pride. The Internal Revenue Services has been giving him hell which resulted in him owing them a bucket load of cash. The Abagnales must leave their posh mansion to a small low budgeted apartment. If that wasn't bad enough, Frank Sr.'s Franch wife for many years has added flames to the fumes by divorcing the poor hard-lucked individual and goes off to marry Frank Sr's attorney friend (James Brolin) and Frank Jr's world is taken upon him.Frank Jr has often seen his father used shady techniques to get the upper hand of people, so he makes the attempt to follow his father's legacy and enhances a few tricks of his his very own. It's soon revealed that Frank Sr. was rather subtle in his manipulative tactics compared to Frank Jr. who seems like a prodigy in in white-collar criminal activity.The real turning point of the movie that will keep viewers on the edge of your seat is the exciting battle of wits between the slick con-artist as he escapes going to jail while hard-nosed FBI agent Carl Hanratty (Tom Ranks) is hot on his trail. and would love nothing more than to see this kid eat prison food. Carl is divorced, but he is truly devoted to his job and even tried to call him at his office on Christmas Eve. They develop a bit of fondness for one another as the film progresses as Carl is impressed with Frank Jr.'s methodical suave demeanor and the game of cat and mouse is proved effective because every chance the FBI catches on to him, he seems to full a fast one on them each time. Frank Jr. admires the devotion and never give up attitude that Carl possesses in his work ethic.The film is based on the true escapades of Frank Jr. who unfortunately gets arrested in a very dramatized situation in France. However, the FBI later in the film admire the white-collar criminal's tactics to catch other potential criminal minds.After Abagnale Jr. served his sentence,he no longer continued his craft and made a butt-load of cash as a security consulter in a corporate world. In a strange twist of irony, he owed millions all the while he ended up saving millions. I guess true stories do have happy endings.Martin Sheen has a supporting role as the father whose daughter wants to marry Frank Jr. but does not seem fond of his daughter's request. The unpredictable kid with a plethora of numerous alter-egos meets her as he's seen as an E.R. medical intern and before you know it, he's now a young lawyer who passed the State Bar in Louisiana. And next we see him as an assistant junior attorney working in his future father-in0law's firm.",Catch Me If You Can

96,brando647,Fun Movie with Great Cast,8,4 February 2009,"You can't really go wrong with a film from Steven Spielberg. I can't really think of a bad film the man has ever made, so you know to expect quality when you watch his movies; this 2002 Christmas release is no different. Inspired by a true story, the film follows the story of Frank Abagnale Jr., one of the greatest con artists the United States has ever seen. Abagnale had posed as an airline pilot, doctor, and lawyer before he turned 21, cashing more than $2 million in fraudulent checks.Jeff Nathanson based the screenplay on the book of the same name, written by Abagnale himself. The story covers so much and moves so fast, yet it never loses the audience or stumbles over itself. In the capable hands of Spielberg, the movie drives on at a good pace and keeps the audience interested throughout. In the end, it's the character of Abagnale that makes the movie so entertaining. At the time, I hadn't cared a whole lot for Leonardo DiCaprio in the past but this movie changed that a bit. DiCaprio was a fan of Abagnale's book before the film ever came about, so his passion for the material shines through his performance. He also had great chemistry with Tom Hanks, who plays the FBI agent on his trail. We also get a strong supporting performance from Christopher Walken as Frank's father; despite his minimal screen time, it was enough to make an impression (and win some awards).Knowing Spielberg spares no expense, you can also expect great production design. With the film set in the 1960's, it made for some colorful scenery. The movie does run a bit long (a little over two hours) but it isn't painful. It's a fun movie and Spielberg doesn't let you down; all I can do is recommend you check it out.",Catch Me If You Can

I think that Steven Spielberg succeeded finally creating an entertaining cat and mouse romantic thriller after his flops AI and MR. The best thing is that all is based on a true story. The setting of the sixties accompanied by some songs of Frank Sinatra gave me the impression to be in that time. I can recommend it to everyone that likes heist films. It is by far better than ""Heist"", ""The Score"" or ""Oceans 11"". My vote is anyway lightly above average because there is not enough suspense atmosphere. 6.5/10.",Catch Me If You Can

After that there is a succession of forgeries and impersonations some of them a bit unbelievable that take place in a not too exciting development. The kid is not a bad guy after all and has a lot of chances to show his good sentiments. He almost always behaves nicely. The affection developed between chaser and chased (maybe the most important feature of the movie) is not deeply explored. Well the story is a bit lukewarm and makes you sometimes think how is it possible that the kid has not been caught on several occasions. We only believe it due to to the great individual freedom and personal mobility that exist (and existed already in the sixties when the story takes place) in USA with the possibility of people changing their names all the time if they want to, etc.. I think in most European countries that kid would be caught very soon with our much more tight personal controls, mandatory identity cards, etc.. Concerning the acting, Di Caprio is equal to himself as we know him and in my opinion Tom Hanks' real talent is waisted in this movie. By the way a curious note: FBI agents are not shown here as the usual supermen and heroes but many of them as somewhat poor guys and not very bright. Well just a tolerable movie no more than that.",Catch Me If You Can
100,tomsview,Caught me,9,13 May 2014,"One thing is for sure, Steven Spielberg has an amazing range.He made this engaging movie in a five-year period that included ""A.I. Artificial Intelligence"", ""Minority Report"", ""The Terminal"", ""War of the Worlds"" and ""Munich"".Set in the early 60's, the movie tells the story of Frank Abignale (Leo DiCaprio) and how he impersonated an airline pilot, a secret agent, a doctor and finally a county prosecutor before he was 21-years old. Unfortunately, he also made a lot of money passing bad cheques. This brought him to the attention of Carl Hanratty (Tom Hanks), an FBI bank fraud agent who pursues him relentlessly across the United States and finally to France.The pursuit becomes a personal contest between them, and although a rapport develops, it is still a high stakes game. However, the film has a surprising outcome; the perfect close to a movie that is enjoyable on many levels.It's a long movie but it doesn't outstay its welcome, Spielberg gives the movie a light touch, and demonstrates a genuine sense of comic timing comparable to a John Hughes, a Frank Oz or maybe even a Preston Sturges.Although not necessarily a comedy, the film is studded with genuinely funny moments, much of it generated by Frank's sheer audacity. There are a number of scenes where Spielberg holds back the punchline, we can fill it in for ourselves such as Frank's knock knock joke or when Jennifer Garner as the high class call girl gives Frank $400 in change when he signs over his homemade pay cheque to her - we know something she doesn't.Between them, DiCaprio, Hanks and Spielberg make every bit of business work without losing sight of the story, which promises inevitable tragedy for Frank.There is a serious side to the story. It tells how Frank is at first dislocated by his parent's financial troubles and then shattered by their breakup. He is also affected by the behaviour of his father, Frank Abagnale, Snr, (Christopher Walken) who seems to believe that image is more important than reality. These forces conspire to push Frank into pretending he is something he isn't.The film also reflects a more naive time as far as security at airports and banks is concerned, Frank capitalises on people's innate respect for professions and institutions, but his actions hurt people, not least himself.Of course today, Frank would probably have to perpetuate his scams online, but the anonymity of the Internet doesn't require the amount of chutzpah that Frank shows as he stands at the counter in his pilot's uniform to cash his rubbery cheques, or ""concurs"" with his fellow physicians when posing as the head of emergency at a hospital. It's that element of daring that makes Frank's crimes entertaining rather than despicable.I have seen this film quite a few times, and like the best movies, the reunion is always rewarding.",Catch Me If You Can

Sure, liberties were taken with the facts but the true story is extraordinary enough that the fabrications don't seem out of place at all. While the story is mainly light-hearted it also shows some depth in dealing with the characters.The cast is a fine one with Tom Hanks & Leonardo DiCaprio excellent together as pursuer & pursued. Just having one of them would have been great but having both of them together is a rare treat. The supporting cast is also top-notch with Christopher Walken, Martin Sheen & Amy Adams all giving memorable performances.The direction by Spielberg is flawless as usual and the cinematography is a key contributor to the film's vibrancy. The period look is very appealing with close attention to detail and a retro opening credits sequence to boot. Also adding to the film's flavour are the jazzy score by John Williams and a number of well-chosen pop songs from the period.The fact that Spielberg has directed so many excellent films unfortunately means that some of them get unjustly overlooked.

Showing the difficulty the real Abegnale would have had to endure would add some realism and make the tale less of a fantasy escape, which is what it ultimately ends up as. But for a fantasy escape, there is some real drama infused into the story, especially with the strange yet fascinating relationship between Abegnale Jr. and Sr, and Frank Jr. realizing that he can't just settle down to marry his girlfriend Brenda (Amy Adams) who knows him under a different identity, since he is being constantly hunted by the authorities. And near the end, Carl Hanratty (Tom Hanks) gradually warms to his query Abegnale, despite all the trials and frustrations he has been put through - an unexpected and much appreciated reversal of character.DiCaprio does a good portrayal of Abegnale Jr. as he starts out confident and full of energy, while slowly descending into virtual paranoia, always looking over his shoulder and devising new ways to once again prevent capture. Tom Hanks also gives a strong performance as Carl Hanratty, the driven officer determined to catch Abegnale Jr. and bring him to justice. Yet they are both in danger of being overshadowed by notorious scene stealer Christopher Walken, in an Academy Award nominated performance, playing Abegnale Sr. the idol of his criminal son. Walken is truly affecting as he slowly comes to terms that he isn't as invincible as he thought, as his wife leaves him and everything he possesses is steadily taken by the government as he continually neglects to pay taxes. But his frequent self-confidence boosting sayings (""Two mice fell into a bucket of cream. One gave up and quickly drowned, but the second kept struggling and churned the cream into butter. Right now, I am that second mouse"") give his son (and perhaps himself as well) the impression that he's on top of his situation.It's an excellent package, with John Williams' excellent 50's style score beautifully complementing Spielberg's work. It may be lighter and less realistic than it could have been, but Catch me if you Can is without a doubt, a lot of fun to watch, which is all it really needed to be.-9/10",Catch Me If You Can
106,blumdeluxe,Worth a watch but not a must-see,7,4 December 2016,"One of the most important things a film should offer its audience is surely a story worth being told. ""Catch me if you can"" definitely achieves this. The story of a charming fraud, a young man that starts his career in crime out of desperation and boredom and achieves everything a regular man or woman can only dream of without really hurting anyone. The story of a most unlikely friendship between two men that play cat and mouse with each other for such a long period of time that they finally come to respect each other.While the story thus has a lot to offer, there are also some points that prevent this movie to really become a classic in my eyes. The characters, apart of DiCaprio's one appear a bit flat and one-dimensional and not much effort was put into their development. Some exaggerations further lead the way into a movie that's definitely entertaining, more so than many other blockbusters, but that in the end doesn't really leave a huge impact as well.Well worth a watch for an entertaining evening but not a must-see in my opinion.",Catch Me If You Can

Because, in order to catch you, which Steven Spielberg does, and finds doing it a good deal easier than the task ascribed before Carl Hanratty, he has to evolve and embellish this story with some not insignificant leaps of faith. Fine if its a conjured tale of fiction but ever so slightly, for me, detrimental to the experience as a whole, as its not.",Catch Me If You Can
108,seymourblack-1,A Filmmaker's Dream-Come-True,9,9 August 2016,"This fact-based story about con-artist Frank Abagnale Jr. is a filmmaker's dream-come-true because it's absolutely incredible, outrageously funny and features an extraordinary protagonist. Based on his autobiography (which he wrote with Stan Redding), it charts Abagnale's exploits as a teenager who made millions of dollars through cheque fraud, travelled extensively at no cost to himself and assumed a number of fake identities with such success that he quickly achieved a glamorous lifestyle, great personal wealth and the attentions of numerous young women. Inevitably, his activities also attracted the attention of the FBI and led to him getting involved in a protracted cat-and-mouse game with one of their agents.Frank enjoys a perfectly happy upbringing in New Rochelle, New York until his father, Frank Sr. (Christopher Walken), starts to experience problems with the IRS over some unpaid tax and can't raise a loan to cover the shortfall. As a result, Frank Sr. loses his retail business, his car and his home and has to move his family into a small apartment. Soon after, Frank's French mother Paula (Nathalie Baye) has an affair with one of Frank Sr's fellow Rotarians and this leads to the collapse of their marriage and the painful divorce that follows. Frank is devastated by the loss of his happy family life and runs away from home.Frank looks older than his age and in his new circumstances, soon discovers that he has a natural ability to perpetrate cons by masquerading as an airline pilot and forging various documents and cheques. The wealth and respect that he gains through his activities give him a great deal of confidence and so, when FBI Agent Carl Hanratty (Tom Hanks) catches up with him at a hotel and confronts him at gunpoint, Frank simply claims to be a Secret Service Agent who'd also been pursuing the elusive Mr Abagnale Jr. and walks away from the premises before Hanratty realises that he's been duped.Frank goes on to pose as a doctor at a hospital in Atlanta, Georgia where he meets and falls in love with a sweet young nurse called Brenda (Amy Adams) who wears braces on her teeth and is worried about losing her job. When he meets Brenda's parents, he claims that he's also a qualified lawyer, like her father Roger (Martin Sheen) who's a district attorney and then gets taken on as Roger's assistant. Numerous surprising developments follow before Frank is eventually given an opportunity to rehabilitate himself in a most unexpected way.Frank Abagnale Jr. is a fascinating character and Leonardo DiCaprio absolutely shines in this role as it fully exploits his ability to be charismatic and funny whilst also subtly hinting at the vulnerability and sadness that remain with Frank as a result of his parents' divorce. The surprising relationship that he develops with the rather dull and humourless Hanratty is also an enjoyable feature of the story and becomes quite credible because of the grudging admiration that the FBI man has for Frank and the common ground that they share (both having lost their highly valued family lives). In a movie full of top class performances, Tom Hanks, Christopher Walken, Martin Sheen and Amy Adams all make a tremendous impression.The 1960s-type opening credits do a great job of establishing the period within which the action takes place and also signal the playful, upbeat style of presentation that contributes so strongly to all the fun that follows. As a highly amusing ""stranger the fiction"" story, ""Catch Me If You Can"" not only has a huge appeal that crosses many demographics but also, with its family drama, comedy and moments of suspense, provides such rich entertainment that it's no surprise that it did so well at the box office.",Catch Me If You Can
109,Spuzzlightyear,Catch this if you can!,8,17 April 2006,"The life of Frank Abignale is explored here rather excellently by Steven Spielberg and company. This is all about a expert cheque forger who scammed his way into jobs with Pan-Am, was a high ranking lawyer and doctor, and romanced countless women. After getting caught by ruthless F.B.I. agent Carl Hanratty, Abignale wrote an outstanding memoir, which has been quite faithfully brought to the screen. Leonardo Dicaprio is quite great here as Abignale and Hanks is good as Hanratty. After watching it, reading the book and then watching it again, I feel the book is slightly better, as the movie leaves holes in subplots the movie alludes to, but doesn't explore further (like his time in jail, and his relations with the Pan-Am recruits, which, bizarrely in the movie, is just dropped, making me wonder what on earth it was there for).

112,classicalsteve,"Terrific Story of Real-Life Con-Artist and Impersonator Frank Abagnale Jr. Lived by ""If You Can't Beat 'Em Join 'Em"": DeCaprio's Finest Performance",10,19 January 2011,"Unlike most criminals, we all tend to like con artists or ""confidence men"". Con artists have to be likable, and they have to be so convincing that ""being taken"" never enters your mind. The perfect con is one where the mark never realizes he or she has been had. Frank Abagnale Jr. was one smart and likable kid who realized early on that a lot of decisions are often based on artificial perceptions which may have nothing to do with reality. If you lay in front of people certain visual clues which play into people's preconceived notions, including their prejudices (which can be sometimes positive), you can steer people into a particular understanding which may have nothing to do with reality. Abagnale decided to test this idea by dressing as an airline pilot. And it worked; he found that simply wearing the uniform convinced people he was an airline pilot, and therefore trustworthy.After his parents divorce, Frank Abagnale Jr. runs away from home and has to figure out how he can make a living. He learns how to forge cheques, but he can't get anyone to take his cheque since they don't ""know him"". He has no luck until he sees some airline pilots with their entourage of beautiful stewardesses, all in Pan Am regalia. In their uniforms, airline pilots appear to be the equivalent of nobility, with people staring in wonder as they pass by. In the 1960's, people had an idealized perception of airline pilots as honest and even heroic, a kind of positive prejudice. If Abagnale could project the illusion of being an airline pilot, he might be given carte blanche to cash his forged cheques. Why not join the party? It's even better than donning a Superman outfit.Through some ingenious maneuvering, Abagnale acquires a uniform and an ID card to pass himself off as a co-pilot for Pan Am. What he finds is much more than he bargained for. By simply wearing his uniform and carrying a forged ID card, Abagnale opens bank accounts, flies on airlines for free, even gets free room and board at the expense of the airline. And he's cashing millions of dollars worth of Pan Am cheques. Everything seems to be going his way until the feds pick up the scent of a prolific cheque counterfeiter and con-artist. Pan Am knows about the fraud and they aren't going to look away. Pan Am and the Feds know he is posing as someone in the airline industry, but they don't know who he is. They misidentify him as a young man in his early 30's. Abagnale is not even 18. The Feds realize their mistake, and Abagnale, to lose their scent, becomes someone else, first a medical doctor, then an attorney. And the cat-and-mouse game is on.Certainly, in retrospect, everything does seem a little too easy, but when watching it, I bought into it, hook, line and sinker, just like I was being taken by a good con artist. A couple of scenes point out he's getting in over his head, particularly a judicial hearing in which DiCaprio, based on some footage he sees on the TV show ""Perry Mason"", starts presenting evidence like a prosecutor at trial. But Abagnale, having not been to law school, doesn't know the difference between a hearing and a trial. This seemed pretty realistic. A similar scene also occurs when he's practicing medicine.This is just a great joy ride of a film, an incredibly compelling story, and possibly my favorite performance by DiCaprio. The combination of DiCaprio's performance, Spielberg's direction, and the fantastic script keep everything moving, making you believe you've been through this roller coaster along with Abagnale. In modern life, we often want to fantasize being something else, the grass is always greener in the other yard, etc. Frank Abagnale took that idea to the extreme and led a life where he realized his true fantasies.",Catch Me If You Can
113,sharky_55,Do you concur?,8,11 February 2016,"Leonardo DiCaprio occupies the role of Frank Abagnale with such ease that it is easy to forget that he is just a teen at the beginning - and barely an adult when it is over. I suppose it is easy for him to forget this too; slipping into these alternate identities lets him live the life he wants, get back the money they took from his father, and escape from a broken family. When he mimics the famous two mice in a bucket of milk speech when asked to say grace, it is funny, but also contains a hint of melancholy like Walken's sparse appearances throughout his con life. The suit, the cadillac, the money...all just items to show off to his father, to show that he has made it, to try and piece this family back together again. How many windows has he peered into to see happy Christmas celebrations? How many half-sisters has he waved at?Momentarily, he distracts himself with the thing he is good at. A little folded note, a little substitute teacher impersonation. Then onto bigger things, and although we know how the story ends, we are nevertheless fascinated. Spielberg's direction is visually captivating - the peering reveal over to the bathtub full of model air-planes, the swing across to the frightened bank teller informing her manager (to signal one plan that doesn't work - so he learns and adjusts his cons), the way he racks focus from the fine print of the check to DiCaprio to indicate just how precise and alluring his charms and deflections are. Williams is great too - the way he builds momentum and confidence as Frank becomes more adept, and twinkles when we see closeups of the favourite trick that he inherited from his father. Completing the effect are those endearing voice-overs of faux-success and worldly experience to his father - no doubt a very important part of his motive is to impress him. This is one of DiCaprio's better performances. He doesn't have a whole lot of emotional range to work with (for example, the real Abagnale left his medical supervisor position because he realised he was putting lives at stake - in the film it is completely comedic) and even when he does emote it is somewhat an act - see the bait and switch where he seems to confess to Roger Strong, but becomes a soppy romantic instead. His best moment is the way he slides effortlessly into the Secret Service Agent 'Barry Allen' only after a tiny second of realisation of what he has been caught in - the way his approach disarms Hanratty so subtly (""Here, take my whole wallet""), the way he mimics his tactics to build authenticity (""Mind if I see some identification"") and how he is able to uses his own knowledge to pose as someone who has been diligently chasing himself down. Hanks' Hanratty is decent as the straight man who is initially consumed by the chase; there are some juvenile moments including a harsh cackle over the phone at Christmas which doesn't quite work because Hanks is not mean enough for it and because their dynamic works so much better when they are ribbing and teasing - Hanratty not falling for his whole sickness routine in jail, and constantly trying to pry his methods for passing the bar exam. It even manages to be a little poignant at the end between the two. Feeling suffocated by the never-ending sentence to bust the scams he once mastered, he takes off and even makes it to the airport to seek that life of lies that seems to be easier than confronting the truth; the death of his father, and the new marriage and family of his mother. Hanratty is all but ready to let him go, but reminds him that no one will be chasing this time. Perhaps he was right when he realised that Abagnale had no one to call at Christmas. DiCaprio's frenzied reaction to seeing him deep in hiding in France suggests that he is most at ease constantly moving from place to place and busying himself with the thrill of the chase. Even James Bond had to call it a day when his time was up, and Frank is now ready to accept it.",Catch Me If You Can

115,vitaleralphlouis,Spielberg's Dreadful Remake of The Great Impostor.,1,9 August 2005,"How many dreadful movies can this Spielberg guy generate before the public catches on that he's a flash-in-the-pan non talent who got lucky with Jaws and Raiders, crash-diving every time thereafter. Sure, some were taken-in by Saving Private Ryan, actually taking it as a patriotic movie when, in fact, it thoroughly trashed our World War II veterans. Perhaps the day has arrived, as this and other Spielberg films (Terminal, Lady Killers) did poor box office.Herein Spielberg takes a hand at retelling the story previously filmed well by Universal in ""The Great Impostor"" starring Tony Curtis. The original film was definitely offbeat, but lighthearted. Impossible to believe, except they said it was all true. The newer version has a nasty tone to it, and fails to engage the audience. I like Leonardo De Caprio a lot, but thought he struck out in this one. Tom Hanks used to be an exceptional actor, but now seems content to be an extended body part to his one and only master. This is really half a review, as I couldn't get beyond 60 minutes of the dreary mess.",Catch Me If You Can
116,rupie,what a delightful surprise !,8,1 July 2003,"I passed this by when I saw it on the racks because I had never heard of it and because 'Titanic' ruined Leonardo deCaprio for me. However I caught a trailer for it at the beginning of the film I wound up renting that day, and was intrigued. It was my subsequent rental, and turned out to be a delightful surprise, and one of the best movies I have seen lately.Right at the start, Spielberg is making a nostalgic gesture towards older days with the elaborate, whimsical title sequence. The title sequence became a whole deal unto itself in movies of the 60's & 70's (take, e.g., Saul Bass's great work in this area for Alfred Hitchcock), but has pretty much disappeared nowadays. It was nice to revisit this experience, with John Williams' playful score augmenting the visuals. An auspicious start.DeCaprio's work here makes me revise my low expectations of him. He does a fine job here as the driven Frank Abagnale. Likewise for Tom Hanks as agent Handratty, my only complaint with whom is his phony Boston accent. The chemistry between the two is great.The excellent script and Spielberg's direction keeps the movie going at a good clip and definitely keeps us on the edge of our seat as we see Frank artfully keep one step ahead of the dogged Handratty. The film is richly textured as well. It works as a suspense/intrigue movie, but also shows us Frank's complex motivations and confused family life. It also skillfully interweaves some delightful moments of ironic humor. Mention must be made of Christopher Walken - a fine and underrated actor - who here does a superb job as Frank's well-meaning, but doomed-to-failure father. Walken does a great job of making us feel sympathy for this man who never seems quite able to get his life together, but whose intentions are always good. On the whole, an excellent movie which takes us back to simpler days when moviemakers found fascinating stories about interesting people and told them as entertainingly as they could.",Catch Me If You Can
117,Stampsfightclub,Worth catching,7,23 March 2010,"Frank Abagnale Jr. (Di Caprio) makes his way across America posing as a lawyer, a pilot, a doctor whilst all the while being chased by Carl Hanratty (Hanks) Based on the true story of conman Frank Abagnale Jr. this ambitious crime caper is a turn for excitement harmless joy that encodes spurts of comedy in a dramatic construction of a man looking for a sense of mayhem and wealth, to live in his father's footsteps.Flowing with the energy you would expect from a Spielberg project alongside Oscar nominated scorer John Williams you would expect a ferocious appetite of crime shindigs and sharp tantalising scenarios across America and for the most part we see a relaxing and remarkable story that is hard and equally remarkable to believe really happened.Leo Di Caprio, in his first paring with Spielberg, stars as central character Frank, giving the conman an elusive personality whilst aiming to be naïve of the difficulties at home between his parents. Encoding uses of his father's charm and wit may seem corny but the resemblance between Di Caprio and Oscar nominated Christopher Walken is mirror like, giving the film a formidable consistency.Tom Hanks, in more of a supporting role, has his moments as the stubborn and driven FBI agent determined to catch Frank. Hanks uses the character's intelligence to his advantage to make his acts seem fruitless whilst all the while maintaining a key objective. Hanks even slides in some delicious deadpan expressions, the knock knock joke in the car for one arguably one of Hanks best ever comedy moments, which is quite something given the American's CV.The plot is the main drawback of the film's potential. Whilst the story itself is based on true events, there feels a lack of consistent believability, which is purely down to the messy structure placed upon it. Starting on a game show, it jumps back to Frank's youth, then to prison then forward to school years, then his fleeing, then forward to present and so forth and because of these Kangaroo style jumps there feels a reluctance to let us into the moment of the character and situation. We are just getting used to Frank being a pilot when the film shunts us to present day dealings and it is a real pain as if this film was portrayed in chronological order we would have had a flawless foundation for an endless chase without knowing the outcome.Williams' score is brilliant, especially the title sequence and Oscar nominated was a truly deserved. The title sequence matches the feel of the music so poignantly we are instantly engaged and ready for the off.The film collaborates usage of career mastery and unanswered questions to the eventual finale, that is worth catching and as mentioned, had this film gone from past to present with no flash back/forwards it would have been perfect.

120,gbheron,A Treat from Spielberg,9,1 June 2003,"The plot is so preposterous it has to be true. A young man, a teenager actually, drops out of high school and, not satisfied with low-end jobs, variously impersonates an airline pilot, physician, and lawyer. All his impersonations work, and he uses his personas in various forgery schemes that net him millions of dollars that fuel his high-flying international life-style. The young man, Frank Abagnail, is played with breezy confidence by Leonardo DiCaprio. DiCaprio is wonderfully believable and his portrayal of the young con man is one of his best roles.But it's not all entirely fun and games.  The relationship between Frank and his parents, especially his dearly beloved but down-on-his luck father (Christopher Walken) is sad and multi-layered. The third important personal dimension is between Frank and the FBI agent (Tom Hanks) who pursues him.Set in the early 60s, Spielberg nails the period perfectly from the opening credits through the clothing styles, modes of entertainment and transportation, and even personal accoutrements. It's perfection.  After a string of darker pictures it's heartening to see Spielberg take on this project. It's paid off very well for his fans and the movie going public.",Catch Me If You Can
121,KnightsofNi11,An absolute blast,8,6 August 2011,"I love sitting down to watch a movie, not expecting much, and then being pleasantly surprised by what a great movie it was. That is just the case with Stephen Spielberg's Catch Me If You Can. The movie stars Leonardo DiCaprio as Frank Abagnale Jr., one of the most successful and intelligent con men of all time. When Frank is sixteen his father runs into problems with the IRA and loses his entire fortune, which also prompts his wife to leave him. From then on Frank vows to earn back his father's savings. He does so through a slightly (i.e. extremely) illegal manner. Check fraud. Frank travels the world taking on different personas, faking work as a pilot, doctor, lawyer, etc. But once the money he is illegally earning starts to build up, red flags go up for the FBI and Agent Carl Hanratty, played so well by Tom Hanks, sets out on an obsessive quest to chase down and capture Frank.The film is clever, quick, and an absolute blast.The nice thing about Catch Me If You Can is that it doesn't take itself too terribly seriously. It is more of a lighthearted film with a serious undertone. This film is actually really funny at times before it grows into a more serious story of character development and winding plot progression. But from start to finish it manages to retain a feeling of witty intelligence that stays smart and intelligible, but also entertaining and fun. The film never gets unbearably boring, even when it slows down for more serious plot points. It is 140 minutes long so certain things are a bit drawn out and I can't say that every scene has a major purpose, but it's always fun and always entertaining.I have a certain asphyxiation with con and heist films, so Catch Me If You Can is sort of a dream come true for me. It is every single thing about great and clever cons wrapped into one film. Watching Frank Abagnale work is like magic. The situations he talks his way out of and the ways he manages to get around certain things is uncanny. The film is based on a true story so I'm not sure what about his cons is true and what is exaggerated, but it all makes for great entertainment. There's something so inherently fascinating about the way he manipulates people through ingeniously subtle psychology and the way it works seamlessly, most of the time at least.The film also succeeds by adding a new layer to a typical con film. It makes its incredibly clever and devious protagonist human. A lot of films portray the con man as a flawless machine that works everything out so perfectly and executes every minute detail without a single issue, so much so that they are more of a gimmick than an actual character. The character of Frank Abagnale is truly human, complete with all of his inner turmoil and realistic flaws. Throughout the film he grows more and more troubled as the law gets closer and closer to him. We see a very human transformation that is as touching as it is fascinating. By the end of the film we love this character not because he is a clever genius, but because he is human.If I had any tiffs with the film they would be that it runs a little long and some of the logic doesn't always add up. But it's nothing to make me dislike this film in any way. It was a blast to watch and a joy to reflect on. Strong performances helm the film while a great atmosphere and wonderfully intelligent character development make its roots run deeply sincere. This film is one of the most human con man stories I have ever seen and for that it deserves a hefty amount of credit. This is a fantastic film.",Catch Me If You Can
122,stamper,Falsely categorized,7,30 March 2003,"One thing that strikers me at IMDB is that the films there always carry so many genre titles. Catch me if you can is one of them. Virtually every category that was ever invented is listed, despite the fact that this is clearly what we (in Dutch) would call a speelfilm' or a spielfilm' in German. I do not know if there is a translation for it in genre' terms, but it roughly means motion picture'. You see this is just the story of a young fraud with not too much adventure, thrills or drama in it although featuring a lot of crime.
I think that after this film, there will be a time of quiet surrounding Steven Spielberg, because it is the way he's done it previously. Hook (1991), Jurassic Park (1993) and Schindler's List (1993), then taking a 4 year break from making movies; Amistad (1997), The Lost World: Jurassic Park (1997) and Saving Private Ryan (1998), then taking a 3 year break and now AI (2001), Minority Report (2002) and Catch me if you Can (2002) making a ??? year break I presume. Why do I make this list you wonder well, I do it to make a point. The point is, that I think that Spielberg will take a bit of a break now and that I think he needs one, because the last films he has made weren't really good. I mean you obviously cannot keep making Schindler's List's or Jurassic Park's but there is something missing lately in Spielberg's work. I miss that feeling that I'm watching the films of someone who never stopped being a small child and I miss the feeling. I mean let's face it, in AI Spielberg tried to insert that dreamy side of himself, but it failed because the Spielberg ending did not fit the Kubrick story, then there came Minority Report which proved that Spielberg is not the best in making thrilling crime movies and now there is Catch me if you Can a film that has a pretty nice story, but also a film that is neither good nor bad. It is entertainment, in it's most normal form and nothing one would assume to have been made by Spielberg. It's not as if I'm not happy with the choices that he makes, but I feel that he could bring more feeling into his film. One could have felt more involved, the film could have been more dramatic and more moving. What happened Mr.Williams' great scores (I know he got an Oscar nomination, but I cannot remember one bit of film, where the music stuck out). This film is just not Spielberg's territory and it shows, for it is not as outstanding and memorable as his other work. Spielberg's territories clearly are adventure (JP, Indiana), Drama (Color Purple, Amistad, Schindler's List) and Family films (Hook, E.T.) and maybe he could even pull off dark film like AI if he didn't try to convert it in a fairy tale at the end.

123,Ruskington,Brilliant source material expertly translated to the big screen,8,1 July 2020,"A thoroughly enjoyable and often hilarious film that manages to avoid any level of pretentiousness or ostentation. DiCaprio is mesmerising in the lead role and there is a something of a breakthrough performance by a young Amy Adams. The film is maybe a touch too long and Christopher Walken is a little bit too Christopher Walken but this is generally what a Hollywood blockbuster should look, feel and sound like.",Catch Me If You Can

I watched it last night for the first time, 17 years after it's theatrical release and I am ashamed of myself for not having watched it sooner. It has a good fun progressive pace. Top acting talent.

125,TheNorthernMonkee,fun Spielberg entertainment,7,6 January 2005,"SPOILERS Each individual director has his own unique style. Whether including a specific type of shot, or links to past films, there is always something unique to directors. The same is true of legendary director Steven Spielberg. Spielberg's films always tend to have an almost childlike feel to them. Often feel good films, Spielberg will create a film which, irrelevant of subject matter, always has a colourful style of imagery and background. In ""Catch Me If You Can"", Spielberg repeats this style with a clever little film telling the story of Frank Abagnale Junior.From the very beginning of the film, Frank Abagnale Junior (Leonardo DiCaprio) is shown to be a clever boy. Learning skills from his father (Christopher Walken), Abagnale slowly begins to learn how to copy cheques and over the next two years spends his time travelling from location to location, conning his way into different professions. All the time however, Frank is followed by FBI agent Carl Hanratty (Tom Hanks).When Steven Spielberg directs a good film, the man directs a VERY good film. Able to create an almost cartoon like world, Spielberg manages to grip us from start to finish. Whilst the opposite is true and Spielberg can sometimes create the most appalling work, with films like ""Catch Me If You Can"", we can perhaps forgive his mistakes.From the opening animation of the film, we know the basic premise. As Abagnale travels from place to place, there are moments of pure brilliance as this quick witted boy (since he's not even 17 when he begins the journey) outfoxes Hanratty time and time again.The connection between Abagnale and Hanratty in particular is what makes this film. With two well developed characters, both DiCaprio and Hanks give brilliant performances as we begin to bond with both characters. Superbly assisted by Christopher Walken and a few other actors, the two stars thrive in this fun little film.The beauty of ""Catch Me If You Can"" is the partnership of the main stars and the direction of Spielberg. Working brilliantly together, these three men and screenwriter Jeff Nathanson, have examined Abagnale's story of his life and produced a great film which remains fun from start to finish. Great fun.",Catch Me If You Can
126,FilmOtaku,Entertaining and fast paced,8,5 June 2003,"Catch Me If You Can, the true story of Frank Abagnale, Jr. is compelling from the stylish opening credits to the very satisfying ending.  I'll be honest, I have a love/hate relationship with Leonardo DiCaprio  I want to hate the guy, but once in awhile he comes out with a performance like the one in this film and I have to admit that he really is a good actor.  He convincingly portrays Abagnale, a teen who managed to outrun the FBI for years - all the while writing over 4 million dollars in bad checks, posing as an airline co-pilot, a physician and an attorney.  Throughout the film, he is pursued by Carl Hanratty, an FBI agent played by Tom Hanks with whom he develops an interesting relationship. 	 While I admit to enjoying Spielberg's action and effects-driven films, I also enjoy the smaller pictures he produces as well.  This film is a prime example.  I completely forgot this was a Spielberg picture, something I consider to be a great compliment.  When a director doesn't have a defining style, it shows an immense amount of talent, and more importantly, lacks the predictability that we see all too often in Hollywood today, especially in the case of someone with such a storied and lengthy repertoire as Spielberg. Granted, Spielberg had the good fortune to have an excellent script and three fantastic actors (DiCaprio, Hanks and Walken) to work with, but the direction is practically flawless in that there are no slow moments; everything happens for a reason and is integral to the progression of the plot.  It goes without saying that a film that is close to two and a half hours in length can have lulls, or seem to be too long, but I found that I did not consider the length once while viewing it.  Perhaps I've become so jaded after seeing so many movies, but I find that more often than not that I go into a film thinking that it isn't going to be as good as I had heard or expected.  Once again, I've thankfully proven myself wrong with this film.  I thoroughly enjoyed it and highly recommend it.--Shelly",Catch Me If You Can
127,Maziun,A movie worth catching and watching,7,8 November 2013,"This movie is based on real story . Since this is a Hollywood movie probably some things were changed , but that doesn't really matter . What is important is this movie entertains . It's long , 2 hours and few minutes , yet it's never boring . It's set during the 60's and 70's and the humor in ""Catch me if you can"" reminds me humor from movies from that time. My favorite joke is the ""knock, knock"" joke from Hanks.The opening credits sequence is brilliant. It's one of the best opening sequences ever. DiCaprio fits in his role well with his boyish look .Tom Hanks is nice as the grumpy FBI agent. Christopher Walken steals the show with his performance as the charming , always optimistic father of our hero. He deserved Oscar nomination. It was also good to see Martin Sheen and Amy Adams. Jennifer Garner appearance was rather pointless.The tricks that DiCaprio uses look believable . I can only complain that he acts a little bit stupid during the second half of the movie , but maybe that's how it was in the real life ? Anyway the movie provides good fun . There is some depth here . Both DiCaprio and Hanks are lonely people who have nothing more than their jobs . Spielberg also tries to explain why Frank Abagnale Jr. started his criminal career . His explanation sounds logical – he was running away because he couldn't deal with his parents marriage problems (He was 16 years old then). ""Catch me if you can"" is a well made fluff entertainment. I give it 8/10.",Catch Me If You Can
128,gelman@attglobal.net,Lose the Title Sequence!,7,4 July 2006,"Clever titling sequences are a Hollywood preoccupation. Some are better and some are worse. The title sequence to ""Catch Me If You Can"" is as repetitive and as annoying as any I've ever encountered. It got the film off on the wrong foot as far as my wife and I were concerned. Nevertheless, it is an amusing film with Leonard DiCaprio as the teen-age youth who successfully passes himself off as a co-pilot, doctor, lawyer, etc., while passing phony checks that lead the FBI on a global chase. Hanks is the perfect nerdish FBI agent who eventually catches up with DiCaprio in a tiny French village where his father and mother met during World War II.

130,Pedro_H,Lots of old pros telling an amazing story - yet plays like a TV movie!,6,2 November 2004,"A young man with a sharp brain and the face of someone much older takes the fast track to riches by way of wholesale cheque fraud.I know of only one or two scripts that have been going the rounds longer before being actually made. Caligula - the troubled Roman epic - is probably the one you have heard of. You can see why the original book (which shares the movie title) was hot-to-trot. The studio execs must have viewed it as a sure-fire winner that no one could really go wrong with. The only problem being the lack of talent waiting to take on this fish-in-a-barrel project. Maybe some projects are a little too obvious - Cleopatra anyone?Spielberg didn't really want to direct this one and through politics to complicated to go in to here had to switch from producer to director. His heart is not in it - so he just goes for the plod-plod-plod movie-by-numbers approach. Sad to see him not really extending his wonderful cineast brain.I read up heavily on the true life case of Frank Abigale Jnr and even read the press library interviews that he made after seeing the film. His escape from a plane showed that he was a true life James Bond! I always say: Knowledge is power!While the script was true in all its main facts it exaggerates the state of the French prison - that while tough it was not as tough as this. Although it was no holiday camp either. It also skims over how he got to practise law - the reason given here is a classic of stating selective truths.(He flunked the exam several times and was allowed to view his mistakes. There may have been bribery involved as well.)Tom Hanks and DiCaprio play off each other well, but they don't really have a lot to do with each other. The phone calls are a fabrication. They are really working in their own little bubble that only collide every now and then.What is the moral here? That if you say your name is Joe Blow and you are an airline pilot people believe you. That if you put as much effort in to crime as you do in to a real job it can pay better? Life has moved on since those days. CCTV, computers, the Internet, you wouldn't last five minutes doing all this today.The saddest thing is that despite his wealth Frank never looks happy. Not here anyway.Money doesn't make you happy seems the closing moral - but a look around the set of this film would quickly show that to be a lie.",Catch Me If You Can
131,rebeljenn,An excellent film,10,6 November 2005,"'Catch Me If You Can' is a rare breed of film combining skill, history, adventure, and interesting characters. (And I don't give out 10-star ratings unless I personally love the film and think it could not have been done any better.) 'Catch Me if You Can' was similar to the 1950s and 1960s North By Northwest or Bond-style films. The acting is done very well, which is highly crucial to the film because it is a film about characters. Leonardo does an excellent job in a not-so-Leonardo-typical-role. A good job on this film in this type of role probably earned him the part of Huges in 'The Aviator.' It is easy to get caught up in this film because of the good characterization and the wittiness of the events which lead him to jump around from place to place, creating this fantasy world and getting caught up in all of the lies. It is easy to feel sorry for him as much as to wish that he were caught and cured of his criminal past.I would highly recommend this film because I think that there is something in it that will appeal to everyone. You may not appreciate it or enjoy it as much as I did, but I still think it is one of those films you will remember for years to come. Excellent. 10/10.",Catch Me If You Can

133,artzau,A very good picture,7,2 January 2003,"Spielberg is a very eclectic director and film-maker.  I get the impression, he loves to dabble, as it were.  In any case, he is definitely a risk-taker. This film is a jewel in several ways.  Strong performances by DiCaprio, Hanks and Walken.  I'm glad to little Lennie getting out of his cutsy-tootsy, post-Titanic over-self-adorational stage.  He might eventually become an actor.  There are several moments in this film when he gives an excellent performance without resorting to his whinny, spoiled teenager persona he's shown us in previous films.  Hanks and Walken, as usual, are top pros and right on line. Walken's role is a poignant one as the unconscious enabling father, Frank Sr. and old Chris comes through in fine style.  Hanks (and, no, you reviewers willing to slam him for his ""accent;"" he's right on with the New England dialect)is superb as the low-keyed, workaholic, driven FBI agent, Hanratty.  The circumstances of Abagnale's life and adventures are incredible and I remember reading about him back in the late 60s when he was apprehended.  This story-- his story-- is more of a statement on our American culture and how our commitment to excessive materialism can make fools of us all.  All in all, this film, while like most of Steve's brain children, is a bit too long but very engaging.  It is a delightful biopic with both hilarious and sad moments.  I recommend it highly.",Catch Me If You Can
134,raymond-15,Cat & mouse situations maintain interest to the end,8,30 August 2004,"I was fascinated by the very original introductory credits and some of the best graphics in years. It grabbed my immediate interest and augured well for what was to follow.The film itself is based on a series of serious criminal offences perpetrated by a young man called Frank Abagnale.  The eventual outcome of his years of crime is nothing short of miraculous...almost unbelievable were it not for the fact that the events actually happened.The dramatic theme is handled with a very light touch...even with a sense of comedy at times.  Leonardo Di Caprio excels as the anti-hero giving us quite an arresting performance.  His role suggests that if you wish to impersonate someone the donning of a uniform ensures you are half way there.It is interesting that Tom Hanks was happy to play a supporting role. Despite his capable interpretation of the CIA agent, it is Leonardo's part as the lying,cheating, fraudulent impostor that will be remembered.To some extent some of the situations are repetitive and the film may be a trifle long, but I have to admit that there is a surge of interest in the end with an unpredictable aftermath of his life of crime.",Catch Me If You Can
135,bopdog,"Well made, but romanticizing an evil, psychopathic criminal in this way is sick!",6,25 December 2002,"I'd always thought these ""pretender"" guys were in it for the thrill, the romance, the acting out of diverse roles, etc. That they loved the challenge, and that kind of thing. Didn't Tony Curtis play someone like that 30-40 years ago, also based on a true story? Anyway--- I was a bit surprised to find out that the Leo DiCaprio character was a criminal--- a thief, a forger, a rip-off artist merely in it for the cash. As he was portrayed in ""Catch Me If You Can,"" he seemed psychopathic, cruel and fundamentally evil.This movie is unquestionably well-made. DiCaprio has displayed admirable maturity and power as an actor--- he no longer looks like a girl. he actually resembles a young Johnny Depp (and that's a good thing). Tom Hanks is also typically great. The 60s period setting is all good. But what I saw on the screen was a lot of innocent people having their lives ruined, in both big and some small ways: The would-be stewardesses who were humiliat ed, the fiance was unnecessarily hurt, her father was abused--- and why? What did those people do that made it OK for the movie audience to laugh out loud at their pain? The people who lost the $4 million dollars ($15 million in today's money), the various folks whose jobs were threatened, etc. How many families lost their income? How many elderly people suddenly could not retire as planned, but had to crawl off, unwanted, to some corner to die?Part of this movie wants us to somehow cheer for the Abagnale guy, to somehow ""see through his flaws"" and yet love him anyway. Bulls***! Based on what the movie showed, he was a horrible, evil little vampire. Hurting, destroying, crapping all over decent folks. His victims weren't even guilty of that old cliche rationale movie con-men have so often used, that they were trying to gain unfair advantage themselves--- no, the victims had done nothing wrong. They were not ""up to anything."" They were merely trusting others, and being loving.For this reason, this otherwise very good Speilberg effort was a bit disgusting. Movies over the years such as ""Fitzwilly,"" ""The Sting,"" ""The Flim-Flam Man,"" and ""Paper Moon"" all romanticize and celebrate evil, because they all make light of thieves and seducers. But think about the people they hurt, the people they destroy--- somehow the victims are always forgotten in that Disneyesque focus on the cute little heroes. I'm sorry Steven, but the subject matter of this movie has gone too far. If you want to make a movie about Charles Manson the monster--- fine. I won't watch it, but at least the movie would be honest. To have made this movie about ""Frank Abagnale The Cute Misunderstood Thief Who Is Really A Romantic Hero"" is sick.",Catch Me If You Can
136,virek213,Making A Dishonest Living,9,28 December 2002,"Once again, director Steven Spielberg pulls another one of his patented surprises with CATCH ME IF YOU CAN, a juicy crime caper film set in the 1960s and based on the exploits of Frank Abagnale Jr., a young man who ran away from home and went on a three-year spree of check forgery amounting to over $4 million.  Leonardo DiCaprio portrays Abagnale, who managed to impersonate a pilot, a doctor, a lawyer, and pretty much every other legitimate line of work to make himself rich before FBI agent Carl Hanratty finally caught up with him.As played by the always-reliable Tom Hanks, Hanratty is a dedicated and cunning foil for DiCaprio's con-man Abagnale.  The two men find themselves locked into a deliciously suspenseful game of cat and mouse that frequently resembles Hitchcock's great caper films of the 50s.  The main titles sequence is priceless in its own right (if one didn't know better, one would swear this film had actually been made in the early 1960s), and John Williams concots a jazzy score redolent of Henry Mancini's classic 60s film scores.  Featuring co-starring turns by Christopher Walken, Martin Sheen, and Jennifer Garner, CATCH ME IF YOU CAN is yet another triumph for Spielberg, one of the greatest directing geniuses in Hollywood history.",Catch Me If You Can
137,roedyg,acting within acting,7,31 October 2006,"This works for much the same reason Shakespeare works with women characters dressing as boys in the play where the original actor is a boy playing a woman. Di Caprio plays a con man who is a consummate actor. Since his skill at conning is identical to di Caprio's acting skill in the movie, his schemes blend seamlessly. His ability to fool people seems completely natural.The plot whips along at a galloping pace.Actors like Tom Hanks and Robert De Niro seem wasted in this movie.

139,movieguy1021,Catch Me If You Can: 8/10,8,26 December 2002,"Catch Me If You Can starts off with a boom with a very suave opening credits sequence, where sample people are chasing/being chased and using the credits to hide. Very clever, like the rest of the movie. Then we go to Marseille, France, where Carl Hanratty (Tom Hanks) is talking to Frank Abagnale, Jr. (Leonardo DiCaprio) and he is released from prison. We are then taken six years earlier, to 1963.Frank's father, Frank Sr. (Christopher Walken) is a grifter of sorts, but nothing major. He's being investigated for tax fraud. And when Frank's mother Paula (Nathalie Baye) is caught cheating, Frank leaves home and first tries out theft in his father's petty ways. Soon he gets way over his head and becomes infamous for writing checks, and soon he's stolen over $4 million. But Hanratty and the FBI is close onto Frank, but always one step behind.I have got to hand it to Steven Spielberg-taking a concept that people like I haven't heard of (gotta read the book!) and manipulating it into a multi-layered story of cat-and-mouse. Of course, it could have been better if there had been more sub-plots. It's mainly Frank having fun and Hanratty chasing him. Also, Hanratty's person needed more depth, but I'll talk about that later.Catch Me If You Can has a good deal of humor for a movie billed as a drama. Its opening credit sequence and Frank's schemes took most of the humor. During his first day at a new school, at a French class, there's no teacher, so why not act as one? That was his first step to stardom, so to speak. I love how he made the checks at PanAm (I'll keep it a surprise). The first half was better than the second half, because it was funnier and more involved. The first half had information about the family and his jobs as a PanAm pilot, doctor, and lawyer. Of course, he hasn't had any training, and it's always worth a laugh to see him struggle. The second half took itself too seriously, and had the now-famous Spielberg fake ending, but at least it wasn't as severe as AI or Minority Report.Depth of the characters, you ask? The movie focused most of the time on Frank, Jr., of course, but we do know some about Frank, Sr. His mother was very underdeveloped and could have been utilized better. Hanratty, we don't really know much about, so it's hard to get deep into his character (but you did get to like Frank). We do learn about his past at the end, but that's kind of unnecessary, isn't it?Leo, I'm not sure if he deserved a Golden Globe nomination, but he was very good. I enjoyed his `dapper dan' attitude, which is what the whole movie was like. It didn't find itself serious (until the end), so it allowed some sort of suave cockiness, which added to the fun and the authentic feel of the 60s (not that I would know, of course). Hanks, with his usual Southern accent, seemed fine (nothing like The Green Mile, though). All of the supporting characters knew their parts (and the one-liners didn't overact or anything!). Jennifer Garner, as a prostitute, is waster and not really needed, mainly just to get to the overlong 140 minute runtime.It's really fun and unpredictable (except the ending); you don't know how Frank is going to conjure up his next scheme. Sure, it tried to get sappy at the end, but it made you feel good, and that's what great movies are all about.My rating: 8/10Rated PG-13 for some sexual content and brief language.",Catch Me If You Can
140,nathanmanson,That's mad how it's a true story,8,2 March 2021,"I find it so crazy how that's a true story. The guy Leonardo plays is super smart man. Leonardo was incredible by the way to.

Great film all together.",Catch Me If You Can
141,ThurstonHunger,the four million dollar man,5,8 March 2004,"This is a film I admired more than I enjoyed. I'm glad I saw it, and moreso that it was rented from a local library. Worth every penny. Also it strikes me as the kind of film my folks should absolutely see, and will enjoy more than I did.But I did enjoy it somewhat. I mean it has a pretty fascinating story at its center (I had not read the original book, but might do so later.) In talking to a friend who did read that, or maybe he heard the book-on-tape, it is clear that changes made to the film presentation were significant. More people doing ""based on a true story"" should follow this example, as the changes honestly helped to advance the storytelling desired.Quest for father, it worked for Joseph Campbell, and it works for Spielberg as well. And speaking of fathers, imagine having the luxury of Christopher Walken in a subordinate role as the absent biological father. I truly enjoy his verb-excising and pause-inserting talent, although it is rare to watch him and not think, ""hey that's Christopher Walken.""Tom Hanks as the substitute father however is more malleable. I think his Boston accent comes and goes a little bit, but his uptight-as-John-Ashcroft attitude here was welcome...he goes one step further and slowly reveals a humane tenderness that normally does not turn up in such rigid rectitude. Add his absent family adds up in the equation.Speaking of luxury, imagine having Martin Sheen in a largely disposable role, and Jennifer Garner as your cheap eye-candy. Well at $1000 a 1960 night, she ain't cheap, but you know what I'm saying.  John Williams' music was different this time out, and I think stole the show more than Hanks as others allege. It did it with a breezy cool as easy as a snap. I likened it to more like something from Harry Partch meets Lou Harrison, then 60's soul jazz...but it was tremendous. It created as much playful suspense as the film needed all by itself.Leonard DiCaprio, evidently one of the driving forces behind bringing this to the screen did not work so much for me. But I think a big part of his charisma was built from swoon power, indeed more often than not he's fatally charming some young femme. His Abegnale character rolls up unbelievable amounts of money, and I wonder if the drive of was more sexually sparked than the spiel we get here? A seventeen year-old plus stewardesses?? Smells like motivation.I imagine it was fun for DiCaprio, or any actor, to play a con man. If we are all actors, maybe when we are being fake we are at our most true. No but, fun to pretend.A con man relies on not only misdirection but of course, confidence. More emphasis is placed on the former here, especially with the hypnotic talisman of a locket on a necklace.The story is more ""Amazing"" than all the stories Spielberg did for the TV series of that name lo these many years ago. For me it had some troubles, as a caper film means you have to have a criminal. And making a likable criminal is something that I'm less susceptible to than others. On top of that, for this to be ""I Was a Teenage Super Impostor"" something did not click. DiCaprio's subterfuge never seemed so meticulously studied. I think we were supposed to buy a combination of some dumb luck and dumber FBI men. The ending intimates that Abegnale's skills were remarkably superior, but this is a film that did not want to get bogged down in the details of the crime.So the deader the head for this, the more one can enjoy the fanciful flight. The film is glossy, the DVD has some nice input and certainly paints a likewise glossy portrait of Spielberg as a consummate craftsman. And a pretty genial guy. Or is he just a master fake?? No, I'm sure he's a gracious gent, and I think this is a nice oddball in his oeuvre.Again for my mom and dad, I give this an 8/10, but on my own scale, it scores an even5/10",Catch Me If You Can

143,LebowskiT1000,Definitely caught my eye.,9,9 August 2003,"When I first saw the trailers for this film I didn't think it looked like anything spectacular.  Although, I am a fan of Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks, so I wasn't going to miss this collaboration.  I must say that I was definitely pleasantly surprised, the film was much more than I imagined and really quite fun.The story is just incredible, and what really blows my mind is that it's based on a true story.  There also a great deal more to the story than the obvious, it's not just about a kid that breaks the law and eventually gets caught, there are a number of subplots that make the story infinitely more interesting.  Not only is the story and subplots great, the but the characters, the portrayal of the characters and the chemistry between them are just perfect.Of course the great Steven Spielberg always puts on a great show, but this was particularly good.  I think the best way to put it is that Spielberg really nailed the feel of this film right on the nose, and was very consistent in his style.  I know there's been a few of his films that had certain scenes or lines that I felt were out of place or oddly placed, but this film didn't have anything like that, everything worked perfectly.  Then there's the always great, Tom Hanks!  A truly gifted actor, he ALWAYS puts on a good show and doesn't let you down here.  Leonardo DiCaprio was an excellent choice for the role of Frank Abagnale Jr., and really nailed the role.  He has the ability to look older or younger than he really is when needed, not an ability every actor has.  Other cast members that should be noted are Christopher Walken, Martin Sheen, Amy Adams, James Brolin, Nathalie Baye, and Jennifer Garner, all pulling off great performances.This is definitely a Spielberg film not to be missed.  Do yourself a favor and make sure that you see this film.  Even if you are like me and don't think that it looks terribly appealing, give it a shot, you may be surprised.  There is virtually nothing I didn't like about this film, which is a somewhat rare thing for me to say.  I hope you enjoy the film as much as I did.

The acting, story, script, editing, and directing were just fabulous. I watched this all the time on HBO and even if there was other good films on I would watch this movie instead. What Frank Abagnale Jr. did while Carl Hanratty always chased him was amazing. He must be one of the most smartest guys ever. Overall, this film was great and I highly recommend it.Hedeen's outlook: 9/10 ***+ A-",Catch Me If You Can
145,EmperorNortonII,"Frank W. Abagnale, Jr.: The Great Pretender",8,24 July 2004,"""Catch Me If You Can"" tells the amazing story of Frank W. Abagnale, Jr., a clever con man who posed as an airline pilot, a doctor and a lawyer, and forged over $4 million in checks in the process.  The story was directed by Steven Spielberg, and starred Leonardo DiCaprio as Abagnale.  Tom Hanks plays Agent Carl Hanratty, the tenacious F.B.I. agent who stayed on Abagnale's trail, in a thrilling game of cat and mouse.  DiCaprio manages to bring charm to his role, while Hanks gives a straight-laced performance. And the opening credits, done in retro-style animation, makes for excellent eye candy.  It's not quite the sort of thing you'd expect from Spielberg, but it's definitely worth watching!",Catch Me If You Can
146,braddugg,Steven Spielberg brings up a rather interesting story but makes it his own slow paced drama that is less interesting than it really is.,4,8 September 2014,"Steven Spielberg brings up a rather interesting story but makes it his own slow paced drama that is less interesting than it really is.Inspired by true story of the con man and runaway thief and fraud checker Frank Abagnale Jr. the story is really interesting in terms of how he disguised himself into so many professions, how many flaws are there in the system. How easy it is to become a pilot, doctor and even a lawyer, how worse are background checks in America and how spineless is FBI too. Now, all this was interesting premise and this is indeed a worth telling tale. Yet, Spielberg made this to a heroic tale of a famous man and how even he has a human side where he loves his parents and wants to be faithful to a girl he loved. I didn't want him to be humane, I would have rather loved if he was lethal and brutal than he is actually shown to be. Tom Hanks here tried to make a fool of himself and I did not like it coz, he failed even failed to make a fool of himself and that's really sad, coz Tom is a fine actor and his acting did not show up here. The movie belongs to Leonardo DiCaprio who does a fine job and the now superstar who was still a coming up actor in 2002, did show that he had the potential of making it big and his choices have made his career great. Leonardo as Frank comes with all guns blazing for whatever he is asked to do but I just wish his role was more cold blooded and cunning in despising himself and making merry with what goodies he gets. The art direction seems to be fine, but soundtrack of Jazz caught my ears and that was some real good music and I loved the soundtrack. Now, cinematography is good too, yet this is over two hour two minute saga that loses steam by the end. I wish it had more pace and not as lethargic as it is. The supporting cast did their job well and Amy Adams was a really cute pie then and she has come a long way since then.The writing had been a bit more crisper and the scissors been much more tight would have made this chase a delightful one, in a heist and chase movie, we do not expect drama but this loads of it, the father intervenes and the son-father relationship was not so much to my liking coz it was more of a clichéd thing than a fantasy one. The son keeps saying, dad I do this for you, I do that for you, now you and mom be happy. Ah, just cut the crap man.Oh, did I go too harsh in criticizing this movie, yeah I would have coz this is a great film for few but not for me. For me this was kind of routine stuff from a director who made a distinction to himself of making movies or telling stories that are too very engrossing and make us move, be it a ET, Jurassic park or a Schindler's List. Now, Spielberg got down to this and it was an OK attempt not a great one though.I am going with a 2/5 for an average movie from a great director and two of the very good actors we have around. This is what your bread and butter is, I need your gold and diamonds.",Catch Me If You Can

149,ruby_fff,Spielberg did it again! What an entertaining film for all to enjoy!,8,21 January 2003,"There's so many film releases all at once that it's easy to (dis)miss Steven Spielberg's ""Catch Me If You Can."" It is a breeze of a film - thoroughly enjoyable. Such entertaining drama with humor, suspense, family ties, FBI stories, based on true events from the life and times of Frank Abagnale, Jr. Hollywood or not, it doesn't matter. C'est si bon.    Spielberg made it seem so easily done - right after the June release of ""Minority Report"". Just the opening credit sequence sets the tone of the film. Its animation is so cool that you'd know it's going to be fun. The ever prolific Maestro John Williams, a regular in Spielberg films, once again provided the accompanying tempo to the plot lines. Watching Leonardo DiCaprio (as Frank Abagnale Jr.) and Tom Hanks (as FBI agent Carl Hanratty) interact is such a treat. The vintage Christopher Walken (after such a wonderful low key performance in ""The Opportunists"" 2000, again) gave an endearingly subtle portrayal as Frank Abagnale Sr. - how can Frank Jr. not do everything he can to regain the financial status to his Dad, and win Mom back? There lies the loving ties of father and son, but is it reciprocal or blind-sighted?  Besides being an 'innocent' con artist, Frank is quite skilful with graphic arts. Seeing him burnishing those PAN AM logos tack down reminds me of my graphic design days before Mac's and PCs - intently applying careful peeling, cut and paste techniques, burnishing those Pantone transfer types... The set  production and art department really brought the 60's back to life. Cinematography by Janusz Kaminski and film editing by Michael Kahn - both are veterans in Spielberg films.Behind all the cheeriness, there are bleak reality moments. After all, this is still life on earth. Lucky for Frank Jr., through all the cat and mouse hiding and chasing, agent Hanratty became almost like a surrogate father to him. Glad to see Nathalie Baye was chosen to play Frank's mother. She is one of my favorite French character actresses, since her role in Bertrand Tavernier's ""A Week's Vacation"" 1980, to her 1999 ""Venus Beaute Institut"" and ""An Affair of Love"" - always she delivers with such simple ease.
This film does remind me of ""Chameleon Street"" 1989 - Wendell B. Harris Jr. wrote the screenplay based on true events, directed and portrayed con man William Douglas Street (who took on a myriad number of roles than just 3). There's also Tony Curtis in ""The Great Impostor"" 1960, directed by Robert Mulligan.Thanks to the genius of Spielberg for letting us enjoy a psychological suspense drama in a lively and fun mode. Everyone involved in the production probably had a marvelous time collaborating. The audience certainly did.",Catch Me If You Can
150,departed07,The Great Escape Artist,10,22 December 2007,"While it was easy for me to believe that Steven Spielberg could direct such pictures such as Schindler's List, Saving Private Ryan or Minority Report where each of those films tackle subjects or showed realism of certain events, Catch Me If You Can surprised me as one of those films where for once he could show the other side of him without losing his touch.In ""Catch Me If You Can,"" Leonardo DiCaprio is the central character for which he plays William Abagnale Jr., a young man who looks up to his father William Sr. (Christopher Walken) in which all the son observes is how to lie and B.S. people to getting what he wants. In one particular scene, William is at a public school dressed in his old private uniform outfit and fools a classroom in believing that he is a teacher and not just some puny student. The rise and fall from grace starts after William sees his father and mother getting a divorce which leads him to be like normal teenagers in running away from their parents and trying to use his father's wisdom in succeeding by fooling people, especially pretending to be a pilot for Pan Am Airports.After stealing nearly a million dollars in cash from pretending to be the pilot, Carl Hanratty (Tom Hanks) is on the hunt to look for William in which on one occasion, he meets the young man face to face at a hotel in Florida and thinks he has him until he is coaxed by William pretending to be a secret agent.By using alias names from comic books, William is having different professions from a smoothing playboy, a doctor and a lawyer to get by making ends meet and at the same time falling in love with a girl by the name of Brenda (Amy Adams) who got kicked out by her parents after she got an abortion. Only time will come when young William will be caught and the truth will be revealed.Catch Me If You Can surprised me as a film about con artists and also a film about identity for which a person can surprise others in the way they present themselves and pretend to be something they are not. In a film with an all star cast from Leonardo DiCaprio proved that he is growing up and leaving all the teeny bop roles behind; Tom Hanks is a mixture of comic relief and drama for which he just wants to make sure that William Jr. is safely caught before getting killed just as Christopher Walken proves that despite playing eccentric characters or people on the brink of insanity, he can play anything smooth.",Catch Me If You Can
151,andrewroy-04316,"A fun and up tempo film, though more light and easily digested than deep and nuanced",7,14 September 2020,"Catch Me If You Can is such an easy film to enjoy, though had it nailed the ending it could've been really great. It is very easy to draw comparisons to Wolf of Wall Street, and for much of the movie I was feeling very similarly about them, but the lighter turn at the end significantly changes the overall tone. Leo is fantastic as always here, and Hanks is also very good. Seeing how Leo hoodwinks people over and over is fun, and the Barry Allen scene was especially pleasant. The high point of the movie for me was Frank's coffee with his dad where he gets so excited telling him how he got all this money and the family will get back together, only to hear that his mother has moved on. That scene really drives home the fact that Frank's entire motivation was to get his family back together and get his father everything he lost, and when he sees that's impossible he is inconsolable. Unfortunately, we don't see this level of psychological insight in the rest of the movie. In opening by showing Frank in captivity, Spielberg focuses the audience on the unsustainability of Frank's cons, how it's all going to catch up to him. After the scene with his father, we have less insight into why Frank keeps going, so when he eventually turns we have even less understanding of why he does that. His relationship with Brenda was an interesting note, but why he took such an interest in her after seeing hundreds of attractive women in his Georgia mansion and nothing really standing out about Brenda was a bit puzzling. The tension that had been built up earlier in the film from seeing Frank succeed but knowing it can't last forever dissipates anticlimactically as we see him turn and help the FBI for no clear reason. Sure, he wants to get out of jail, but at that point what does he really care about? He could've escaped to Europe, but chose to come back for reasons we don't know. It's an interesting movie and a consideration of what the truth means and what the societal penalty for being different than expected, but it was more of a lighthearted movie than a deeper introspection that I was hoping for. The friendship between Frank and Carl was cute, to be sure, but also a bit forced. I really enjoyed Williams' score for the film as well. It's a good movie and a fun one throughout, but had it explained the psychology behind Frank's actions in the third act it could've been a great one.",Catch Me If You Can
152,Spanner-2,"Good film, but not as good as it could be",7,1 January 2003,"This period film has Leonardo DiCaprio as a real life con man who pretends to be a airpline pilot, lawyer and doctor by watching tv shows and impersonating the characters. DiCaprio was born to play this part and pulls it off quite well, with the right mix of charm and youthful exuberance. Tom Hanks as the FBI Agent on his trail is somewhat less effective but aquits himself ok. This Steven Spielberg film works fairly well, but doesnt quite connect as it should as we never really get inside the head of the protagonist to know what makes him tick, sure his adventures are fun to watch but we dont care about him as much as we should. GRADE: B+",Catch Me If You Can
153,bregund,The Sara Lee of films,1,5 November 2003,"***This review contains spoilers***The biggest problem I have with this film is the same one I had with Coppolla's `Dracula':  this film is a hodgepodge of vignettes, less a continuous stream than a series of carefully crafted scenes.  Normally the editing process of a film patches the scenes together into a unified whole, so that the resulting film flows, but in this film nearly every scene opens and closes like its own little film, leaving little room for character development.  I have no idea what motivates Frank Abagnale, for example. One might be tempted to look at the failure of the family business or his parents' divorce as a catalyst, but still we are given absolutely no insight into the character.  It would have been nice to see the characters given a little humanity instead of looking and acting like stiff background characters from some crappy 1960s cartoon.In one of the most bald-faced product placements I've ever seen, three FBI agents, including Hanks, are invited in to Franks's mother's house for `Sara Lee'.  One of the agents says:  `nobody doesn't like Sara Lee.'  That might be true if the only food you've ever eaten is tree bark, but the waxy, unsatisfying desserts offered by Sara Lee are the Keanu Reeves of the dessert world:  they look good, but have no substance.
Situations arise and disappear like zephyrs.  Why does Frank apply for the job at the hospital, did he get tired of being a pilot?  He gets the job at the hospital, okay that's simultaneously interesting and funny, but then what happens?  Does he quit, is he fired?  How does the girl get back together with her parents, did they forgive her, does she keep her job? How did Frank perform as an attorney?  When and how did he buy a house in Atlanta?  Who are all those people at his house?  What was the deal with model/prostitute?  The whole scene served absolutely no purpose.  There are dozens and dozens of unanswered questions such as these, from start to finish, leaving a curiously empty, unsatisfying feeling, much like eating a frozen dessert made with artificial chemicals.  That Sara Lee gets such a high-profile product placement in this film is no coincidence, I am sure.Christopher Walken gives one of his best performances as Frank's father. Like Richard Farnsworth in The Straight Story, Walken's face tells more about the character than anything he could ever say.  His performance is so rich and deep that he should be nominated for best supporting actor.  LDC, having shown so much promise in `What's Eating Gilbert Grape,' is merely adequate in the role of Frank Abagnale; he's no Christopher Walken, that's for sure.  Hanks plays himself, doing his best Robin Williams impression of Tom Hanks playing a dramatic role, occasionally raising his voice just like he's been doing since Bosom Buddies.  Hanks is the Sara Lee of actors.All in all, this is an interesting film, albeit a curiously empty one. The day after you watch it, you won't remember any of it.",Catch Me If You Can

159,bbewnylorac,An enjoyable film,7,2 March 2015,"I loved Frank Abagnale's autobiography so I was worried what Steven Spielberg would do with the film, given he's known for giving his subjects the big Hollywood treatment. I was pleasantly surprised - I guess Abagnale's incredible true story suited the big treatment. Leonardo Di Caprio accurately captures Abagnale's immaturity and impulsiveness, disastrously combined with his fierce intelligence. He becomes a master con man living out every fantasy, as a pilot, a lawyer, a teacher, and even a doctor, and manages to swiftly dodge the consequences for years. It's comical, in a way, seeing the sheer audacity and inventiveness of the man. I love the scene where he strides across the airport with the air hostesses in their chic suits. It's funny to see how trusting and gullible companies such as banks and airlines and hotels were in the 1960s, and Frank just exploits it to the hilt. But also, as in the book, we see how terribly sad Abagnale is. In the end he has only his wits to live on, and it can't last if he's going to live a normal life. Things I don't like include how overblown the music score is. I hate it when the music tells you how you're supposed to feel in a scene. I don't like Tom Hanks as the detective -- he's too much of a clown. I love Christopher Walken as Frank's dad, also a bit of a sad character. Also the film does go on a bit long, but then there is a lot of Abagnale's life to squeeze on to the screen.",Catch Me If You Can

As with all Spielberg films, his storytelling is wonderful as is his cast. In this film, amongst others, we have Leonardo Di Caprio, Tom Hanks and Christopher Walken. This makes for great watching, and the story itself is amazing, because it sounds so implausible yet it happened in real life. Frank Abagnale Jr went around the whole of the USA and parts of Europe conning people and cashing in millions in fraudulant cheques. The material on paper looks like it would have difficulty sustaining a two and a half hour movie but truth be told there are no such troubles, with Spielberg behind camera and the grade A cast all on top form it's simply engrossing and movie making magic.Overall this rates as probably the best film so far of 2003.

It explores every facet of Abagnale's life while remaining wickedly entertaining and perfectly stylish (the costume design and set decoration are incredible). DiCaprio gives another knockout performance Hanks delivers what might be my favorite performance of his. Walken and Amy Adams are also quite excellent (as is Jennifer Garner in her cameo).

He becomes a highly successful con man and ""paperhanger"" (check fraudster) between the ages of 17 and 22. In the film, his start as a con man begins when, as a student, he fakes the role of a substitute high school French teacher (his mother was French). As his check fraud efforts become more sophisticated and for greater amounts of money, the FBI becomes involved. Agent Carl Hanratty (Tom Hanks) pursues Abagnale for years, on one occasion catching him in a hotel room, but Abagnale bluffs his way free by posing as a Secret Service agent.The ""careers"" that Abagnale fakes in the movie are as a Pan Am airline pilot (he doesn't actually fly the planes but gets free travel around the world and his pilot status makes it easy to cash fraudulent checks); emergency room physician, and lawyer. During the course of faking being a lawyer, he does pass the Louisiana bar exam with two weeks of study. He becomes engaged to Brenda Strong (Amy Adams), a hospital candy striper and daughter of lawyer Roger Strong (Martin Sheen). However, he's forced to flee the engagement party when Hanratty and other agents show up.He is finally captured in France, serves some time there, and then is sentenced to 12 years when extradited to the United States. After a few years, Hanratty, with whom Abagnale has developed a relationship over the years, convinces him to work for the FBI as a check fraud consultant. After fulfilling his requirements in that role, he eventually becomes a consultant, marries, and has a stable life.This is an ""inspired by"" film. In fact, Frank Abagnale, Jr. Never related to his father after he left home. The accuracy of some of the exploits described in his memoir published in 1978 with the same title as the movie has been questioned. He failed the Louisiana bar exam twice before he passed. He has admitted that some of the events in the memoir were over-dramatized.Nonetheless, this was a fun ""con man"" movie.

171,Mort-31,A film about the consequences of divorce,6,3 April 2003,"There are two reasons which made me unable to enjoy this original and amusing story from A to Z. One is Leonardo DiCaprio, who, unfortunately, has the leading part in this film. He plays an 17-year-old boy who looks ten years older than he is, all right but he absolutely failed to convince me that he is really only 17. Sometimes he tries to play particularly `childish' in order to emphasize his real age but everything else  marrying, cheating, etc.  he does like Leonardo would do it, not like a minor whose parents got divorced (no matter how super-intelligent this minor may be).The other problem is that this is a Steven Spielberg film. I was looking forward to see it because I thought maybe Spielberg has, for a change, chosen to tell a good-humoured story about a good-humoured sly fox in a good-humoured way. And I guess, any other director would have done so. But Spielberg would never get away from his crucial but corny theme: family. And he would make a family film out of every subject put in his hands. And this, in my opinion, harms the film very much. A movie based upon a true story can never be really true. So Spielberg had the chance to decide to skip famiy sentimentalities. But he didn't.If you want to see a good film on family, watch The Royal Tenenbaums or the Danish documentary Family. If you want to see Catch Me If You Can, do so.

As for the acting, Leonardo DiCaprio delivers the best performance in the entire movie as Frank Abagnale, Jr., and he should have received a Best Actor nomination. Tom Hanks is just awesome in this movie, playing FBI agent Carl Hanratty, who tries to catch Abagnale and throw him into custody. Amy Adams is pleasant in this film as DiCaprio's nurse girlfriend, and Christopher Walken brings his classic ""nice guy"" attitude in an Oscar-nominated performance as Abagnale's father. Once again, this is another classic Spielberg collaboration, and it has never looked better. John Williams makes a classic original score, Janusz Kaminski creates fine cinematography, Michael Kahn delivers unique film editing, and Jeff Nathanson has created such a brilliant well-written script that really recreates the life of this regular criminal. This movie is filled with surprising drama, some funny laughs, and some brilliant touching moments that only the greatness of Spielberg can provide. This movie was so brilliant, that I couldn't stop thinking about it for days. This is one of Spielberg's finest films, and it's a memorable favorite.

175,Okonh0wp,Hallelujah! Spielberg's back!,10,23 June 2004,"In the crafty hands of Spielberg, a novel long having been considered as unintriguing, becomes an excellent piece of work. The autobiographical novel, written by Frank Abergnale, tells of a counterfeit-savvy teenager's three-year stint at eluding the FBI by posing as a pilot, doctor, and teacher in the 60s.            Abagnale's story, first published in 1980 was shopped around for weeks to studios before being picked up. After seeing this movie, I'm sure you'll have trouble thinking of it as unexciting. However, looking at it from a different angle, is a form of crime such as passing bad checks is nothing visually compelling and it doesn't lend itself well to base a whole movie about?            To this I credit Spielberg, who once again creates an exciting and fun movie, that families can get excited about seeing come holiday season. Spielberg, essentially, takes the stories and infuses it with a couple of familiar elements: a lost youth struggling with the abandonment of a father figure (or in this case, his actual father), as well as a cat-and-mouse chase. The former is something which we can relate to more than we consciously realize and the latter is something which adds suspense and fun to the story. The alienated youth theme has popped everywhere in Spielberg's movies, from Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade to AI and everywhere in between. At the same time, I wouldn't call Spielberg's work, unoriginal or recycled, since he mixes these motifs in different combinations with other dramatic elements and the story itself is quite fresh.          Quality seeps out of every element in the film, from its score and sets to its dialogue and acting. I never thought I'd ever hear myself say this years ago, but Leonardo DiCaprio delivers a great performance, shedding aside his `Who needs acting when I'm a sex-symbol' attitude of old, and immersing himself in the role with all the vulnerability, despair, and aptitude it entails. Tom Hanks, of course, matches up to DeCaprio, line by line, as Hanratty, the FBI investigator who chases him for three years. The relationship of mutual respect between the two, and eventual lifelong friendship, is truly heartwarming. In Hanks' interpretation of the part, there is not just mutual respect but frustration bordering on obsession, as he borrows a page from the inspector in Les Miserables. Christopher Walken also has a big role as the father, with whom DiCaprio's character is very close.          The film is not only a joy in itself but a positive sign in this new century that the work of a skilled storyteller such as Steven Speilberg can still hold up after all these years.",Catch Me If You Can

177,TheHoodOfSwords,Fun crime movie,8,23 May 2020,"One of the classics of crime films. Following Frank as he cons the USA and many other countries. Bouncing checks and impersonating a teacher, pilot, doctor and lawyer. This movie is one I come back to again and again and I'm annoyed that it's no longer on Netflix. Going through this film everything that happens you can't even believe that it's the story of a true person. Tom Hanks is cast amazingly as an FBI agent who has been through a rough life and has thrown his life into his work and catching Frank. Dicaprio is also cast pretty well as a suave but unexperienced kid run-away turned into a criminal con-man. My one problem with the casting is that Frank is supposed to be 15-21. Granted the fact that Dicaprio looks older helps with the believability of the movie, but it's still something you notice from time to time. Overall this is a great con movie and I would recomend it if you want a slick movie with come surprisingly good comedy throughout.",Catch Me If You Can

180,Quicksand,Blessed Return to Normalcy,9,29 December 2002,"A good story.  Not nearly as pretentious, overblown or intellectually devoid as, say, everything Spielberg has directed since 1994.It still has its flaws, and I'm wondering if ol' Spielberg chose to focus on the father-son relationship a little more than other important aspects of Abagnale's life... or if he's just showing his lack of ability to direct actors.  I know, I know, that's blasphemy... but the parents in ""A.I."" and the modern-day old people scenes in ""Saving Private Ryan"" were just SO bad, I have to wonder if he picked Christopher Walken and Martin Sheen for ""CMIYC"" because a) They wanted to work with him badly, or b) They wouldn't require the direction of someone less experienced or less accomplished. Sound fishy?  Explain the parents in ""A.I.""  Switched loyalties like some people switch channels........As for ""Catch Me,"" it's a cute, breezy film, with very few flaws.  The most glaring:a) Jennifer Garner's one scene makes absolutely no sense, it's a non-sequitur.  If she'd turned out to be an undercover agent, that would have been something.  Instead, she just shows up, pulls money from her bra, and is gone again.  I felt violated, like I just watched a plug for her television show in the middle of an otherwise fun movie.  She obviously wasn't a prostitute because Frank says he recognizes her... I never did understand the fascination with this actress (assuming any actually exists).b) Brenda Strong, and her father, played by Martin Sheen.  Once they exit the film, they are never mentioned again.  They're set up to be fairly important in Frank's life, and I'm left wondering what became of them / Frank's relationship with them.  This isn't a plot hole, so much as a huge gaping annoyance.  Perhaps Spielberg is getting senile; no, it's not the screenwriter's fault, the director should be able to look at the script and go, ""Hey, Jeff, what happens to characters X, Y and Z?""Beyond that: cute, breezy and worth seeing at least twice, so you can put it all together and admire some of the DP's camerawork (which alternates between the fancy and the mundane).  Kudos to Nathanson/Spielberg for giving it a fourth and fifth act, and giving us that much more about Abagnale's life.Flawed, but only a few film geeks will notice.  It gets an A from me, your opinion may vary.  9/10.",Catch Me If You Can
181,bix171,Interesting But Not Fascinating,7,25 December 2002,"Steven Spielberg's entertaining chase comedy/drama features a couple of very fine performances by Leonardo DiCaprio and Tom Hanks as a forger who travels the world and the FBI agent determined to haul him in. Based on the true story of Frank Abagnale Jr., it fits nicely into the Spielberg canon of films about splintered families; Abagnale's underlying motivations concern his determination to recover what the I.R.S. has taken from his tax-evading father and, in the process, repair his broken home. Though it's an interesting story, it's not an extremely fascinating one: once Spielberg and screenwriter Jeff Nathanson have set up the basic scams Abagnale operates, there's a lot of repetition over the first three-quarters of the film's 140 minutes (the action could have been pared a bit in the editing room) and it refreshes only in the final section, where Hanks overtly assumes the role of surrogate father to DiCaprio's needy child. After a couple of moody, personal science fiction films in ""Artificial Intelligence: AI"" and ""Minority Report"", Spielberg seems intent on losing himself in a wistfully retro action story--the film takes place in the Sixties but a Kennedy-era-innocent Sixties that seems cloistered from the events we've chosen to make iconic--but he's unable to let go of his dark side (he's probably incapable of ever making an `E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial' again) and the film wallows in its unhappiness. But he's energized by the engrossing lead performances that dominate everything around them: as people consumed by the actions of escaping and capturing, DiCaprio and Hanks lock into each other and the relationship they form subtlety invites the viewer into their game; Spielberg wisely allows the actors to interpret the material directly and keeps the pressure off the audience by making everything clear and digestible. With Nathalie Baye, Martin Sheen and Christopher Walken, amusing and intelligent as Abagnale's father. The harsh sunlit cinematography is by Janusz Kaminski and the cleverly mod production design is by Jeannine Claudia Oppewall. John Williams' unassuming, jazzy score is surprisingly good, considering the source.",Catch Me If You Can

Leonardo DiCaprio's Frank Abagnale is deceitful and deceptive, but not nasty. Instead he's huge fun to be around. Same goes for Tom Hank's catcher, who incidentally, finds it difficult to do the catching. Catch Me If You Can, to not seem too rigid or sound mundane, splices the story from when Abagnale's already captured, to the how and why, the very beginning, up until Abagnale's inevitable capture. It's a slick, cool process held strong by its two leads. I wish there was more room for Hanks to thrive, as DiCaprio fills the screen with his charm and intelligence.",Catch Me If You Can

He and Hanks have perfect chemistry, although it seems so strange for them to be so friendly with one another. Casting throughout was impressive, as were the settings and wardrobe.

186,shanfloyd,Brilliant acts in a somewhat jaded perspective of Spielberg.,9,7 March 2003,"In these days of breath-taking special effects, dazzling sounds and tension-filled interpretation of violent thrill, it's quite hard for a director like Spielberg to check the interest to make uses of them in his movie while he has a number of award-winning films filled with all of them under his belt. But it evidently appeared, after watching the film, that he really wanted to do something new. Something that deliberately will not be considered as a typical Spielberg film.But he has not quite succeeded to fulfill those wishes. Though he has not used anything special of modern technology, apart from excellent camera work, another typical Spielberg perspective is now exposed which he could not remove from this film too. Well, upto this time that was playfully hidden by the tension his movie used to have. But now, the ""cat and mouse"" theory, in which the mouse is always the public winner (look at the examples, Jon Anderton, Ian Malcolm et al, the arachnophobics, the family in Poultergeist etc) is at its over-used bluntness while now, the 'cat' has come into the standard of FBI agents. But above all these, it must be said that Spielberg is quite lucky to have so much brilliant actors at their best in this film. Be it DiCaprio, who is all convincing as young and handsome Frank Abagnale Jr. or Tom Hanks as the FBI agent. Both, especially Hanks, got it all right in every places in the movie. And we must not forget Christopher Walken as Frank Sr. His performance is also quite realistic and fluent. So it turns out to be the acting which prompts us to see the movie over and over again, this time not by Spielberg, though smelling something new in the future air.",Catch Me If You Can

189,jb_campo,"Funny, Serious, Thoughtful, Low-key film - Spielberg Delivers",8,27 December 2015,"I loved Catch Me If You Can, based on the real-life story of Frank Abagnale. Abagnale, portrayed beautifully by Leonardo DiCaprio), is a young kid who runs away from home and uses his guile, wits, charm, and good looks to con his way into real-life professions that take years of training. Pilot, Doctor, Lawyer, this 19 year old kid can do all theses things, or pretend to. What made him want to do this?The film centers around the father-son relationship. Christopher Walken is outstanding as Frank Sr, a down-on-his-luck entrepreneur who has problems with the IRS coming after him for tax violations. But nothing bothers Frank Sr. He always keeps saying how he's the mouse who is going to survive by working harder. Yet, he seems to survive using smoke and mirrors, sweet talking people, and teaching his son that the image is more powerful than substance.Frank Jr learns all these lessons and applies them to all aspects of his life, chasing women, jobs, and all the money and benefits these bring. But it seems he really just wants a happy family, something he didn't ever seem to have. His mother, played by famous French actress Natalie Baye, doesn't seem to really love him. She mostly ignores his existence.Why should you see this film? The story is terrific, just the right pace of action and suspense. Is he going to get caught now? How is he going to pull this one off? The direction from Spielberg is right on. He tied everything together with no questions lingering at the end.The acting is terrific too. Tom Hanks delivers a masterpiece as an obsessed FBI agent Hanratty who is in charge of capturing Abagnale who ends up stealing millions of dollars by the time he is through. The relationship between the pursuer Hanratty and the pursued Abagnale is great, and the movie portrays them as developing a relationship of friendship. Other characters play strong roles too, including a young Amy Adams as as love interest for Frank Jr.I also loved the historical aspect of the airlines and the 60s, when pilots and flight attendants were considered glamorous positions. The old cars, the old uniforms, the costume designer and the cinematography really made the old times come to life with vibrant colors and a pizazz that maybe it didn't have, but it was nice to relive.Story, Director, Acting, Cinematography - Catch Me If You Can has it all. I highly recommend you catch this movie if you can. Enjoy.",Catch Me If You Can
190,luke-a-mcgowan,"Catch Me If You Can is an absolute blast to watch with a big bag of popcorn, but its also an impressive work of dramatic film that ranks with Spielberg's best",10,27 March 2016,"Steven Spielberg frequently adds the father-son element into his films, but rarely is it as strong as it is in this movie. It never stops being flashy and fun as Abagnale embezzles and defrauds his way around the country, but Spielberg wedges that family angle in there and suddenly the film changes. It becomes about a boy in denial of his parents breaking apart and he thinks that by getting all this money he can push them back together. For all of his fake titles and wealth, he's just a sad kid trying to make his father proud of him.DiCaprio's performance is essential to that focus. He's a perfectly glitzy casting choice to play someone who weaves his way through the world on his charms, but his emotional distress at the shattering of his world is much more important. Of a hefty supporting cast, Christopher Walken shines as Frank Abagnale Sr, an infinite sadness appearing in his piercing eyes as he observes his renegade son during their many meetings. Amy Adams is a delight as the bracey, ugly duckling Brenda, and Martin Sheen adds considerable heft to the film as her father. Tom Hanks goes toe to toe with DiCaprio all throughout and makes for some of the best moments.All of the con scenes are superbly written, directed and shot, with lingering shots on DiCaprio's unblinking charm and clever movements disguising things to be hidden. The first meeting between Hanks and DiCaprio is a classic scene in its own right. The dialogue is so clipped and so well-written that it seems perfectly reasonable not to, say, open a wallet or trust a man's word. The scene in which DiCaprio escapes through a police blockade is superb, with the camera focusing on all the minute clues and then ending with that plane takeoff. The whole thing is timed to perfection.Catch Me If You Can is an absolute blast to watch with a big bag of popcorn, but its also an impressive work of dramatic film that ranks with Spielberg's best.",Catch Me If You Can

To say that Stephen Spielberg is a genius is an understatement, when it comes to films like this. Every single moment in the movie is captured with sheer brilliance and fantastic execution. He knows exactly how to make the audience feel with each and every different aspect that is delivered to us in each and every scene.Leonardo DiCaprio is of course famous for Titanic, and other films since then, but I would have to say that this is his best role to date, since ""What's Eating Gilbert Grape?"". Although he is a character actor, and a good one at that, this role for him was perfect, because he not only was given the chance to be a ""character"" but also the lead in the film. He is able to carry a whole movie on his shoulders with such ease it is so enjoyable to watch. Tom Hanks was certainly not one to forget in this film, either, though. His character, Handratty, was unforgettable as well. Hanks is able to make you hate him, feel sorry for him, and laugh at him all at once in 'Catch Me'. His accent is very well rehearsed, and there are times you forget that it is Tom Hanks, and not the real character he is playing.This movie will leave you cheering for the wrong team, and holding your breath at times. It is hard not to like this film, and I give it a full 10 for it's magic, beauty and true-to life story that it so gracefully delivers to us.

192,nicolechan916,Innovative,8,1 January 2016,"It is incredible to think that this film is based on a true story, and that a high school student was able to deceive so many people. What an ingenious and innovative kid - for the wrong reasons of course. I am unsure of the accuracy of the film's portrayal of the actual events, but Frank Jr. does seem to be quite mature for his age - at least his persona does. Adding to that, I feel like the romantic encounters (save for Brenda) was probably the influence of Hollywood, or dramatized at the least.Leonardo DiCaprio perfectly encompasses the emotions of an emotionally troubled teen to the T. He portrays his character's naivety well, depicting both Frank's fake confidence and emotional turmoil. Supporting actors and actresses did a good job too. Walken as Frank's father and Hanks as Hanratty both support a kind of father figure to Frank though one is encouraging him not to stop and the other is trying to catch him.The editing is well done with two different timelines juxtaposed against each other. At first it is a little confusing and hard to discern which time period is being shown, but it gets better as the film goes on. What I do not get is the very first scene of the film which shows a kind of game show. Not only is it a weird way to introduce the film it does not fit into the story at all. The film doesn't end with the game show, and it is not mentioned or seen again for the rest of the movie.The designs of the set and the costumes are nicely done and adds to the atmosphere of the film. Also, I liked how there are quite a few cameos with well known actresses (although probably not so well known back then).

That's why when ""Catch Me If You can"" began with such a treat, I immediately knew this was going to be an exceptional motion picture.And my prediction was correct.Starting off with the clever cartoon opening and the quick, jazzy score by John Williams, the perceptive observer recalls films such as ""The Pink Panther,"" ""Around the World In 80 Days"" and ""It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World.We are then swept into the world of Frank Abangale, Jr., taken from his book and adapted for the screen by Jeff Nathanson. In a nice opening scene, Frank, Jr. (Leonardo DiCaprio), a man — who because of various situations in life — impersonated a teacher, an airline pilot, a doctor, a lawyer and a Secret Service agent (and almost gets away with it), is introduced on an episode of TV's ""To Tell the Truth."" In addition to fooling hundreds of people over the years, he cashed over $4 million in fraudulent checks. During most of his escapades, Frank is hunted by an obsessive FBI agent, Carl Hanratty (a wonderful performance by Tom Hanks).In almost a Wile E. Coyote/Roadrunner fashion, the impersonator pulls off several miraculous escapes, leaving the law with a fresh coat of egg on its face. While DiCaprio's Abangale is clever, free-spirited, charming, sexy and charismatic, Hanratty is a lonely divorced father, dull, sour and doggedly determined to catch his thief.Both manage to communicate with each other over the course of several Christmas Eves because they know each others' minds. Both are also pathetic characters in their own way, although poles apart, personality-wise.While Frank's choice as a pilot (he only flies free as a ""dead-head,"" never actually attempting to control an aircraft), is to attract women, he is forced into the medical and legal professions directly because of Carl's detective work.Hank's character — complete with a perfect Boston accent — can get close to his prey, but can never quite bring him in. Meanwhile, as a doctor, Frank (who watched episodes of ""Dr. Kildare"" to bone up on his surgical technique) attracts a naive young nurse in braces (Amy Adams) whose father (played by Martin Sheen), is a District Attorney in New Orleans.Studying for two weeks — and watching ""Perry Mason"" — he passes the Louisiana bar exam on his first try and becomes Sheen's assistant. Playing it super cool, as well as picking up professional jargon and vernacular, Frank bluff his way through several hilarious situation, including making $400 from a prostitute who thought SHE was ripping HIM off.Later, though, things become very dark, indeed, as Frank's constant dodging the law is less and less fun. During the masquerades, his mother (Natalie Baye) divorces his father (Christopher Walken, an Oscar winner for ""The Deer Hunter"" and who will probably get a nomination for this role, as well) after an affair with a lodge buddy (James Brolin).Frank's father, hounded himself (by the IRS), sees through his son's fraud, and while secretly envying him, knows it can only lead to misfortune. Finally captured, Frank is given an entire new career in a nice twist of an ending.""Catch Me If You Can"" is a major departure for director Steven Spielberg, whose last several films — ""Schindler's List,"" ""Saving Private Ryan"" and ""A.I."" — have been of the utmost seriousness. This almost lighter-than-air picture still manages to tug a few heartstrings here and there, but maintains its cheerful look or the most part.Sometimes, a bit too long (at two hours, 20 minutes), audiences will nevertheless find the humor and breeziness of this movie too irresistible to let this bother them.",Catch Me If You Can

This has got to be one of Speliberg's best movies but what also makes this film special is that it has his style but all in all without any big CGI or SFX , its just pure magical entertainment which strings you along. The story follows the life of a young man known as Frank Abignal Jr who would go into history as the most audios and yet daring and youngest con men in history conning banks out millions as well posing as several other professionals. Leo DiCaprio shows once again that he is not just a pretty face and he can square of with the likes of Johnny Depp. One thing that is great about his performance is the level of innocence portrayed by him and it is very hard if not impossible to be mad at him . The film moves at a slow pace which I really didn't mind because it introduced you into his world which also mad one build bonds with the other characters which made the movie an emotional one to watch and sometimes painful for me personally through watching my parents having to struggle with their finical situation and how teen against can some times go right out of control. Tom Hanks was good as the federal agent , not his best performances but still very good but Christopher Walken was nothing short of brilliant which begs the question why has not been given an Oscar yet ? My only complaints were that it was a little too long but I was willing to let that go because DiCaprio kept my hooked and a few Hollywood moments added in which I guess kind of distract a slight bit from its inspired by true events angel. To conclude Catch me If You Can is one of Speilbergs best works as well as proving that DiCaprio is not just a pretty face but one of the talent and very respectable actors coming up , highly recommended there is something for everyone in here.CATCH ME IF YOU CAN: 8.6 OUT 10THE TRUE STORY OF A REAL FAKE.",Catch Me If You Can

So what if he got caught?Frank Abagnale Jr.  learned early on that looks could be deceiving:  his parents' fairy tale romance didn't include a `happily ever after' ending and although Frank Sr claimed to know the secret to success, it continued to elude him.  Rather than be discouraged, Frank Jr. embraced these lessons and adopted deceit as his career, assuming the guise of doctor, lawyer, and pilot (among others).  Not content to look like a jet setter, Frank embarked on global cheque bouncing spree to the tune of $2.5 million that earned him a spot on the FBI's Most Wanted List - quite a feat for a 17-year-old high school drop out.Based on the true story of Frank Abagnale Jr's dalliances with the law as a teen con man, `Catch Me If You Can' is both adventure and comedy with a touch of cynicism (the whole collapse-of-the-nuclear-family angle).  The film has a bouncy, spirited soundtrack that supports and enhances the lightweight subject matter.  This, along with wonderful set and costume design help to faithfully establish that sixties feel. Subtle scoring, fluid editing and tight camerawork ensure that the pacing is consistent and flows smoothly. This attention to detail is carried on by the cast.This is the other Leonardo DiCaprio Christmas movie  the one with a modest budget, that wasn't years overdue, and didn't have everyone's tongue wagging about late night parties and blow-ups on the set.   After solid work in `What's Eating Gilbert Grape?' and `The Basketball Diaries', DiCaprio became the flavor of the moment with `Titanic' (one of the most overrated movies of all time) and his credibility went into decline with roles in `The Beach' and the abysmal  `Man in the Iron Mask').   I braced myself for the worst and was therefore pleasantly surprised with his performance in this film: DiCaprio carries the role of Frank Jr. with aplomb, infusing Frank with the perfect balance of charisma, ballsy impertinence, humor and when necessary, gravity (without resorting to the broody scowling we've seen before).  His colleagues are no slouches either.His role as the spectacled ubergeek in `Blast From the Past' notwithstanding, Christopher Walken's characters are best known for their villainous tendencies. As Frank Sr., Walken is decidedly under whelming, a pitiable dim shadow of a man who labours under delusions that salvation is just around the corner.  Walken ensures that his character doesn't cross the line into useless pathetic, rather he exists as a cautionary tale to blind optimism.  Equally understated, and yet simultaneously outstanding, is Tom Hanks as Carl Hanratty, Frank Jr's dogged FBI foil.  Carl  a composite of several of the individuals who tracked Abagnale  is a quiet, determined loner who carries a few too many pounds and revels in the chase. Hanks brings the same quintessential every-man quality to the role that he is famous for, without looking like his character is a rehash from some other film. This is one of those rare films that has virtually no swearing, violence or nudity (there are a few suggestive scenes) and yet doesn't moralize or try to drown the viewer in saccharine.  In addition, it is fun, engaging, and well acted.  I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking to be entertained.",Catch Me If You Can
199,ldavis-2,Spielberg does Soderberg...,3,28 December 2002,"and the results are deadly: a technically flawless but self-righteous, humorless film maker, he is utterly incapable of embracing the joy of this cat-and-mouse chase, much less, appreciating the delicious irony of Abagnale's post-conviction life. Ironically, the usually-bombastic (and equally self-righteous) John Williams manages to reign himself in; his score was such a surprise, I though someone else had done it.Although DiCaprio tries mightily, Abagnale remains a selfish punk not worthy of our sympathy. He lets his father, for whom he launches his crime spree, drown in debt while he makes off with suitcases stuffed with cash. That Sr. has no problem claiming to be a Medal of Honor winner in a pathetic attempt to secure a loan tells us he wasn't above accepting ""help"" from Jr.Which leads us to Hanratty, who is not only self-righteous and humorless, but mean. He takes a perverse joy in telling Jr. what happened to Sr. And he wonders why Jr. escapes from the plane!The ER scene should have been written thusly: Jr. storms in like a general, talks to Mom while examining/comforting the boy, respectfully asks the interns for their diagnosis, forces himself to soak up the blood from the wound (which we get a gratuitous close-up of) while trying desperately not to pass out! That would not only have been funny, it would have displayed Abagnale's moxie and pluck. Instead, I found myself hoping he'd rot in jail.When Jr. is given a bogus check by the FBI agents, he notes that the paper is not perforated. Since we never learn how he mastered making bogus checks or obtained the tools needed, we must assume that he wasn't working with paper that wasn't perforated, either! How this minor detail got past the ""experts"" at the FBI (and Spielberg) is not for us lesser minds to ponder.",Catch Me If You Can

201,krational66,"Gorgeous adventure, final return.",8,28 May 2020,"Young, simple, wild, bold, smart, and childish, the 17-year-old Frank's gorgeous adventures before he became an adult were fascinating. From the enthusiasm of being 16 years old, he relied on extraordinary courage, imitation and interpersonal clever eye-searching to extract millions of dollars in fake cheques in just two years and disguised as Pan American Deputy Captain Zhou You The nations, as doctors and lawyers, also passed the judicial examination on their own. He was less than 18 years old, but he walked between Xiangche beauty like a 28-year-old man. Even if he was romantic all night, he would be able to cope with each other one by one.
Carl, who hunted him, wasn't so lucky. As soon as he appeared, he was a middle-aged man with a dull personality, a bad career, and a failed marriage. Colleagues were unpopular, the boss didn't want to see them, and they worked hard every day. It was a workaholic who worked overtime even at Christmas. As a result, he was stunned by a kid.
The two chased and fled, and they were natural enemies. But on Christmas Eve, carl's phone always remembered that there was a lonely frank. Carl saw his disguise from the start, and his smug laugh broke Frank's confidence. However, from that moment on, carl became Frank's dependence. He is the person Frank can say about merrycharistmas at Christmas. He is the object of Frank 's childish mischief and the object of ostentation; he is the one who can make Frank willing to let Frank handcuff himself; he is a thousand miles away from illness and illness A man brought home from a foreign country on the verge of death; he was the one who went to see him in prison on another lonely Christmas day; he was the one who gave Frank his second life. He was the only one who understood Frank's child's heart. He had a distress for Frank that he hadn't even thought of. He understood that the warmth of family love that Frank had longed for and family reunion. We saw that Frank was watching the once happy family in the mother's hometown. He was drunk in the fiancee's house and wanted the warmth of this family. On the day when his father's bad news came, he stood outside the window looking at his mother's happy new family The warmth in the house was beyond his reach. The child's gaze and tears that he couldn't help, finally exposed a fragile and insecure heart. Fortunately, he still has Carl by his side. The two turned from enemy to friend, and even father and son, letting the circumstance of the obscure plot turn around, casting a ray of sunlight into the darkness.
Frank's body has our shadow: young and ignorant. The future is still so long, how much joy there is in the world, how can there be time to consider the consequences? Therefore, we squander our youth to the fullest and avoid all possible consequences and punishments. And carl, the guy who is always pressing behind us, making us always worry, is like a responsibility, an obligation. Of course we cannot escape forever, but when we were young, who did n't think we were different and were favored by God? Until one day, we grew up a bit and started to look back, but found that the things we had cherished so much had long been lost. This way we went too hurriedly, Taicang Huang, too much to grab into our arms, so that when it slipped from our arms, there was no consciousness. At that moment, we were Frank who heard the news of his father's death on the plane. There was no remorse, no amount of pain to restore the established facts.
Finally, without exception, we were caught by carl, packed up the gains and losses of the past, and faced possible consequences and punishment. From that day on, we stayed and stayed with Carl, and we called that day ""growing up.""",Catch Me If You Can

204,Brogan,"Spielberg does comedy, and succeeds!",10,1 January 2003,"I've recently got a ""A"" in one of my college classes titled, ""Spielberg/Lucas."" In that class the instructor lecture on the style of visual, characters, and plot for a Spielberg film. We made ""connections"" with all of Spielberg's films, what did JAWS, E.T., CLOSE ENCOUNTERS, and SCHINDLER'S LIST all have in common? With Spielberg's latest film, CATCH ME IF YOU CAN, is this the same Spielberg that is famous around the world?
CATCH ME IF YOU CAN is a very different Spielberg film. It's a off beat comedy with a bit of suspense mixed into it. Critics and fans have been criticize Spielberg for the last twenty years for his attempt for doing a comedy film which was 1941. Now, Spielberg has managed to succeed in making a enjoyable comedy film. Where 1941 had tons of slapstick comedy and buildings falling apart in the name of laughs, CATCH ME is more from personality and wit. CATCH ME IF YOU CAN is based on the true story of Frank Abagnale Jr. (Leonardo DiCaprio). Frank is known to be the most successful con-artist and check forger in U.S. history. Abagnale posed as a Pan-Am air pilot, doctor, and proscutor, when he didn't even complete high school. Abagnale also went around the world making and cashing about $4 million dollars with bogus checks. Despite that the checks would bounce like a rubber ball, Frank had enough intelligence to fool the banks and even the the companines he claimed he worked for. It took federal agent Carl Hanratty (Tom Hanks) to identify Frank's mistakes, which led Carl on a cross country pursuit for Frank. While Carl is staying around the clock trying to figure out more about Frank and his whereabouts, Frank keeps changing his name, occupation, and girlfriend. The only two people that remain close to Frank's life is Carl Hanratty, and Frank's father, Frank Abagnale Sr. (Christopher Walken). The film shows that one of the reasons why Frank remains to do his numerous crimes is to purchse expenisve things for his divorced father who is depressed from having his wife leave him on her request, and the closing of his family owned stationary store (where Frank learned about his numerous tricks of forgery). When I heard about CATCH ME being the new Spielberg film, I bought a copy of the book written in first person by the real Frank Abagnale. I highly enjoyed the book with the way Abagnale explains on what he did, how he did it, and the numerous funny parts that would be great to be put on film. After watching the movie, I was slightly disappointed in the film. There were some parts in Abagnale's book that I was looking so much forward to be seeing in the movie, including a part in the book where Abagnale gets involved with bailbonds man. Sadly to my disappointment, it wasn't featured in the film. I then read a interview on why Spielberg was so attached to direct CATCH ME IF YOU CAN, and when you watch the movie, it's obviously shown on the screen. Spielberg loved the father/son relationship between Frank Sr. and Jr. In fact, the relationship was partially mention in the book, in the film, it's carried thoughout the film. While the movie does touches on the various career changes and check forgery. Also, since the book was written in first person, the character of Carl Hanratty was mention here in there, where Hanratty is the second most seen character in the film, right behind Frank. But other than that, CATCH ME IF YOU CAN is a very enjoyable and entertaining film. I've always been devoted to Mr. Spielberg, and this is a very different film for him. It is historical, takes place in the past, but it's the first time where most of the film is being told from one character's narrative. Spielberg does a great job with telling the story, he even adds a nice touch of the mid 60's film style and mood with the opening credits being animated, very similar to the opening credits of dozens of 60's comedies. Then John Williams also adds the final touch with the jazzy score that is heavy on the clarinet and brass than the usual strings. Most people groan and moan when they hear the name Leonardo DiCaprio, ""oh no! Not that guy!"" I do agree DiCaprio does get overexposure, but he is a good actor. Look at WHAT'S EATING GILBERT GRAPE and THIS BOYS LIFE, he did a excellent job in both films. I think most people just think of DiCaprio in TITANIC which wasn't his fault as much as it was James Cameron's. DiCaprio might win over some people with his performance in this film which shows that DiCaprio did understand the personality and that Frank had a fun time while doing all of the check swindeling. Christoper Walken breaks out of his stereotyped acting that many comedians and t.v. shows have made fun of in the past, and delivers a very good performance. Just watch the scene when he talks to Frank Jr. about his still love and devotion to the woman that left him for another man. But Tom Hanks is the pro, and he proves it again in this film. Hanks portrayal of Hanratty with the Boston accent and the combination of the clumsy actions yet intelligent mind makes the Hanratty character the most enjoyable federal agent since Tommy Lee Jones Sam Gerrad in THE FUGITIVE. Hanks did a brilliant job with Michael Sullivan in ROAD TO PERDITION, and he does it again with Carl Hanratty in CATCH ME IF YOU CAN. I can not judge if CATCH ME IF YOU CAN should get any Oscar nominations (I haven't seen GANGS OF NEW YORK, ADAPTATION, and CHICAGO yet). But from what I've seen, CATCH ME is great, but it's not better than TWO TOWERS, MINORITY REPORT, SOLARIS, ROAD TO PERDITION, BOWLING FOR COLUMBINE, and PUNCH DRUNK LOVE. If there should be any nominations, then Hanks should get nominated for Best Supporting Actor for playing Hanratty.
CATCH ME IF YOU CAN is a very enjoyable film, it's a big risk of a film for Spielberg to return to comedy. But this film proves that Spielberg can now do any genre, including comedy, and pull it off. Great job Mr. Spielberg! ***** (out of five)",Catch Me If You Can

208,kyle-cruse,"Fun, fascinating film",8,16 September 2008,"Based on true story of con artist Frank Abagnale, Jr. (played here by Leonardo DiCaprio) and the detective (Tom Hanks) in pursuit of him, ""Catch Me If You Can"" proved to be a fun-filled, fascinating movie. Rather than telling this story as accurately as possible, Spielberg manages to spice it up with tons of little bits of humor and fascinating facts rather than just tell it as a straight story. There is enough humor here for this to be a comedy, from Abagnale pretending to be a substitute teacher to get back at some students who made fun of him to him pretending to be a former graduate from Harvard to impress his girlfriend (Amy Adams) and her father (Martin Sheen). On the other hand, there is a moving story here, dealing with the struggles in this man's life and his family. It is truly a fascinating story on its own, especially the areas regarding Abadnale's high level of intelligence, and it is a story told very well here. The film could afford to be shortened a bit, as it tends to be a little long overall, particularly with the long scenes with Abagnale and his father (Christopher Walken) and other scenes having to do with his family. The recurring Christmas theme is also somewhat unnecessary and not necessarily beneficial. Nevertheless, this is an impressive movie, one of Spielberg's best, in my opinion. Not entirely perfect, but not too far off. Worthwhile for just about anyone, especially if you like excitement as well as great character studies.***1/2 out of ****",Catch Me If You Can
209,perkypops,Not Mr Spielberg's best by a long way,3,16 May 2011,"Good films generally have good stories which have been rewritten as great screenplays. This film's screenplay fails to live up to the story it retells. Any film portraying the hero/villain (Frank Jnr) as a contestant in a game show as a first take has a lot of ground to make up before it ends.There is a hollowness in this film which begins with the tale of the two mice who fell into a bucket full of cream, because I thought only one of the mice was honest and, by the end of the film, I knew I was right. There is a nastiness in this film which is apparent via the targeting of the female bank clerks and others for trickster game playing during the film. The scams actually do harm people along the way although we are not credited with enough intelligence by Mr Spielberg of what that harm may be.We have an unlikeable character for the alternative hero/villain (Hanks's FBI investigator Hanratty) who is not allowed to show any redeeming quality at all, except for a crafty swipe at Frank Jnr whenever he can, and doesn't the lad deserve it? We even have characters playing 'suspicious minds' just in case we lose sympathy with Frank Jnr's game playing, but, unlike Hanratty, they are actually mostly clueless. And any who aren't clueless seemingly don't get a mention in case it spoils the plot. So what may have been a very believable book is not a believable screenplay.The acting is patchy. I enjoyed Frank Jnr's parents doing their thing, and, mildly speaking, Amy Adams's Brenda, but that is about it. The rest were just not very convincing at all.So definitely not Spielberg's best and if you'd like to see the man at consummate ease with his medium spend your money on a re-run of ""Duel"" which is still my favourite Spielberg film.3/10 because it is overlong and I wasn't entertained.",Catch Me If You Can

Some of Leo's scenes are a bit too posturing (like the printing press scene), but I thought the story played smoothly most of the way through.

The previous film that was released to star Dicaprio was Gangs Of New York, directed by Martin Scorsese. This week, we have a very different kind of movie from the man I like to refer to as `the great one,' called Catch Me If You Can.  `The great one,' being Steven Spielberg, my favorite director who's made some of the finest motion pictures in history. In my opinion, the release of a Steven Spielberg film is an event. He's created some of the most memorable and beautiful scenes in movie history. For example, who could forget the touching goodbye of E.T., or the horrifying invasion of Normandy in Saving Private Ryan. Catch Me If You Can is no exception to the greatness of Steven Spielberg's direction. This isn't one of his best movies, but it is one of the best films of 2002. What's more, who could resist a movie that also stars Tom Hanks and Christopher Walken. 	The story was inspired by the real events of Frank Abagnale, who as a young man eluded the authorities of millions of dollars in check fraud. Dicaprio plays Abagnale, and he certainly pulls off a stellar performance that will leave you laughing and saying, `my God, how does he get away with all this!' Tom Hanks plays the FBI agent, Carl Hanratty, who tracks Abagnale across the world. Among the identities that Abagnale assumed while forging checks was that of an airline pilot for Pan Am, a doctor, and a lawyer. It all leads to Abagnale one day working for the FBI in the check fraud division, and helps bring many criminals to justice. 	This film is really witty and will certainly leave it's audience pleased. Many people agree that the film is fun to watch, as well. It's especially great to see Leo portray the young Frank Abagnale, as Frank becomes obsessed with modeling himself after James Bond. Even going as far as to buy an Aston Martin with the money that he's received from the forged checks. This film is definitely worth seeing and is certainly one of best movies of the year. Quite possibly, in my top five picks of the year. And actually, I liked this more than Spielberg's other film released this past summer, Minority Report that starred Tom Cruise. Great work by John Williams on scoring another fine soundtrack to another great Spielberg film. Williams uses some jazzy ensembles in the score to represent the time and feeling of the film, although the main title theme of Catch Me If You Can is hardly one of a large sweeping theme. Nonetheless, there's little if anything to complain about here. The film works on all levels and I highly recommend seeing it. I was waiting to acknowledge what the best movie of the year was until I saw Catch Me If You Can. Well, I don't think that Catch Me If You Can is the best movie of the year, although one of the best films of 2002. ****",Catch Me If You Can

It didn't seem to me that Spielberg involved himself too much in this film, and I must admit that DiCaprio shines in his lead role.  It seems that he is finally starting to come into his own as a decent actor.  Christopher Walken (a favorite of mine) was great as always.  Tom Hanks, suprisingly, was tolerable as well...it was refreshing to see him in a role where you're not forced to see him as an immortal, or always feel sorry for him.  He played his role straight-up and I enjoyed him.  The story was told very well, although I thought the film was a bit too long.

220,oshram-3,Well worth catching,9,6 June 2004,"This movie received a lot of hype when it came out, but I never got the chance to see it until this week (courtesy once again of the library, thank you very much). I'd heard good things about it, and I figured any film that involved Spielberg and hanks would be worth a look.The movie chronicles the story of Frank Abagnale Jr. (Leonardo DiCaprio), a young man who sees his father's (Christopher Walken) slow descent into poverty and decides to help him by applying his particular kind of genius into a bold but extremely clever fraud scheme. Frank is soon passing himself off as a pilot for TWA, and his schemes only get bolder from there. Assigned to catch him is determined Agent Carl Hanratty (Tom Hanks), who lacks Frank's brilliance but makes up for it with dogged persistence.The movie is very skillfully handled. Spielberg has a number of terrific shots sprinkled throughout (the moment where Carl realizes he's actually spoken with Frank and didn't know it is classic), and the feel of the 60s is deftly captured. DiCaprio really does look like he's fifteen or sixteen through most of it, and all of the small subtle period details are captured. We're also shown a great deal more than we are told; while Frank is a genius, we are never told that, but we see how his schemes unfold, part accident and part inspiration, and we come to sympathize with him even though he is a criminal. In fact it's a testament to the skill of the writing and directing that although the characters are at odds with one another and have conflicting goals, we can somehow root for them both.Hanks is his usual excellent self, and his Carl is a character we immediately like, even if he is a bit gruff around the edges. DiCaprio surprised me because he fits into the role seamlessly; I've never seen him be this natural or effective before, and it gave me new respect for him as an actor (he really needs to stay away from period stuff). His performance is the more important one, because naturally the bulk of the film centers on him. Christopher Walken is also very strong as Frank's father, a man whose life slowly crumbles beneath him yet who never gives up fighting for something better (it's never made clear if he did anything wrong in his past to elicit such attention from the IRS, which normally would be a drawback but in this case is oddly effective). The rest of the cast is excellent too, and Martin Sheen gives a nice turn in a smaller role.In the end we see that Frank really could have been someone amazing had he just buckled down and worked for it  that he did so well with so little is also a testament to his pluck and intelligence. But Spielberg and his cast manage to present an interesting and entertaining story that never lags and keeps us wrapped up in its twists and turns from start to finish. In the last few years Spielberg has made his share of lackluster films (AI, Minority Report) but Catch Me If You Can is not one of them. A strong effort from some gifted people at the top of their games, Catch  is certainly worth a rental. It's a little long at two and a half hours, but it's certainly worth the investment of your time.One minor note: John William's score is extremely effective and one of his better works in recent years.

Expertly directed by Steven Spielberg, this is one of his finest, and shows a side of him I didn't think was there.Leonardo DiCaprio plays Frank Abagnale, Jr. and Christopher Walkin plays his father, Frank, Sr.  The two are an absolute gas together.  Senior's life is going down the tubes - his business goes under, the IRS is harassing him, and his wife leaves for another man.  The happy home young Frank knows is no longer there.  The father gives a healthy disrespect for the law and authority to his son, so young Frank decides one day to pose as an airline pilot.  He learns how to make fake identifications and phony airline checks, and off he goes.  In short time, he's living the lifestyle of a swinging bachelor, even though he's still a teenager.  He gets away with it because he's a great con artist and thinks quick on his feet, and he's so good at producing fake payroll checks that the FBI is soon on his tail.Tom Hanks plays the FBI agent after DiCaprio, and he does his usual superb acting job, playing the agent as a determined loner.  Without giving up the details, Hanks eventually catches the young man, who after exhausting his airline pilot facade has gone on to pose as a doctor in charge of an emergency room and then a lawyer.  The kid is so good at what he does, that the FBI hires him in lieu of a stiff sentence so that he can teach them how criminals manipulate the banking system.This film is absolutely charming.  The acting is great and the viewer is enthralled at the amazing exploits of this young criminal.  Walkin in particular deserved an Oscar (he was only nominated for best supporting actor).  His manic character and determination are the inspiration by which his son embarks on his adventurous life of crime.  And after his disastrous performance in ""Gangs of New York,"" it's nice to see DiCaprio rebound with a winner.",Catch Me If You Can

But the best performance came from supporting actor Christoper Walken. An Oscar play.

It all contributes to making this a greatly entertaining film achievement.The most impressive though, to me was the performances by leading Tom Hanks and Leonardo DiCaprio, and by supporting Christopher Walken and especially by Amy Adams and Martin Sheen.One thing I thought a weakness was that is didn't feel timeless - somehow it felt stuck in the beginning of the 00's in its production style.Overall, though, a fine film by Spielberg.",Catch Me If You Can

I've always enjoyed watching this ""crooky"" kind of intelligence and you cannot but notice that even Hanks admired the character of Abignale Jr.The only flaw in the movie, however, is that though a problem existed in the relationship of the parents, the leading character played by DiCaprio had no other dimensions.

This is a film that is extreme well written, entertaining and funny all in one I loved this movie. Leonardo DiCaprio was so good in this film he really sunk himself into this con man but through his performance you can tell that he isn't a bad person just a lost kid refusing to face reality which makes him a much more interesting character. Tom Hanks was also fantastic in this film not only is he really funny but he had great scenes with DiCaprio, you really got the impression that these two were each others equals and it was riveting to watch. Christopher Walken gives one of his best performances ever in this film I thought he had some really touching scenes with DiCaprio and he was a really tragic character. John Williams gives one of his best scores ever to this film, the theme is jazzy and alive and matches perfectly with the tone of the film. A lot of the entertainment value for this movie comes from seeing Abagnale change in and out of his different personas, not only does it create for a lot of laughs but it was really interesting to see how he was able to accomplish all his misdeeds. I do have a couple of flaws with this movies for one a lot of character arcs such as Amy Adams arc just do not get a real conclusion and are left dangling in the air. My other flaw may seem like a minor one or a nitpick but there were a lot of unbelievable aspects in this film namely scenes where DiCaprio makes clear and obvious mistakes and are just written of as funny scenes, which they are but I just think it took me out of the movie a bit. Another than one or two minor nitpick I think this is a fantastic film, one of Spielbergs better films for sure, it's got some great performances, a really different and catchy score from John Williams and a tone different from other Spielberg films that just continues to show me his incredible range as a director.91%/A",Catch Me If You Can

Di Caprio is outgoing and charming. Everyone else is like publicity, you know it's there but you don't take them in account. Except Christopher Walken, who is Superb.At second viewing, three years later, I remembered only pieces, and was bored to death. The settings are urban boring and the action is heterogeneous but unimpressive. I think Spielberg rooted to make the story of the con man too sweet, to make him infantile and reachable phsycologically. I didn't like that approach being the character in real life a lot more interesting, obscure and harder. Tom Hanks character Hanratty tries to be smart at all times, guessing and boring, tires with his pseudo-hero role.All of the movie tries to make what would be an interesting, edgy film into a bedtime story, sweetened by all filmical elements (actings, directing, lights, script).

Overall, it has an air of being old-school. It's not very dark or foul mouthed, and it's not a pure comedy either. It has a nostalgic touch to it, which I guess is supposed to draw in the crowds for an old fashioned crime caper of sorts. However, I thought the film felt kind of schizophrenic. The comedy bits are those that work best (Hanks' best work so far in my opinion), but judging from the subject matter, this should have been a considerably darker film in tone. It's like Spielberg didn't know how to put the story together as it displays numerous mood swings - sometimes serious, sometimes definitely not. Structrually, the film also feels a bit weak, it would have worked better with linear storytelling, rather than jumping back and forth in time. The acting is OK, but I could never really get to grips with DiCaprio's character (and in some scenes, neither did DiCaprio). The production design, cinematography, and score work fine together but the story never quite holds up. There is nothing remarkable about the film, and towards the end, Spielberg's sappier movie sentiments makes for some not so good movie time, unfortunately. [6/10]",Catch Me If You Can

If you act in a certain way, people will respond in a certain way. This theme which was so beautifully portrayed in ""Being There"" is central to Catch Me If You Can. Early in the film, Frank Abagnale sees a pilot and notices that everyone around him adores and admires him, and most importantly, does not question him when he cashes a cheque. Solution: Become a pilot. All you need is lingo (which he gets by fawning over an airport official) and a uniform (which he cons his way into). From here, we get the story of one of histories great con men, who before his 23rd birthday has successfully convinced people he was a pilot and doctor and a lawyer and had passed $4,000,000 of bad cheques. It it s wonderful light and entertaining ride.Catch Me If You Can is a major accomplishment for most directors, but for Speilberg, it is like a weekend off - a movie he made to take a break from making movies. Not to say that it is bad - it is a chase movie with more laughs than most comedies and extraordinary attention to detail. It recreates the innocent, pre-Vietnam 60's beautifully, a time when an airline pilot had instant credibility and charm.The movies three leads, DiCaprio Hanks and Walken are all at the top of their game. Having fun with there roles while at the same time creating memorable characters we care about. FBI agent Carl Hanratty is a dry-as-toast career fed with little more in life than the crooks he chases, but still, Hanks gives him depth and a personality. Christopher Walken is perfect is an odd role for him as Frank Sr., the beloved and hapless father of the anti-hero lead, who never quite gets the breaks in life he wants or deserves. But In Abagnale Jr Leo Di Caprio creates a criminal character we cheer for. As I watched this film, I was simultaneously cheering for both the bad guy and the cop.

235,Blade_Le_Flambeur,Excessive,7,5 May 2003,"There appear to be two Steven Speilbergs in Cinema: Speilberg the filmaker, responsible for such films as Schindler's list and Speilberg the entertainer, responsible for films such as Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade. Sometimes, he manages to balance out both with films such as Jaws as the result. I usually enjoy his more balanced out films, they really entertain while catching your deep thoughts. However, sometimes there's a sign of a clash between the two. In 2001's A.I. Speilberg seemed to want to have a Kubrick film yet at the same time dazzle the audience with vibrant chase sequences and harrowing visual effects. The clash usually ends up in somewhat of a mess, not neccessarly bad but not really that good either. That being said, I'll move onto the review. Catch Me if You Can is definitely a clash of Speilberg. He wants to provide the viewer with a quick and stlyish movie about one of the moust astounding criminals in the world yet also provide them with a deep, rich character study. Unfortunately, the script seems to go more with the quick aspect, providing flashy dialouge such as in Frank's Father, Christopher Walk's character. What ends up happening is a rather solid film, but it could have been a bit more. Leornado Dicaprio shines as the intelligent yet somewhat misguided Frank. He conveys his emotional moments and his excited moments effortlessly, really making the viewer think he's 17. Tom Hanks provides solid work here, but he seems to be a bit over- the- top with his character. Christopher Walken offers valuable support here, perhaps showing the route of the motivations for Frank's crime spree. With a good enough cast, this movie clicks instantly and follows through... almost till the end. Unfortunately, somewhere along the line the movie trips on it's own legs and becomes quite repeating. It ends up just being one con job aftr another, trying to inspire excitment in the viewer then get emotions out of them by showing Frank's internal dilemna. The script is solid enough and Speilberg's directing a bit unfocused but still all right. That being said, it's not that Catch Me If You Can is neccessarily a bad movie, quite the contrary really. It's an interesting $9 spent, a sort of ride yet an emotional experience. Speilberg clashes indeed, but the rest of the movie sticks together well enough. 7.5/10",Catch Me If You Can

245,secragt,Sly and Winning Change of Pace for Spielberg,10,21 June 2003,"Fleeing the dark tone which has permeated his movies for the past five or more years, Spielberg chose this light-hearted character piece from the mile high stack of scripts available and what a great choice it was. This is easily the most entertaining and purely enjoyable effort from Steven in at least a decade and a real comeback for a director whose work, while still respectable, was beginning to wear. All the elements are there. The cast is outstanding from Hanks to DiCaprio to Sheen to Walken and they are all game. The script is sensational; from dialogue to organization of events this is probably the most focused and sly screenplays Spielberg has had to work with in many years and was probably the best script of the year. The music and cinematography are solid (one of Williams' better ""jazzy"" soundtracks. In particular, DiCaprio shines as the fresh-faced con artist and Hanks is dependable as the long-suffering and dedicated federal agent after him. Walken makes the most of his limited screen time. One wishes Walken's character (and the genesis of DiCaprio's con mentality) had been better defined but there is the great substitute teacher scene which is transcendent and hilarious. Just the mere proud smirk on Walken's face when he realizes his son has pulled a fast one on the faculty for a week is enough to explain much of Abignale's childhood and influences. Ironically, this movie relies on close personal relationships and almost no action, which makes it the most atypical Spielberg movie ever. There are no big chases or explosions but a great many heart to heart conversations. Incredibly, it all comes together and the result is a staggeringly witty and great movie. To be honest, I didn't think Spielberg had it in him anymore. But then, he had a lot of great help. Fans of cons and coming of age movies should definitely check this out.

I can report that Dicaprio did a great job and that all the reviews criticizing Tom Hanks' Boston accent were wrong. I'm not saying his accent was perfect, far from it, but Hanks needed that little something to keep the viewer from thinking ""Hey, that's Tom Hanks!"" Hanks gives an understated performance that made me think that he is a better actor than I gave him credit for. (I know, I know he has two Best Actor Oscars) His mannerisms and the accent were different enough to allow me to accept his character and suspend my disbelief. Even if the acting had been horrible, the direction, the credit sequence, the music, the cinematography and the art direction would have me recommending this film.

This movie is full of surprises.The rest of the cast is also very good with great performances from Christopher Walken, Amy Adam's and Elizabeth Banks.This movie holds up just as good nearly two decades later!

The real Frank Abagnale, Jr. must have been 10 times slicker than Leonardo because the character as he portrays him wouldn't have been able to con me out of so much as a dollar bill and the FBI agent that Tom Hanks plays isn't too bright. How he ever let Abagnale get away from him as many times as he did is beyond me, but then again, based on recent news the FBI appears to be about as bright as Barney Fife so I guess they really did let this kid slip through their fingers on more than one occasion and make fools out of them all.",Catch Me If You Can
251,gottogorunning,Very Entertaining,8,9 August 2005,"After two science-fiction films (AI and Minority Reports) who where not exempt from reproaches but also very attractive, Steven Spielberg stays into the realm of entertainment. But, the reproaches that could be made to his precedent movies, the extravagance and the Hollywood tendency from these projects, are not longer there. With 'Catch me if you can', we can see another facet of Steven Spielberg. He tend to be just like a young director who's searching new approaches, but with a lot of experience: the cast is perfect, the cinematographer is very good and the well trained compositor (John Williams) has the intelligence of producing some kind of new themes.Where Spielberg hit the point is in his total mastering of the Abagnale - Hanratty pursuit which, instead of being made in an epileptic manner, works more on the psychological level of the relationship. This pursuit shows the research of a missing father by a missed child who has no other way to prove his existence than to play with the law. Di Caprio shows, once again, his abilities to act the different facets of the tormented teenager, even if for an actor who is almost in his thirties it's maybe the time to change. Tom Hanks is Tom Hanks, he has nothing to prove.The only reproach we can make is the stereotyped vision that Spielberg has in his representation of the woman. Nathalie Baye is sympathetic in his French wife role, but it's in fact his whole character that poses a problem :the opportunist French wife who doesn't assume his maternal duty. This role makes us believe that for Spielberg, the subtlety is only a man's thing.Apart from some imperfections, Catch me if you can is a very good movie...if you like entertainment",Catch Me If You Can
252,mwendel,An Amazing Story,8,25 December 2003,"This movie is an adaptation of the book written by Frank Abagnale Jr., at one time one of the top con artists/forgers in history.  The film is a sharp intelligent chase between the FBI and Frank.  Surrounded by excellent locations, dialogue, and an excellent John Williams soundtrack, you are mesmerized by the sheer confidence and extent to which Frank was capable of eluding the law and forging checks.  At times, Frank seems more like an escape artist/magician than a criminal.One thing the film doesn't truly address is whether or not the immense losses suffered by the banks, truly affected any individuals or business in a long term manner.  What it does show is how one step in the wrong direction can create a snowball effect that doesn't allow one to escape even when they want out.  Frank, while living the life of luxury, somewhere along the line realizes that to live that life while being chased isn't going to work.Luckily, for him, he was very young when he made his mistakes, and being very intelligent he acquired and retained skill set invaluable to law enforcement agencies and security companies today.  Frank was able to turn his mistakes into a good thing in the end.  I would guess, and one would hope, that if he had to do it over again, he probably wouldn't have made the same choices.A very well done worthy of watching. Enjoy it!",Catch Me If You Can

It's a true story about a boy named Frank Abignale Jr. who becomes a con man, using fake identities and cashing in faux checks. And while this is happening, an FBI agent named Carl Hanratty is on the lookout for him.What's great about this story is the humor. There is some wonderful play between Frank Abignale Jr. and Carl Hanratty and all of the characters in the film. I especially like Carl's ""Knock Knock"" joke.

256,matlefebvre20,As serious as a drama and as funny as a comedy,8,4 June 2006,"According to me, biopics about little-known people are more interesting, because they're more surprising. Just before renting ""Catch Me If You Can"", I've never heard anything about Frank Abagnale Jr. Now, I know a lot of things...Frank Abagnale Jr. was a young man (in fact, not 20 years old yet) who discovered that he had a real talent of forging other people and to make money from it. And the story itself is not a forge, because it really happened. All of the elements presented in the movie are not necessarily true, but the majority is. The trueness of the story is simply incredible and hard to believe.Abagnale is played by Leonardo DiCaprio, who delivers a fairly splendid performance here. While he was in his late 20's during the filming, DiCaprio perfectly appears as a late teenage boy.The other main character is FBI agent and fake checks specialist Carl Henratty, played by the incredible Tom Hanks. Henratty is the cat of the cat-and-mouse game and he personally runs after Abagnale on this wild ride in order to bring the kid to the justice. But the job isn't easy.The main example is the famous hotel showdown. At this moment, Henratty only heard the Abagnale name and he doesn't have any sight of Abagnale's face. So, he meets Abagnale, but the young man acts like if he was an agent as well and Henratty falls into the trap. This situation is the funniest one in the entire movie.Also highlighted must be Christopher Walken's performance as Abagnale's father.There is no single mood into this movie. Sometimes, it is very dramatic and there are very special scenes. But it's also very comic and it surely is one of the lightest movies of Steven Spielberg's career as a director.So, ""Catch Me If You Can"" is another jewel in Spielberg's filmography and so it is for DiCaprio and Hanks...",Catch Me If You Can

It is richly entertaining and in its 140 minute running time, it doesn't get boring. Unlike Dicaprio's other movie Gangs of New York gets boring after awhile.Also unlike in Gangs of New York Dicaprio gives an excellent performance in Catch Me If You Can and in Gangs he gives a terrible performance. It's really sad that Dicaprio will probably not be nominated for an oscar because this is by far his best performance. Theres just too much competition for him. Tom Hanks did a good job too but he wont be nominated either.This movie has an excellent script, that should at least be nominated for an Oscar. So should the Original Score. The Costume Design and Art direction are possible too. Spielbergs Direction is a longshot for an oscar nomination but its not totally impossible.

258,LiquidPoetry1921,What took me so long?,9,22 February 2017,"This is one of the best movies I've seen in a long, long time. Captivating from beginning to end, Frank Abagnale, Jr., (Leonardo DiCaprio) amazes the audience with how flawlessly he can fake his way out of a tight jam. Just when you think 'they've got him this time', he manages to extract himself from the perilous dilemma ~ his cunning even astounding him sometimes!The only reason I gave this flick 9 stars instead of 10 was for a couple of minor issues I had with it. I thought the voice Carl Hanratty (Tom Hanks) used for this role was unnecessarily muddled with an indiscernible accent. His own voice would have sufficed just fine for the part and didn't need to be changed to enhance the role. As well, the 'interesting' relationship between Frank, Jr.'s mother and father at the beginning of the film was completely unnecessary and didn't add anything to make the movie more interesting. However, I can see why Christopher Walken (Frank Abagnale, Sr.) was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor ~ for the incredible influence he had as the con-artist dad grooming the con-artist son, but not for the awkward scenes he had with his wife, Paula (Nathalie Baye). Perhaps that entire scenario was created for artistic effect...I just found it a boring waste of time.However, that was the ONLY boring thing about 'Catch Me if You Can'!

Frank Jr. learns a lot from his father and in school one day he pretends to be a sub-teacher and gets caught after a week! At the same time, Frank's mother is having an affair and his parents then get a divorce and Frank runs away from home, but the cheques he has bounce all the time so he finds a way to make better cheques and changes his appearance from time to time to show what he does to cash the cheques. From a pilot to a doctor he uses the television to guide him in a way and soon an FBI agent catches on to Frank's trail, who now becomes a wanted fugitive.I really enjoyed this movie, it kind of reminded me of one of my favourite tv-series The Pretender (Michael T. Weiss, Andrea Parker) and how there are some people in the world that can pretend to be anyone they want to be. Leo was great as Frank Jr. and I think its his mother Paula that is to blame for him running away, she was having the affair that killed the family and how his stolen fortune soon messes his mind up so badly that he loses prospective of everything. Tom Hanks was very smooth as the workaholic FBI agent. Christopher Walken as Frank Sr. who loves his son dearly and Frank John Hughes who starred in a series called Players where he and 2 others were forced to work for the FBI, what a coincidence that he plays an FBI agent in this and especially because the ending is somewhat the same as that series.I rate this 10/10.",Catch Me If You Can

261,rowanmaillot,Only the best chase film EVER!,10,6 June 2020,"More people need to talk about this film because it is worthy of its 8.1/10 stars on IMDB and with your help of watching this movie you can increase it. This is how movies are supposed to be made, one of Spielberg's best of the 2000's and it has great performances by Leonardo DiCaprio, Tom Hanks, Amy Adams, Jennifer Garner and many more brilliant actors. Leonardo DiCaprio's performance as real life con-artist Frank Abagnale Jr. feels like the real thing, it feels like they casted the real Abagnale at the correct age and this is your performance.When you're watching a movie, you walk out of the theatre saying to yourself, 'What a great performance', but that is not what actors want, they want you to believe this could be a real person and DiCaprio accomplishes that beyond the shadow of a doubt. This movie is proof that DiCaprio can push out a brilliant performance and isn't just that pretty-boy from Titanic or Romeo & Juliet. It's actually one of the only times I agree with the Rotten Tomatoes common Sense Media, so I wouldn't necessarily consider this film to be underrated, just compared to his other films, this one is put far down on the list which I absolutely disagree with.Spielberg crafted my favourite war movie, my favourite action adventure movies, four of my favourite science fiction movies, my favourite motion capture movie, my favourite comedy of the 2000's so I went into this film with the highest expectations possible and I loved this film, it was excellent in every way possible. It tells the story of Frank William Abagnale Jr. and how he became rich and got away with everything he did.His dad (who also goes by the same name except Jr. played by Christopher Walken) and mum have a break-up one day and Frank has to choose whether he wants to live with his mother or father. It is a very frustrating and traumatic task so he decides to run away from home. He becomes a co-pilot by faking identity and paying checks instead of cash, he gets involved with a prostitute and finally meets his future wife played by Amy Adams. They meet at a hospital counter where they both flirt and finally she asks him if he wants to meet her parents, he accepts and they go there. Frank tells them he has multiple jobs and they eventually get married. Detective Carl Hanratty (Tom Hanks) and his fellow detectives go around to where Abagnale is having the wedding.Abagnale admits to Brenda Strong (Amy Adams) that he is a con-artist and all that money he has gotten by pretending he has a job. He tells her to keep the money and he jumps out of the window and runs away as fast as he can. He eventually gets caught by detectives and is brought to a filthy jail in France. Carl Hanratty comes over there one day to send him to America and says he will meet his father. On the plane, Carl admits to telling him a lie, his father fell down the steps on the way to the train station. Frank goes to the toilet claiming he was going to be sick, only to find a way out of the plane and goes and runs to where his mother lives and sees she has children and a new husband.At the end of the film, he ends up working for Hanratty and that's the end.100% - One of my all time favourites",Catch Me If You Can

265,JAKastner,The Moose Hole - 'Catch' This 'If You Can',8,12 January 2003,"There are few directors out there that can make a great film but it is even rarer for a director to make two great films in one year. Steven Spielberg will try to be one of those rare directors. Earlier this year, Spielberg directed the critically praised Minority Report, which gathered more praise for its box office battle with Disney's Lilo & Stitch then anything else. Now after directing box office draw Tom Cruise, Steven Spielberg attempts to breathe new box office life into the career of Leonardo DiCaprio by adding the mix of Oscar winning actor, Tom Hanks. Will this experiment work and showcase the reasons why Spielberg is one of the greatest directors in Hollywood or will this one of the very few flaws in his career?The story goes that Frank Abagnale Jr. lives a normal life with his parents but things begin to change very quickly. His family moves to a small apartment after his father runs into trouble with the IRS. Frankie's parents soon divorce after his mother begins to cheat on her husband. This drives the confused boy to run away from home. Frank makes a good life for himself by disguising himself as an airline pilot becoming the James Bond of the skies. But he runs from that job after an FBI agent named Carl Hanratty begins the chase to capture him. Hanratty will go to the ends of the earth just to catch him. The story, which was based on a true story, was well done but felt too weighted. Some of the elements seemed too unbelievable for the audience to really accept. And some areas of the story seemed to last too long that in the end they felt flat for the most part.The characters in the film were all based on real life people. Leonardo DiCaprio plays the lead character, Frank Abagnale Jr. It really wasn't much of a stretch for him to play a ladies' man but it had been some time since he played a character that was like the one he plays here. Frank Abagnale Jr. is a confused character who continues the chase not because he loves it but that he needs it. He needs the cat and mouse game with Agent Hanratty to fill that void he is missing with his family. DiCaprio shows great acting ability especially in the end expressing this character. Agent Hanratty is not an Oscar winning performance for Tom Hanks but it is a character which seems like he had a lot of fun with. Christopher Walken is great as Frank Abagnale Sr. playing off Leonardo DiCaprio very well especially in facial expressions. It is a shame that his character is not given a good send off in the film rather then the plain ending his character gets.Overall, Catch Me If You Can is another good offering from the creative genius of Steven Spielberg but certainly not one of his greatest. The film is certainly a great diversion from the usual dramatic films offered by Spielberg but Catch Me really seems slow and flat in certain areas of the film. Some of the characters were flat in some areas. Christopher Walken's character is great but sent off in a good way. At least there should have been something there for the audience for feel sorry for when his son is told his father is dead. Jennifer Garner's character, though nicely performed by the Alias star, seemed pointless in the overall effect of the film. Catch Me If You Can is a nice film, though, for people to relax in without having to waste a very long time with or being too blown away with elaborate special effects. Catch this film, if you can. If not, don't worry too much about it.My Rating: **** out of 5",Catch Me If You Can

267,RARubin,Unseen Cruelty,8,27 June 2005,"Steven Spielberg has a style, a straight forward telling of a story. There is something middle class and suburban about his films. The temperament of the protagonists, their concerns is essentially middle-class whether the actors are soldiers of D Day or doomed Jews of Europe; their world, the well-to-do burgher world has crumbled. He doesn't write these scripts, but he certainly puts his stamp on them.DiCaprio is very convincing, playing a teen, and then in turn, playing an older man whether doctor or pilot. I think that is a neat trick. I've always thought that actors are the weirdest of all artists and possibly the dumbest in real life, but I digress. Christopher Walken plays the failed businessman-father with the heart of a gentle con. The son takes the con part and leaves behind the gentle. His mother is an opportunist, a French war bride, so when things go wrong, she moves on without a lot of thought or feeling for the men in her life. DiCaprio is attracted to criminality, a ""Paper Hanger,"" living in the swinging late 60's with a suitcase full of ill-gotten cash. Tom Hanks, the stodgy FBI man is on his trail, but the boy is just too fast. He can only be caught if he wants to be caught. I digress again. Mr. Spielberg is not Alfred Hitchcock, but he learned a lot from watching Hitch's work. Keep the plot moving by the illusion of unseen cruelty, the shaking chandelier or invisible shark.

Secondly, the performances are excellent, Leonardo DiCaprio in this sort of role where he actually acts instead of just looking pretty (Titanic springs to mind) is really a joy to watch. Also, Christopher Walken is excellent and Tom Hanks does that thing that he does which is to pull off an extremely good performance without actually trying. Lastly, I just want to say the music was brilliant- I'm really a big fan of John Williams.

Frank Abagnale, Jr. is a slick counterfeiter/conman with Tom Hanks from the FBI always hot on his heels. Based on a true story. Frank had a troubled family life and after a surprising separation of his parents after his Mom has problems keeping her legs together. Frank loses it and decides to run away, only to return to visit his father, Christopher Walken, from time to time. I especially enjoyed Walken in this film. His relationship with his son, Leo, in the movie was rather realistic and reminded me of mine with my father. Walken fans will enjoy seeing him in this film, even though he doesn't play his normal evil self. I also enjoyed Hanks and Leo's relationship in the movie as it resembled a father son relationship. Frank cares for Carl(Hanks), and Carl cares about Frank, even though it is his job to catch him and throw him in prison. And you can't help but to admire how Frank always outsmarts Carl throughout the film.Being a Spielberg film, one can expect the typical happy ending. And although I normally don't buy into such fluff, it worked for me in this film. It has a few quirky moments, but overall it was a good effort and I would enjoy watching it again.

Nothing wrong with the previous assessment apart from the fact that ""Catch me..."" did not entirely succeed in keeping my undivided attention and that I was not really impressed due to an absence of tangible substance in the portrayal of the various characters.All the protagonists seemed to lack a form of real content and appeared to me as being very shallow human beings. Even the chemistry between Di Caprio and his father which was obviously intended by the director, was hardly convincing. In the first half of the movie Tom Hanks was portrayed too often as a bungling FBI agent which bordered on ludicrousness but luckily he was more convincing in the second half. Some scenes, such as the references to James Bond and Di Caprio's amorous encounter in a hotel room, were really superfluous not to mention the viewer's disbelief at the ingenious escapology of the Houdini-like forgerer.

I have had a lot recommended to me, whilst i watch a hell of a lot of movies i haven't seen them all. I recently got my hands on a copy of Catch Me if You Can and had high hopes. Afterall, i've heard nothing but praise for the movie and the two main stars Leonardo Dicaprio and Tom Hanks are two of my all-time favourite actors, how could i not love this?! So i watched it.. and i love this film! It had me hooked in from beginning to end and I couldn't take my eyes off of the screen. It was a fun movie as well as one that just keeps you wanting to know more and guessing how it will end for the characters.. especially Leonardo Dicaprio's Frank Abangale Jr.The plot follows Frank who leaves home at 16 after his parents divorce and poses as a pilot.. then a doctor.. then a lawyer.. all before he turns 21. I tell you, this guy has lived. Hot on his tail is an equally brilliant Tom Hanks as FBI detective Carl Hanratty who figures out Abangale's tricks through a series of fake cheques he is cashing out. This leads to an entertaining cat and mouse type movie full of twists and turns. The two actors play off of each other perfectly and are two completely different characters. What i like about Leonardo Dicaprio's portrayal of Abengale is that he is an incredibly smart guy and he is so good at showing this without completely overplaying himself. Christopher Walken also does great as Abengale's father and adds some moral backbone to the twists and turns and we get a young Amy Adams who is also great as Abengale's love interestEverybody in this film does great.. in fact.. even a Jennifer Garner cameo was awesome!In the end, from the fitting music in the soundtrack to the animated opening sequence to the climax of the film everything was almost perfect and i will be watching this film a lot more times in my life because i had a great time and it really showcases why these 2 actors are 2 of the best working today.

279,Mcnabbbeasty,Amongst the most entertaining films ever made.,9,5 August 2021,"""Catch Me If You Can"" is simply all time classic cinema. Every aspect of this 2002 Spielberg gem is phenomenal. From the witty and captivating story to fantastic acting from DiCaprio, Hanks, and Christopher Walken. You can watch this movie a hundred times and it just won't get dull. At its core, that's what film is all about. This is one of my favorite movies ever and has been ever since I first watched it at about 15 years old. It's a pretty long film but you sure can't feel it; nonstop captivating scenes and moments. To me, that's rare to be close to 2 and a half hours and non stop riveting. ""Catch Me If You Can"" is just a supremely joyous film watching experience and one of the most rewatchable movies out there.",Catch Me If You Can
280,thescholar22,Catch me if you Can Review,8,9 June 2015,"This movie came out in 2002 and was directed by Stephen Spielberg. It's about this guy Frank W. Abagnale Jr. coning as an airline pilot, a doctor, and a lawyer in the 1960's. The thing here is that he did all of this before he was 21. The movie starts off with a game show talking about why he did all of this. Then it goes to Frank in French prison in 1969, played by Leonardo DiCaprio. He tries to escape but the flashes back to 1963 with his father, played by Christopher Walken, winning some kind of award. Later his father is investigated for tax fraud. As his father slowly loses his fortune and gets divorced Frank runs away. He learns coning from some tips his father did earlier in the movie. After coning as an airline pilot he starts to get the attention of an FBI agent Carl, played by Tom Hanks. Carl almost gets Frank but he gets away the first time they meet. Then he cons as a doctor to throw the FBI off and then a lawyer. You probably know from the opening Frank will get caught eventually. Thought after he gets back to America the ending is actually pretty good and satisfying. I think this movie also started to create the 60's craze until Mad Men perfected it a bit later. Anyway this movie is pretty good as a biopic about Frank's coning and struggle to get back his fortune.",Catch Me If You Can

I kept waiting for a movie to be made, but it never happened.....until now.This is a GOOD MOVIE, but 2 hours is just not long enough to tell all the juicy details of this man's story.  This movie is entertaining, but lacks the depth of the whole story. But heck, it's just a movie.I, for one, wouldn't have minded seeing this movie play longer, but I am sure the studios didn't want to release a 3 hour movie.  A two part mini-series might still give the story justice.  Frank Abnigale Jr. did so much more than what was put into this movie. It was still fun though.Left out, were quite a bit of the details about how he LEARNED fraudulent technique.  I wonder if Spielberg thought the audience would be bored by such detail, but in fact, I would have been riveted. The movie feels like it's in a hurry (hardy har har) and is afraid of boring its audience.Too fluffy for oscar buzz with the exception of Christopher Walken.

It's okay, it has very good things in it but it was too long (and that's why boring at times) and even though DiCaprio is a great actor he looked too young for this specific role. I mean, it sounds pretty odd that Frank got away with all of his felonies for such a long time but it's even more unbelievable when we see Leo on the screen.

It had excellent performances in it from Leonardo Dicaprio, Tom Hanks, Christopher Walken, and Martin Sheen. This movie was so amazing and unreal that it seems impossible for it to be based on a true story, but surprisingly it is! I do think Leonardo deserves the Golden Globe nomination he got for this role, and possibly an Oscar, but I was surprised Tom Hanks did not get one because I thought he did an excellent job as well. I hope 'Catch Me If You Can' makes it to the Oscars!!",Catch Me If You Can
291,Niro,Catch Me Not,4,31 December 2002,"You'll pardon me for not concurring that this is Spielberg's best film in years (and Lord knows that he keeps sucking my wife and I into those $8.50 box-office tickets anyway).""Minority Report"" has been called the antithesis of this so-called 'breezy' film (because the parents in CMIYC ""care"" -- or at least one of them does) but that's giving Spielberg way too much credit.A word of advice: don't watch ""The Grifters""  (which I did the night before viewing this mess), possibly the best con film this side of ""The Sting.""
Hell, don't even see the underrated ""Harry in Your Pocket"" or even ""The Flim-Flam Man"" before checking out this ultimate con of your $$$.Funnily enough, the biggest con here is Steve grabbing the money he lost when you didn't see ""A.I."" or ""Minority Report.""And what a mess it is: Tom Hanks manages the worst Massachusetts accent since the lamentable Costner's in ""Thirteen Days"" (and I'm one of the film snobs who actually LIKES Hanks -- his turn in this year's ""Road to Perdition"" is worthy of a nomination: not a win, mind you, but a nod).Hanks' accent wouldn't be a problem if he wasn't in approximately every other scene.The Saul Bass-inspired opening creds (think ""Pink Panther"" flix) and cool initial John Williams score suggests a fun retro film, but this just isn't. It's ""Ocean's Eleven"" sans the cool.Dispensible characters come and go with no follow-up whatsoever (Jennifer Garner in a truly ""what's she doing here?"" cameo, Marty Sheen and his daughter-character -- who are actually important to the story, but disappear when their usefulness subsides: basically 10 minutes after their arrival).Though ""based on actual events,"" several interludes smell like Spielberg inventions, not the least of which are Leo's 'just missing' being caught episodes, which play out here like old Marx Bros. sketches -- without Groucho and Harpo and Ms. Dumont.By the way, Leo's pretty good here (how can this 28-year-old still look 16?).But while watching the film I couldn't help but wonder what the book was like -- and comparing Frank Abagnale, Jr.'s exploits as portrayed here to those of the fellow from Michigan who was arrested a few years back. The latter not only impersonated doctors, airline pilots and more but actually performed operations, flew planes, etc. From memory, the guy was the greatest impostor in history.Oh wait, there *was* that old Tony Curtis film, ""The Great Impostor"" -- maybe I'll have to check that out again as well.Christopher Walken's most endearing role ever (?) in a nice turn as Leo's dad can't overcome the average DP work, Hanks' worst performance in a few years, a really shoddy script and, well, STEVE.Catch it not.

293,SpaaceMonkee,Long and Underwhelming,5,11 November 2021,"After having heard for years how great this film was, I confess to being disappointed. Much of the hype surrounding it centers on its supposedly true backstory. From that perspective, Catch Me If You Can is two ace actors playing out larger-than-life characters in an amazing tale. But, in the years since the film's release, it seems that there now is substantial doubt about the veracity of main character's story, to say the least. Ultimately, why should we be surprised that a man claiming to be one of history's famous con men may have conned an audience looking for an interesting story?Instead of watching Catch Me If You Can as the Hollywood glamorization of a convicted felon's tale, which itself may be a highly exaggerated or fabricated version of what actually happened, watch the movie as a movie with a clever plot that at times seems implausible. It follows Tom Hanks as an FBI agent chasing con man Frank Abagnale across time and geography. This film is likely the least I've enjoyed Tom Hanks in a role. His character seems stilted and forced.The movie plays out the cat-andamouse game, slowly. There are funny moments throughout, but they are not frequent enough to overcome the film's length.

294,HBeachBabe,"light, breezy, fun & inconsequential",8,1 January 2003,"""Catch Me if You Can"" is as light and carefree as the period it evokes. Right from the opening title sequence, accompanied by yet another great John Williams score, we are transported to the early sixties - a decade of bright colors, breezy tunes and gentile living - the Camelot of pre-assassination-of-Kennedy America.Steven Spielberg's flashier side is well hidden here, although his style comes through in his inventive use of close ups and cross cutting to give a sense of time and place, evoke the period through the use of small details rather than large settings.His work with the actors and the small character touches is evident. Leonardo DiCaprio fares best under Spielberg's guidance, Tom Hanks, not as well, but still strong.His use of a New England accent seemed to impede some of his line readings.The story is fun, with just enough depth to keep it from blowing away. Ultimately though, the material may be too light for Spielberg, often feeling *too* much like 5 or 6 episodes of a 60's TV sitcom, like ""Please Don't Eat the Daisies"" or ""Gomer Pyle"" Hank's use of a four-letter expletive not-withstanding.CMIYC is a fun time at the movies and will make you laugh and maybe get misty eyed, but it lacks the emotional pull of Spielburg's weightier films.

It turned out to be Ellem Pompeo, who I think is hot. This movie told the story of how he became a pilot, a doctor, and a lawyer. Not very many people can do that. This was a good movie.

The most amazing thing about the film is that it is based on a true story. Thankfully, Christopher Walken supplies Leo with some interesting motivation for becoming ""The Great Pretender"". Earlier in his career, the knock on Spielberg was he was a director of spectacle; not an actor's director like Sydney Pollock. That just isn't the case. His abilities have matured, as has the man.

His direction in Catch Me is coherent and strong without being intrusive, putting the story first.
Not that I want to start on a negative note. Catch Me is a really good film--funny, human--and different, for Hollywood, which usually likes its young male heroes to be hip, horny and heartless. Frank has a disarming vulnerability and attachment to his family. That lost-boy thread saves his story from being about someone who uses people, and it makes the movie.Fine acting from Di Caprio and Walken.

If you want to get as much out of it as possible, there are a few things you need to keep in mind before watching:Catch Me If You Can showcases a lot of interesting intrigues as the plot develops and turns into a cat-and-mouse chase. The pacing is well done as are the relationships between the characters, which rarely feels over the top even when the situations at time are somewhat absurd. The movie never feels unbelievable in that sense, and its optimistic and genuine tone - together with great performances from both DiCaprio, Hanks and Walken - makes for a thrilling and exciting joyride with a rewarding finale.However, this movie is not without potential downsides. Women are frequently depicted as sex objects and are rarely given any other character depth. Secondly, there are some details, expressions and institutions in the movie that can be confusing at first, especially for non-Americans.Nevertheless, Catch Me If You Can are fun, cheeky and captivating. It is fairly light at a first glance, but there are deeper themes that makes this movie enjoyable for a wide audience.My personal grade: an entertaining 7/10.

How much of it is true is beyond my knowledge, but for a man to get away with so much.. it's kinda crazy. I will say that other than the great characters and their development, this did not feel like a Spielberg film. It just didn't have that masterful touch that I usually get from his other films. Is that bad? Well, no. It just doesn't feel like his best movie. So in conclusion I gave Catch Me If You Can a ""Good"" on theVade Review Bar or an 7 out of 10. Although I wanted to give it an ""Alright"" this film's characters and actors were outstanding and really made this film a good movie. The small issues with how the story was told, and Jennifer Garner's character (kidding) really held this film down from being a truly memorable one.

After the entertaining but overrated Minority Report, he brought us one of his most effortlessly fun films in a long time. I caught myself grinning from ear to ear many times throughout the movie. DiCaprio turns in his finest performance since What's Eating Gilbert Grape & The Basketball Diaries. Even though the story is based on a true story/autobiography of Frank Abagnale Jr., it all seems like some crazy Hollywood plot that's just too irresistible not to love. As for the rest of the cast, Tom Hanks is (as always) thoroughly reliable as the G-man set on catching Abagnale. Christopher Walken steals every scene he exists in as dad Frank Abagnale Sr., Frank Jr.'s impetus and inspiration for his outlandish check fraud spree. Like father, like son indeed. Martin Sheen and Jennifer Garner make delightful appearances in key scenes and John Williams' score is top notch, perfectly catching the snappy-cool kitsch of the 60's in every note. It's all a refreshing mix of everything we've come to fall in love with the movies.

That's really not what you would expect from a big name film with big name stars. I guess I got about what I wanted from it, but to say that it's as wonderful as what I'm reading here is just not accurate. First off, you know you're in trouble when Leonardo Di Caprio is the best actor in the movie. I'm not a fan, but he did do the best job. I like Tom Hanks, how could you not? However, his acting talents are incredibly overestimated. For the first 20 minutes I was having a hard time trying to figure out what his accent was- southern, East Coast or perhaps Australian? Weak. Next, there's the infamous Christopher Walken. Amazing how no one mentioned him in the 20 or so comments I read. Maybe they didn't want to say anything bad about someone so well liked. OK, leave it to me to do the dirty work. Once again I'll bash another extremely popular actor: Walken is a terrible actor and in this movie he actually was a little better than I've seen him- slightly less terrible. I also read that this was totally original and that the ""cat and mouse"" idea was just great. This film didn't have an original feel to me and just off the top of my head I'm coming up with 2 other chase movies that blow this one away: Heat (De Niro) and The French Connection. Sorry to have to burst everyone's ideas, but I can't lie to you. I must also do the unthinkable again; yes, I'm going to say a few words about Spielberg. He has some talent, but his movies are filled with a certain sappy quality that just doesn't ring true or have any relevance. Perfect example- that thing with the floating $ bill that someone said was a nod to Forrest Gump (a forgettable movie to be sure). I guess people like that sort of stuff, but it's just silly and overdone. Well, I think I've ranted enough. I just feel there are many other better movies to get excited about out there. For Tom Hanks fans I still say ""Big"" (1987) is his best. For Spielberg I strongly recommend his first and best effort ""Duel"" (1971).

Frank's story is very intriguing and exotic.  It is about a man that in the late 1960's that makes a living through fraud.  He writes bad checks, imitates professionals such as doctor, lawyer, and airline captain. He made millions of dollars living this way.  At this rate it will take me two or three lifetimes to make the money he made.  He lived like a god for about 4 years.  It makes me want to just try to make one big score.  This movie is an inspiration to me to do `wrong' for profit.  If only I could have one chance to make big money.  I would go for it.  Yeah right, I don't have the courage to do it.

309,kikoydaba3,highly entertaining crime thriller with fine artistic qualities,8,7 July 2019,"Catch Me If You Can is a highly entertaining crime thriller with fine artistic qualities. Director Steven Spielberg gorgeously delivers a film set in the 60s following the exploits of Frank William Abagnale Jr. as a con man, effortlessly played by Leonardo DiCaprio.The film tackles themes of family, parenthood and loss. Frank Jr. starts with a happy family that quickly fractures when financial struggles and extra-marital affairs led to his parent's divorce played by Christopher Walken and Nathalie Baye as Frank Sr. and Paula Abagnale, respectively. Their divorce precipitated his descent to financial crimes. Hot on the trail is Carl Hanratty, played by Tom Hanks, an FBI bank fraud agent. Carried by a great cast and brisk editing, Catch Me If You Can never slows and the audience is completely immersed in the journey and thrill of Frank Jr.'s exploits. Every shot looks beautiful with the impressive cinematography from recurring Spielberg collaborator Janusz Kaminski. Composer Michael Khan provides a score that reflects the tone of the film.Ultimately, Catch Me If You Can fails to reach its true potential because the character growth of Frank Jr. has little weight. Through the course of the film, moments are sprinkled to reveal Frank Jr.'s motivations but this is not fully explored. The script comes short in realizing that Frank Jr.'s broken family is the reason for his actions. The emotional weight of the film gets lost in the chase aspect. However, the film remains a marvel to appreciate considering all its qualities.8/10",Catch Me If You Can

It's funny how their relationship is portrayed as well. It's quirky and i think Steven used it well. Chris Walken is Leon's dad and as usual puts out a good supporting role. Overall, another good way to spend your time and a must for a Stevie Spielberg fan 8/10",Catch Me If You Can
312,easmith03,Entertaining Drama/Comedy,8,2 January 2003,"I found the movie to be top notch entertainment.  The acting was great, and the story was paced in a way that it didn't have any slow spots for me. There were enough laughs to make the movie seem quite light hearted.  But, there was also a dramatic element of the movie where you realize that Frank (DiCaprio) is committing crimes, and he is being tracked down.Frank leaves home as a 16 year old and begins a ""successful"" career as a con man who uses the cover of a pilot, lawer, doctor, etc to help him to a life of riches as he uses his counterfit identifications to help him pass bad checks.  The FBI is always a step behind.  Frank seems to be able to get away with anything, and seems quite the clever con man.  But, you begin to realize that he is really just a very young man, who despite the adventures, is really quite lonely.Yes, he is a criminal and you do have to kind of root for ""bad guy"" to get away to enjoy some of the drama in the movie.  However, I don't think I'll be giving away too much to say that he does eventually have to pay for his crimes.I had just finished the book just prior to seeing the movie.  And I do think the movie captures the spirit of the book.  However, I found a couple of things curious about the transformation to the screen. Apparently the book is embelished.  Probably several things in the book are presented more ""grand"" than they actually occured, or just made up entirely. But, there were a couple of events in the book that might have been interesting in the move.  While the movie also adds some elements that weren't in the book at all.  Oh well, I enjoyed the book also, and it was a pretty easy read, so if you enjoyed the movie, you may want to consider reading the book also.",Catch Me If You Can
313,Snoopymichele,"Great fun, DiCaprio is perfect",9,7 March 2007,"SPOILERS BELOW This is one of those movies that you're not sure you are going to like, and you watch it, and you end up loving it. It's fast paced, well acted and directed, and great fun.Leonardo DiCaprio is utterly charming and endearing as Frank Abagnale, Jr., a teenager who in the 1960's posed as an airline pilot, a doctor and a lawyer-all the while evading the FBI who wanted him for check fraud. Tom Hanks shines as Carl Hanratty, the fed who first wants to nail Frank, then ends up taking him under his wing and giving him new direction in his life. Christoper Walken and Nathalie Baye as Frank's star-crossed parents also give fine performances. Amy Adams nearly steals the movie as the young woman who steals Frank's heart.The film is about a young man who is traumatized by what the US government has done to his family so he decides to literally become other people to escape from whom he really is. Frank is a charming smooth talker with an uncanny knack for forging checks and documents. He's so angelic looking and unassuming that none of his victims are aware they are being conned. As he has proved time and again in films like ""This Boy's Life,"" ""What's Eating Gilbert Grape,"" and ""Titanic,"" DiCaprio is more than just a pretty face. He has the talent to back it up, and this role is tailor-made for him. Under Spielberg's direction, he's taken that talent to another level. Ultimately it becomes about a surrogate father/son relationship between Frank and Carl. While he's trying to outwit and outrun the sometimes curmudgeonly FBI agent, Frank admires him at the same time. Carl, for his part, does hold a soft spot for Frank, and he leads him down the path to redemption.The sets, the costumes, and the music all capture the essence of the sixties, when anything was possible and nothing was out of reach if you wanted it.I was pleasantly surprised at how much I liked this film-I give it a 9 out of 10.",Catch Me If You Can

What's very compelling is how clever and smart he was during his changing of many occupations; however, it was a young person having fun as well!

316,ashi-lance,Catch Me...,9,6 February 2013,"This was an entertaining and fun piece of film making from the ever-reliable Steven Spielberg. It is a bit of a depart from his usual full-blown and hugely epic movies like Jurassic Park, Schindler's List and E.T., yet this does not detract at all from the fascinating story of Frank Abagnale Jr. Although it is important to remember (as with any such film) that this is only 'inspired' by a true story and not told word for word from one, the plot is fascinating and keeps you laughing, crying and wondering until the end. Dicaprio is believable as a guy that can convince people that he's someone else. Dicaprio is a charmer and is very smooth as we watch his character do some fancy talk to the young ladies. Tom Hanks as the FBI agent reminds me of his cynical character that he played in ""A League of Their Own"" and his mere presence adds more to this film, perhaps more as we see him in 2nd lead Just like the opening credits, this film is very much a chase movie with a nice sense of period. The plot starts at the end and jumps back to see the whys and the hows of the tale. It is told with a slick energy that keeps the story moving and never really lingers on any scene longer than it has to. It is for this reason that the two hours goes by relatively quickly. When his parents file for divorce and he has to choose between them for custody, Frank Abagnale Jr. runs away from home. He begins to con his way around - getting better and better at it with each step he takes. Posing as a pilot, a lawyer and a doctor he earns his money from cashing forged cheques. He is able to do all these sort of crimes inspired by comic books and experiences he got from things around him. As the numbers go up, FBI agent Carl Hanratty starts tracking him in a game of cat and mouse. Overall this film is a slick, stylish chase movie which should be enjoyed as such and is more enjoyable for being a true story. If anything it is a little too slick for it's own good, but that is a petty complaint to make against a film that kept me pleasingly entertained for the entire film length!! To be fair – the film didn't sets out to be some massive thought provoking film; it was a chase movie and it was a very stylish and enjoyable one at that.My Rating – 9/10",Catch Me If You Can

321,cartman_1337,A welcome departure from Spielberg's usual style,8,9 September 2013,"This is the story of perhaps the biggest American fraudster in history, and the cat-and-mouse chase to catch him. A hunt that in many ways brought Frank Abagnale Jr. (DiCaprio) and FBI agent Carl Hanratty (Hanks) together, since in many ways they were each other's lives at the time, and culminated in a lifelong friendship. Frank Abagnale Jr.'s story is an incredible one. By the time he turned 18, he had successfully played the roles of an airline captain, a doctor and a lawyer, and cashed in false checks for over $2.5 million. This is the film of his story, based on Frank's own accounts of the events. And it is an exceptionally entertaining film. Cocky con artists succeeding pretty much always make for a fun film, and when it's based on the true events of a young and likable man, it gets even more fun. It's amazing what you can get away with a little ingenuity and enormous amounts of nerve. But there's of course a price to pay when your whole life revolves around living a lie.Catch Me If You Can is actually a rather unusual film to bear Spielberg's name. The usual Spielberg trademarks are mostly absent from this film, without that necessarily being a bad thing. Initially Spielberg didn't intend to direct this film at all; it was Gore Verbinsky who first got the job. But when Leonardi DiCaprio was called back to film more scenes for Gangs of New York, delaying the shoot, Verbinsky had to withdraw. At that time James Gandolfini was lined up for the role of Carl Hanratty. It could've been interesting to see how the film had turned out with them, but looking at the film as it is, it is hard to imagine it being better than the Spielberg/Hanks collaboration it turned out to be, their fifth at the time.Along with Spielberg's departure from his usual style, there's also John William's soundtrack, which is very different from the pompous soundtracks he's most known for. It's jazzy and beautiful, and fits the 60s setting perfectly. The acting is first rate, from the leads of Leonardo DiCaprio, who started showing at the time that there was more to him than just being a heartthrob, and Tom Hanks, both delivering top notch work, to brilliant supporting parts from actors like Christopher Walken and Martin Sheen. It's a well crafted and playful movie overall, delivering the goods across all lines. It's a highly entertaining movie, that I'm sure will stand the test of time. Recommended!",Catch Me If You Can

And never feel tired watching it even today, for its all handsomely shown, those life pictures of a con man from real life. Frank Abagnale JR would be your real life hero instantly, cant think of another person portraying Frank than Caprio, hes just handsome and his behavioral acting would have helped a lot in it. The music was tricky with a mystical feel adding tempo to the chase and tricky parts in the movie.When a hearty biography is directed by Steven Spielberg cant complain about a flaw anywhere, but to be fair, it wasn't that engrossing as a Schindlers List - i know its stupid to even compare- and would be able to give only a 8 though i thoroughly enjoyed it",Catch Me If You Can

Well what should have been either a 100 minute well edited fun movie or a mini-series but at two hours and twenty odd minutes it is way too long and paradoxically not long enough.You see there are some neat things in this story. What did Frank Abagnale Sr. , wonderfully played by Christopher Walken, do for a living? Was he a printer or just run a stationary store?  I mean where did Frank Jr.( DiCaprio) learn about inks and paper and such? It would have given depth to the story and was not there that I saw.They spent time on Frank Sr's wife and Junior's mother Paula Abagnale played with a wonderful style by Natalie Baye, but was she a hooker in France or was she a money grubbing tramp and the whole divorce scene was played like Junior had not been living there for sixteen years? I couldn't tell for sure.Spielberg can do better work.  Tom Hanks must feel greatly relieved that a picture can be made that he doesn't have to be the mainstay? He was slow to grow on you but ultimately very good as FBI agent Carl Hanratty. This is sort of fun for a matinee movie but it is not award class.

Not just anybody takes over a project with ""Trash"" written all over it, and makes a very good movie out of it.""Catch me if you can"" is a very enjoyable film that you can watch over and over again. I believe I'm one of the few that thinks Leonardo Dicaprio can be a good actor when he puts his mind to it. And although this is not the case, I must say that this is one of the few movies in which I don't find him annoying. Tom Hanks also proves his quality with an excellent performance in a supporting role, although it never felt right Hanks doing a goofy second to Dicaprio. Another great addition was Christopher Walken as Frank Abagnale, Sr. He doesn't have as much screen time as Dicaprio or Hanks, but makes a strong background character that helps the audience understand Dicaprio's character. I think the film's biggest plus is being a real-life story. I don't know how much of Frank Abagnale Jr.'s life has been changed for the script, but no matter how different it is, the story is believable, except for making Dicaprio a 17 year-old, c'mon!. I think somebody hit the jackpot when they looked at Abagnale's adventures and said ""Hey, somebody should make a movie about him"".Spielberg made a great last minute save with this film.

Interesting to see how Frank Abagnale Junior (Leonardo DiCaprio), though he grows to see his father more clearly, deals with his hurt by acting out some of his father's antisocial behavior, becoming that of which he most disapproves in a parent.

Teaming him with Christopher Walken as his father was a stroke of genius, as the two really resemble one another, something that never would have occurred to me.  Both of them are great, and Tom Hanks has fun with his role, too.

I can imagine what a great comic turn Gandolfini would have had with this role as the perplexed, straight-laced FBI agent.)And Steven Spielberg, who inherited this film from other directors, took it and made it into a truly enjoyable experience.

Carl Harnatty ( Tom Hanks) is the FBI agent in charge of running the Check Fraud division of the FBI. ""Catch Me If You Can"" takes us on the exciting and extremely funny cat and mouse chase between the two men.I have now seen both ""Lord of the Rings - The Two Towers"", and ""Catch Me If You Can."" ""Catch Me If You Can"" is a lot better, and easily the best film of 2002. The film succeeds on so many levels. The first is that the film is based on the amazing true life story of Frank Abignale Jr. He was the most cunning and successful con-man in history, and was able to accomplish everything he did before the age of 19. What makes the film even better, is the fact that it follows extremely close to the novel of the same name, written by Frank himself. The next reason is because of the direction of Stephen Spielberg. The film was paced extremely well, and even though the film is almost 2 1/2 hours, it never seems long, or drawn out. The set designs were also very authentic, and he managed to get the best performances possible out of the actors. This of course leads into the third reason of the film's success which were the amazing performances given from the cast. Leonardo Dicaprio has never really done it for me before. I love his films, but not him. However, he gave the best performance of his career. He is extremely witty and cunning which let him play the different identities of doctor, lawyer, etc so convincingly. Tom Hanks was awesome as Carl Harnatty. He will amaze you with the determination he gives to catch Frank. But he will also make you laugh with his Boston accent, and how naive he can be. At one point, Abignale is able to convince Carl that he is a Secret Service agent working on the case. Alias' Jennifer Garder, Christopher Walken, Martin Sheen, and the rest of the cast were all excellent as well. Finally, the film is down right hillarious and fun to watch overall. I was laughing for the whole entire film, and I actually enjoyed watching Frank from one moment to the next.""Catch Me If You Can"" offers an extremely accurate portrayal of Frank's Abignale Jr.'s life, outstanding performances, outstanding direction from Spielberg, and you will laugh harder than you ever have before.

As he travels around the globe cashing fraudulent cheques, Frank is pursued by FBI Special Agent Carl Hanratty (Tom Hanks) hence, the taunt in the film's title.What makes this film an interesting and fun one is that the main character actually exists in real life and Leonardo DiCaprio's performance is a charismatic one.  Although I found some parts of Catch Me if you Can' enjoyable, I did find it a bit slow and the story-telling flawed.  Although one can conclude that Frank was a genius to have deceived as many people as he did, the film is lacking in explanation of how Frank managed to succeed in the range of positions he came to work in, eg how did he become a doctor and barrister without going to either medical or law school?As a fan of Steven Spielberg's work, I was looking forward to this release and compared to his last two films A.I' and Minority Report', this film is much lighter in tone.

This Movie is the Second Mouse",10,29 October 2007,"My all time favourite movie. Absolutely brilliant! Definitely Spielberg's best. Leonardo DiCaprio is one of my ten favourite actors. Everything I've seen him in, both he and the movie it self have been absolutely brilliant.Leonardo is Frank Abagnale Jr. Someone who became a doctor, lawyer, an airline pilot and managed to con millions of dollars from the government.Tom Hanks plays the F.B.I. agent Carl Hanratty who is devoting all his spare time to track down capture Leonardo as soon as he can.Christopher Walken is Frank Abagnale, the father of Frank Abagnale Jr. His son learned most of his skills from his father. His father loves his son, and won't say anything to even hint to his son's location and Nathalie Baye is Paula Abagnale, Franks Jr's mother. She's started a new life and doesn't much care for her former husband, and just wants her son to be safe and not on the run from the government.This movie is perfect. I strongly recommend this movie to everyone and anyone.",Catch Me If You Can
343,FilmWiz,Leo and Hanks are remarkable,8,5 January 2003,"MPAA Rating: PG-13My Rating: 12 and upMy * rating: 8.5When I first learned about the making of this film, I nearly fainted. Leo DiCaprio and Tom Hanks in one movie together? That combo didn't click too well with me, but I decided to see it in the opening week, anyway.
Boy was I wrong... The film was remarkable, and everything about it was realistic and exiting, which is just the thing you'd expect from a Speilberg picture. This is one film that I would enjoy seeing time and time again, and it's creators should rejoice. Even Frank Abagnale Jr. should be happy about the release of this picture. The story begins when Frank William Abagnale gives his son, Frank William Abagnale Jr. (DiCaprio) a check book for his sixteenth birthday. Following his fathers footsteps, he become a con artist. He uses his checks as a way to spend money that he doesn't have. At the same time, he uses his skills to become a doctor, a pilot and a lawyer. Carl Hanratty (Hanks) is an FBI agent who trys to catch him. the real shocker is in the end...This story is superbly told by all actors, especially the two leading actors, DiCaprio in particular. DiCaprio is not the 'Titanic' spoiled teenager that he was in most of his films. He is now a 19 year old adult, something I have been wondering about now for some time, even though he was born in 1974. An excellent film. You will not be dissappointed",Catch Me If You Can
344,rah604,'Catch Me If You Can',8,23 April 2004,"Leonardo DiCaprio plays Frank Abagnale, the kid who ran away from home and became a con-artist. Frank successfully impersonates a co-pilot, a doctor and we find that he has other surprises up his sleeve. In the process, Frank uses over two million dollars via forged checks.In 'Catch Me If You Can', director Steven Spielberg strays away from his sci-fi explorations (AI, Minority Report) and gets back to the basics. By that I mean, that he makes a simple movie (no superlative heroes or special effects) that everyone can enjoy.  The entire cast excels here. DiCaprio, uses charm and wit in his performance as the scheming Frank. Hanks is funny in his turn as a nerdy and obsessive FBI agent. Walken gives his strongest performances in years in a small, but pivotal, role as Frank's father.Even though the pace of the film slows a bit during the last third, it is still a witty and immensely entertaining film. This one's a real catch.Rating: (8/10)",Catch Me If You Can

346,yaseminturkish,Can we reward Spielberg with `Chicago's' Oscar for releasing two purely entertaining films in the same year?,10,14 February 2003,"Remind me again why America has such lofty expectations of Steven Spielberg but will gladly sit through any of the now rotten George Lucas films?  Our expectations are so high that Spielberg goes out and makes his most purely entertaining film in a long time (`Catch Me If You Can') and one of his absolute best intellectual films ever (`Minority Report') in the same year but finds the Academy rooting for the sophomoric `Chicago.'  Truly perplexing.Possible SpoilersThat said, `Catch Me If You Can' is the most fun I've had at the cinema in years and like most Spielberg films appeals to everyone so as to maximize profit.  `Everyone' refers to the dumbed-down American public who adore retread sequels, franchise films, and any film with the words Julia Roberts. And this is the brilliance of Spielberg who brings the masses of dumbed-down Americans together with the silent minority of intelligent film-goers who won't see a movie with less than 3 stars.  `Catch Me If You Can' is a perfect film for everyone and so entertaining that I found myself more excited than I had been earlier that day at a screening of the self-indulgent `Adaptation.'Who knew that Leonardo DiCaprio could act?  I sure didn't after the snorefest that was `Titanic' but Spielberg has a way of urging even the most awful actor toward brilliance.  As Frank Abagnale Jr. Dicaprio is very good at making us like this con-man and indeed, hoping that he will get away with all of his crimes.  Tom Hanks is fairly pedestrian here, perhaps he's out of revelations, but Christopher Walken is pure magic as always.  In one scene he and Frank Jr. make eye contact and there is a secretive smile that they share as he congratulates his son on getting away with impersonating a French teacher.  Scenes with Frank's future wife, a nurse, where she is more upset that he's not a Lutheran than anything else are pure magic.  A chance meeting in Frank's hotel room with Detective Hanratty (Hanks) is smart and fun.Most intriguing is the fact that Spielberg spent very little time shooting `Catch Me If You Can' and in the course of one year managed to release two incredibly memorable films.  Sure `Catch Me If You Can' doesn't add anything to the story of Frank Abagnale Jr. but a story as exciting as his doesn't need any additions, its a true story after all.  Still, I can't imagine any other director bringing as much to the film as Spielberg does with his fun John Williams beginning to the scenes at Miami International Airport with the flight attendants and their cute powder blue uniforms.  This is one of the few directors that you can currently look to for originality and excitement.  `E.T.' was based on a dream after all and I can't forget those spiders crawling across the floor in `Minority Report'.  Even his biggest failure `Artificial Intelligence' was unique and well-crafted.  The other directors out there are on a course of making bad sequels for profit and making toilet humor some sort of revelation.  You have to hand it to Spielberg for taking an extra step.10/10",Catch Me If You Can

348,redbirds525,One of Spielberg and Hanks' best!!,9,17 June 2003,"First off, I must preface by saying I am not a fan of Leonardo DeCaprio. I had to suffer through him in TITANIC (a movie which I enjoyed), GANGS OF NEW YORK (which I hated) and now CATCH ME IF YOU CAN.I first saw CATCH ME IF YOU CAN in the theatre last Christmas and thought it was an okay movie. Nothing spectacular. I rented the DVD when it first came out and watched it three times within the week that I had the DVD for. This has since become one of my favorite films in recent memory. I have been turned off recently by some bad Speilberg films, in my opinion (AI, MINORITY REPORT.) But the combination of Speilberg, Tom Hanks and even Leonardo made this a very entertaining movie to watch.This movie actually reminded me of THE FUGITIVE, with Harrison Ford and Tommy Lee Jones. It always seemed the crook was one step ahead of the authority figure. Tom Hanks is great as Carl Handratty, the FBI agent hot on the trail of Frank Abagnale (DeCaprio.) The always wonderful Christopher Walken plays Frank's dad and gives a brilliant performance well worthy of the Oscar nomination. This is really a great movie to see. One of my favorite parts was at the end where they are playing the classic Nat King Cole ""The Christmas Song"" during one of the climaxes. I would recommend CATCH ME IF YOU CAN to everyone, even those who are not Leonardo DeCaprio fans.Rating: 9 out of 10",Catch Me If You Can
349,smoky_circles,"The most saccharine, sentimental depiction of sociopathy, ever",3,9 January 2009,"Frank is a con-(young)-man. He cashes fake checks totaling up to millions, cheats and lies his way into several professions, and charms several women onto his sheets...but that is just because he is a lonely, lost boy, because his father was always in money trouble, and he had a broken home. He writes sentimental letters to his father, offers him expensive gifts, and talks about his mother rejoining them. He is actually a genius, see, and, when given the chance, proves himself to be virtuous by helping the authorities. And he has good, honest, hardworking potential too!! -- he passed the bar exam all on his own after loads of studying. This movie struck me as so false throughout that I couldn't help but see through it and overcompensate for its dishonesty and false sentimentality by continuously re-imagining it: what might REALLY have happened? How sociopathic might Frank have been to lie, cheat and steal so easily and continuously? How many women might he have slept, really? And how many times did people catch on to him? A brief look at a wiki article proved my suspicions. Frank's first victim was his own father. He ran away from home and never looked back. He failed the bar exam several times and his passing may have involved bribery and other methods of cheating. After being placed in prison he tried to escape to Brazil but was caught repeatedly. His cons sometimes failed as people suspected his lies. If this story was even mildly hollywoodized, I would have been fine with it (and if the writing, acting and visuals weren't as bland). But it takes sentiment and dishonesty to the oomphth degree. Take for example the window scene near the end. It again reinforced the theme that Frank was just a lost and lonely boy who committed all these crimes because he missed his mother. And the cheesy label-removing motif. That was just a waste. Tom Hank's character was worst at the beginning when he was going room to room shouting comically and trembling like an old lady. He got slightly better at the end. Leonardo's character was as I mentioned unnatural and flat, so I guess he made the best of it. The female characters were very fake and comic-booky and annoying, yelling ""yes, yes"" during the sex scenes or crying after being yelled at by their boss and falling bashfully head over heels for the guy who comforts them. The worst offenders might have been the FBI and law enforcement folk who were a bunch of bumbling cartoonish idiots, too shy to reach their arms over for a fork. There were also a whole bunch of random scenes that didn't give anything to the movie. Some, like the prostitute scene seemed to be out of nowhere and would have fit in more if the whole movie wanted to show Frank as mildly sociopathic (which would have been more realistic). The one scene that I did like was when the agent came to France to see Frank's setup. Money flying everywhere and tilted camera angles gave it a cool look. But even then you are given the dishonest condition of Frank in stress and somewhat unraveling, a condition which screams at you, 'hey! look! look how worn out and rambling he looks! This criminal spree is taking a toll on him too, you know. He does have a heart!'",Catch Me If You Can
350,Thanos6,Ehh.,4,27 December 2002,"**MILD SPOILERS**
I was dragged to see this with the family on Christmas, and it was definitely my least favorite ""present"" of the day.The main flaw in the film was that of its main character:  Frank Abagnale, Jr.  I can't support a character being portrayed as a 'hero' if in fact they aren't one.  Abagnale had no conscience, no moral center, no concern for all the innocent people he duped and tricked.  Plus the film didn't show how he slipped from perfect schoolboy into cold-hearted conman; it just *happened*. If Abagnale had been portrayed as more of a villain, I would have liked the film more.  Leonardo DiCaprio's largely sleep-walking performance didn't help.I give this film 4 out of 10:  one point for Tom Hanks's excellent portrayal of Carl Hanratty, one point for John Williams's lovely musical score, one point for Thierry Kuntzel's lovely credit sequence, and one for the ""airport pickup"" gag; you'll know it when you see it.",Catch Me If You Can
351,Jisk,"Good, but not great",9,20 January 2003,"While watching Spielberg's new film, I was completely captivated by the naturalness of the performances. Usually, I find the acting in his films to either be syrupy(A.I., Saving P.R) or cartoonish (but good as in Raiders). In this film, the performances felt REAL. I have never experienced that in a Spielberg film, as I have usually felt that the performers were too aware that they have been ""acting"". That is my most usual criticism of his films. This time, I had no problem with it. I loved the acting in this film.    My problem with this film lies with some of the choices Spileberg has made as a director. Spielberg is not notoriously ""stingy"" as a director. He usually lets the audience have what they came to his movie for: an emotional experience. While this trend was certainly true early on (think of the final segment of Close Encounters), lately it seems that he is holding back. I won't give away any spoilers, but people who read this might know what I mean. For instance, I walked away from this movie THINKING about it. Not FEELING it but THINKING it through. Did I like that or didn't I? I asked myself. I sure laughed like a loon throughout so surely I enjoyed it, but then why did I feel so dislocated from that experience of it by the end? Spielberg, in my own humble opinion, has been committing ""Shyamalanisms"" of late. Definition: A really alienating end to a perfectly wonderful movie; an ending that makes you ""think"" but ultimately does nothing to make you ""feel"". ""A.I"" did it. ""Wha?"" I asked at the ending of that film. Everyone seems to loathe the ending of ""Minority Report"" so I won't even go there. And now, with ""Catch"" he has completed a trilogy of films which are largely wonderful but leave you with a sense of vagueness/despair.   Don't get me wrong, I liked this film.

Sad because is seems less Spielberg than other films, just like ""Minority Report"". Leonardo is very convincing and this is his best performance yet.His portrait is great and you could see him as that kind of charming fraud he plays. Hanks is less convincing than Leo, but it's still the great performance you'd expect from the best actor we have right now. As in ""The Road to Perdition"", it's a new character for Hanks, which in both movies probably led to the Oscar nomination of his co actors.But Christopher Walken is the best, by fare the best performance i've seen him in. He has some sort of devilish greatness about him it's just great. And the scenes with Hanks shows a great portrait of a father, Hanks must have some magic effect on he's co-actors, cuz if Hanks isn't the best all others are. The movie is great stylish, very 60s and very straight. There are funny moments in the movie, especially Agabnale's first prank/fraud.But somehow the movie is a little too long, but leads up the best Spielberg ending since ""Schindler's List"".I love spielberg movies and this is one of his five or six best, which is saying a lot. 8/10",Catch Me If You Can

And Walken manages to come because he transpose his emotion in your life with a lot of problems. Tom Hanks had a good performance, but when I think of his performances in The Terminal or Forrest Gump, which were sensational, in Catch Me If You Can not seem so great, but also is very good.The direction was very good. I'm no fan of Spielberg in particular, but I recognize that he has great movies, so that i've watched a lot and I liked the most. This was no different a light direction, which does not force the bar to the viewer. Knowing how to be smart, know how to be subtle, knows how to be funny. Although I found some unnecessary scenes on the life of Frank Jr., which lengthened a little movie, but nothing that hinders the viewer, the film still holding you from start to finish, no doubt.Overall, this is it, it is nothing revolutionary in the cinema, but still, it's a great film by a great director, is very light to watch and you probably do not feel the time passing.",Catch Me If You Can

Leonardo, Martin Sheen and Jennifer Garner were more concerned about what they are wearing and how they look rather than getting into depths of these wonderful characters.

Actually my motivation for writing this comment is one of the scenes in the film. I am really wondering whether it hit anyone else as it did me.It took place during the dinner scene in which Leonardo DiCaprio is extolling his virtues to Martin Sheen, the father of his fiancee, who is quite skeptical and gives him a line if questioning. Immediately came to mind a similar scene, at the dinner table,  from the 1972 film ""The Heartbreak Kid"". Charles Grodin is extolling his virtues and line of goods to Eddie Albert, father of Sybil Shephard. Mr. Albert tells our hero afterwards exactly what he thinks of him and from there, of course, the similarity ends.  Would recommend this film, good story and great acting.

I can imagine the screenwriter having a BALL writing the script, enjoying himself immensely after he wrote, page, after page of clever dialogue, fun moments, and narrow escapes.  I felt like I was living the experience along with the character.What can I say, that hasn't already been said about the director, Steven Spieldberg, he is beyond criticism at this point, although, I have found in his last few films, that he just doesn't know how to end them.  A.I. went on for much too long, and the ending of Minority Report,  well, it had about 3 different endings... With this film, the ending seemed to always be around the corner.  But then again, it wasn't, I was ready for the movie to end at the airport, where much of it had happened symbollically, but then there was an extra scene... but with such a clever, magical script, I really didn't mind if it had kept on going.Catch it, if you can!",Catch Me If You Can

366,PeterJordan,Catchy if a bit overlong,6,9 August 2006,"The premise of Catch Me If You Can is interesting to say the least. The Spielberg directed biopic is based on the true story of Frank Abagnale Jr who pulls of a series of breathtaking and unbelievable but nonetheless credible in their execution scams, and all before his 19th birthday.However this is also essentially the story of a young man who witness's his fathers business failure and consequently the break up of his happy family life, and accordingly sets out on something of a reactionary and desperate, but unattainable crusade to try and reclaim that which he has lost.Leonardo di Caprio, in a Michael J Fox eternal youth stereotyping role, stars as the teenager who is pursued over a period of years by an FBI agent played by Tom Hanks who is determined to get his man no matter what.The movie opens by setting the scene of the relationship between Di Caprio and his father, played by Christopher Walkin, whom the son obviously idolises. Early on we see Frank Abagnale Sr. being honoured by the local Rotary chapter but it soon becomes all to apparent that his success is not as it seems and in fact he is on the verge of bankruptcy and being pursued by the IRS for tax evasion. Things rapidly crumble leading to the Abagnale's losing their house and soon after the break up of the family when his Frank Senior's French wife leaves him for his best friend. Frank Jr, forced to choose between living with his mother of father, instead opts to run away and very soon realises an ability to graft and deceive people, more often than not women, based on his good looks, charm and, as he discovers, the awe and glamour in which the public hold airline pilots in 1960's America.Frank Jr. starts by breathtakingly impersonating a Pan Am Co Pilot which, more than anything exposes the gullibility and trusting nature of people before an age of air terrorism. Buoyed by his success and the relative ease in which he manages to carry off his assumed role, Frank's rapid learning curve combined with the necessity to keep ahead of the FBI chase leads him to further roles as a James Bond type super cool sophisticate, A Night shift doctor and ultimately a State prosecutor. All through this he keeps in contact with his father holding out the vague hope that he can get his mother and father back together and all will be the same as before and the nightmare will end. As his star continue to rise and his daring reaches new heights his fathers conversely falls as he ultimately ends up working as a mail man to make things meet.The most striking thing about this movie is how it develops each of the deceptions or roles he adopts, so that we start out finding it hard to see how he can carry off a role when he introduces the concept and yet as we are led through his deceptions the, ease and credibility of his performance and the naivety or unquestioning attitude of his audience carry us along and make us too see how he could have really pulled the trick.In the end the movie does stretch on a bit in its telling of the story and introduction of additional supporting cast of a love interest and her father played by Martin Sheen so that the end product runs well over 2 hours but if you think you might be on for sitting that long it's worth a look.",Catch Me If You Can

369,Tkbn3812,"A brilliant story, with stunning acting, and a gripping plot",9,26 September 2016,"Catch Me If You Can is quite a unique film, one of which is to be commended for the beautiful way it tells a magnificent story. Directed by the great Steven Spielberg, it recounts the true story of Frank Abagnale, one of history's greatest imposters. Spielberg has portrayed a story that has viewers connecting with the characters, with a well-paced narrative that is bound to both impress and shock the audience, alongside spectacular acting, and a simple yet intriguing musical score to couple the most tense scenes.Frank Abagnale is your typical 60s teenager. A 16 year old, he is an only child living with his parents, a simple yet sufficient life.But his whole world is turned upside over the course of a few weeks. When the IRS come after Frank's father for unpaid taxes, the family is forced to move into a small apartment; not much time passes before the two parents separate. This is the turning point for Frank, and sends him on a journey that will go down in history as one of the most remarkable stories of an imposter.So begins a story that spans three years, three jobs, almost $6 million in stolen money, counterfeit checks, not to mention a wedding, and tells the story of both the teen on his crime spree, and the FBI agent who will stop at nothing to catch him. Frank Abagnale is played by Leonardo DiCaprio, with FBI agent Carl Hanratty played by Tom Hanks. These are two big names of Hollywood that do remarkably well in their individual roles. DiCaprio plays Abagnale in a realistic manner, bringing out the teenager's sly nature, while also taking into account his more human side, of which pushes him out on his journey in the first place. Tom Hanks was an excellent choice as the FBI agent; his acting is convincing, as he portrays the workaholic as a tough, no-nonsense guy who has a troubling backstory and, deep down, a heart.Frank Abagnale Senior, played by Christopher Walken, plays a pivotal role in the plot. It is the financial troubles that Frank Junior sees his father in that in turn encourage him to set out on his journey of three jobs.Amy Adams, who as Brenda Strong plays Abagnale's bride, seems to have been an unusual inclusion. Nothing eventually comes of this proposed marriage, and as convincing an actor as DiCaprio is, it at no point seems as though Abagnale is truly in love. Perhaps this is intentional, however, considering the outcome.There are several minor characters in the film, including Martin Sheen as Brenda's father and Natalie Baye as Frank's French mother. Cheryl Ann is played by Jennifer Ann, in a short and unnecessary scene of which, again, nothing comes out of.It is in fact from the moment that Frank leaves the US that everything begins to fall apart. The scene of which involves his eventual arrest in France sees DiCaprio let down his performance a little, switching from a character who is in control to that of one now distressed. After this, the relationship between Abagnale and his capturer, Hanratty, is built up; for the most part this is successful, however there are some flaws. The scene where Abagnale nearly leaves the country again is not particularly realistic. Clearly Hanratty had enough faith in Abagnale to believe he would not leave, and while this is what happens, surely he would not take the risk?The film features yet another unique and beautiful score from John Williams, who approaches scenes of action with a jazzy motif, of which makes a two minute debut in the opening credits. The actual theme for the movie contrasts this motif, and is a pleasant tune with hemiolas, a trademark Williams-styled theme reminiscent of ET and Jurassic Park in its instrumentation. This score is truly a positive for the film.However, as with all films based on true stories, there are certain aspects that need to be pointed out. There was no planned wedding in Abagnale's real life; while he does eventually marry, this is actually after his release from prison. His parents were never in financial trouble, and in fact Frank's first victim of fraud was his father himself.While Frank did have a relationship with an FBI agent, it was not to the extent seen in the film. He most certainly did not call him every Christmas; the real Frank Abagnale called the prospect of calling the man in charge of capturing him absurd. One thing that isn't stressed enough in the film is the fact that Abagnale committed most of his fraud before the age of 19. There is no way that Abagnale looked 28 (DiCaprio's age at time of filming) when he was only a teenager, and if it were made more clear he was a teen for most of the film the audience may have been even more impressed by his crimes.However the film is right to portray a criminal in a positive light; the real Abagnale has gone on to assist the FBI and other crime agencies in counter-fraud measures, from his experience in the real world. Overall, this is a pleasant watch that will certainly leave a positive impression on viewers. Remarkable acting from DiCaprio and Hanks are the highlights of the film, with a plot that, regardless of inaccuracies, is simple yet interesting. The music score by far is a positive, with in-depth character development that keeps the audience engaged throughout the film.Although the film has flaws specifically in its romance, it wins in almost every other aspect, keeping viewers connected to the story. The film certainly is to be commended in the way it portrays a troubled teenager and the man sent out to stop him. It most definitely succeeds at telling the true story of a real fake.",Catch Me If You Can

It is a good example of how a lot of talented people can get together and in a self-important moment design a mundane period piece that only artsy types would like.

Based on a true story!? This happened in real life! I just had to find out what in the world was he doing being able to do all that!? Quite an interesting story.
It's about Frank Abagnale Jr.(Leonardo Dicaprio) a young man who was able to con people being a doctor, a legal prosecutor and a pilot. And now the FBI , specifically Carl Hanratty (Tom Hanks) is trying to catch him.
This was just incredible and shocking. Purely intelligent to be able to pull off something like this. What he did with those toy airplanes from Pan AM, that was genius, I was really impressed. How can someone have the guts to do all this and not be afraid of being caught just blows my mind.
Even though Frank was busy making money and impersonating different professions , he was lonely, missing his mom and dad very much wishing he had the old life he had with them. He was hoping all the money he was making can take him back to the way they were but it didn't. And he very much looked up to his father (Christopher Walken) they insinuated he had a part in making him the way he was. I wasn't very happy with his mom and her actions. A woman who looks for opportunities only.

372,mikek-6,A terrible film from a director who should know better,1,3 February 2003,"Spielberg has made some awful films in his long career (AI for one) but this is by far his worst. Its such a shame because the guy is obviously highly talented, doesn't need the cash, and should have the confidence in his own abilities and the audience not to need to stoop to Disney techniques in order to embellish a great, true story. So many things just didn't add up, particularly in some of the characterisations - the young girl's parents, for instance, just weren't the type to have thrown her out of the house when they found she was pregnant. No, reality really is better than fiction and all those things that Spielberg added in a naive attempt to interest the audience were just the things which turned them off. And, oh, what was that awful boring, long, pastiche of a title sequence at the front? Most of the audience were asleep, or talking, before they saw the first frame of the story. Hollywood yet again gets it wrong.",Catch Me If You Can
373,witness-7,disappointing execution and little concern for characters,6,22 March 2003,"First, the good news. Christopher Walken fans will appreciate the one gem of his movie -- his supporting performance. After that, there isn't much to hold this movie together.Leonardo DiCaprio is mis-cast as someone who thrived on their anonymity -- while he happens to be one of the most over-exposed actors in Hollywood. Tom Hanks, along with his role in Road to Perdition, adds little dynamic to a key character -- seemingly taking a parallel to Dan Aykroyd's film career: a once-notable star playing forgettable roles, getting chubby from too much food and sitting on the laurels of former glory.There are a few moments of interesting character situations, but none of the characters made me care about them (besides Walken). Characters are discarded so frequently in the chase for DiCaprio that the movie seems as shiftless as his character's life. While this conveys the nature of his on-the-run existence, it leads to a film with more of a laundry list of brief encounters rather than any richer storytelling.There's an attempt to create a surrogate father-son relationship between DiCaprio and Hanks, but it is handled superficially and merely suggested. There's probably more they could have done to bring out an interesting dynamic between these two key characters. More also could have been done to bring out the dynamic of the real father's influence on the son.The movie employs the classic switch between past and future scenes, but there's no mystery in them other than the mundane details of how they will inevitably connect -- as the audience presumes from the start. A few clever escapes here and there, but they are hardly captivating, let alone memorable.To its credit, making a story about a fugitive guilty of fraudulent checks is hardly Hollywood sexy these days. But the entire experience left me expecting more from this movie.",Catch Me If You Can
374,existenz-6,Amusing joy ride of a film,7,15 December 2002,"""Catch Me If You Can"" is easily Spielberg's best film since ""Saving Private Ryan"", and his best comedy ever.  The film is a funny, exciting, adventurous journey into the world of conman extraordinaire Frank Abagnale Jr.  If you don't know who he is now, you will after seeing this movie.Truthfully, I wasn't expecting much going into this.  Spielberg's films have become so premeditated recently, with just the right angle, just the right piece of music and just the right look of awe on the actors' faces, that his films haven't been truly enjoyable for some time.  He's like a novelist who, despite great diction and flawless punctuation, has lost his touch when it comes to story and character.  With ""Catch Me If You Can"", Spielberg has finally loosened up and let the story take center stage.  It's an understated but mesmerizing success.  I even forgot that I was watching a Steven Spielberg film, which is a sign of how good it is.Christopher Walken, who did a Q&A after the screening, said that this movie was filmed very quickly.

I like the very beginning. TV watchers supposed to find out a true Frank among three men. I especially enjoyed the question from the interviewer regarding a CHOICE. The question has been addressed to the first Frank, the fake one.Unfortunately, Steven Spielberg decided to address to a real Frank a NEW question and missed an opportunity to make the play stronger by giving a ""chance"" to answer: "" I didn't have any choice.""By answering that, the real Frank would have gained an extra dose of mystery, which is always good for a thriller, and he might have also gotten some additional sympathy from the audience. In short, it would have added a few cents to the character development.That answer would have been a powerful attention grabber for the watchers, who would be waiting for an explanation, and the interpretation would come through the story itself.Now, why didn't the real Frank have any choice?This is what we see in the movie:The boy was thrown into turmoil due to the divorce of his beloved parents. Thrashing between mom and dad, Frank, to avoid an emotional storm, runs away from both of them. After this point, he has been pushed to do what he could for survival, without being given any choice. The teenage boy started to face the cruelty of the materialistic reality - each independent step is costing MONEY. Already, before his parents' divorce, we observe that Frank had a high self- defense ""mechanism"" – episode of his transformation into a school-teacher. Using the inheritance from his father – the ""mice pray"" and the empty bank checks, Frank, thanks to his cleverness, is gaining success, ensuring his physical and emotional survival.As a matter of fact, he faces a real CHOICE and hesitation of a decision in the end of the movie.

Truth seems to sort of stifle the creative juices. Having read the actual story, I'm afraid I had trouble following the movie, at times. It starts out in a French prison, but I don't recall anyone saying why he was actually in prison in France. I thought the movie version of his becoming a doctor was a bit raw and quite abrupt. The true story involved a much more natural flow of events and would have made a neat segment. I guess they needed a certain treatment in order to make transitions from one part of the story to the next. And they did a pretty good job of stitching the whole thing together, even providing (creating?) a background of family issues to explain, in a way, how he happened to get into his chosen lifestyle. Some very classy bits to watch out for. Well worth waiting for on video.BTW, lest anyone think that Frank's lifestyle would be fun to emulate, you should know that he spent a lot more time in prison than what appears in the movie.

I love this movie for that purpose! Not to say that it doesn't cause some cerebral response, but it's just fun to watch! Frank just keeps slipping through all the nooses, and Tom Hanks' portrayal of Carl Hanratty is probably one of the most overlooked performances of his career while being one of his best (and he has some pretty good ones out there).One of my favorite things about this movie is the opening credits. It's unbelievable that anyone would like the opening credits, but it brings back memories of my early adolescence when I learned to love movies watching the late night showings of Martin and Lewis on Fridays and Saturdays on my local network affiliates. The 60's styling during the opening credits just creates a wave of nostalgia that causes me to really enjoy. And I love the score. It's perfect for this type of intrigue.The only negative thing that I saw in the movie is the stretch of age that DiCaprio has to pull off. I think he does so on an emotional level, but, physically, it's hard to believe him as a 14 year old at the beginning of the film.If you haven't seen this one, it's worth the purchase price of the special edition DVD.

Three (counting the Xmas calls) years of Frank being tracked down compressed in less than two hours do not make for very exciting story telling. It is merely a case of Frank jumping from one role into another. His ability to act these roles proficiently is only tested once in each situation. However, a year in each of these roles would necessitate the construction of a more elaborate personality for Frank than what is depicted in the movie.Some scenes seem to have been put into the movie without reason. For example, the whole set of scenes starting from the 'james bond of the skies' comment to the scene at room 3113 serve no purpose. Frank at another role. What does it tells other than that Frank likes role playing?Overall it is somewhat enjoyable... but Frank's character is not interesting enough, despite its many transformations.

386,a-ozornin,Amusing and entertaining,7,12 April 2012,"When we were children, we used to imagine who we want to become: astronauts, firefighters, top-models, whoever. Apparently some people live their lives as if they are still playing in the courtyard; they easily change their occupations, looks, even characters. Catch Me If You Can is about such a man.This is a true story about Frank Abagnale Jr. who, before his 19th birthday, successfully conned millions of dollars' worth of checks as a Pan Am pilot, doctor, and legal prosecutor. He admires his father and from him he learns how to manipulate people and systems. Of course, he attracted attention of the police forces, and in particular of Carl Hanratty, man in charge of falsifications in the US. The pursuit that ensues is the main focus of the movie.The plot is based on the autobiographical book by Frank Abagnale Jr. himself, where he describes his adventures, and despite the huge potential that the book had to offer to the movie makers in terms of the characters, relationships etc, the movie turned out to be nice extra rather than the stand alone piece of art.The movie lacks personality. Charisma of real Frank Abagnale Jr. did not allow Steven Spielberg to put anything personal in the movie. It is simply re-telling of the book; the director or the screenplay writers don't have their own opinions on the matters going on, they simply take the back seat and show us what happened to the main character. This approach made the movie automatically inferior to the book – the audience still needs guidance; good movie is always a dialogue, not a monologue, not a dry ascertaining of facts. It is still amusing and interesting to watch, but poor Frank and Carl look like animals in the zoo rather than humans with human feelings and emotions. It starts to feel artificial game of cat and mouse.The famous director failed to inhale life in the characters. Little surprise that the star cast didn't manage to do it either. Leonardo DiCaprio and Tom Hanks clearly do their best. DiCaprio convincingly plays immature kid with little understanding of consequences of his actions. Hanks convincingly plays workaholic cop. But the lack of conflict, lack of deep interactions means that the characters don't evolve, and in the end of the movie we see the same two chaps that we saw in the beginning. Christopher Walken, Martin Sheen, Amy Adams – they all play their parts perfectly, creating exactly the characters they were asked to create. Shame they still look unnatural. And in the end, all the action around the master of reincarnations simply leads to the thought that maybe exciting, fulfilling life doesn't need to be full of action and pursuits and God-knows-what. Maybe what people actually need to live truly interesting lives is the presence of other people, who would guide, teach and just talk meaningful talks. Who needs all the checks and all the millions if there is nobody around to tell you where to spend it? The story of the man who never stopped being a small child is worth watching only for the sake of this idea.VERDICT: Good illustration to the book, amusing and interesting, even though it fails as the movie.m-picturegoer.blogspot.com",Catch Me If You Can

390,Quirky-,Groovy 60's fun from Spielberg,9,19 January 2003,"***SPOILERS IN REVIEW***A breezy, very enjoyable film from the title credits onwards, Steven Spielberg's latest, 'Catch Me If You Can' is not a particularly important film from the blockbuster man, but it's good, guilt-free fun for a couple of hours. Frank William Abagnale, Jr. (Leonardo DiCaprio) is a young man, son of a stationery store owner and a mother from provincial France, whose life is suddenly torn apart when his apparently in love parents announce their imminent divorce. Young Abagnale panics at the very notion of his parents being apart and hot foots it down the streets of NYC. After this spontaneous running away, Frank Jr. must somehow make a livingwhich leads to the idea of forging bank cheques. This forgery doesn't go unnoticed by the FBI, where Special Agent Carl Hanratty (a bespectacled Tom Hanks) is on the case, desperate to track down the chameleonic Abagnale. After some credible impersonations of pilots, doctors, CIA agents and lawyers (and a few others), Abagnale has racked up almost $4 million and the FBI is close to tracking him downAt 140 minutes, the film feels a little too long, although the time doesn't drag with the proceedings. DiCaprio is excellent as Abagnale, Christopher Walken is tragically funny as Frank, Sr. and Hanks is good as the always-on-the-job, Hanratty. As I said, it's not a particularly significant film in Spielberg's career, but it's a lot of fun. 8.5/10",Catch Me If You Can

Work an honest job with lousy pay? Go crawling back to your parents? Or would you do what Frank Abignale did? fly all over the world and cheat banks out of millions of dollars.Catch Me If You Can tells the incredible true story of the kid who became one of the most wanted con mans in American history. Starring Tom Hanks and Leonardo Dicaprio this is a slick, good looking, and intelligently funny movie that ranks up with some of Steven Spielberg's best work.Frank Abignale (Leonardo DiCaprio) lives what would seem like a perfect middle-class life, but when his father is convicted by the IRS for bank fraud things start to fall apart. His parents file for divorce and he has to choose whose custody he is going to be put in. So what does he do? he runs, and with high intentions of getting his family back together, after all isn't that what every kid wants? Frank went from forging fake cheques to eventually becoming a co-pilot for PanAm American Airways, a supervising MD, and assistant prosecutor, by the end stealing up to 5 million dollars. For a time he thought he was untouchable, but FBI agent Carl Hanratty (Tom Hanks) is keen to put him behind bars, and so the story of the cat and the mouse begins.While the two are hardly on screen together they do share an amusing relationship. The cat and mouse are two very different, but also very similar creatures. Both had lost families to a divorce and as much as they wish they could have it back they both realize that you have to grow up. DiCaprio pulls of the best performance since ""What's Eating Gilbert Grape"", another recommendable movie. Tom Hanks excels exceptionally well as the uptight agent in heavy pursuit of the criminal and Christopher Walken plays the very good optimistic father figure.One thing I found ridiculous was Steven's depiction of how easy it was to get a job in the 60's. Frank would simply observe the terminology of various occupations presented in movies and perform them in the facility where the practice is conducted. This gets me thinking of how much of this movie is actually fictionalized.However in spite of that this is still one the most outrageous, scandalist, funny stories I have ever seen, and what makes it even better is knowing that it actually happened.

397,DarrenHorne,"Charming film, with superb performance by Walken",8,7 March 2005,"From 1963 to 1969 Frank Abignale Jr made the FBI ten most wanted list by performing awe inspiring confidence scams and stealing millions of dollars by forging cheques.Catch me if you can tells the story of teenage Frank (Dicaprio), as he flees a broken home and sets off to gain enough money to rebuild his family. Frank sees the respect that certain professions command and manages to successfully pass himself off as a Pilot, Doctor and a Lawyer, (all, in part, to impress his father). He soon gains the attention of FBI agent Carl Hanratty, (Hanks) who hunts him for years and gradually develops a near fatherly fondness for him.Dicaprio gives an outstanding performance that firmly establishes him as perhaps the finest actor of his generation. He perfectly blends a charismatic, cocky teenager with deep down fragility and emptiness that was caused by his parents split. The gut wrenching choose a parent scene strikes home to all of us how traumatic a parental divorce must be. The character development is spot on, from goofy teen to a worldly con man that can no longer distinguish between truth and fiction.Hanks does well, playing a bookish FBI everyman with a touch of a sinister 1950s man in black. However Christopher Walken, as Frank's father, is superb and lifts the father son scenes from over sentimental Spielberg tosh, to highly charged and touching encounters. An award worthy performance that will have you blinking back the tears.The delightfully nostalgic opening credits set the tone for this charming film that is genuinely heart-warming and fun. The trailer is misleading as this is not fast paced chase film, but a dark, character driven, true story that will have you hooked from the first few scenes. Dicaprio oozes charm, whilst at the same time showing a vulnerable, lonely side that will have you routing for him every step of the way. It is possibly 20 minutes too long, and it feels as though the last few scenes were tacked on at the end. However the end scene pulls the whole story together and gives the film a completeness that will have you smiling as you leave the cinema. An engaging and touching tale about a boys wish to be part of a family.",Catch Me If You Can

A hack script, Halmark-inspired score and sloppy editing render this potentially gripping movie slightly below average even as brainless entertainment. After a promising turn towards artistry and adrenaline in Minority Report, Spielberg seems to have slid back to his comfort zone of shlocky emotionally manipulative made-for-tv crapolla. While the moral ambiguity and basic plot are nonetheless interesting, seeing the stellar performances by Christopher Walken, Tom Hanks, and Leonardo DiCaprio (--who, despite a slight air of inappropriate cynicism seems to have finally recovered from his Titanic fame and returned to his roots as an emotionally gripping actor--) and the absolutely fascinating true story of Frank Abagnale Jr. rendered into 24 carat shlock is a truly unforgivable con-job. With a trendy wave to non-linear narrative Spielberg also guts the movie of any adrenaline value by revealing the outcome of the story in the first three minutes of film. In perhaps the greatest travesty of all, the natural humor of the story is exploited to the extent that it is about as subtle as a fart in an elevator.",Catch Me If You Can
399,jmcsween90,Great director doing what he does best,8,8 March 2003,"Although his ventures into sci-fi in recent years turned up interesting results, Steven Spielberg has in this movie returned to more conventional story telling and the end product is a mouth watering feast of cinematic thrills. The film is based on the true life story of Frank Abignale Jr. (Leonardo DiCaprio), a teenage con artist and fraudster who becomes the youngest ever person to wind up on the FBIs most wanted list. Having seen his parents seemingly perfect marriage crumble following his father's troubles with the IRS, DiCaprio enters a self destructive fantasy world when he turns his attention to forging cheques and impersonating airline pilots. Soon the Feds become aware of his illegal activities and Agent Carl Hanratty (Tom Hanks) picks up the scent.In an effortless two hours and twenty minutes, Spielberg uses his considerable talents to weave an atmospheric and exciting tale of cat and mouse as DiCaprio always remains just one step ahead of the determined FBI agent pursuing him. Slowly the noose tightens around DiCaprio's neck, but not before he has a chance to defraud millions of dollars and successfully trick his way into a variety of jobs he was unqualified to do. As his increasingly sophisticated exploits land him in greater trouble, he finds himself further and further removed from reality and he is left with no one to trust and no where to go but to keep on running. With meaningful relationships destined to end in tears, he develops a deep rapport with the only person who has any understanding of him  his pursuer Tom Hanks.
Catch Me if you Can' confirms yet again that Spielberg has no peer when it comes to making purposeful popcorn entertainment. He can thrill and audience without ever sacrificing the twin pillars of strong scripting and good acting. DiCaprio excels as the charming con man, while Hanks' measured performance as the dogged FBI agent is an effortless turn that once again reconfirms his status as one of Hollywood's most capable leading men. In the midst of the battle of the big names, special mention must go to the great Christopher Walken as DiCaprio's father who steals every scene from the big boys. An exuberant jazz score from John Williams and a sumptuous production design that captures all the design flair of the period adds icing to this most enticing of cinematic cakes.",Catch Me If You Can

I love the fact this was based on a true story, and that Frank Abagnale Jr. was able to successfully beat our corrupt system at its' own game.However, the movie omitted a lot of events the book detailed. Such as Abagnale being asked to fly the airliner briefly, while the pilot went to the lavatory. Good thing Frank knew better to switch on the autopilot, while he was away. And being asked to deliver a newborn baby, while posing as a doctor. He was very fortunate an experienced nurse was nearby, that day. Despite Spielberg's aversion to sexual matters- the book clearly places Abagnale's exploits with women nearing 50 encounters. I admire anybody who can live this way, and not catch anything.Frank W. Abagnale, as a real-life pretender of sorts- illustrates what every young man's secret fantasy world craves; the ready ability to change and adapt to your surroundings. I applaud Abagnale's clever ability to ""socially engineer"" himself so convincingly, at such a young age. Frank's message to me was clear; dress like how you wanted to be treated. I envy the fact he got away with this kind of crime in a day where it was easily perpetrated, and hard to detect. Those days are long gone.

DiCaprio is great as always and his character is so clever and likable, that you just want to see how he cons ""the system"" next. The cop chasing him is Tom Hanks. He has a goofy accent, but he is still also likable, even though he gets really obsessed with catching DiCaprio. Christopher Walken is also there for a few scenes as Leo's dad, and he is great as always.What makes this movie even more amazing, is that it's based on a true story.It may seem a bit shallow, since it is basically just one man conning the system in creative ways, but it is very entertaining.10/10",Catch Me If You Can

Steven Spielberg's unpredictable story idea together with Tom Hanks raw talent make an Oscar worthy combination.I had always wanted to watch this flick ever since I read about it back in 2002. I never came across any of it's television broadcast. So finally out of frustration I bought the DVD. Catch Me If You Can is about a character called Frank Abagnale Jr played by Leonardo Di Caprio, who starts cheating on people and in the course of time becomes the biggest conman of USA. Carl Hanratty (Tom Hanks) is an FBI detective who is determined to put an end to Abagnale's activities. After being duped by Abagnale at a hotel, Carl gets an idea about the perfection of Abagnale in duping people.Every actor in this movie is flawless.

This movie is good, no doubt about it! I especially loved the sixties feel, very neatly captured by Spielberg. Leonardo is Leonardo as we know him, doing what he does best. Hanks is perfectly cast, and I was surprised that his face didn't bother me once, as it usually does.The story is intriguing and the tempo of the movie is high. Christopher Walken steals the picture with his exceptional performance.The father-son theme of the movie actually works very well which is a rarity for this kind of film.I would rate it 8/10, but (being a European) the depiction of the French police takes one point off the score. However the Music by Frank Williams, and the intro (which captures the spirit of both the film and the sixties) gives that point back.One could argue that the film idealizes Abigales criminal career, and that the morale of the film is, that as long as you do something good, everything will work out for you  even if your special talent is crime. However, as this film is based on a true story, and since movies in my opinion are not supposed to lecture or mould the viewer, I stand by my 8/10 (even though the movie is not breathtaking, it's a tiny bit more than just professional work).",Catch Me If You Can
418,darrell-garrison,What a team!,8,19 January 2003,"Steven Spielberg has brought Tom Hanks and Leonardo DiCaprio together in what could have been a small film, but becomes great entertainment in the hands of these masters!  One of my favorite things about this movie is something I didn't even notice until towards the end-- Spielberg adds his unique touches ('Spielbergian') without overwhelming the film.  His restraint and professionalism truly shine here.  Hanks is excellent as always, and DiCaprio continues to show his growth as a fine actor.  It's only a matter of time before he wins his Oscar in the right vehicle (this isn't it).  I saw 'Gangs of New York' and 'Catch Me If You Can' within a week of each other.  I would easily pay to see this film again, but not the other (even though 'Gangs' is quite good.  And by the way, this film is much more re-watchable than Spielberg's other film this year, 'Minority Report'). This movie has a great 60's sheen to it.  I hope it gets an Oscar nomination for Best Costume!  The audience I was with enjoyed this bad-boy-on-the-run caper, rooting for him vociferously.  And what makes it so special is that it's based on a true story.  This film makes me want to read more about Abagnale.  I recently saw an interview with him, and he stated that the movie correctly captured the essence of what his life was like then; that's as high a compliment as is needed.  I had a feeling that the real Abagnale had a cameo somewhere, and I was right.  In reading the credits he shows up as a French police officer!  For the films that were released in 2002, there are only two that I can universally recommend to ANYONE.  'My Big Fat Greek Wedding', and this movie.  'Greek Wedding' would get a slightly more vigorous nod because of a bad swear word said by Hanks in this that might offend some; but it was the FUNNIEST line of the movie!

Leo did an okay job, but I found Hanks grating (not to mention the fact I spent most of the movie trying to figure out why his name wasn't O'Riley, the FBI agent in the book). Walken was good, but I found his character to be very much unlike the man depicted in Frank Abagnale's book.
I was sorely disappointed that the green baby/blue baby joke wasn't even mentioned!Plus it distorted the whole image of why Frank did the things he did. He, himself, admits that his father's financial troubles were a factor in his actions, but if I remember correctly, he stated much of what he did was hormone-driven -- ie. his affinity for women.Instead of spending $8 on the film, spend $10 on the book and wait for the movie to be shown on TBS in a few years.",Catch Me If You Can

This movie although funny and engrossing tends to remind me of just how much we assume things in our daily lives.I found myself going to the doctor a few days later and thinking to myself ""what if one of those nurses came out without that white coat on. I mean is the fact they have the coat on that makes you think they're a nurse or the fact they came from behind that door. What I loved about this film and in fact the whole thing was this kid actually did all these things for so long just because people took for granted he was who he says he was.
I have talked to some people who work at hospitals who tell me they wear the white coat not because they are required to but because people give them less problems when they do. I talked to several nurses who told me when they don't have their whites on patients have actually screamed and harassed them out of their rooms cause they though they weren't real nurses and were there to kill them. Cops too, I spoke to several cops who said that when they are off duty people don't stop for them even when they flash their badges. One told me he has actually had several people get off cause they told the jury the badge looked fake, and he didn't look like a real cop. Also several people who have worked at banks tell me they have seen the real guy before as he did several educational films for various banks about how to spot bad checks. Apparently he really was that original when he was young, and after he was caught banks changed security procedures for good.  Not many criminal can say their actions changed a industry, much less now work for the industry as experts. These days people a allot more jaded then when these events took place and people have a more inquisitive nature. But as 9/11 showed us things are still not perfect if really better at all. My favorite scene in this film is when he becomes the head of the department at the hospital. The two doctors look scared and all he does it what he saw on TV. I think he was watching General Hospital or something, but I am not sure. I like the acting in this film especially Walken, Hanks character was really drool but from what I heard in interviews, that was the way the guy really is. Leo does well in this as usual. The film is well paced and believable. People can argue about all the things in this movie that are wrong. To me though this movie is about a kid who wants to help his father so he can get back with his mother and they can be a family again. Once he realizes he has gone to far, he keeps going and does what he can to go on with his life. He had one h*ll of a ride though and he knew it. It is a good story that is well told and well acted.

431,jansen-aui,Entertaining throughout,8,17 June 2006,"Few directors can lay claim to as much diversity as Steven Spielberg  he's shown us every now and then with his ability to produce two films of starkly contrasting tone in the same calendar year. Most recently, 2005 saw Spielberg deliver the spectacular alien-invasion blockbuster War of the Worlds followed closely by the somber Best Picture nominee Munich. In 1993, it was the one-two punch of crowd-pleaser Jurassic Park and the uplifting Best Picture Schindler's List. 2002 was another year of achievement for Spielberg  after wowing audiences with the thought-provoking sci-fi thriller Minority Report, they were treated with the light-hearted, thoughtful, and endlessly fun Catch Me If You Can.Set in the 1960's - in New York initially but spanning all the way out to France - Catch Me If You Can tells the tale (the film opens with ""inspired by a true story"") of Frank William Abagnale Jr. (Leonardo DiCaprio), a fraudulent con artist who had successfully posed as a teacher, a pilot, a doctor and a lawyer, stolen millions, and gotten away with it, all before his 19th birthday. Throughout the entire three-year episode, detective Carl Handratty (Tom Hanks) is the FBI agent who gives determined chase, setting up a cat-and-mouse affair where Frank always seems to be a step ahead, but who more than once offers to give himself up to the agent he forms an interesting dependence on over time.What seems a simple premise is taken beyond that by a clever script and assured direction. The two leads are cast wonderfully, DiCaprio as the youthful con artist who seems to revel in the thrill of just getting away with things but who can in a moment snap into loneliness and yearning, and Hanks as the all-too-serious agent who loves to mess with Frank's mind. The supporting cast, too, give excellent turns but it's Christopher Walken who stands out as Frank Sr.- his sad, unfulfilled eyes speak tomes of the emotional struggle he's been through and the shaft that the law has treated him with. If there's a failing with the picture, it's the pacing during the opening sequences which establish the context of Frank Jr.'s situation - they seem to slow and weigh the movie down a little before it even kicks off proper with Frank Jr.'s first con. The closing sequences, too, serve as an epilogue that's a little bit unnecessary - Spielberg could have easily finished the film ten minutes earlier and audiences would not have been any less satisfied.It would be a shame to finish the review without touching on the technical aspects, and it's here that Janusz Kaminski's brilliant photography seems to glitter in gold, combining with excellent costuming and John Williams' score (inspired by 60's Sinatra hits and James Bond-style cues) to give a believable, immersive sense of period. Indeed, perhaps what makes Catch Me If You Can so effective is the supreme sense of amusement and fun it seems to have been made with, and that is something that's directly channeled on to the audience. There's no heavy, resonant story here that delivers an important message, but where Spielberg succeeds is in not trying to: it's a cop-and-crook flick that simply excels as entertainment, even if it's a tad on the long side for the scope of the story it covers.",Catch Me If You Can

Frank (Leonardo DiCaprio) was the greatest con in the history of the US. He decieved 12 countries and all 50 american states while running from an FBI team led by Carl Hanratty (Tom Hanks). And guess what? He did this all before he was 19.Frank was probably one of the most gifted persons in American history - even though he used his gift for breaking the law - and it was only fair that he was portraied by a gifted actor. Leo DiCaprio gets into Frank's skin perfectly with, probably, the best performance in his career. Tom Hanks is the same great actor as usual and they both make a very funny and interesting duo throughout the film. The story is always interesting and keeps the viewer attached to the end. Of course, the directing is flawless by Steven Spielberg. He returns to the subjects that started his career - the broken home - and achieves one of the best films I've ever seen. A quick special mention has to be given to the author of the opening generic - sorry for not remembering his name. He achieves a masterpiece with an animation short film. An overall superb film.

Catch Me If You Can was sat on for twenty years and then went through several star actors and directors before DiCaprio, Hanks, and Spielberg took the reins. While I have my grievances about Tom Hanks in this film, he was at least a good stepping stool for DiCaprio. This is personally one of my favorite Leo performances, an opportunity not wasted to showcase his incredible range. As for Spielberg, most critics will label this film as not one of his best, but I ostensibly disagree. Can you imagine if Verbinski or Fincher directed this? The central motif would have been drowned by overzealous desires to focus on audiences' base attraction to rebellion. Spielberg's finesse and directorial impulse control were perfect for this film. He was uniquely qualified to tackle the melancholy themes in Catch Me If You Can and have them wrapped up and presented in a beautiful, lighthearted package that was just right for the Christmas season.

442,mrow,An entertaining film,8,29 December 2002,"Just a short piece about ""Catch Me..""  (no spoilers here).  I think Leonardo C  was correctly cast. They needed someone who could pass for age 18 but also who was pretending to be  8 or 10 years older, as the featured main-character/con artist. He does look awfully young, but I think it came off ok.   The understated score was by Williams (no surprise) but was very different from other works he has done, and generally works well for the film. It is as unlike the score for Harry Potter as night and day, and does demonstrate Williams' versatility (although Schindler's List has long since put any concerns in that area to rest). I was not able to identify the composer prior to seeing his name, momentarily wondering if it might possibly be Dave Grusin or perhaps J. N. Howard or even Howard Shore.  The director is an excellent storyteller, but I am left wondering how others might have handled certain treatments.  There was good audience reaction and I would imagine it will continue to do well at the box office.  I would like to find out what the budget was, but for dart-throwing fun I would guess it at $75mil.  Tom Hanks as the hapless FBI agent-in-charge is entertaining as well, and Christopher Walken also has a good part in this.

Most of situations are credible, this could haven happen more or less this way. The secondary carachters like di caprio's mother and fathers are not much developed but that give chance to faster pace and doesn't really harm the viewer involment with the main character. We can kind of understand what pushed the situation to start and develop this way.There is also no glorification of crimes or criminal, Tom Hanks also doesn't represent a model saint cops leading a crusade against check forgers.All in one, the story of two opposite personalities, with somehow similar wound and weaknesses, a ""smart"" crime movie, shown in a fast pace story telling and realistic environment made me arrive at the end to think ""is that already finished"", which doesn't happens often in my case.Would recommend it without hesitations.",Catch Me If You Can

Featuring terrific performances from DiCaprio, Hanks and Walken the film exudes quality from start to finish. The depicted time period is captured and expressed to perfection: the sets, cars and clothes are a joy to behold at times and you find yourself genuinely lost in Frank Abagnale JR.'s world of deception. The lighting is wonderful, all sunlight streaming through windows and half closed curtains, giving the film a timeless, fairytale look, perhaps serving as a metaphor for the make believe world of young Frank as he impersonates both a doctor and an airline pilot whilst conning America's banks out of millions of dollars through bogus cheques, all before his 18th birthday. The characters are fleshed out extremely well and the reasons behind Frank's descent into a life of crime are carefully illustrated and conscientiously referred to throughout the movie.

It is lighthearted in tone (with a touch or two of darkness), breezily shot and acted, and painted in a kaleidoscope of '60s colors.  Leonardo DiCaprio and Tom Hanks get to retire their serious acting chops for a bit and seem to be truly enjoying their roles.  The supporting cast is strong from top to bottom, especially Amy Adams as a clueless naif and a heartfelt turn by Christopher Walken as DiCaprio's father.  Concerning the story, the tale of Frank Abignale, jr. (DiCaprio) is as much a yarn about mankind's willingness to trust someone who says all the right things as it is a commentary on how confidence opens doors which, for you, should rightly remain shut.  Spielberg, who has been producing heavy, ominous fare for the last decade or so (Schindler's List, Amistad, and Minority Report, just to name a few), puts a sense of magic and enjoyment into his movies that calls to mind earlier work like E.T.One final note:  it's also amazing to note that what Frank Abignale did could never be duplicated--because of Frank Abignale himself.

The relationship between DiCaprio and Christopher Walken is almost as good as the one between DiCaprio and Tom Hanks. The bond between them is not immediately apparent and it is highly unorthodox, but, by the end, you completely believe the friendship that has arisen before our eyes. The plot itself is very interesting, and I have to say that the ending was not what I expected. The film definitely delivers, and, other than ""What's Eating Gilbert Grape,"" this was the first movie that I really liked DiCaprio in. I found his work to be the weak link in ""Gangs of New York."" Hanks, of course, is outstanding once again. Lastly, the film has some very picturesque moments, such as the scene with the 8 old school stewardesses escorting the main character through the Miami airport as Sinatra's song massages our ears in the background.

461,gipper1,Slick Slight-of-Hand,8,1 June 2003,"Steven Spielberg says that his initial impression of the massive con job pulled by Frank Abagnale, Jr. was that it was all one big ""slight-of-hand"" trick - no substance, no profound evil, just somebody wanting to see how fast and how loose they can play with the system.So Spielberg does about the only appropriate thing in bringing Abagnale's story to the screen: his movie itself is an artsy, slick slight-of-hand trick. It is as full of rich color, extensive detail, and beautiful decorum as anything Spielberg has ever done. I don't know if the movie is supposed to be ""about"" anything, even accounting for the obvious scenes where Spielberg tries to hash out his strange ideas of fatherhood. He has skipped his really relevant issues in favor of a shooting-the-breeze approach - encapsulated by the fact that shooting wrapped in only 52 days, manic speed for a Spielberg picture (this is the man almost run out of Hollywood for his monumental delays of ""Jaws""). The film, in and of itself, exists just fine as this elegant piece of pop art which Spielberg has constructed, not dissimilar to the boys with toys attitude Steven Soderbergh brought to his ""Ocean's Eleven"" remake. Slinky, low-tech, with John Williams lyrical jazz ballet, it has vibrance, texture, and intelligence, with Christopher Walken and Tom Hanks stand- outs in their respective roles. DiCaprio is still a hard pill to swallow, but he comes off as at least a believably suave con man, if not a convincing one.
I suppose my one real critique would be length - the film has such pride and joy about its own carefree attitude that it is a shame to see it ramble to the end of its 142 minutes, with an interesting but unnecessary epilogue about how Frank Abagnale emerged from his life of crime to help the FBI start catching forgers not as smart as he was. A more concise display of how Abagnale moved on once the chase was over might have been in order, but that is hardly a deal-breaker.

Tom Hanks is OK, although I still can't quite figure out (a) what that accent is he's using (Boston?) and (b) where is he stationed?  That seemed the biggest continuity problem to me.  At first he seems like he's in New York or Washington, then maybe Atlanta, who knows?  Minor point, however.Spielberg does a great job telling this story and making you actually care about the characters; my only beef is that I think he could have explored Carl's family situation a little more.

Wow didntsee that one coming. If Minority Reports ending reminded me ofMission Impossible then Catch Me if you can was Dragnet.  Thenhe manages to do the most lazy straight to tv trick in the history ofcinema. Oh yeah you got it, he uses the rolling text to make surewe understand that it IS an happy ending.So while I celebrated both Minority Report and AI as good films thatcould have been great. Catch Me If You Can is not its a disgrace, ithad all the makings of being ten times better than both the beforementioned films and one of the best films of the year but hemanages to make the film ordinary with its ending.  So why shouldwe praise this movie?Speilberg is the greatist movie maker for the openings to his films,take Jaws, Saving Private Ryan, Indiana Jones (all three) and nowCatch Me If You Can and you can see a genius at work. But I find itvery hard to find an exceptional Speilberg ending since Jaws?Surely thats as or more important than the start?",Catch Me If You Can
472,ducksr,Original and flawless.,9,28 August 2004,"Catch Me If You Can, starring Leonardo DiCaprio and Tom Hanks, is an extremely entertaining film, and absolutely lovely to watch. DiCaprio plays the well-known fraud Frank Abagnale Jr., and Tom Hanks plays the FBI agent Hanratty who's chasing him, and they both deliver great performances, DiCaprio in particular. Being based on a true story, this movie develops into a roller coaster of fun, and one of the truly great films of 2002. Even though the movie may seem a little slow in the beginning, there's never a boring moment, and I have to say this is one of the most entertaining films I've ever come across. It swiftly made it's way into my top 10 movies, and I will watch it again and again.An original and great movie, with flawless acting and direction. Definitively one of the most entertaining movies of all time, it never gets dull! 8/10",Catch Me If You Can
473,camcmahon,I haven't read the book just yet - I definitely will now!,8,31 March 2005,"This was an entertaining and fun piece of film making from the ever-reliable Steven Spielberg. It is a bit of a depart from his usual full-blown and hugely epic pictures, yet this does not detract at all from the fascinating story of Frank Abagnale Jr. I was interested in this man before I'd seen the movie, and it only served to increase my interest. Although it is important to remember (as with any such film) that this is only 'inspired' by a true story and not told word for word from one, the plot is fascinating and keeps you laughing, crying and wondering until the end.Frank Abagnale Jr. is an astounding and interesting character. The real life Abagnale originally said that he did not believe Dicaprio to be 'suave' enough to play the role, but he certainly does pull it off. Dicaprio's acting is superb, and totally believable as a man who could lie to, deceive, and con everyone he met without once losing any of his charisma or charm. Hanks is also excellent, he plays the role of the obsessed FBI agent well, and also with a likable quality. The interaction between these two characters was great, it was interesting to see a budding relationship slowly build between two characters who were actually positioned against one another.I loved the look of the film. It was a refreshing blast to see the 60s portrayed in such a vivid and colorful way. The whole setting and atmosphere of the film gave it a wonderful and almost (I hesitate to use the word) 'magical' sense. This tone appealed to me much more than a darker tone might have.However, the film is rife with moral ambiguity. As much fun as it is to watch Dicaprio jumping from one place (and identity) to the next, forging checks and spending inordinate amounts of money at a whim, the film never really focuses on the morally bankrupt side of the story. The portion of the film devoted to this at the end still seems to skim over the fact that this man has stolen millions of dollars. It ends on a high note for Frank Abagnale Jr., never fully spelling out the wrongs he committed. Still, this would probably bring the whole film down, and sometimes it's fun just to enjoy a bit of escapism without being told off for desiring such things. I mean, it's hard to be totally strict and upright - you have to love it when Dicaprio's character swindles Jennifer Garner's prostitute for $400! Overall, this is a fun film and really enjoyable. Not as much of an epic masterpiece as some of Spielberg's other movies, but still a great film!",Catch Me If You Can

475,crpetersen,"Witty, entertaining and hilarious",8,1 November 2019,"Right from the opening credits, I knew that this was going to be an entertaining movie, and it was. This movie was witty and hilarious at times, and with sharp writing and non-stop action, it really delivers this story, which is inspired by one in real life, well.The story is about Frank Abagnale Jr., played by Leonardo DiCaprio, who is a very intelligent 16-year-old who runs away from home and starts pretending to be a co-pilot, a doctor and a lawyer, and succeeds in the meantime to steal millions of dollars using payroll checks. All this is, of course, not without consequences, and he soon has an FBI agent, Carl Hanratty, played by Tom Hanks, on his tail. And even though the two characters are rivals, you see throughout the movie a growing relationship between the two during the scenes they share together.The director of this movie, Steven Spielberg, is known for his epic Hollywood films, but this one feels a bit different and is a lot more lightweight, but still very interesting and at times powerful. There are scenes where Frank and his father, played by Christopher Walken, get pretty tense while they have conversations. The father-son relationship really made this movie a lot more interesting for me.All the actors did really great jobs here, DiCaprio was perfect for the role, Walken delivered a moving performance, and Tom Hanks was unsurprisingly terrific. Amy Adams, who I haven't mentioned was in this, was also great. As I said, all the actors were just great, and there's not much more to add to that.All in all, a solid, entertaining movie. If you're looking for something easy to watch, something funny, I could definitely recommend this one.",Catch Me If You Can

It was very entertaining, and I always am more satisfied with movies when they are based, at least in part, on something that really happened. In reviewing Soderbergh's Ocean's Eleven, Roger Ebert wrote:Serious pianists sometimes pound out a little honky-tonk, just for fun. That's like what Steven Soderbergh is doing in ""Ocean's Eleven.""I kind of feel like that's a bit of what Spielberg is doing here. I've found this the least thematically significant film he's directed since Jurassic Park, but that said it is very entertaining and the acting is excellent. Even DiCaprio, whom I don't normally like, was great. Even more so, I thought Christopher Walken's performance as DiCaprio's father was superb, and very much worthy of a supporting actor Oscar nomination he garnered for the role.Bottom line: 7/10.",Catch Me If You Can

DiCaprio captures the part of the con-artist Frank Abagnale perfectly, in a very believable performance. He's 200 percent on the mark.

All before he had even turned eighteen.So begins a game of cat and mouse where the teenage Frank tries to stay one step ahead of the bumbling FBI Agent Carl Handratty who is trying to track him down. The escape scenes are a lot of fun, the father /son moments between Frank and his father are filled with heartwarming drama. But it is the relationship between Frank and Carl that is special. Right from the opening scene you know Frank is going to prison but you wonder how Carl will eventually catch him. And what a scene when it comes!Walken is great as Frank Snr.Hanks's Handratty is far from his best work, but that certainly does not mean he's bad. He's just not in Forest Gump mode.DiCaprio steals the show after being eclipsed by Day Lewis in GONY. He is outstanding in the role of the supremely confident fraudster Frank on one hand, as well as the vunerable kid who justs wants his family back together. It's a shame that he will probably miss out on an Oscar nomination , because he hasn't been this good since What's eating Gilbert Grape? Definately worth the ten year wait.9/10 - Great film - Based on the true story of the life of Frank Abagnale Jr, Catch me if you can is a treasure of a movie. The action moves at a pace, without seeming to move at all, and you are drawn in a moment from laughter to sadness and back again just as quickly.

488,roses_are_red14,"Great comedy, stirring drama - well done Spielberg, Di Caprio and Hanks!",8,27 December 2008,"Leonardo Di Caprio, Tom Hanks, and Christopher Walken star in this clever comedy by Steven Spielberg, based on the somewhat-true story of Frank Abagnale, a young American con-man.I was very surprised by how much I enjoyed this film! I have never heard it praised in conversation, although I haven't heard it condemned either. It seems merely to have been released and then quickly faded into the dominant space of popular consciousness - sheer indifference. My low expectations were blown out of the water, however, as I found this film very engaging, entertaining and thought-provoking.Di Caprio, as he so often does, provides a great visual hook in this film. Don't watch it expecting eye-candy; he plays a very lost 17 year old boy for the most part, and even if he is very successful with the ladies on screen, the camera views him as the boy he is, and therefore so does the audience. His performance is wonderful, and certainly pulled at my heartstrings. The character is brazen, reckless, selfish, irresponsible and deceitful, and yet never fails to win our sympathy. Likewise Tom Hanks is extraordinarily likable as a cop with no sense of humour, charisma, or incredible intelligence. Full credit to the actors for their ability to play deeply flawed characters with perfect empathy.Catch Me If You Can is also thoroughly enjoyable for its charming visual style. The film is set in the 60s, and the immersion is complete. One of the bonuses of watching a tried-and-true director like Spielberg is that no expense is spared, and the bright and colourful sets and costumes are a great compliment to Frank's bold attitude, as well as being useful in their absence when muted down for more intimate scenes.This film is charming in its humour and moving in its empathy, and really highlighted the subjectivity of our sense of justice.

The surprises are unexpected, but logical - not outlandish.Years ago I might have felt that the depiction of the FBI agents was exaggerated, but after the current years' revelations of their activities, I find everything not only apparently accurate but almost understated at times. The two major characters are carefully and gradually revealed to us until we understand the personal difficulties Hank and Frank haveundergone in their lives, which to some extent lay the groundwork for their behavior.I highly recommend it for the whole family.",Catch Me If You Can
490,mercuryadonis,In Speilberg's world...,5,2 January 2004,"Welcome to Steven Speilberg's world, a parallel universe where nuance, subtlety and personal interpretation are non-existent.  In this world FBI agents are stumbling lead-footed stooges, wearing identical MIB suits and porkpie hats, who enter a suspected check-forger's apartment with handguns drawn, shouting ""CLEAR!"" as they stumble about from room to room.  In this world a love scene must be accompanied by items on a bedside room service cart being knocked off one-by-one.  A conversation between two secret agents must be shot in silhouette against an ominous blue background.  A police station should be as glossily lit as a top European fashion emporium.  The precocious hero must be able to escape an airplane lavatory in mere seconds, without tools, by removing 4 tiny screws.  The love interest must be blonde, the in-laws stern, the failed father edgy, brittle and possibly nuts (Christopher Walken will do).  And most of all the hero's dubious achievements must be shown to have benefited society in the long term and any of his character flaws attributed to youth, naivety and bad upbringing. After all, this is a movie and we can't have a fundamentally flawed hero or a morally ambiguous ending.  Even if the said ""hero"" bilked countless innocent people out 4 million dollars.It would be nice if just once Spielberg could depict a story or a sequence of events as they might realistically occur rather than having to plaster everything with his trademark gloss and worn-out directorial flourishes.

Not all films can be an E.T., Philadelphia, Lord of the Rings..and when they aren't it's important that they be a solid demonstration of the talents of those involved. Such is the case with this film. Cudo's, however, to Walken who demonstrated restraint from his usual over-the-top Walkenisms and portrayed his character within the story.

In fact, talking of France, DiCaprio acts that scene so naturally, you don't feel, but you understand his willingness for all this to end. The music added to the fun, Spielberg was fantastic, I was shocked that the film came out in 2002, he actually put the watcher in that 19'-something world!!! I love DiCaprio most, not because of the class of his acting, but the youth he managed to put into it. He makes Frank so young and smart at the same time!! He isn't serious, he is a smiling, loving, playboy, and he really gets the audience hunting for what his next stunt, next quick escape is going to be. Film is good, highly recommended.

495,babiedol12,Excellent Movie!,9,25 December 2004,"Catch Me If You Can is a very fine take on a true story. It brings together three of Hollywood's biggest names  Di Caprio, Hanks and Spielberg  in a collaboration that is certainly no pretender.Frank Abagnale Jr. and Stan Redding, ""Catch Me If You Can"" is the true story of Frank Abagnale Jr. (Leonardo DiCaprio), a teenage boy growing up in 1960s New York who ran away from home following his parent's divorce and made a living out of slyly and meticulously impersonating a doctor, a co-pilot for Pan Am airlines, and a lawyer. Hot on his trail but seemingly always one step behind is FBI agent Carl Hanratty (Tom Hanks), who grows to admire and respect Frank's clear brilliance despite having only met him once. Told in elongated flashbacks as Frank is being escorted by Hanratty to an American prison, Frank had cashed more than $2.5 million in fraudulent checks around the world and in all fifty states by the time he was caught at the age of 19.As if Spielberg hasn't shown himself to be the foremost American cinematic storyteller yet, Catch Me If You Can solidifies his position. This is the kind of film that reminds you of the absolute enjoyment of watching a great story in the hands of a great director and cast working with a love for the cinema that radiates from off the screen. But let's get one thing straight: Spielberg doesn't automatically make great movies because he's a great director; he's a great director because he has the ability to make great movies.

499,SWhite,Stay Awake If You Can,2,28 December 2002,"Perversely, this movie would actually have to be better for me to dislike it. As it is, it's just too boring to care about. Good cast and crew, likeable production values, no complaints there - but there's also no story, no believability, no suspense, no interest, no ANYTHING.Leonardo DiCaprio gives a one note performance in which he looks cute (whoa - THERE'S an Oscar caliber stretch, huh?) but tells us nothing about the character. Tom Hanks apparently decided to give nothing to this performance except some extra time at an all-you-can eat buffet. He's a slightly chubby cop obsessed with catching Leo for no particular reason; he doesn't even dislike Leo, nor is anyone else in the FBI apparently even interested in catching this ""master criminal.""But worst of all, Leo's character impersonates a doctor, a pilot, and a criminal attorney...and yet we don't see him get caught in a tight scrape even once. As this is a real life story, surely the real Frank Abagnale had many hilarious or suspensful ""near misses"" - so why have they all been cut from this film? Leonardo postures in costumes; Hanks follows at a walking pace (with virtually no police procedural techniques shown); no one particularly cares if Leo's character is ever caught or not. (Worse still, in the opening five minutes of the film, you ALREADY KNOW whether or not he got caught, and who (if anyone) caught him). Peg this one at ""zero"" on the old suspense meter.This seemed like a not particularly well-done TV movie, done for not a particularly prestigious network. A definite disappointment for all involved (even John Williams' score is lame).  I'd say to wait for this one to hit the 99¢ rental rack...and then ""Catch It If You Must.""",Catch Me If You Can
500,Juliette-10,"One not to miss - that means you too, Oscar.",9,19 January 2003,"First of all I should probably declare my bias - I am definitely NOT a Speilberg fan.  So when I heard the hoopla on this film - as yet another gem from the Speilberg stable I was sceptical.  However, I did find two reasons to overcome my aversion to Steve and go anyway - the fact that it is based on a real-life person (hey, it might be educational) and secondly, that it signals the end of a two-year hiatus for DiCaprio.  Okay, okay - I'm sure there are quite a few of you out there who base his entire career on Titanic - but for those of us who have seen a number of his smaller, 'indie' projects you'll know what I mean.And, I have to say I was pleasantly surprised.  Gone are the long build-ups that Speilberg favours.  Out, too, goes all of the schmaltz he has tended to dollop onto his movies of late.  And, probably best of all, he gives us a movie in which Tom Hanks doesn't cry (oh come on, name another one!). Instead we get a tightly-scripted foray into the world of grand larceny through the eyes of a 17-year old boy.DiCaprio and Walken are both brilliant in their respective roles.  Walken is both endearing and infuriating as the idealistic dreamer of a father who can't (or won't) understand why the IRS keep pursuing him for his taxes. DiCaprio, on the other hand, pulls off a double-whammy by being both enigmatic enough to be able to pull off the con-jobs while at the same time, never allowing you to forget that he is only a boy.  DiCaprio's treatment of 'Frank' is neither condescending or trite - something many actors today could learn when playing teenagers.However, that is not to say the movie is without its flaws.  The first is Hanks.  Often held up to be one of the greatest actors today, here he flounders against not only DiCaprio and Walken but against much of the supporting cast as well.  He just doesn't seem to be able to find a rhythm for his character and instead seems to be trying a different tack in each scene.The other flaw is that obsessive need of many American directors to bring psychological theory into their movies to increase the dramatic gravitas. We do not need to be told the reasons why 'Frank' embarked on his crime spree for two reasons: 1, DiCaprio has already done it for him through his sensitive, three-dimensional portrayal of 'Frank'; and 2, because the charm of this kind of movie ultimately resides in the fact that each of us find a certain appeal in 'Frank's' actions - both the audacity and the flair he shows in being able to pull off these heists. In saying all of that, this movie is one not to miss - and that means you too, Oscar.  DiCaprio was robbed for What's Eating Gilbert Grape - don't let it happen again.",Catch Me If You Can

504,MonroeSmile,Possibly the most underrated film of all-time,10,13 June 2009,"Spielberg is regarded by many as the greatest director of all-time by many, with the examples of Schindler's List, Saving Private Ryan and Jurassic Park just being a taster of his remarkable work. But for me, his greatest achievement is the incredibly underrated masterpiece that is Catch Me If You Can. Sure it didn't win Oscars ( but it was was nominated), sure it wasn't a box office smash, sure it didn't show us the horrors of the past, but it did show us a heartbreaking REAL story, of a boy who couldn't take his parents divorce, who wanted to run away with it all, and frauded the USA out of millions of dollars, being chased along the way, baffling the FBI and the world as to how he could obtain the money, fool the professionals and simply get away with his continuous law-breaking.Leonardo DiCaprio, who is regularly snubbed in acting, probably because of his outrageous good looks, is the best actor of his generation, without a doubt. His performances in Romeo & Juliet, Titanic, The Man In The Iron Mask, Gangs of New York, are all top-notch, exceptional roles that put many of today's actors to shame. Catch Me If You Can is by far his best performance.He plays the fraud Frank Abagnale Jr with such depth and realism that you feel almost intrusive on his life, like you know too much about him. We witness his confusion at the divorce, his disgust at his mother's new boyfriend, his despair at not having a proper home anymore. And yet Leo also plays the adventurous teen spot on when it comes to a certain arrogance needed to convince people he's a pilot or a doctor. Also the determination and focus to detail on Leo's face when making fraudulent cheques, degrees etc is quite unbelievable, you really feel that this kid is putting his utmost concentration into these scams because it's his only way to survive, and he's gotta keep on running or he'll go to prison. Tom Hanks, as always is on top form as a fast-talking FBI agent who lives and breathes his job, and who is on Leo's trail. Understanding of the young kids' obvious trauma at the divorce, Hanks does sympathise, but has to chase him because, as he puts it ""it's my job"".The chemistry between both Leo and Hanks is very enjoyable, for although they are almost enemies with one chasing the other, in the end they turn out to be the best of friends. The most intriguing and unique relationship in the film though has to go to Leo and his father Frank Abagnale Sr. played by the eternally mesmerising Christopher Walken. Walken's character is a man who is very proud and when he is in economic ruin he tries to fool everyone into thinking he's the successful man, however the only person he is fooling is himself. He convinces himself totally that lying makes everything better, and this is probably where Frank is inspired to run away from everything and lie his way around the world. It certainly is the case when Leo asks Walken to tell him to stop running, and instead encouraging him to stop, Walken says ""You cant stop"" and then carries on the web of lies his son has spun by asking "" Where are you going tonight? Somewhere exotic?"" referring to Leo's stunt as a pilot. Walken was deservedly Oscar-nominated for Best Supporting Actor for his performance which is really quite fascinating. The most memorable and poignant scene of the film is where Leo learns from Hanks that his father ( Walken) died by slipping on stairs. This is where Leo's talent is really shown, as the pain and anguish fill his eyes in a mixture of disbelief, anger, helplessness, plus feeling physically sick. He slams the chair in front of him, his eyes swollen in tears. But it's just his moans, eyes or facial expression that makes us feel his huge loss, it is his body. Leo's body moves in the strangest ways, almost like he is consumed with grief and reaching out in despair, all in all making it quite hard to watch. I haven't seen anyone put across that kind of emotion since the great James Dean in the 1950's. Along with the fast pace, great songs from 1950/60's, the atmosphere of that time gone by, a hell of a cast (including brief performances by Martin Sheen and Jennifer Garner), Catch Me If You Can is highly entertaining. Boasting a highly unique soundtrack, a truly uplifting storyline, world-class acting and some superb direction, Catch Me If You Can is Spielberg's most underrated and yet best work, and is a film that will become a firm favourite with all who view it.",Catch Me If You Can
505,doublechump,"God Save us from the ""Spielberg"" touch",1,10 January 2003,"I lasted about ten minutes in this ""gem"" before running from the theatre in disgust.  I'm so sick of movies that tell you every moment how you should ""feel"".  Spielberg doesn't trust his audience to make their own decisions about what they are watching.  Each and every single second is so manufactured that it is impossible to react in any other way than in the micromanaged specific predigested fashion in which Mr. Spielberg wants us to.  Perhaps his movies are meant to be watched with the sound off.  They are like panels of a cartoon.  The visuals are clear and they certainly tell a story in a clear and distinct way, but there's no room to breathe, no air on the screen.  It's like being at a Natural History museum looking at stuffed cavemen hunting a sabre tooth tiger.  Sure is pretty.  But nobody's breathing up there.Since I only saw ten minutes (which is enough for me if a movie is as terrible as this one.  The film could've turned into ""citizen Kane"" the moment I left and it wouldn't matter, the damage had been done) I can only comment on what I saw, so here goes:The title sequence:I hated those faux-sixties cartoon drawings.  Like everything in Spielberg's post-""Close Encounters"" body of work, it doesn't quite make it.  It was a cute idea, but instead of getting an artist who would really do a good job stealing from the Saul Bass school of design, he got somebody who fumbled the job, making it seem more like the cheapo animation in one of those 70's health movies like ""I am Joe's Stomach"" or something.  Even worse is John Williams score, but the less said about him the better.The ""To Tell the Truth"" opening was one of the laziest first draft attempts at expopsition I'd seen since the Ndugu letters of ""About Schmidt"". Doesn't anybody know who to write dialogue anymore?  Plus, the transition from the gameshow to the rainy sequence in France was both clumsy and non sensical. Once again, Speilberg gets a case of the nauseating ""cutes"".  Gee, French people are funny, they can't pronounce this character's name.  Gee, does everybody in the audience get that THIS is the guy that Leonardo De Caprio was talking about in the previous frame?  That fat guy who looks like he ate Tom Hanks?  By this point I had one foot aimed towards the exit.
Then we get another ""cutesy poo"" Spielberg moment when the fat guy who looks like he ate Tom Hanks has to open an umbrella inside because there's a leak. Sacre Bleu!  That's Hi-larious!Then we get another in a long list of what I like to call the ""Pinnochio meets Faces of Death"" moments that Spielberg seems so fond of.  Where broad bad comedy meets the harrowing and gut-wrenching.  Like in Amistad where first we get Matthew McCaughnahay doing his best High School Acting version of ""Mr Toad's Wild Ride"" and then we get African American slaves chained together and thrown into the sea.  This is where Leo's consumptive hacking (which is better suited to ""Midnight Express"" than this lightweight ersatz caper/chase flick) is juxtaposed with the worst accent I think I've ever heard in a movie (even worse than Leo's irish? accent in the Gangs of New York).  The fat guy who looks like he ate Tom Hanks is nattering on under that umbrella, the faceless French guys are chimpering in inaudible francois and Leo is hacking up like John Hurt in Aliens.  What's wrong with this picture?  Why is Speilberd so determined to gross us out?  (See ""Minority Report"" with its hacking of snot and rancid-food-eating scene for his most recent offense)Then we get Leo's attempted escape which of course is accompanied by the entire prison population shrieking and urging him on like the Forum crowd in ""Ben Hur"".When Christopher Walken arrives, he managed to use his own quirky acting rhythms to throw a pleasant monkey wrench into Spielberg's well oiled McMovie.  But by the time Leo was watching his parents dancing the wine stain into the white rug, and then when Walken told Leo not to hit the curb while parking (guess what he does anyway!?  Screams of knee-jerk laughter from the multi-plex crowd)I had seen enough.  I want to have my own feelings, Mr. Speilberg, thank you.  I have only to refer to ""Far From Heaven"" as an example of how to let an audience think.  Even though the movie had an arch tone and over-the-top dialogue at times and looked like a techinicolor fantasy, it never told you how to feel.  It allowed you to make your own decisions.  But I'm afraid Mr. Spielberg has morphed past the point where he'll have anything meaningful to say to someone past an eighth grade education.Yuck.  Ten minutes was tooooooo much.",Catch Me If You Can

That's what makes it so intriguing. Very good acting from Leonardo and Tom Hanks. My only complaint would be that the mother's character was a bit difficult for me to figure out. The look of the film is also just right. It stayed in my mind for days after and led me to do a bit of research on the real-life character. Apparently the movie stayed very close to the autobiography except for the father's character. His role was enlarged for the movie, perhaps to help explain Leonardo's character's motivations.

507,berkerj,It caught me!,10,18 June 2003,"Believe it or not, Leonardo DiCaprio has acted well in the past. ""This Boy's Life"" and ""Basketball Diaries"" come to mind. He couldn't miss with this kind of material. It's one of those ""how could you not like this?"" kind of movies. Such a unique story is perfect fodder for a movie. People are gullible. How many firms really pore over college transcripts and check out all those references in depth? Charm gets you quite far in this life because as much as ability counts, an employer also wants to know, ""Am I going to be able to stand this guy for eight hours a day?""Here's basically a slimy little kid named Frank Abagnale fooling everyone, essentially stealing millions of dollars, pretending to be some really high-level occupations (pilot, doctor, lawyer, teacher) and what happens? The viewer actually finds himself rooting for him. That's a combination of Steven Spielberg's directorial expertise and Leo's fine work with the script.At least the Oscar folks remembered Christopher Walken by nominating him for best-supporting actor, though Chris Cooper got the statue for ""Adaptation."" Too bad. As usual, Walken takes over the screen every time he's featured, and the performance as DiCaprio's dad was Oscar-worthy. Tom Hanks was good as FBI agent Carl Hanratty, though it sounded as if he received New England accent lessons from Kevin Costner in ""13 Days."" In other words, ""ugh!""Terrific film. Should have been nominated for Best Picture. It was the best I saw in 2002.",Catch Me If You Can
508,Charlie_Kane,Superb film making,9,8 May 2003,"This picture was recently released to DVD and I must say that the transfer is excellent. The film loses nothing in the translation to the small screen because its main strengths are its superior direction and acting. Leo DiCaprio not only appears in nearly every scene, but he carries this film with amazing, amusing and seemingly effortless panache. He portrays Frank Abignale, a 17 year old youth who, in 1963, managed to flit across the country impersonating, variously, A Pan Am pilot, a Pediatrician, and a lawyer. He also succeeded in passing over 1 million dollars in forged checks, all the while eluding the F.B.I. man dedicating to catching him, a man named Carl Hanratty, played by the ever amazing Tom Hanks. It's a rare pleasure to watch these two top notch actors play off of each other, aided by a nuanced, witty, and intelligent script. Not to be forgotten (except by the Academy)is the fine supporting performances from Christopher Walken as Frank Abignale Sr.,Amy Adams, and the luscious, amazing cameo by Jennifer Garner as the high priced hooker who gets beaten at her own game in one of the funniest scenes that I've seen in a long time. Mixing this all together in one fine dessert is the direction of Steven Spielberg. The style of this picture marks a total departure for him, allowing him to pace this film like no other. It's an excursion that I'm glad he took. Kudos also to D.P Janus Kaminsky and a totally mesmerising jazz influenced score from John Williams.",Catch Me If You Can
509,ashwinikumar170,One of the best performances by DiCaprio.....,8,27 December 2012,"Actually there is not very much in the movie to be spoiled. What the movie is about is expressed in the beginning. Based on the true story, it covers the the life of con man and how FBI Agent hunts him down. The con man is played by Leonardo DiCaprio who impersonates a pilot and few other personalities while FBI Agent is played by great actor Tom Hanks.Movie has all the elements that makes it a must watch. Even this more than 2 hr long movie, it is too much fun. It is very different from all the Steven Spielberg films that you will see. It has a distinct type of humor in the scenes of the movie, kind-of situation based.As far as acting performance is concerned, all the viewers will be amazed. DiCaprio's performance is so good that you will want for his character in the to succeed. Tom Hanks as always gives a stunner. He is a kind of actor who plays different characters every time giving the audience a variety.To sum up why you should see this film:1.If you are fan of DiCaprio or Tom Hanks there is no reason why you should not see the film. 2.If you are tired of watching movies based on serious subjects, then this will offer you something different as well as pleasant. 3.It is a "" Steven Spielberg "" film.",Catch Me If You Can
510,d500,a great movie,8,21 June 2007,"I have just seen this movie and it was a very entertaining experience.The best thing about this movie (which is easy to overlook) is that although Frank is a cheat and a criminal in every sense of the word, we sympathise with him and want him to be more deceitful. We want to consciously overlook the moral bankruptcy. That is honestly how good the script and direction are.The presentaion of the 60's is realistic and engaging. There are a few occasions where you think that Frank's ""heroics"" are somewhat exaggerated but perhaps it is understandable because he was a master con man. Di Caprio does not look 16 when he is portrayed as 16, but I guess you can't make someone aged 30+ appear that young no matter how hard you try! I did not like Di Caprio before I saw this movie but my perception of his talent has completely changed. He gives a spell bounding performance. In fact I don't think any other actor would have bettered his performance. He completely looks the character and portrays many different expressions with flawless expertise. Hanks is subdued but is reliable nonethless. The rest of the cast are also very able, be that Frank Sr or Frank Jr's would-be father in law.In summary the direction, acting, scipt, photography, everything is top-notch. The only reason I don't give it a 9/10 is because it is a bit too long and I feel it could have been trimmed about 10-15 minutes. Well done Spielberg. Well done Di Caprio.",Catch Me If You Can

The storytelling and layout of the film was outstanding.  To start with an easily recognizable game show (To Tell the Truth), and to take the movie as many places it did shows that Spielberg has not lost his touch.  He needed to direct a winner after so many draws, and he did with this one.  In the words of Frank Abagnale himself: ""You know why the Yankees always win the World Series?  It's because of the pinstripes.""  The pinstripes really wowwed me!Oh, and I LOVED the soundtrack.  This is one to bring home and listen to over and over again.",Catch Me If You Can
518,littleblackduck,Spielberg in top form,8,24 January 2003,"In the 1960s a young man named Frank Abagnale Jr (Leonardo Di Caprio) forged his way into a lifestyle that included designer clothing, girls and flying. His story is a fascinating study of how naïve the world was then and how easy it was for an intelligent man to convince people that he was genuine. Have times really changed?  Steven Spielberg is still channelling Stanley Kubrick and he delivers a dark comedy, which moves at a frenetic pace underscored by a jazzy soundtrack.  On the surface, this film looks fluffy and brainless but take a look at the way the director uses things we take for granted.  There are numerous references to Christmas in this film and forget the jolly holiday  Christmas is presented as a dark and lonely time when bad things happen and loneliness digs its claws in. FBI Agent Hanratty (Tom Hanks) works on Christmas Eve and receives a call from a guilty Abagnale, a small Christmas tree one of the only sources of light in the room.  Abagnale's discovery in France is at Christmas time while carollers sing pious songs.  Abagnale is arrested outside his mother's new home; never getting to enjoy the Christmas treats inside. The world is presented according to Kubrick who believed that the world was a thoroughly unlikeable place and people cruel and self obsessed.  This is one of the major themes in this film.  Frank's father (an excellent Christopher Walken) is hounded by the IRS and abandoned by his French wife Paula (Nathalie Baye) and remains a broken shell of a man, still clinging to the sham that is the American Dream, never realising his full potential.  His son runs away from all this pain, and running is an important motif in the film, and seeks solace through money.  An ironic film reference to Forrest Gump (1994 ) involves a banknote floating in front of Tom Hanks reinforcing thematically that this race is for money, not fulfilment or spiritual comfort.  Hanratty is just as obsessed as Abagnale and that the two should end up together is one of the film's strongest metaphors.  Spielberg does not show us the whole story.  He cuts and jumps and never gives us the full picture  what is left out is just as intriguing as what is shown.  There is resonance in the gaps and silences in the film and the symbols further enhance the ride.  Lots of this film takes place in temporary accommodation such as hotels and rented apartments.  Hotels being the symbol for transience and impermanence, the rooms are filled with trolleys of half eaten food, consumed alone, and the family home is broken up by debt early on in the film.  Everyone in the film is eager for something greener  the young girls duped into becoming stewardesses, the naïve Brenda (Amy Adams) who is manipulated by parents and lovers alike and Hanratty himself, who is searching obsessively for his Holy Grail in the form of Abagnale.  Hanratty never tries to understand Abagnale and even mispronounces his name.  He is a loner who has no time for people only results.The score by John Williams (unlike his usual stuff) enhances the film and there are some very clever credits, which reinforce the feel of the era. There are sloppy errors in the production design, which are annoying, but the look of the film is one of its biggest assets.  Spielberg uses period camera angles and editing and the photography is a delight.  Janusz Kaminski knows his way around a camera and uses it to tell a story, to characterise and to make subtle points.  An example is when Frank Jr meets a young woman in a hotel corridor.  The camera focuses on the shoes of each character. Shoes in themselves being sexual symbols gives the scene much more resonance that if it were conventionally filmed.Spielberg has certainly grown up as a director.  AI (2001) was a great film. That the general public didn't get its cynical take on humankind says a lot about how audiences see movies and how they are manipulated to accept the trite and the banal.  Minority Report (2002) was a dark, brooding satisfying film and Catch Me If You Can while not as cerebral as the previous two, still does not fail to entertain and to please.

520,robertpanek2001,The Captain Sinks The Ship,1,10 January 2003,"I love a good ""con"" flick and when I read about the exploits of Frank Abagnale recently in the prerelease publicity for this movie I was psyched to see this flick. Hey, it even has Steven Spielberg directing with a huge budget!The story as it was told in the publicity for the movie left me filled with anticipation because I could not understand how a teenager could do what Frank Abagnale is reported to have done, and after watching ""Catch Me If You Can"" I still don't know how he could have done what he is supposed to have done.Obviously this is a big problem, and the problem exists because Spielberg does not understand how Abagnale could have done these otherworldly things.
Spielberg took the lazy way out; he decided that because the events are supposed to be ""true"" (hey the FBI says they are!) he as director was under no obligation to convince us.Wrong!If you want to see a great ""con"" flick see the film masterpiece known as ""The Sting"". That was not ""based on a true story"" and thus George Roy Hill understood that for the film to work he had to make us believe that Redford and Newman could pull off such a caper and he succeeded so well that under repeated viewings we have no doubt that these two could both devise such a plot, find the ""talent"" to do the job and lead them successfully to the end.In ""Catch Me If You Can"" Tom Hanks playing the FBI agent who tracks Abagnale around the country and in Europe (though he apparently went to South America as well and Spielberg or not South America never seems to fit into the budget) asks Abagnale to the very end how he passed the Bar exam to be an attorney in Louisiana.We never get a believable answer. After 2 hours and 22 minutes we don't know how a teenager could work as a doctor in a hospital (and in a supervisory capacity over other doctors no less!) or become a prosecutor (!) in Louisiana.What you will get though is all the ""big budget Spielberg"" that you could expect along with all the other Spielbergisms that you are familiar with.

525,devon_bolen,How have I waited so long to watch this!?,9,1 September 2021,"""Dear Dad, You always told me that an honest man has nothing to fear, so I'm trying my best to not be afraid.""Set in 1963 New York the plot is centered around Frank Abagnale Jr. (a name I now feel like I've heard more than my own) played flawlessly by America's sweetheart Leonardo DiCaprio. Frank is a kind hearted and extremely tentative kid who shares a very close relationship with his father (Christopher Walken). Who's entanglements with the IRS instills an anti government mentality in his son at a very young age. After being hassled by some bullies at school Frank impulsively begins impersonating the substitute teacher. After evading repercussions for over a week Frank discovers he has a pension for imitation. Young Frank's world is shattered when he learns that his mother is having an affair and subsequently files for divorce. Not knowing how to cope he runs away from home. And from that point on never stops running.Having observed firsthand his fathers financial struggles Frank decides the 9-5 life is not for him and begins writing a series of counterfeit checks, at first just to pay for room and board. But it doesn't take long before he realizes just how profitable it can be. Thus Frank Jr. Commences his life of imitation and forgery. All the while being pursued by FBI agent Carl Hanratty played brilliantly by Tom Hanks (complete with New Yorker accent). Who quickly becomes obsessed with catching this kid that seems to be one step ahead of the government at every turn.Watching the evolution of Carl and Frank's relationship is the real crux of the film. From contention and animosity to mutual respect and finally friendship. Catch Me If You Can perfectly hits all the right emotional notes without ever crossing over into cheesy territory.This is in large part due to the stellar performances. Leo brings such a charisma and ethos to the character of Frank that you just can't help but root for this guy; no matter how twisted his lies become or how illegal his exploits spiral. Christopher Walken is equally exceptional and his loyalty to his son above all else is particularly affecting. You can see it in his eyes he knows his son's lying to him, but it doesn't matter. Like he tells Hanratty ""I'll never give up my son."" Because despite making some questionable decisions he and the audience know Frank Jr. Is not a bad guy and his desire to provide restitution for his father is a noble goal, even if his methods are unorthodox.The real fun of the movie comes from watching Frank narrowly avoid escape and ensures the plot never edges towards becoming played out. Watching him go from airline pilot to doctor to lawyer in a span of months is just pure entertainment. And leads to some truly hilarious scenarios. From confidently addressing a jury at a preliminary hearing that isn't actually present, to being called to the ER for surgery and promptly slipping away to the janitors closet to vomit. This is definitely one of Spielberg's funniest movies. Although The Terminal proudly wears that crown in my book.Catch Me If You Can is a supremely entertaining piece of cinema and one I'm ashamed it's taken me this long to watch. It's a feel good movie in all the right ways with a truly satisfying ending. I'm just going to pretend I saw it back in 2002 because like Carl tells Frank, ""Sometimes it's easier living the lie.""",Catch Me If You Can

Hmmm. Anyway, the movie was quite boring. If you have seen the trailer (which was good), you have seen enough. It is always very suspicious when the most interesting part of a story is, that it is based on a true story. The movie gives everything away in the first five minutes and has nothing to add in the following two hours. Camerawork, production value, design, acting - all very high standard, but the movie lacks a heart. Maybe that's because Spielberg was originally producer of this flick and had to jump in to direct it at the last second. It had some nice parts, I smiled sometimes and the characters are sympathetic. But it has big dragging holes in between and it's repetetive. All in all it looks like a rough cut and maybe it would have been better, if they took out another twenty five minutes. Well... maybe not. I gave it a six (out of ten).",Catch Me If You Can

I did not believe him as a street thief in Gangs of New York for a second, but he pulls the con as Frank Abagnale rather well, considering the fact all he had to do for a third of the movie is smile and look pretty. Christopher Walken - God I love him - looked like he was reading cue cards for part of this film, but he played the frailty of Frank's dad damn well. Tom Hanks was probably the better of the three, as the FBI agent chasing Frank but his role seemed almost for comic relief. The scene stealer here I thought, was John Williams' pseudojazz score. The music reminded me of those 60s cop shows, but with a quick tempo to remind us that this is, after all, a chase movie. With bright washed out lights, the cinematography lent a dream like quality to the atmosphere, but in reality served to tell us that this is just Hollywood fluff.",Catch Me If You Can

But nothing more than that. I think diCaprio gives a satisfying performance-the best his limited range allows. He's very charming and likeable. Hanks on the other hand, who even would get an Oscar nod for playing a dead body, is wasted. I have never been a fan of his acting (highly overrated) even though he had great movies (since he can choose from the best material, it's no wonder). The one who shines here is Christopher Walken, with the only touching performance in the entire movie. He provided the needed depth and delivered a character description nobody thought he would be able to do (after all his maniacs-roles). His Oscar-nomination in the supporting category is well deserved. I hope he will win after Ray Liotta (""Narc"") and Dennis Quaid (""Far from heaven"") got neglected by the academy.

All the while, he is being pursued by FBI agent Carl Hanratty (Tom Hanks), whose dedication to catching Abagnale borders on obsessive.While the main focus of the film is on Abagnale's genius for defrauding the government, deceiving just about anyone with whom he comes into contact, and the ensuing cat and mouse game with the FBI, it also allows us a glimpse into the underlying roots of his deception.  His father Frank Abagnale Sr., portrayed with great depth and sincerity by Christopher Walken, has a penchant for deceit himself but when his business and marriage fall apart it ignites his son's strong yearning to restore the life and family they once had and ultimately his ambitious yet perilous journey into high stakes fraud.There are times when the plot seems repetitious and predictable, and therefore robs this film of becoming a first rate thrill ride.

It's an interesting, light-hearted look at the true story of an extremely clever con artist, and full of great performances. Christopher Walken shines as Frank Abagnale Sr., adding an honest, bittersweet quality to the movie, and his relationship with his son made for the most moving scenes of the film. Tom Hanks has the perfect dry wit in his role of Carl Hanratty, and his portrayal of the somewhat nerdy, striving foil to Leonardo DiCaprio's smooth character created a lot of comedic moments. And of course, Leonardo DiCaprio is amazing as the lead character, Frank Abagnale Jr., as he is in all of his roles. He really lets us see the humanity of the character and why he was the way he was, as well as does a great job in a more comedic role, different from the dark ones he usually tends to take on. He's the perfect mixture of suave, boyish and troubled that this character needs to be believable, and he pulls it off amazingly.In brief, this movie is something really different and incredibly interesting. Frank Abagnale Jr. is a fascinating, intelligent man with a true story that is both funny and full of real emotion, and these actors and director take it into their hands in the most perfect way.

Catch Me if You Can does *none* of this.  The story of a young man with incredible talent who puts himself in unbelievable situations all searching for some kind of cosmic truth.

The years go by and we get older, and your watchlist grows. At least that is the case with mine. Ever since I joined IMDb I have added some films that I saw to my watchlist. Although I do admit sometimes I forget to add films that I already saw. So far during my lifetime I have watched over 1400 movies if not more and I can tell you with confidence that this film is not something that is going to disappoint you. Retrospectively, 2002, seems a long way back.. I tend to get nostalgic from time to time; if most of you would know my age you would probably say I am still very young for that.. However, I cannot forget the joy some of these films like CMIYC gave me and the feelings that it conjured up in me as I was growing up and good vibes. Catch Me If You Can ensures that the viewer is experiencing never ending excitement, thrill, and pure entertainment. This is mostly due to the fact that the script is extremely well written and tailored immaculately to the characters, and it all becomes realistic. The performance by the three major actors Leonardo DiCaprio, Tom Hanks, and Christopher Walken is truly off the charts. You know when sometimes you have a movie or TV-show where the cast just fits exactly like a puzzle? Well, I do and these three are meant to be on screen together as it is in Catch Me If You Can. In this film Tom Hanks is persevered,Christopher Walken is Mysterious as usual, and Leonardo DiCaprio.. the lad who is an adventurer.I do believe Hollywood should aim to go back towards making movies like this, I personally despise the fact and find it vile that we have all these supernatural, fantasy, space movies. I was never really a fan of Star Trek or any other 'battlestar galatica' movies...and hopefully, someday they will indeed produce films that are of such quality as CMIYC.If you have not seen this movie yet...then waste no more time searching for another film to watch this December, or on this Sunday afternoon... and if you already seen it then you know how it is good and the environment which it should be watched in. To make it ideal...I usually get some wood logs from outside, put it in the Fire place, get a hot chocolate, some popcorn/pistachios and lay back in your usual seat on the couch. For me it just matches the movie to watch it during the winter season... and if there is snow outside and you can hardly see out from your windows then you know its time.I know that I did not provide any details to the plot or described what the movie is about, but I hope I got you into the zone of having a relaxed afternoon and I shared true honest feelings with you about how I feel when I watch movies.Thank you so much for reading this 'review', (More like a 5 minute monologue) BD.",Catch Me If You Can

It begins when Frank's mother and father get a divorce after his father gets in trouble with the IRS, Frank enters his crime spree in the hopes of gaining a fortune and getting his parents back together. He attracts the attention of FBI agent Carl Hanratty (Tom Hanks), who organizes a manhunt after the teenager. This movie balanced the lighthearted absurdity and the dark reality of the situation, so that the audience transitions back and forth between chuckling with amusement and holding their breath with apprehension. With Frank Abagnale Jr being a genius young criminal evading the law, and Carl Hanratty being the serious, dedicated FBI agent trying to stop him, the viewer finds themselves rooting for both characters in the game of cat and mouse. Both Carl and Frank can be likable and despicable, smart and dumb, right and wrong. Their portrayal by actors Leonardo Dicaprio and Tom Hanks keeps the audience watching eagerly to the end.

However, I am pleased to say I found the film immensely enjoyable, and would class it as one of my favorite films of all Time.The cinematography is great, acting is superb, and the music is a lovely piece.Although not sounding like your typical John Williams score, the music is another fantastic delivery from Mr. Williams.

The surprise was the unique relationship of the FBI agent and the con-man in their cat-and-mouse chase they have over the years around the globe.  An engaging film that you are curious to see how it ends. That goes even for my girlfriend who stayed awake for the entire movie because she was captivated by it [Note: she has slept thru ""Gladiator"", ""Shakespeare in Love"", ""Elizabeth"", and the ""Fellowship of the Ring"" because they (apparently) didn't peak her interest].

The plot is great for a true story in the sense that you don't always know what is going to happen next, there are some surprises. It was one of the first time that a beautiful lady played by a famous actress wasn't in the action of the movie. In fact, there is none. Yes, there are many ladies, but they have little screen time and they aren't famous. So, it was a fresh aspect here for a Leonardo movie that I liked. The plot is entertaining because you're asking yourself when he'll get caught. (if you know that he gets caught) The way he fools everyone is also very funny to watch. The dates were a little bit confusing but it wasn't very important. Sometimes, some scenes are boring and you want to get to the action. At the end, you hope that it end because it's a long movie, but it's worth it.
It is not the best movie that I've seen. Live some people pointed out, it wasn't funny enough to be a comedy, it wasn't dramatic enough to be a drama. It was something unusual that could have been god, but I think that Spielberg didn't spend too much time on this movie.

546,forrest44,Fun in sadness,10,16 April 2006,"Aside from Schindler's List, Catch Me If You Can is my favourite Steven Spielberg film, in which I believe something common between us teenagers is reflected home-- fear to see our parents' divorce. Frank's life as an economic criminal began right after his parents' announcing divorce. He first did this just for living, and then the thought of reunion his family took over. Like many teenagers, Frank loves his parents so much, as can be told through the minutia that Frank wants his mother to quit smoking, but they, just like many parents, just seem to ignore this, as an only child, I can't help but feeling extremely sad about it. Each pair of parents should pay attention to this brilliant piece of work, 'cause sometimes you just have no idea about how your children love you! Frank made every effort trying to reunion his parents, but each time his father turned him down. Every crazy step Frank took was related to this purest wish, nothing seems matters when compared with it, even going to jail. His father's death made up his mind to visit his beloved mother, who was happy with her new family, Frank alone outside in Christmas, urging Carl to put him in the car not to be seen by mom, not to worry her. I just can't help laughing and crying each time I saw this movie. Steven Spielberg is amazing!

He loves his parents dearly but can't stand the fact of his parents divorcing. The only thing he can do is run away from it. He imitates a school reporter, a pilot, a doctor, and then a lawyer which eventually gets himself caught with the biggest detectives of the United States.

The film is based on the true story of Frank Abagnale Jr., (Leonardo DiCaprio) a teenager still in high-school who pulls a number stunts and gets away with millions.  With the F.B.I. hot on his tail, it is thrilling to watch over and again how Abagnale is able to escape their reach and play with them as long as he can.  We as the viewers, tend to side with this desperate teenager and enjoy the taste of another sweet victory each time he gets away with a job.  It is interesting to see DiCaprio take on the faces and prestige of doctors, lawyers, and teachers alike.  All in the span of 2 and a half hours.  Tom Hanks plays Carl Hanratty, agent of the F.B.I. and is a superb compliment to DiCaprio.  Hanks always has an aura about him of high regard, and this film is another example of that expectation.

I have read Mr. Abagnale's book and it is truly an amazing story. The screenwriter did a very good job of turning what could have been just one escapade after another into a thoughtful story of a young, smart, highly sensitive boy who was traumatized by his parent's divorce. He ran away when forced to choose between his two parents, and got caught up in a web of deception which took on a life of its own. Spielberg had to leave a lot of the details of the story out of the movie in order to more fully explore the motivations of the characters. I think this made the movie more interesting and added a serious dimension to what otherwise might have been fluff. After Schlinder's List, I believe this is Spielberg's best film. Great acting by all, especially Christopher Walken. Wonderful cinematography. The set design & costumes envelop you in the '60's.

561,Christophe44,A very entertaining movie....,8,30 March 2004,"After two science-fiction films (AI and Minority Reports) who where not exempt from reproaches but also very attractive, Steven Spielberg stays into the realm of entertainment. But, the reproaches that could be made to his precedent movies,  the extravagance  and the Hollywood tendency from these projects, are not longer there. With `Catch me if you can', we can see another facet of Steven Spielberg. He tend to be just like a young director who's searching new approaches, but with a lot of experience: the cast is perfect, the cinematographer is very good and the well trained compositor (John Williams) has the intelligence of producing some kind of new themes.Where Spielberg hit the point is in his total mastering of the Abagnale - Hanratty pursuit which, instead of being made in an epileptic manner, works more on the psychological level of the relationship. This pursuit shows the research of a missing father by a missed child who has no other way to prove his existence than to play with the law. Di Caprio shows, once again, his abilities to act the different facets of the tormented teenager, even if for an actor who is almost in his thirties it's maybe the time to change. Tom Hanks is Tom Hanks, he has nothing to prove.The only reproach we can make is the stereotyped vision that Spielberg has in his representation of the woman. Nathalie Baye is sympathetic in his French wife role, but it's in fact his whole character that poses a problem :the opportunist French wife who doesn't assume his maternal duty. This role makes us believe that for Spielberg, the subtlety is only a man's thing.

In short, its brilliant. It is one of my favourtie movies ever.People love watching movies that I call 'excites them'. To explain this, think of Harry Potter, you may wonder why it is so popular and it is becasue it excites people as they wish for that world to be true. People love to watch movies they wish they could live in or have charaters they wish to be like. Fact. It is the same with the movie Wolf of Wall Street, people love it because in a way they wish they could live (minus the consequences) the way Jordan Belfort lives in that movie (but they may not want to admit it), the different life style excites people as it is different from their own. It is the charm and wit that Frank in Catch Me If You Can that people love to watch and contributes to people loving this movie.This movie literally has everything else, wit, humour, a fantastic cast, amazing director, good music. SO DO IT. WATCH THIS MOVIE NO DOUBT.",Catch Me If You Can
569,99Tfl,Fun and Exciting with Heart to Spare,9,3 December 2018,"Frank Abagnale's exploits are the epitome of the phrase 'the truth is stranger than fiction'. So it was only natural Hollywood would want to turn his story into a film. After going through David Fincher and Gore Verbinski, Steven Spielberg took it on and delivered probably one of his best films from the 2000s, a fun and exciting caper that nonetheless knows when to tug the heartstrings.Leonardo DiCaprio plays Abagnale, a teenager who runs away from home when his parents divorce and proceeds to impersonate a pilot, a doctor and a lawyer with few people being the wiser, cashing forged cheques worth millions in the process (anyone wondering why the then-27 year-old DiCaprio was the teenage Abagnale, the real-life Abagnale was noted for looking older than he was really, which greatly aided his cons).Tom Hanks is Carl Hanratty, the FBI Agent investigating Abagnale's cheque fraud (Hanratty was based on multiple agents involved in the Abagnale case, including John Shea, who Abagnale later befriended). Hanratty insists that cheque fraud is serious to his bosses, and he will capture Abagnale eventually.Also appearing, before her rise to fame, is Amy Adams as Abagnale's chief love interest, Brenda Strong; Martin Sheen as Brenda's father; and Christopher Walken as Frank Abagnale Sr., Frank's father, who encourages his son to continue his activities as revenge for his treatment by the government owing to his IRS problems.The score by John Williams is light and jazzy, with Williams' influence from mentor Henry Mancini highlighted more than ever and oh-so-memorable. The script by Jeff Nathanson is also up-to-scratch, adapting Frank's most audacious antics faithfully while still changing some things for dramatic effect (or necessity: Frank's story is most likely so convoluted a word-for-word adaptation could never work). And Steven Spielberg's direction and handling anything but messy: hot off science fiction thriller Minority Report, he has energy enough to create a thrilling, adventurous and amazing.Bottom line: Catch Me If You Can is exciting, enjoyable, and superbly put together for a sly and breezy film that one can watch over and over again.",Catch Me If You Can

There isn't a part he can't play, and he brings out the best in everyone around him. Unlike the Tom Cruise/Paul Newman hook-up in ""The Color of Money,"" I think that this movie will be the vehicle that launches Leonardo DiCaprio into a wider range of roles.The delight of this show comes from its reality.

575,SounakPramanick,"Powerful, captivating and enjoyable!",10,10 May 2020,"Catch Me If You Can is the best example of how a great film should be made. The director of this movie, Steven Spielberg is known for his epic Hollywood films, but this one feels a bit different and is a lot more lightweight, but still very interesting and at times powerful.Right from the opening credits, I knew that this was going to be an entertaining
movie, and it was. This movie was witty and hilarious at times, and with sharp writing and non-stop action, it really delivers this story, which is inspired by one in real life, as well.We can see a teenager boy, Frank Abagnale, his father, the other Frank Abagnale and the FBI agent Carl Hanratty. The story centres on the counterfeiting checks by Frank Abagnale Jr. and on the persecution of Frank with the FBI, and especially Carl Hanratty.The film begins as Frank parents get divorced. From his father, Frank gets his first 25$ in his checking account. He starts to fake checks because his main goal is to get his parents back together and return his father's money. The film reaches a turning point when police starts to chase him. As the story progresses he begins to change the way he fakes money and becomes a doctor to hide from the FBI agent Carl Hanratty. But the police find his number and Carl phones him. Between them there is an interesting conversation and soon after that Frank was caught by the FBI.Leonardo DiCaprio was light on his feet in a way that feels very far removed from his more recent performances, taking on the role of a notorious conman whose exploits seem too impossible to be true. The based-on-a-true-story narrative is extremely well calibrated, with screenwriter Jeff Nathanson effortlessly blending family dynamics, chase-film elements, con-artistry, various love interests and side-plots, and two, off-beat, father-son relationships that stretch between DiCaprio and his dad, warmly played by Christopher Walken with twinges of sadness in-between the margins, and Tom Hanks, as the FBI agent who doggedly pursues the young criminal as he hitches free rides on planes and cashes his own perfectly forged checks. There isn't one aspect to this film I'm not enamored with, between the jaunty John Williams score to the gorgeous cinematography from Janusz Kaminiski, and then there's that amazing opening title sequence, Michael Kahn's peppy editing, and that ridiculous supporting cast.For many people this movie became one of the favorites and I know why. The plot is amazing and completely unpredictable. The actors are famous and they were selected professionally. The film definitely succeeded, we can see that because this film has now become a classic. I can't see any bad things about this movie. Maybe there were a few special effects, but I think drama and crime movies don't need that many special effects.All the actors did really great jobs here, DiCaprio was perfect for the role, Walken delivered a moving performance, and Tom Hanks was unsurprisingly terrific. Amy Adams, who I haven't mentioned was in this, was also great. As I said, all the actors were just great, and there's not much more to add to that.I also was astonished by this movie as the director shot so many peculiar and unique details which helped us to understand the personality of Abagnale. For instance, the scene when Frank comes to cash his checks and witnesses the name tags whether the woman is Miss or Mrs. for the purpose of flirting or not. Or another moment, when at the beginning of the movie the comics with Flash hero are shown just next to the Frank's bed and after that the allusion to this hero appears during the whole movie.So , I highly recommend to watch this movie to anyone who like strong movies where there are many great moments where you feel suspense as you will surely enjoy the great work of Spielberg and the perfect acting of Leonardo DiCaprio and Tom Hanks.",Catch Me If You Can

The movie is brilliant, at times entertaining in showing how our reality is partly made of paperwork and false perceptions. At other times, I found it intense and emotional in representing the struggle of Frank's father to emerge from his low social condition out into the ""little club"" of those ""who have everything"". Overall the movie is very balanced and I would not have minded watching some 30 minutes more of it.My advice: absolutely watch it, even multiple times to spot some more visual details.",Catch Me If You Can

It defiantly did not disappoint me as I was sucked into the world of Frank Abanale Jr and experienced his unfortunate and stressful life.Based on a true story, this film is about a young boy aged 17 who in his lifetime had managed to con his way into millions of dollars. Flipping easily between different jobs from airline pilots to Doctors, to lawyers. Along his way he even managed to run into a bit a romance.However, I believe that Leonardo did not play his character in a pensive way, as I think he should have. Although he is revelling in his wealth, he should perhaps be a little bit more upset due to the circumstances.It is an interesting plot line with lots of snaking twists and turns, it is unequivocal to see that a lot of thought has gone into planning this film out, but I must admit that I have seen better films.During some of the unnecessary scenes in the film I was so bored I realised I had taken better interest in the way the curtain was blowing in the wind, in contrast to the more interesting scenes where I would be literally on the edge my seat in frenetic anticipation.Overall, the film is generally interesting, and is a definite must see.

Unfortanetly Tom Hanks does exactly what he always does, act poorly. He always plays tom hanks playing someone else, he's not playing the FBI agent, he's playing tom hanks as the FBI agent. Tom Hanks AS Tom Hanks AS some character. Once again, Spielberg also is merely mediocre. He has no edge nor directorial creativity and hardly does anything but tell an interesting story in a very bland way. The best part of the movie was the opening credits which was a throwback to the classic graphics of the opening credits of the 1950 (eg. anatomy of a murder) Walken plays his role quite well though. Overall, the movie was pretty mediocre but DiCaprio and Walken make it enternaining enough for for me to have stayed awake amidst the tired work of spielberg and hanks.",Catch Me If You Can

However, fifteen minutes into the movie I became totally amazed. Great acting by DiCaprio, this part is an actors dream, however he plays it very childlike, and very believably(Amazing considering Leonardo is 28 and his character at one point is 17). Tom Hanks is very good. I was thinking on the way home that maybe a ""cooler"" actor could have played Carl (Hanks character) such as George Clooney. However I realized that Carl makes too many mistakes to be ""cool"" so Hanks fits the part. Christopher Walken does a great job. My vote 9/10. A great movie to spend an afternoon at the theater.

590,friendtalk_2000,Realistic painting of a fantastic life,9,31 December 2002,"Is this movie a feel-good comedy with a message or a character-driven drama in lighthearted sheep's clothing?  Well, it's both.  The wonderful thing about this movie is that it appreciates and celebrates the fact that real life does not fall into genre categories, but spreads into all of them, binding them together with the common thread of the person who's living it - in cinematic terms, the main character.  And boy, does Leonardo DiCaprio deliver in that department.  Obviously intelligent and creative, his Frank Abagnale, Jr. is carefree, mischievous, and always aware of the fact that he will, eventually, be caught - he's just trying to enjoy the ride as much as possible before it ends.  DiCaprio shows us the sparkling glee when Abagnale pulls off a con, the innocent ego that makes him absolutely believe that he won't be caught. then the grief that propels him onward, and a desperate loneliness that ultimately drives him to reach out to the FBI agent on his trail (played by Tom Hanks, who's been doing this for long enough that his character is automatically solid and enjoyable, even though he's technically the `bad guy').  Their tenuous and unusual relationship is one of the most interesting aspects of this fascinating movie - made all the more fascinating by the fact that it's all based on a true story.  Real life is stranger than fiction, they say, and Frank Abagnale's life is one so impossible you just might believe it.  He got away with an absurd amount of fraud and deception in a picturesque, naïve era, and Catch Me If You Can follows his adventures with the delight of a director who truly enjoys the story he's telling.",Catch Me If You Can

Frank Abagnale (DiCaprio) was fun to watch, but there was never any tension built up, and the score reflected this as well.

601,felixshreds,Inspiring.,8,6 October 2013,"This review contains spoilers. - I've watched this movie several times. I remember seeing it the first time. Being astounded by the brilliance of DiCaprio's character and by the intelligent storytelling, I directly decided to write this review.Frank is a rebel. He thinks outside the box and therefore realizes the weakness of the system. With a morally questionable attitude towards authority and routine, he decides to live a dangerous and permanently altering life. The life of a genius, however a liar - an ambivalent personality whose actions can be evaluated and assessed controversially.The story is developed nicely. Starting with a funny exposition in which Frank's unusual, yet clever behavior is shown, Spielberg continues by illustrating the inciting incident to a rare career. A divorce! This is the aspect of this movie that is the most interesting one. Divorces have become such a regular thing. Why would such a daily happening event effect so greatly on an intelligent person? This circumstance can only be reasoned by the idiosyncrasies of Frank Abergnale's character. Although his brilliance and his rebellion let him appear as an emotionally cold, completely rational person, the cause of all his decisions lays in a very psychological and emotional event. Suddenly this movie seems to be rather a psychological study on an insurrectionist, than a regular crime story.This is the point where Hanks' character comes into play. This character implies antagonism, thus adds a whole amount of suspense to the story. Let me ignore all the often discussed coincidental scenes of confrontation in this film at that point. Hanks' occurrence adds a duality to the story. And at the end, somehow Hanks and DiCaprio become friends and partners. Despite the fact that they act against each other, there never is hatred or greed in their relationship. They just play their social roles as a rebel and as a detective. It's a socially required rivalry. This is also the reason for which they are able to peacefully work together at the end. The movie documents the genesis of a rare friendship, which was used to be avoided by the existence of social roles.I comprehend this movie as a sociological study, due to the fact that it shows extraordinary characters in typical social roles, as well as social dynamics that we all know.Visually this movie is well made. Well directed, well written, well acted - but cinematically there is no specialty that needs to be pointed out especially.

It is funny at the beginning where Frank says he is dying and they take him to the hospital and he escapes and when he pretended to be a substitute teachers and calls himself Mr Abagnale and when he embarrasses the bully in front of the entire class!!!! He looks so cute as a boy!!",Catch Me If You Can
607,Reel_Time_Reviews,"Reel Time Reviews ""Catch Me If You Can (2002)""",8,15 January 2016,"Catch Me If You Can is a film Directed by Steven Spielberg in 2002""A true story about Frank Abagnale Jr., who, before his 19th birthday, successfully conned millions of dollars' worth of checks as a Pan Am pilot, doctor, and legal prosecutor.""Catch Me If You Can stars Leonardo DiCaprio as a young con artist being chased across America by the FBI investigator Carl Handratty (played by Tom Hanks) as he is chased across all 50 states in America for stealing over $4 million in fraudulent cheques. It really is a movie that you can re-watch over and over again, however although I found it very entertaining and fun to watch, like all movies it had it's flaws. Obviously the movie is an adaptation of the life of the real con artist Frank William Abagnale Jr. and the events that took place during his life when he was growing up. From impersonating a substitute teacher at his high school to becoming a lawyer just to marry a girl whom he fell in love with, the movie follows Frank's life and engages the audience by keeping them entertained. The biggest flaw that the movie had for me was the significantly huge lack of Christopher Walken in it. Although he was a very influential and important figure in the movie, specifically for Leonardo DiCaprio's character, I personally would of liked to see the majestic works of Walken more frequent throughout the film. On a more serious note, sometimes the scenes can feel detached from the Actors and it creates a feeling of confusion as some things feel less believable than others.The acting is to be applauded though, with such an amazing cast it's hard to make a movie like this not enjoyable. Most credit should be given to Tom Hanks and Christopher Walken for their characters and the interactions that they make with Frank. It is these relationships that engage the audience as they show the feelings between a struggling father and his son, along with the relationship between a criminal and the man chasing him down. Watching a young Leo cheat his way through life and avoid any confrontation with the FBI is both thrilling and entertaining as we truly get to see the retold events of Frank Abagnale on screen. We sympathize with him and understand the struggles he is going through. Leo's character is a prime example of an Anti-Hero, we know what he is doing is wrong but we don't want him to get caught because we want to see what he does next. Yet again Steven Spielberg combines a good cast, well written and entertaining script along with the magnificent music created by the phenomenal John Williams to create an exciting adventure inspired by real events. The setting of the 1960's is captured well and the audience really gets a feeling of the era that this took place in.Overall Catch Me If You Can was an enjoyable experience with a lack of my on screen time for Christopher Walken, but made up for that with it's easy to follow and engaging plot.8.0/10~Reel Time Reviews",Catch Me If You Can

Spielberg did an excellent job of developing the characters and the casting of DiCaprio, Walken and Hanks in their respective roles brings this true story to life. You are tempted to feel pity for the father played by Walken but you realize that he is a malcontent who finds it difficult to take responsibility for his own actions. DiCaprio is perfect as the charming young con artist and complements Hanks character as the FBI agent as the plot moves from one twist to another. The plot provides a great mix of drama, tragedy, suspense, humor and fantasy. The soundtrack provides many well-placed tunes of that era including the sexy voice of Dusty Springfield singing ""The Look of Love"" which in my opinion should have won Oscar for best song in Casino Royale but lost to ""Talk to the Animals"" in Dr. Doolittle - go figure.",Catch Me If You Can

That said;  `Catch Me If You Can' has got to be one of the most thoroughly entertaining feature films since, `Moonstruck.'Hats off to Steven Speilberg for absolutely fabulous direction.  Leonardo Dicaprio deserves the Oscar and Golden Globe for an unbelievably great performance as young Frank Abingnale -  Tom Hanks was, as always, truly convincing as FBI agent, Carl Hanratty - Christopher Walken as Dicaprio's father was a truly mesmerizing performance.  I fell in love with Nathalie Byer.  The entire cast, it seems, is on the same page - the chemistry is at once believable and heart wrenching.Jeff Nathanson screenplay is a beauty.  I expect we'll see a lot more from Jeff.From the opening titles to the costumes to the closing shots this movie was refreshingly original and riveting.

614,KwanHoFans,"Very fun, clever, and intellectually satisfying!",8,18 October 2003,"I watched this movie on DVD last night--what a pleasant surprise!  Well, I can't imagine any movie with Spielberg as director and Tom Hanks/Leo DiCaprio as lead actors to be anything less than good, but not having seen the trailer to the movie nor read reviews of it I wasn't sure what kind of a film to expect.  Knowing that this movie is based on real life events of Frank Abagnale Jr. makes it all the more enjoyable to watch, while I cannot stop myself from wondering how on earth he was able to pull it all off--as pilot, doctor, and lawyer.  I'm sure he must have run into some difficulties at times with his pretense, yet he must have been able to react quickly and avert near-disasters until the time he's finally caught.  I really liked his character as DiCaprio portrayed him, despite the fact that the essence of what he did was wrong.  Tom Hanks, as usual, did an excellent job--I ended up liking his character as well even though he started off being rather dislikeable.  Christopher Walken also wins high points for his portrayal as the senior Abagnale, bringing a certain dignity and believability to his character that wins our empathy in spite of his shady dealings and troubles with the IRS.  In short, I ended up liking just about everything in this movie.  It was a very well-presented story and a well-acted drama, with humour sprinkled in just the right amounts and at the right places, in my opinion.  The pace is just fast enough to keep me entertained and thinking at all times, without loosing me in any overly convoluted subplots.  Kudos to Spielberg for such a fun, clever, and intellectually satisfying piece of film-making!",Catch Me If You Can

I simply didn't want it to end and this is the main reason I gave the movie a 10.I loved the main character Frank's attitude and his brilliant way of thinking. The fact that it's based on a true story makes it even better. I had to Google Frank Abagnale Jr. after watching this and the friendly face that smiled on the pictures wasn't really what I expected.

The script certainly benefits from this.Although the soundtrack is weak, the production overall is very good and creates an eloquent sense of anticipation for the film's unfolding.But the plot is weak - there is no value in the execution of the premise.I don't understand the context of the scams at all; the scams don't have the role of surprising the viewer with the genius of the protagonist; there is no good message and drama to make the escalation worthwhile only.So it can get tiresome, or at least demotivating. In terms of the chase there is also nothing to rate above average. There is fan-service here and there, but in the end:The film has no valuable narrative purpose, does not seek to specialize in any of the areas that could make the script more consumable and interesting.Good direction, good dialogue delivery, and good acting is what the film managed to deliver to me.Finally, it can leave an unpleasant feeling by making you feel disbelieving about several things that are happening, only slightly comforting because it is based on someone's real life.",Catch Me If You Can

I thought the chemistry between Leonardo's character (Frank Abagnale Jr) and Carl Handraty played by Tom Hanks was great to watch.

634,rynostevie,Very cool,8,14 December 2002,"I just saw this movie in its first public screening at the LA Egyptian Theater in Hollywood. Going in I did not know what to expect, mostly because of the fact that Spielberg directed and because of the presence of a former distaste in the form of Leonardo DiCaprio. I have to say I was very surprised at the finished product which was very cool, very well done, witty, and just an all around good movie. I have not seen a biography film done so well since, well I guess since I first saw The Passion of Joan of Arc. DiCaprio appears to be back on the top of his game. Hanks... is Hanks. I love Hanks so I can't say anything bad about him. And of course, Christopher Walken in the role of the Frank Abagnale, Sr. There is a glimmer of Captain Koons, his cameo in Pulp Fiction, in his character in this movie, although he is very much more fun, and crime, loving. There is little suspense thriller or action in this movie, but it is more than made up for with the depth that Spielberg achieved in his characters as well as in the drama. A very representative scene of these characters is when Frank, Jr. has been caught posing as a substitute and teaching his English class at his new high school for a week before he is figured out. His parents are both brought in to the principals office and informed of his behavior as he is forced to sit outside the office and watch the proceedings. When his parent finally emerge they have grave looks on their faces as they escort him out. The mother exits frame as Frank, Sr. walks beside his son looking down condescendingly. It appears that Frank, Jr. is busted. Then out of nowhere Frank, Sr. pulls this jovial smile and the tension is released. Frank, Sr. is proud of his son's accomplishment. A very interesting relationship operates between the two for the entire movie along these lines. In addition to the screening, Christopher Walken was there for a little Q&A afterwards. Weird dude.

636,wyn_fair79,not the most dynamic movie of the season *spoilers*,7,26 December 2002,"""Catch me if You Can"" though not the most dynamic movie of the year, is definately one of the better movies I have seen for some time.  It lacks the grandeur and stunning sights of 'Towers' and Gangs' and therefore relies on the basics of moviemaking...good direction, acting, and a good story. And Speilberg doesn't fail in delivering a movie to keep you entertained for two and a half hours. However, when looking at the movie in parts, the audience is left wanting something a bit more.  DeCaprio fails to convince that he is a young boy who is running away, not from the feds, but from the failed relationship of his parents.And when he reached the point where he can no longer live in denial, you don't really feel for him.  Nor does Hanks quite earn your sympathy when he continually just misses catching DeCaprio. On the other hand, Walken manages to stir your emotions with his wonderful delivery as DeCaprio's father. Towards the end, Spielberg fails to wrap everything up as neatly as you would want.  Nevertheless, it is a movie worth seeing at least once.  It was good fun that will possibly be lost in the deeper movies and more cinematic movies of the season.  But if you aren't in the mood to see an epic film or left wondering just what the movie was about, I recommend catching the flick when you have nothing better to do on a cold afternoon.",Catch Me If You Can

The movie begins with three impostor of Frank Abagnale with Caprio being the one. Then it shows how Frank becomes a criminal by forging checks after the divorce of his parents. Frank poses as a co-pilot and forges payroll checks and succeeds in stealing over 2.8 million dollars. He also impersonate as a doctor and an assistant prosecutor. Tom Hanks plays a humorless FBI agent named Carl Hanratty, who begins to track down Frank. Then begins the cat and mouse game. The scene in which Frank calls Carl for the first time is really interesting. Frank tells him that he is sorry that Carl could not catch him in their first meet, to which Carl replies that Frank has called him because there is no one else whom he can call.

642,tieman_64,Another boy who makes believe,5,7 August 2011,"""Spielberg is both politically backward (liberal, that is, rather than radical, reaching, humane) and, like his nut-job U.S. president, totally bereft of curiosity. [] He remains enraptured by respectability, orthodoxy and the status quo. It's doubtful that enlightenment will ever strike him."" - Dennis Grunes Steven Spielberg's ""Catch Me If You Can"" opens with a stylised credit sequence, a homage to Saul Bass and the caper/con/heist/spy/Pink-Panther/Saint movie credits of the 1960s. What follows is Spielberg's version of Tony Curtis' ""The Great Imposter"" and Wendell Harris' ""Chameleon Street"", though here our hero is teen-aged con-man Frank Abagnale (Leonardo DiCaprio), an emotionally wounded kid who lies to others as a means of escaping the lies he tells himself.All of Spielberg's pros and cons are on display. Moments of sexuality, romance and swearing ring awkward or false, the film's comedy is clunky, all female characters are whores, bimbos, nitwits or betrayers, the terrifying, darker aspects of ""real-life Frank"" are ignored and the film's last act is bloated. Spielberg cheats with some of the images as well, using postcard pictures, fancy clothes, an animated intro, chirpy music, cutesy nods to Truffaut and slick montages to convey an impression of either fun or loneliness. It's all very mechanical. A collection of references rather than anything substantial.Though it aims for a breezy tone, the film's start-stop narrative is more a collection of vignettes. Spielberg's camera also rarely conveys a sense of true three dimensional space, and like ""Minority Report"", one is always aware that there is nothing, no space, no landscape, beyond the edges of each sound stage, each set-piece, each street corner or those blazing shafts of white light which seem to cordon off each sequence. Watch, for example, how small the film's street scenes are, or how closed off its airport sequences feel. With Spielberg, there's never anything beyond the set piece, a facet which he tried to rectify with ""The Terminal"" (where space and architecture become the lead character).Still, there's a lot of great stuff on display. DiCaprio's fantasy world is infectious, Spielberg clearly having fun as DiCaprio does likewise. Forging cheques, playing make-believe, living a fantasy life, these are all things which appeal to Spielberg. The film's ""real human drama"" is also handled much better here than elsewhere in Spielberg's filmography, and unlike most con-man movies (""The Sting"", ""Ocean's Eleven"" etc), Spielberg always stresses the pain (see ""California Split"") underlying each of DiCaprio's flights into white-collar fantasy (though DiCaprio's victims are given no voice). This is the post ""A.I."" Spielberg, the film-maker increasingly suspicious of himself and his art.If one ignores ""ET"", ""Catch Me"" is perhaps Spielberg's most autobiographical film (the director famously conned his way into, or rather conned us into believing that he conned his way into, a Universal Studios lot). All Spielberg's neuroses are presented (ie, a kid hiding in the fantasy world of cinema/con-artistry because his parents are divorcing), before the film eventually climaxes with Frank joining the FBI and using his powers of lying, forgery and imagination (aka his sweet film-making skills) for the ""greater good"" of America. The film then ends with title cards which inform us that Frank stopped thousands of criminals, raised a large family (all sons!) and became a millionaire by creating unforgeable cheques. It's Spielberg's own trajectory from little Jewish outcast to millionaire do-goods-man, his filmography untouchable, unforgeable, but built on lies and forgery.Some cite the film as a critique of the ""American ethos"", white collar America, and the hollow drive to ""please the father"", ""get top jobs"" and ""be all you can be"". But what the film really exemplifies is Spielberg's brand of confused, liberal humanism. The film's French authorities may be brutally indifferent, but America lets Americans act out, then, like a good daddy, rehabilitates them and brings them back home. FBI agent Tom Hanks, Frank's surrogate daddy, is after-all not a big mean G-man, but just another wounded guy looking for a son of his own. If daddy and son work and dream together, everyone will prosper.In this regard, Frank's motivations are completely ignored by Spielberg, who attribute them solely to ""divorce"". In reality, Frank's criminality stemmed from his father's own predicaments at the hands of the state (his inability to ""turn cream into butter"", as he says in the film), predicaments which led to real-life Frank noticing the disparity between America's economic reality and its empty promises of success through ""unceasing hard work"". What Spielberg's film does is bashfully circle around this truth before presenting the opposite. Here, Frank's flights aren't a means of debarring his father's problems but of overcompensating for his father's failings as a scheming businessman, failings which Frank believes caused his evil wench of a mother to leave daddy. Work hard, be smarter and cleverer than daddy, and mommy won't leave. But remember to do this within the boundaries of the state, the law, otherwise you won't make millions and have a cool job and big family. The film's goody-goody conservatism, which a better director would have pushed to parody, is epitomised by a series of conversations towards its ending when Frank reiterates that he ""didn't cheat"", that he ""studied and worked hard"" and ""passed all his bar exams"". In other-words, selfishly conning people only sidetracked our hard working, talented Frank from his true potential, from America's true ""rugged individualism"", true nature, and true work ethic. And if you do this as well, if you're an imaginative little guy who works within the boundaries like Frank/Spielberg, you too can be a zillion dollar high flier. Meanwhile, the film completely ignores the contempt con artists ordinarily have for their victims, for humanity in general, that pool of all-too-eager suckers.7.9/10 – Worth three viewings.

But I had a damn keen interest in it. Tom Hanks +Leonardo DiCaprio and you get a direction from Steven Spielberg as a topping. What better a serving can you ask for.First things first. Creativity of the movie takes you from the very first moment, when credits are shown. I mean thats what I love about Hollywood. They take their jobs so possessively. Even something as minor(in comparison to the hell lot of other things a movie includes) as starting credits are designed so creatively, so attractively, that you rarely see such stuff in the East. Then, talking about screenplay it was none the less just fabulous . You know movies of such kind..they make you feel right between those characters. You never feel you aren't a part of that movie. Such is the beauty of all the hard work, that even though watching it at mid night with college the next day,you don't feel to pause it for a moment. The guts of Frank William Abagnale are what took me by awe. His confidence he puts into whatever he says or does. Bravo to the thought improvisation in the script. And what brilliant execution.What next hit hard was the relation between Carl(Tom Hanks) and Frank (Leo).When you are an ace thief the most faithful and trustworthy relation you can and you have is with the agent chasing you.It is true and is strong. Both of you stay committed to each other yet against each other.Also, this one really shows that you are what you believe at that moment.!

The plot is established very quickly, then we are given around 2 hours of Di Caprio pulling off the most ridiculous, barely believable feats of money making while Hanks, who's character is given little background and no depth, stays one step behind. The ending is dragged out ridiculously, and gives little satisfaction.The real problem i found was that Di Caprio is on-screen almost all the time, yet he spends so much time pretending to be someone else, we never get to know his character and therefore i found it impossible to feel any emotion to his situation.After 1 hour, the film wears thin, after another hour, i was barely awake.

647,geezychrist13,The Emergence of the Greatest Actor of The 21st Century,10,9 January 2020,"Leonardo DiCaprio was all ready one of the most well known names in Hollywood. For most of the 90's, especially post Titanic there wasn't a single girl over the age of 8 who wasnt in love with him. He was the epitome of a teenage heartthrob. While his acting in such films as This Boys Life, Whats Eating Gilbert Grape, The Baskeball Diaries, and the aforementioned Titanic was to me superb, I hadnt seen a perofrmance that made me set him above his contemporaries. This was the one. He became a Man in this movie to me, shedding the stigma of a pretty boy to a truely acclaimed thespian.
Tom Hanks was a good as he always is, though i felt at times left wondering what James Gandolfini would have done differently with the role. Hanks just does what we always expect, turns in a great performance with what seems like no effort.
The Best performance to me in the Film( apart from Leo's) is Christopher Walkens. Every scene he is in, you really feel the pain that he is going through as he loses everything. I cant really express in words the emotion he evokes, but watch the scene where he is pleading in the bank for some assistance.

Every single one of them acts like a beauty queen contestant finalist from the 1970s - 80s. They are so fake. Same goes for the anyone who sees Abagnale as a pilot - who ever behaved (or does behave) that way when they saw an airline pilot in uniform? Was this added to keep the film lighthearted or something? It took away from the film as far as I'm concerned and made it feel like a average production.,Catch Me If You Can
649,ionisz,One Of The Best Biographical Films,9,6 July 2016,"""Catch Me If You Can"" is one of the Steven Spielberg's gorgeously crafted real life adaptations, along side with ""Schindler's List"" and ""Saving Private Ryan"". The only major difference between ""Catch Me If You Can"" and the other two is that this is obviously the only one with humorist moments, but not because of intended comedy, which is none, but due to one of Leonardo Di Caprio's most interesting and charming characters, Frank William Abagnale, all combined with the hilarious moments.This movie also features Christopher Walken in almost his best acting performance, as Frank Abagnale. Just like in Quentin Tarantino's ""Pulp Fiction"", Walken touches us only by saying a few words, and so, he is simply magnificent. Furthermore, we have Tom Hanks, which fits perfectly in his role. A no-sense-of-humor federal agent, devoted and implicated in finishing his task? Hanks is definitely the best choice.To conclude, ""Catch Me If You Can"" is another entertaining, effortlessly watchable Steven Spielberg film, that catches us in a lot of positive ways.",Catch Me If You Can

653,dinkaxd,A wonderful storyline & the cast,9,3 February 2018,"Catch me if you can is the best example of how a great film should be made. The famous director, Steven Spielberg worked hard to do this film unpredictable and to create very interesting plot twists. The film centres on a big lie. We can see a 19 years old boy, Frank Abagnale, his father, the other Frank Abagnale and the FBI agent Carl Hanratty. The story centres on the counterfeiting checks by Frank Abagnale Jr. and on the persecution of Frank with the FBI, and especially Carl Hanratty.The film begins as Frank parents get divorced. From his father, Frank gets his first 25$ in his checking account. He starts to fake checks because his main goal is to get his parents back together and return his father's money. The film reaches a turning point when police starts to chase him. As the story progresses he begins to change the way he fakes money and becomes a doctor to hide from the FBI agent Carl Hanratty. But the police find his number and Carl phones him. Between them there is an interesting conversation and soon after that Frank was caught by the FBI.For many people this film became one of the favorites and I know why. The plot is amazing and completely unpredictable. The actors are famous and they were selected professionally. Leonardo DiCaprio and Tom Hanks perfectly played their characters. The film definitely succeeded, we can see that because this film has now become a classic. I can't see any bad things about this film. Maybe there were a few special effects, but I think drama and crime films don't need that many special effects.Whatever you like or dislike crime films, you will enjoy this one because of it's storyline. I would recommend this film to anyone who like strong films where there are many great moments where you feel suspense. And I would recommend this film to girls who like Leonardo DiCaprio (he is so young and beautiful in this film).",Catch Me If You Can

The way he could study a crowd and blend in to a crowd that acted simpler was astonishing and he wasn't cough by the police by doing so. some negative things had happened to him in this film one of the most i would think is the entire reason he had ran away all because his parents got a divorce so he ran away at 16 and continued pretending to be someone he wasn't some of the most important characters would probably be Frank Abagnale Jr, Carl Hanratty, and Franks father Frank Abagnale.

He can play the businessman, the caring son, the loving fiancé, the player, and the pitiful homeless kid that just wants a family. I have seen this movie 3 times and each time I cried. I guess that my favorite thing about this movie is that you never really know what is going to happen next. You think you understand what is going to happen but you don't. I absolutely love this movie its got a little bit of everything in it. It has all of the things that you could ever ask for in a good movie, famous actors, romance, a little comedy, the cocky young hot guy that you end up feeling sorry for, and a great plot. Above all the most intriguing thing about this movie was that it was true. The story wasn't something that Hollywood dreamed up with their vivid imaginations.

Although I was born in 2001, Catch Me If You Can (2002 movie) is the best movie that I have ever watched. ""Catch Me If You Can"" is based on true story of Frank William Abagnale Jr. He is the FBI's consultant about checking cheques. In my opinion, I think there are many genres in this movie which are comedy, drama, and criminal. The plot is so interesting, captivating, and exciting. I cannot take my eyes off this movie for even a second. This movie keeps me on the edge of my seat because every second of this movie is enthralling. Leonardo DiCaprio is appropriate to be Frank William Abagnale Jr. He can make me believe that he is real Frank William Abagnale Jr. His sight can express emotions and feelings excellently. By the way, Tom Hanks who is Carl Hanratty makes me understand a good acting chemistry. He can get along well with Leonardo DiCaprio. The other performers are also very good at acting. Frank William Abagnale Jr is really genius, but he is still tricky. Although he is a high school boy, he can disguise himself as a man of many professions realistically. Moreover, he makes many fake cheques that are lost more than 1.3 million dollars. So, Carl Hanratty who is an FBI agent needs to catch him. But it is very difficult to catch him because of his cunning and genius. He can deceive Mr. Hanratty and avoid being captured for many times. Actually, I want to spoil more than this, but I think you have to know everything and watch ""Catch me if you can"" by yourself.

I like the relationship between son and father in the movie.

Leonardo is very great for the young handsome character as you can see from the Titanic even now he's much older from the movie but he still looks handsome and Tom Hank, I'm not wondering why he is one of the best actors. His performance is very flowing and makes his roles very interesting and observable. They make the characters look real and interesting. I saw many movies that they performed so this one does not disappoint me and especially the director ""Steven Spielberg"", he created many amazing movies whether Jurassic Park, Raider of the lost Ark etc., this one is also.

A very big role; as for the film itself, it is the same sentence: Spielberg is always one of the best when it comes to storytelling.

After seeing his mother's new family, he came to arrest him. The police said you take me away. After all, he is just a child because Frank understood early on that the world is far more hypocritical than him, but he can correct evils because he has learned how to behave.

Instead of a movie about a remarkable young man we have one about motivation for criminal actions stemming from a broken home and a dishonest father and the particularly unremarkable FBI agent trying to catch him.There is little description of how he charmed his way through cons as most of the movie is spent giving a completely false impression of his father(and hence him)or showing the plodding Hanratty one step behind him again.The characters are simplistic, one dimensional and worse dull.  In one scene as Hanratty is reporting to his boss his assistant agents loitering at the back of the office are licking ice-creams, they're dopey and outsmarted by Abagnale, WE GET IT ALREADY!I would like to be able to say I was disillusioned having read Abagnales' book before watching the movie, but I can't.

700,kdammers,An entertaining film,7,28 December 2005,"This movie is about the making and doings of an incredible con-man. The movie should NOT be seen as a biography of the real con-man (assuming that his co-authored autobiography is for real), since the interesting psychological background is made up and some of the incidents are fictitious. The movie uses a couple of framing devices to get started: the hunter goes to a French jail to get the hunted and take him back to the United States; the hunted is introduced on ""What's My Line"" ( a popular mid-century U.S. t.v. show). Then there is a flash-back to the hunted's childhood, and we watch his development into a con-man.The pacing and characterizations are well done, and the viewer is kept pleasantly off-balance by both situations and switching empathy for the hunter and the hunted.The period items (like the ""What's My Line"" bit, clothing, cars, ways of talking) do more than just ring true: they draw viewers back into that time and place.Although the film is primarily entertainment, the story it tells gives one pause more than once. What does it mean that a teen-ager could pass himself off as a professional in various fields? Was he really driven to do what he did, or was he simply a rogue?

Frank sets out reconnect his mother (Nathalie Baye) and father (Christopher Walken). Frank Jr.'s mother leaves his father because of some financial difficulties. Quickly Frank finds out that the real world doesn't come cheap and pays for his new lifestyle with fraudulent checks. Only being 16, Frank finds out that all the money in the world cannot bring back the past. Pushed by his father, Frank desperately tries to buy his parents reunion. A great true story of Frank Abagnale Jr., Catch Me If You Can shows the lengths a young man will go to in order to get back what he holds dear.Hot on Frank's heals is the smart, but often mistaken, FBI agent Carl Hanratty (Tom Hanks). While trying to reconnect his parent's lost marriage, Frank finds something he isn't looking for in Brenda Strong (Amy Adams). The two hit it off and quickly fall in love. A reoccurring color and lighting motif appears in the meeting of Frank and Brenda and suggests the possible downfall of Frank's new life. (It's always a girl.) Director Steven Spielberg manipulates lighting and color to show the glamorous lifestyle of a pilot, doctor, and lawyer, all careers Frank cons his way into. The contrast to the brightness of the glamorous appears in a drab, dark palette when young Frank's life isn't heading where he would like.Like Max in Where the Wild Things Are, Frank creates a new world for himself in order to deal with what is taking place at home. DiCaprio does a phenomenal job of creating empathy from the audience for his character. Although Frank is breaking the law, it is hard not to root for him.Frank manipulates people to get to his goal, an elaboration of something he learned early on from his father.

708,madiso08,What a great movie,10,19 March 2011,"WARNING THIS REVIEW INCLUDES A SPOILER Catch Me If You Can is inspired by the young teenage con artist and master of deception Frank Abagnale Jr. played by actor Leonard DiCaprio. This movie is about the relentless pursuit of Frank Jr. by FBI agent Carl Hanratty played by actor Tom Hanks. The movie starts out by showing sixteen year old Frank Jr. living a good life with his father Frank Sr. played by actor Christopher Walken and his mother Paula played by actress Nathalie Baye. The family runs into some financial issues because Frank Sr. owed the IRS money. Due to the financial issues the family had to move out of their house to an apartment. Paula cannot deal with all of the changes and begins having an affair with one of Frank's close friends played by James Brolin. Frank Sr. and Paula end up getting a divorce and Frank Jr. had to move a choice of which parent he wanted to live with but instead of choosing Frank Jr. ran away.After Frank Jr. ran out of money he begins to try and cash bad checks at all of the banks. Frank Jr. quickly moves up the criminal chain when he starts impersonating an airline pilot. He also starts making fake Pan Am payroll checks. This is when Carl begins to start chasing Frank Jr. It was a long chase for Carl but he never gave up. Frank went from being a pilot to a doctor, a doctor to a lawyer, and even managed to fall in love with a girl named Brenda played by Amy Adams. The chase eventually came to an end when Carl found Frank Jr. and he decided to give up. Frank Jr. was so good at check forgery that the FBI decided to eliminate his jail sentence as long as he would work for the FBI in their fraudulent check department.In my opinion the theme is no matter how long you run the things you do in your past will catch up with you and you will have to deal with the consequences. The obvious example is the main character Frank Jr. getting caught and sentenced for all the crimes he committed. Another example is Frank Sr. was committing fraud on his taxes. This caught up with him and caused him to lose all of his worldly things and his family. Finally Paula was having an affair and tried to keep it a secret but it caught up with her because the affair broke up her home which in turn caused Frank Jr. to run away. I feel like this theme could be applied to many other movies. For example The Cider House Rules, Roses father was having sex with her and he also attempted to keep it a secret. He even denied having sex with her when questioned about it. This eventually caught up to him to because he got Rose pregnant.The movie is mainly shot from an objective point of view and the lighting is mainly high-key lighting, except when Frank Jr. was in prison (the lighting was darker). The lighting really ties in with the theme of the movie. When Frank Jr. was free and living life the lighting was bright but when he finally got caught the lighting was darker.I must say I truly enjoyed this movie. Not only does the theme teach a lesson but the acting was great and the movie kept my attention the whole time. I give it two thumbs up!",Catch Me If You Can

717,tdinh,Clever and charming!,9,2 December 2013,"If you're looking for a movie that's lighthearted at times, sad during others, and charming overall, this definitely meets those requirements. I was laughing throughout most of it, but there were certainly some very poignant scenes in which the strong emotions felt by Frank, Jr. (played brilliantly by Leonardo DiCaprio) were illustrated perfectly.I thought one of the things that Steven Spielberg does a good job of with this film is providing the audience with a psychological understanding of why Frank does what he does. Spielberg gives us Frank's past and background through the use of flashbacks throughout the movie, and this really helps the audience sympathize with the young con artist to the point where you're almost rooting for him albeit his illegal criminal activity. Another thing Spielberg also does well is the emphasis he puts on how much effort and time the clever Carl Hanratty (played by the incredible Tom Hanks) puts into capturing Frank, and by showing how similar they really are despite the cat and mouse game they play.Overall, the film is great. The acting is superb, but with an A-list cast such as DiCaprio (whose baby face fits the role of young Frank, Jr. perfectly by the way), Hanks (who gave excitement and life to a potentially bland character), and Christopher Walken (Frank, Sr.) with a quick appearance by the always wonderful Jennifer Garner, this is to be expected. The charm that DiCaprio brings to his character is fun to watch as well.

Based on a true story, I think this is a good film. The plot starts from the end and jumps back to see why and how Frank Abagnale Jr. was captured by Carl Hanratty. It is the reason why the two hours goes by very quickly. The presentation is good. The opening credits impressed me and attracted me to continue watching this film. I also enjoyed watching the exciting game of cat and mouse. The cast is good as all of them acted very well. I think DiCaprio is good, he acted well and he made a lot of expressions.

Although this story lacks violence, blood, murder, and other stereotypical understandings of this genre, this film reinforces its true crime integrity through the criteria use of narrative style, the text at the finale, the explanation for the evil, and the psychological understanding of this true, blue collar crime. All in all, this 2002 film, Catch Me If You Can, directed by Steven Spielberg cleverly captures the loopholes found in the criminal justice system, not only in the police force but the Federal Bureau of Investigation, making this film a true crime reflection as well as an explanation as to why the accessibility of actual criminal minds is necessary in these judicial forces to ensure safety and justice. This film is not only well written, entertaining, and includes a star-studded cast, but it also has a deeper meaning, a real life application, and new ideas for the viewer to think about after the credible finale; therefore ultimately earning my vote of a full, ten out of ten production.",Catch Me If You Can
720,reissd2,A Great Film,9,4 December 2013,"Catch Me if You Can is a fast-past adventure, but a major departure from Spielberg's usual films involving dinosaurs and aliens. Spielberg shows in this film that he is more than capable of creating an entertaining film without the use of expensive special effects. The film is a biographical true crime film depicting the life of conman and counterfeiter, Frank Abagnale. As a teenager, Abagnale began a crime spree that would result in him cashing over $2.5 million in fraudulent checks and take on the false identities of a pilot, pediatrician, lawyer and college professor. In the film, Abagnale (Leonardo DiCaprio) begins his crime spree after his parent's divorce. When he is faced with deciding which parent will retain custody he decides to run away. Throughout the film, Abagnale uses various identities including that of a pilot, doctor, and lawyer to facilitate his check cashing schemes. It's clear that Abagnale hopes that with enough money he can somehow reunite his separated parents. Throughout the narrative, Abagnale is hounded by FBI agent, Carl Hanratty (Tom Hanks), who grows a begrudging respect for the young con artist. The development of their relationship is very believable and adds a lot of depth to the overall narrative of the story. Leonardo DiCaprio masterfully takes on the challenging role of Abagnale simultaneously illustrating to the audience Abagnale's genius (albeit misguided) and his naivety regarding his family. Christopher Walken provides great acting as Abagnale's father while Tom Hanks provides his usual great acting acumen portraying an FBI agent who becomes a father figure to the troubled Frank Abagnale. If there is one aspect of where the film fails is its failure to truly analyze the real Frank Abagnale's motives. The motivations of Abagnale are romanticized throughout the film as a young boy who naively believe he can bring his parents back together. The real Abagnale wasn't so innocent and was far more motivated by women and using his ill-gotten wealth to meet beautiful young women all over the world. This weakness is rather small and takes away none of the entertainment value that the film has to offer. This film is incredibly well acted and is a rare true crime film that deviates from the expected blood and gore of the drama usual of the genre.",Catch Me If You Can

The movie is about the life of Frank Abagnale who had a very complicated life. There is a lot of action in this movie and it's really not boring. The movie was a success and also the real Frank Abagnale really liked the movie . The movie is about a young man (Frank Abagnale) who is good at pretending to be someone else. One day his parents decide to divorce and Frank need to choose with which parent he wants to live. Frank doesn't want to make that decision and runs away. He doesn't have a lot of money so he starts to forge checks. He is very good in forging stuff so he forged his pilot certificate and became a co-pilot. The FBI discovers all the forged checks and they start to look for him without knowing who he really is and what he looks like. Carl Hanratty is an FBI fraud bank agent and he really wants to catch Frank, but catching Frank is not as easy as he thought. Meanwhile it gets a little risky for Frank to be a pilot so he decide to change jobs and he becomes a doctor. Frank is not afraid of the FBI and keeps forging checks and papers, but can he keep doing that? The leadactor in this movie is Leonardo DiCaprio. DiCaprio has played a role in many movies like 'Titanic', 'Romeo+Juliet', 'The great gatsby'  Leonardo DiCaprio plays the role of Frank Abagnale in the movie and I think he is the perfect actor for that. The other leadactor is Tom Hanks. He has the role of the FBI-agent. Also Tom Hanks plays his role perfect, I think DiCaprio and Hanks are the perfect combination to make a movie together.

723,ankitapasricha2209,A complete laughter and entertainment dose !!,8,21 August 2014,"This movie is a remarkable work by Spielberg. It is based on the true life story of Frank William Abagnale Jr. who himself plays a minor role in the movie as a French policeman. This only adds to the fascination and awe while watching the movie. The movie depicts how Frank disguises first as an Airline Pilot, then a doctor and later as a lawyer without any professional training in any of these fields. He was able to con a huge sum of money from various government authorities all around the world through his fake degrees, qualifications, payroll cheques etc. Leonardo Dicaprio's performance as Frank in the film was terrific and Tom Hanks' role as an FBI agent only adds to it. Frank's character in the film makes it seem absolutely believable that a man like him can lie, deceive and con almost everyone he meets. The most interesting part is to watch Frank disguise as a school teacher in high school so effortlessly . It is also amusing to watch him get away from the Airport so easily with eight of his selected stewardesses despite the presence of over a hundred officers at the Airport.Overall, it is an exciting movie to watch that kept me engrossed throughout the movie. However, I feel that the movie very quickly digresses from the serious topics such as separation of the family, divorce, bankruptcy and their impact on the character of Frank although these were the real driving factors due to which he resorted to such a deceitful lifestyle. Also, the fact that Frank ends up well off in life even after he was caught, sort of glorifies his lifestyle. It is always a very pleasant change from the usual serious films to watch a bit of escapism and complete unrestricted freedom without instigating an inward desire to lead such a lifestyle.",Catch Me If You Can
724,davewrite,"An intelligent, fast-paced, and thoroughly engaging odyssey",9,6 November 2005,"Forget morality. Most people want to see somebody beat the system -- no matter how he does it -- a winner! That why the movie-going world loves a con artist, especially if he's a young Adonis with a soft heart and a winning smile who exudes charm and cool sophistication. This sympathetically told true story shows how one teenager, skillfully played by Leonardo DiCaprio, did it with daring bravado.The unlikely villain in this story is a kid who's traumatized by catching his mother cavorting with another man, which is soon followed by divorce. Unable to choose which parent should be his guardian, he runs away and applies both natural gifts and lessons learned from the playful deviousness of his skeptical father (who's just experienced financial ruin) to become America's most notable impostor, wangling serial employment as a cop, pilot, doctor, and lawyer. The skill acquired from learning how to forge a fake identity and bogus credentials give him the ability to forge checks -- filling suitcases with millions of dollars and a James Bond sort of life to go with it.This film has many interesting contrasts. Pitting the plodding, joyless purposefulness of a rigidly moral FBI agent (Tom Hank's character) against the capricious cunning of a light hearted con gives a nice edge to this story. And the superb roles played by the best of the best character actors, Sheen Sr. and Christopher Walken (the father), add meaning and levity.Steven Spielberg and his star-studded cast lived up to their billing with this one.",Catch Me If You Can

It makes him an only child instead of showing his three siblings and changes the timeline so that he does his first major theft and confidence tricks at the age of 16.It is told in a value-neutral way so that you can't admire him for his schemes nor condemn him for his wrongdoing either. You don't care enough about the character to admire or condemn him. He is simply a 'phenomenon'. The actor Lenny D is adequate in the role.

It is about a kid who is good at making fake checks and earning millions of dollars by pretending to work in different jobs. The first job was that he pretended to be a sub teacher at age 17. Then his father lost his business and the family had lost their house and became broke. When that happened the parents got divorced and the kid wasn't happy about it. So he ran away and depend on himself. He became so professional at making fake checks. He once pretended to be a co-pilot at Pan American World Airways. Then he pretended to be a doctor and a lawyer. While making fake checks the FBI started to notice that the kid had stolen millions of dollars and FBI started looking for the kid. That is why the name of the movie is Catch Me If You Can. Because all this time the FBI had been trying to catch him and they funny thing is that he got caught not in the United States, he got caught in France. I recommend this movie to everyone who are a fan of Tom Hanks.",Catch Me If You Can

It had everything - great actors, great music by John Williams, the amazing director Steven Spielberg. It wasn't boring for a second although being over 2 hours long. I simply didn't want it to end and this is the main reason I gave the movie a 10. I loved the main character Frank's attitude and his brilliant way of thinking. The fact that it's based on a true story makes it even better. I had to Google Frank Abagnale Jr. after watching this and the friendly face that smiled on the pictures wasn't really what I expected. Leo plays the roll very well - give the man an Oscar already! I'm also thinking that Leo and Tom Hanks must have had a lot of fun filming this.There were many famous actors and actresses in smaller rolls, which I liked. Perhaps some of them weren't so famous back in 2002 (I'm a bit too lazy to do the research at the moment) but seeing for example Ellen Pompeo and Jennifer Garner made me even more interested in the movie.

742,cruise-imdb,A twentieth century retelling of Aesop's fable of the tortoise and the hare.,8,17 March 2006,"Catch Me If You Can is the screen adaptation of the autobiography of Frank Abagnale Jr. (played by Leonardo DiCaprio), renowned as one of America's youngest and most successful con men. The story tells how Frank Jr. steals over four million dollars by forging checks while impersonating an airline pilot, a doctor, and a lawyer, all before his nineteenth birthday. The film also stars Tom Hanks as Carl Hanratty, the FBI special agent assigned to track down Frank Jr. By telling this cat-and-mouse story from both the perspective of the cat and the mouse, director Steven Spielberg shows that hard work and honesty are more rewarding in the long run than any get rich quick scheme.The theme of Catch Me If You Can is best illustrated in scenes involving Frank Abagnale Jr. and Frank Sr., played by Christopher Walken (nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor). In one scene Frank Jr. treats his father to dinner in a fancy restaurant, where he tries to make a gift to his father of a brand new Cadillac. Although Frank Jr. has been forging checks and only posing as an airline pilot, he lies to his father and tells him that he has become a co-pilot for Pan-American airlines. By lying to his father, Frank Jr. shows that he understands the values his father has tried to teach him, even if his actions don't reflect those same values. Although he has stolen everything he has, Frank Jr. knows that he can only gain his father's approval by posing as someone who is hard working and respectable.In a later scene Frank Jr. meets with his father to announce that he's getting married. When Frank Sr. reveals that he knows that his son is wanted by the FBI, Frank Jr. begs his father to make him stop. Frank Jr. storms out of the bar when his father encourages him to continue running from the law. Frank Jr.'s reaction shows that he regrets his choice of a life of crime and wants to stop running.By showing Frank Jr. as regretful and ready to stop committing crimes, the audience is allowed to develop some small amount of sympathy for an otherwise unsympathetic character. This ploy has been used by writers of the heist and con-man genres for years, for example 2001's The Score, and 2003's Matchstick Men.Spielberg uses many film elements to illustrate the theme in Catch Me If You Can. For example, When Frank Sr. is accepting an award honoring his hard work, he is filmed from a low angle. In contrast Frank Jr. is filmed from a high angle in the same scene. The combined effect of these two angles is to place Frank Sr. on a pedestal in his son's eyes.Catch Me If You Can is a twentieth century retelling of Aesop's fable of the tortoise and the hare. Frank Abagnale Jr. is a smooth-talking con man who stays several steps ahead of the plodding FBI agent who pursues him. But by the end of the film we see the tortoise's deliberate effort pay off as he finally catches up to the exhausted hare.",Catch Me If You Can

FBI Agent Carl Hanratty has made his prime mission to capture him and bring him to justice, however Frank is always one step ahead of Carl, baiting him to continue the chase.This story began with the fact that Frank's parents divorced and he needed to decide with whom he wants to stay but he chose a completely different way, he decided to escape from home in order to start a new life. And this desicion changed his life. From the very beginning of the film, I did not think about what would happen at the end, whether Frank would be caught or still not. I just hoped that in the end he would be happy. I had so much fun watching this film and smiled almost every minute. There are so many funny and touching scenes in this film. When Carl Hanratty for a long time tried to catch up with Frank, but all the time he stayed a step away from him until he finally reached his goal, but made the right choice did not put such an outstanding master of fraud checks in prison, and decided to cooperate with him in catching other criminals. It was the perfect end of this story.In conclusion I can say that it is my favourite film. Leonardo DiCaprio and Tom Hanks played brilliantly. Excellent camera work and soundtrack. The outstanding biography of Frank Abagnale, which became the basis of the script. This film can be given many more different epithets and they will all be absolutely deserved.

The movie itself is light and fascinating with a good humour as well. However, the story also touches some deep social issues by showing a guy who has experienced the divorce of his parents, the adulating period and the significant time when he was completely lonely. Being influenced by parental problems, he decides to escape a life he no longer loves as well as to escape from himself. Therefor, the film gives us the opportunity to wonder about who we are in the face of where we have come from.Dreaming about a united family, Frank works to get his mother and father back together and make the family whole again. Of course, this can't work. During the movie he meets with father a several times and tries to convince him to get his mother back but a teenager doesn't understand that everything is broken and he needs to face the cruel world by himself. The moment, when Frank sits with Brenda's family and watching them being happy he wants so badly to have the same reunion and be frankly loved by his own family. While I was watching the movie, I clearly saw that Frank tries to resemble his father. Moreover, he learns from his father how to be the ""second mouse"" and get off with whole skin, whereas the moment with a necklace demonstrates it clearly.I also was astonished by this movie as the director shot so many peculiar and unique details which helped us to understand the personality of Abagnale. For instance, the scene when Frank comes to cash his checks and witnesses the name tags whether the woman is Miss or Mrs. for the purpose of flirting or not. Or another moment, when at the beginning of the movie the comics with Flash hero are shown just next to the Frank's bed and after that the allusion to this hero appears during the whole movie.So , I highly recommend to watch this movie as you will surely enjoy the great work of Spielberg and the perfect acting of Leonardo DiCaprio and Tom Hanks.",Catch Me If You Can
745,sashastarunskiy-13079,Catch me if you can,10,19 February 2019,"""Catch Me If You Can""This is not just a film, not just a story about a boy who deceived everyone and stole several million dollars. This film is a peculiar story about the life of people, and a part of the soul of the director himself. Steven Spielberg seems to have seen himself playing the main role, otherwise it is impossible to explain many facts that speak about the similarity of the life of the main character with the life of the director.
Problems in the family, attempts to self-actualize in any way, and early maturing in the mid-60s. These facts make the biography of the protagonist similar to the biography of Spielberg.
Sixteen-year-old Spielberg spent all summer vacations at Universal Studios. Every morning he came there in a suit, but none of the guards even thought that this young ""worker"" actually came just to see how the movies were shot.And so, let's get acquainted with the characters of the film. The protagonist is Frank William Abagneil Jr. Frank is a charming, cunning, clever, and somebody might even say, two-faced, but incredibly kind person, who at the age of eighteen was one of the most sophisticated criminals. What made a wonderful boy and a diligent son become a criminal?Family. Hard times change people. Frank is inspired by his parents, their pure and strong love is what makes the boy happy. But one moment can destroy everything. Frank's mom starts cheating on his father with his friend. Father lost all his money and property. Marriage does not save. But Frank can not choose a parent with whom he will live, after a divorce, can not accept the destruction of their ideal family happiness. Frank wants to save his family, create all conditions for further prosperity and tries not to let the things that make him happy disappear. He had a terrific skill of transformation. Frank pretended to be a Pan American pilot, a doctor, a lawyer. He made and cashed fake checks for a total of two and a half million dollars.Uniform, appearance, wrapper - this is what helps to make people believe in anything. If you wear a pilot uniform, then you are a pilot. Four years a young boy confused the police of all states. He plays his game, with transformations and changing forms. He plays with people, considering himself omnipotent, he is sure that at any moment he can stop and spend money with impunity.
The main character is dealing with FBI agents who do not intend to joke. Agent Hanratti is not the one who gives up easily and he will not stop the persecution. His goal - to catch a brilliant young criminal, which robbing banks.
If we talk about the actors who performed the roles, then of course, we must be thanked to Leonardo DiCaprio, who more than anyone else approached this role. He was able to demonstrate all the cunning plans of the protagonist, his charisma and poignant wit, and at the same time his kind soul. Tome Hanks, who played the role of Agent Hanratti, despite the not the brightest role, thanks to his skill, complemented the film.It should be noted acting game Christopher Walken, in the role of Frank Abagneil Sr.. The image of the father occupies an important place in the film. Having everything, he lost it. The only thing left is a son who, until the end of his days, loved his father, and committed crimes for his sake.
I believe that this film is a masterpiece. The film covers the problems of family, society and man. This is not just a comedy story. This film is one of the best works of art.",Catch Me If You Can
746,kotyusha-m,Too young or too old?,10,19 February 2019,"Striving for something must give a result. This is especially true for people who are stubborn. And it doesn't matter to them how much they have to endure, what difficulties and boundaries to cross, because the main thing is to reach the end point, that is, to achieve result.But many still can not get what they want. Why so? The answer to this may lie either in a banal laziness, or in another misfortune - the conquest of the unbeaten.The main character of this film was able to please in the second paradox. In short, he wanted the fact that at that time it was simply not possible. But not so much, he demanded: he wanted to live happily, like most. But what can you do about your parents' divorce? What can you do about the imperfection of the rights of American citizens, who suck all the money out of their beloved father? Many would be humbled, but not Frank. Choosing the right moment, when everyone was in another room, he ran away with a desire to find a way to the old life and fulfillment of all his dreams.In general, the whole film is focused on this, the most important and most amazing character. What is it amazing, at first incomprehensible. At least in appearance, he appears to us as a typical 16-year-old boy who loves parents and life. But that was for the time being. It can be seen, and in truth, it is said that only a difficult situation determines who we really are. Jack, being once again in a similar, showed himself as a man of a dozen timid, who would hardly just accept disaster. And it seems to be a great advance, but when the usual striving turns into a navischevuyu idea, the bad can not be avoided. Of course, in dreams, he really believed that if he earned more money and became a worthy man, his mother would take it, but would marry his father again, and they would live quietly and peacefully. In fact, it turned out that it would not be possible to quickly become someone significant, so I had to play someone, in the literal sense. From such a ""game"" there were problems with the law, the eternal bustle and, finally, the realization that he is nobody. Why, and with the parents did not work.However, in all this minus you can find a handful of plus: Frank for such a small period managed to go into the skin, count several people at once. And let him pay for this with complete solitude, yet in the ability to crank it all up and consist, for the most part, its difference from others, its peculiarity.
This concerns the most fundamental character. I doubt that he would have become so without the help of the one who brought it to life - Leonardo DiCaprio. Here is his finest hour: he now and then put on various masks. But probably the best he managed to show complete hopelessness, the realization that all dreams have collapsed. And this intersection of the image of the usual ""waking up"", ""matured"" boy and the image of the genius of a mozyinik create something unrealistically huge in terms of acting and plot. Also, at the height of the one who caught the whole film Frank - Karl Henratti, in the performance of Tom Hanks. I was surprised at how different he appears to the audience at the beginning and at the end of the film.As for the plot, it turned out pretty twisted and interesting. Here, and morality, and the essence, and humor, and drama. In short everything that Spielberg loves so much is the director of the project.
So what is the result: a person who has an extraordinary gift to adapt to the role of anyone, a detective, whose ""scent"" amazes and the action itself, where both humor and drama are surprisingly well balanced. In a word, ""Catch Me If You Can"" is an ideal film that will suit both the younger and the younger generation.",Catch Me If You Can

Frank Abignale Jr. (Leonardo DiCaprio) - a master of deception and cheating, who managed to work and the chief physician and pilot of passenger airlines, and assistant prosecutor - and all this to 21, and certainly, with the help of youthful seductiveness, and a small chain, which ""allegedly"" lost many employees. In the film, one can see the unconditional ""influence"" of his father, whose ""rules of life"" he brought to ""unprecedented heights"", and his prayer before dinner in his future wife's house was a story about a mouse: ""Two mice fell into a vessel with milk. One mouse - did not resist, and sank. The other one floundered for a long time, whipped up butter, and climbed to the surface. "" In this story - he is undoubtedly the second mouse. The parents' divorce became the ""catalyst"" of all his actions, where he masterfully falsified bank checks in his name, promised unprecedented profits to his father (remembering his mother - just before arrest, when he saw her juvenile daughter in another family through the window), and in the end, over time, became the most valuable employee of the FBI in the field of fraud. The story of such a ""non-standard"" hero - under the leadership of Steven Spielberg - came out in a very voluminous, dramatic ode about inhuman gain, human weakness and short-sighted, where it seems ""you can get the moon"".",Catch Me If You Can
748,yshekotka,Another Hollywood Masterpiece,10,19 February 2019,"There is a popular belief that if a movie is directed by Steven Spielberg and if it stars Leonardo DiCaprio, Tom Hanks and Christopher Walken, this movie is bound to be successful. However, these factors weren't the only key factors that had made me watch this movie, but also the fact that the main idea is based on real-life events. I just can't resist such movies. So, proceeding to the story itself, it's about a young man being underaged who has the brass to not only to take on the role of a doctor, pilot, lawyer, etc. but to pull a con game on FBI. If it was possible to say that pulling a con game on FBI and on the country, in general, can be described as being professional, I would definitely say that the main character Frank Abagnale Jr. (Leonardo DiCaprio) did it professionally. Throughout the duration of the plot, he is chased by an experienced and rule-bounded F.B.I. agent, Carl Hanratty (Tom Hanks), who several times let the DiCaprio's character slip through the fingers. Nonetheless, agent Hanratty manages to do it and the final Frank's escape fails. Fails, but not for long.
To be honest, I tried to watch this movie twice, but it was kind of impossible for me. The problem was that I really was not able to catch the plot of it. When watching it for the 3rd time I finally managed to understand the whole idea, the whole story, that seemed to me as something uncatchable. So does Frank Abagnale Jr., so tells us the headline of the movie.
I have already noticed that the director is Steven Spielberg. I believe that when you hearing that a movie is going to be made by this great person, you know in advance that it's going to be a masterpiece beginning from the idea and finishing with the way of the picture in general. A great deal of film scenes is considered to be a masterpiece. Also, I like that the story, at first sight, is a criminal, but at the same time, it is sprinkled with romance and humour. I cannot help but notice an amazing. Actually, the director collected all the actors, who you cannot expect less from. Each one fit into an image of their characters.

749,alenashikova,Thought-provocative funny movie,9,19 February 2019,"What I would like to concentrate on is the idea of the movie.There arise many issues to think over, for example, family, friends, sense and value of life, money, smartness and others. That is really thought-provocative and make us change our mind on many essential things, maybe even to change yourself, to change your attitude to people surrounding you, to events, to deeds.While watching 'Catch Me If You Can' I had so much fun I smiled constantly. Well, that smile was interrupted by laughs. The movie tells the story of Frank W. Abignale, Jr. who is just a kid as he pretends to be a schoolteacher. After his father and mother get a divorce he runs away and starts pretending to be a co-pilot, a doctor, a lawyer. The way he does this is funny and brilliant. The main characters are perfect at playing, they are alive in their roles and amplua and are pleasant to watch at.
Dicaprio is a charmer and is very smooth as we watch his character do some fancy talk to the young ladies. Tom Hanks as the FBI agent reminds me of his cynical character that he played in ""A League of Their Own"" and his mere presence adds more to this film. Mr. Spielberg has found a perfect actor to fill the shoes of the con man with the perfect casting of Leonardo DiCaprio. It's very easy to see why all the women fall prey of this charmer. He was a fast talker and a slick operator. He exudes charisma to fill another couple of movies. This is not just a plain image that we face, this is a real story and the director realized it in full strength.There are impressive, touching and terrific scenes. In spite of the fact that there are much action in this movie, there are many scenes that touch the spectators and make think. The dialogues are elaborated and beautiful and smart-sounded. I like the style of clothes the characters wear, it's fashionable and tasty-designed. The decorations and all stages are perfectly-elaborated.The story is inspired by a real story. I don't know in how many ways it is true but watching this guy all I wanted to see was him pulling more of his nice little tricks. The scene where he pretends to be a schoolteacher is just great. If you want a nice funny movie, not too heavy, this one will definitely please you. I guess this film represents one of the most impressive achievements of Steven Spilberg. It doesn't leave spectators with a drop of disappointment.",Catch Me If You Can
750,pbk453,The Cat and The Check-Forging Mouse,8,19 February 2019,"Catch Me If You Can manages to reach the goal that most of the biographical films strive for. This film manages to captivate the viewer and present a dramatic retelling of the true events without sacrificing the important details that make the original story so appealing in the first place. Sure, it adds an additional historically inaccurate plotline, but these scenes don't take anything away from the experience and only enhance the events as the movie continues to unfold. I truly think that the quality of its screenplay is what makes it so memorable and charming.The main characters stand out and have just enough time to make an impactful impression on the viewer. From the naive mischievousness of Leonardo DiCaprio's portrayal of Frank Abagnale to the persistency and inspiring commitment of Carl Hanratty played by Tom Hanks. Both of the characters are almost perfectly suited for their roles in this long-running game of «cat and mouse» and the actors make sure that their impressive portrayal of Frank and Carl shows it. The performances also allow for every close call for Frank Abagnale and every small victory of Carl Hanratty to feel like the first one. Emotional hooks are already in you by the time Frank makes his first forged check and they aren't planning on letting you go until you're done with the movie.
Also, the original soundtrack is fantastic. Always nailing the tone of the scene, John Williams once again proves his talent as a composer throughout the film. From the beautifully animated intro sequence to the small, almost unnoticeable melodies that serve as wonderful background for this lighthearted story.Of course, you can probably guess how the story ends even if never knew the true story of Frank Abagnale. The film tries its best to leave you guessing up until the end whether or not will the story of the young check forger end on a high note, but it's obvious that the script never aimed to interpret original events as a complicated story about the morally gray nature of crime and/or a story with a strong focus on how your confidence and wit can help you find a way in and out of every situation in life. It's just a simply structures, feel-good movie with a cheeky tone that can be enjoyed by almost everyone and I'm all for that. It's a great watch and I'd highly recommend it to anyone who wants to see an engaging crime story and have fun. If that's what you're after, then Catch Me If You Can is the movie for you.",Catch Me If You Can
751,darya_rus,Catch Me If You Can,8,19 February 2019,"At first glance, I can say that the film ""Catch Me If You Can"" by Steven Spielberg is a classic film that does not claim for high awards and a dominant place in the history of cinematograph. But after the first, second and third viewing it becomes clear that the creators, without even waiting for it, created a truly exciting and unique movie. This is not an entertaining film for the general public, this is a film-story for a thoughtful and curious viewer.
The film ""Catch Me If You Can"" is not intended to tell the viewer any thoughtful story with a global human problem. We see the story of a schoolboy, a minor American teenager, who at such a young age managed to be a representative of a wide variety of professions: an airline pilot, a qualified doctor, a lawyer. In his spare time, he fell in love with forging bank checks, thanks to which he managed to save up impressive multimillion-dollar capital. But the FBI agents get involved in the chase of a young swindler. The plot of the film is a powerful and intriguing embodiment of a true story by means of cinematograph. The main goal of the film was to tell in a dynamic form the most interesting situations that took place in the investigation of the case of Frank Abagnale.
Steven Spielberg has proved himself as a powerful and professional film director. In my opinion, he is the very film director who can combine together absolutely contradictory genres. The whole atmosphere is focused on the chase, on the feelings of the persecuted and the pursuer. A lot of funny and humorous moments, embellishing in all a dramatic picture, allow viewers to relax while watching. Steven Spielberg created a light comedy - dramatic film and while watching it you fully immersed in the developing events and directly take part in them.
The actor's game contributed its positive mite to the overall concept of the film, without which, probably, it would not have had half of its success. First of all, I should say that Leonardo DiCaprio, for his then-young age, coped well with his role. He looks like an inquisitive young man who wears various masks. For him, the occupation of a scam is a hobby that absorbed him completely. Through the actor's talent, this image looks convincing and memorable. I would like to mention the wonderful work of Amy Adams, who, although she appeared in a cameo role, however, was able to attract the attention of the audience. The actress completely reincarnated, and this role became not similar to the rest of her ones in her career. Tom Hanks does not look like a boy against the background of the young actors I have mentioned. His character looks funny and energetic against the background of realistic fret and other emotions accompanying this feeling.
In conclusion, I want to say that ""Catch Me If You Can"" is an exciting and dynamic film about financial scams that don't get bored during the rather long timeline and leave a wonderful mood with their bright and positive atmosphere.",Catch Me If You Can
752,krivzha,No one can keep their eyes off those damn pinstripes,10,19 February 2019,"How can that be real? The question covers not only the real story of Frank Abagnale Jr., but also the film itself. Steven Spielberg, Jeff Nathanson, John Williams, and the whole cast caught me from the very beginning of the film. Not unnaturally, that all the scams of real Frank Abagnale Jr. were romanticized, to say nothing of his relations with other characters, though, the historical inaccuracy is not that huge, and the film itself manages to knock a viewer off their pins. The list of worth-watching biopics is simply too short and Catch me if you can, with no doubt, ranks if not the first but at least the second in this list.
Here is a young man, who escaping his parents' divorce flung himself whole-heartedly into check forgery and impersonating other people. Steven Spielberg uses all his filmmaking experience to present the story of this young man in a way that after end of the film a viewer starts to scrutinize the Internet to know more about the real Frank Abagnale Jr., and to know more details about his life. The same manages to achieve the main actor Leonardo DiCaprio, and it is worth mentioning that Leonardo DiCaprio playing a role of impersonator impersonated not only a pilot, doctor and parish prosecutor, but Frank Abagnale Jr. himself. Obviously, a great criminal story can't be without a great detective. In this case we have Carl Hanratty played by Tom Hanks who as usual presented high quality acting. And on the whole the music composed by John Williams adds a spice to this masterpiece of Steven Spielberg. From the very beginning of the film John Williams manages to deliver the main features of the film: intrigue, lightheartedness and intensity of narration.
The film is fantastic and catchy. Above all, the plot covers not only the cons of a criminal life having a great sum of money by fooling other people, but the consequences of hard life times as family divorce (it is worth mentioning that Steven Spielberg focused on this idea very strongly), loneliness, and violence of outer world. Great film, with wonderful screenplay, skillful actors, ingenious director and stunning story. Long story short, it is masterpiece.And remember, yankees always win because no one can keep their eyese off yankees' damn pinstripes.",Catch Me If You Can
753,lianagasparyan-49810,A must see film by Steven Spielberg,10,19 February 2019,"Catch Me If You Can is a stylish, confident comedy filled with adventure and originality.
Here we see the story of Frank Abagnale Jr. - the brilliant conman who practiced medicine without attending medical school, passed as a pilot without attending flight school, and practiced law with absolutely no law degree. This was all accomplished before the age of 19, might I add.
Like most Spielberg characters, Frank comes from a broken home. Frank thought he was living the good life with his loving father, Frank and mother, Paula, until his father started having financial problems. His family was forced to sell their house, their car and Frank saw his parent's marriage begin to crumble along with their lives. One day Frank is pulled out of school and told by a judge that his parents are getting divorced and Frank has to choose who he wants to live with. Traumatized by the news and circumstances, Frank Jr. hits the road and devises clever schemes to make it on his own. During his brilliant three-year run as a master of deception he cashes fake checks and amasses millions buying sports cars, fancy suits, and pretending to be a kind of James Bond with women. The con enables him to go undetected for awhile but soon the FBI gets wise to the bank forgeries and sends agent Carl Hanratty whop specializes in the bank fraud division, after Frank.
Frank's ""good life"" includes dating various women who inspire him to try different careers. With each year that passes and with the large amount of forged checks that near $4 million.
Catch Me If You Can is a high quality, entertaining film from the master of cinema, Steven Spielberg. This is one of those movies that is so fascinating and clever to watch, you can't believe it's based on a man's real-life memoirs. It's a fascinating study of a brilliant mind who didn't plan to be on the FBI's most wanted list. I particularly enjoyed the ensemble of talented actors, especially the wonderful chemistry between Hanks and DiCaprio. The acting, as expected, is top notch. Tom Hanks, in a supporting role, is at his usual level, which is nearly benchmark. He brings incredible depth to a character. Leonardo DiCaprio, who does not even pretend to share the stage with Hanks, is superb.
This film is utterly entertaining and captivating, with very few slow parts and many funny moments. It has comedy, drama, suspense, romance - it covers every genre except for those looking for a shoot'em up action movie. I highly recommend to watch this movie!",Catch Me If You Can
