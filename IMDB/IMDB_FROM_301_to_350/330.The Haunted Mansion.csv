0,TheLittleSongbird,It is not that bad!,6,25 October 2009,"The Haunted Mansion is based on a ride at Disneyland, and is one of three movies the other two being the Country Bears and Pirates of the Caribbean based on a Disneyland ride. As for the movie, it is very flawed, but you know what, it isn't that bad. It's not as good as Pirates of the Caribbean but it's better than Country Bears.The film does look amazing, with splendid sets and costumes and the special effects were actually above average my favourite being the singing statues. The music is great, and the performances in general are very good. Eddie Murphy has been better, but he gave a good account of himself and the children were appealing. The best of the lot has to be Jennifer Tilly as the crystal ball, but she should have got more screen time than she did. The film does have a fairly creepy atmosphere to it, especially that truly scary scene in the tomb.However, The Haunted Mansion isn't without its flaws. The script is very cliché-ridden and doesn't give the actors very much to work with. The plot does have its dull and predictable spots, and never really recovers, and is further disadvantaged by a rather anti-climatic and obvious ending. The only real disappointing performance came from Terence Stamp as Ramsley, he is a fine actor, but he is given little to do.All in all, it is very flawed, but it is watchable. 6/10 Bethany Cox",The Haunted Mansion
1,SnoopyStyle,Not funny and not scary,4,26 October 2014,"Jim Evers (Eddie Murphy) is a hard-working real estate agent who doesn't have time for his family. After missing their wedding anniversary, he proposes to go down to the lake. His wife Sara (Marsha Thomason) gets a call from Gracey Manor looking to sell. Sara is reluctant to go but Jim drags her and the kids to meet Edward Gracey (Nathaniel Parker). A storm floods out the road and the Evers are forced to stay. Ramsley (Terence Stamp) is the stiff creepy butler. The manor is web-filled and Gothic with a vast cemetery in the back. Jim stumbles onto a secret passage and encounters Madame Leota (Jennifer Tilly), a gypsy ghost locked in a crystal ball. The kids follow a spectral orb up to the attic and finds a portrait that looks exactly like their mother where they meet house staff Emma (Dina Spybey) and Ezra (Wallace Shawn) who are actually ghosts.Eddie Murphy is pushing too hard to be a jerk. It's no surprise that he succeeds. His character is a jerk and doesn't come off well. Eddie isn't funny anymore. This movie is not scary. It's PG and has no edge to it. Marsha Thomason seems sweet but not very compelling. I do like the kids. This movie needed to work on their level. Essentially, it needed to be their movie if the PG rating needs to stick. The scares are always heightened when the audience sees it through children's eyes. The only fun part is when Eddie and the kids are looking for the key in the cemetery. The kids battle some scary stuff. I just wish the rest of the movie is more like that.",The Haunted Mansion
2,claudio_carvalho,"A Watchable Adventure, In Spite of Full of Clichés and the Presence of the Unbearable Eddie Murphy",6,13 November 2004,"The real-estate broker Jim Evers (Eddie Murphy) and his wife Sara Evers (Marsha Thomason) are partners in their real-estate business, but Jim is workaholic and does not give much attention to his family. On their wedding anniversary, Jim promises to travel with Sara and their daughter Megan and son Michael in the weekend to a close lake, but Sara is invited to visit a mansion and Jim sees the chance of the beginning of a great deal. He decides to visit the huge house in the way to the lake, and the family is hosted by the weird butler Ramsley (Terence Stamp) and his master Gracey (Nathaniel Parker). Jim and his family pretty soon realize that the house is full of ghosts and that Gracey believes that Sara is the reincarnation of his former fiancée Elizabeth. Although full of clichés and having the unbearable Eddie Murphy, 'The Haunted Mansion' has some good moments and is watchable. The best parts are those with the participation of Emma (Dina Waters from 'Six Feet Under' and her funny voice), Ezra (Wallace Shawn) and Jennifer Tilly as the crystal ball Madame Leota. My vote is six.Title (Brazil): 'Mansão Mal-Assombrada' ('Haunted Mansion')",The Haunted Mansion
3,mark.waltz,"""Oh my God! Dead people!""",6,16 November 2020,"So says the little girl who can wack a spider with her hand and not wince even once. She's looking at the backyard of the abandoned mansion which her real estate parents, Eddie Murphy and Marsha Thomason, are expecting as the possibility of adding to is there a list of homes for sale.They have been contacted by the very eerie looking butler Terence Stamp (who looks like a ghost himself) for his employer (Nathaniel Parker), the heir to the estate of this eyesore, a home that may look glorious on the inside but any sensible passerby wood consider it to be an enormous rat's nest.""Put in the toilet angle and leave out the ghosts for now"" Murphy suggests, yet the family becomes very nervous when they are forced to spend the night. Mor the family who was on their way to a vacation on the lake, this is the last type of vacation they expected.The very ambitious Murphy and wife Thomason have issues because Murphy is too involved in the business that they created together, leaving them no real family time. The setup is there for a mixture of light horror, screwball comedy and family drama aids greatly with the addition of one of Disney's most popular rides, and those who think that the ride is too short will find it thrilling to be on it for nearly two hours.For the kids, the initial horror comes from no cellphone reception (flip phones no less!), but the audience, especially those who have been on the ride more than once, know what is to come. For the two kids who never seem to smile, they are going to have to rely on something stronger than cell phone connection to get through this night.Another hint that this house has issues beyond the endless graveyard in the back yard is the fact that an obvious thunderstorm hits the moment Murphy and family are inside, and for Murphy the fact that he gets tossed into a hidden passageway practically right away. A portrait of Thomason in early 1900's attire indicates that there's more to them being there than to just try to sell this huge white elephant.In smaller roles are Jennifer Tilly as the head in the crystal ball, Wallace Shawn as a creepy valet and Dina Waters as the maid. The special effects are fast and funny, and the film as a whole is very family friendly in spite of a few light cursing. Murphy seems ageless so his 15 plus years on Thomason are not noticeable. This is one of the better family comedies of the millennium with lots of fun to be had in its perfect running time.",The Haunted Mansion
4,gavin6942,Not Awful,6,6 October 2014,"Workaholic realtor Jim Evers (Eddie Murphy), his wife/business partner Sara and their two children are summoned to a mansion. When they discover that the place is haunted, Jim discovers an important lesson about the family he's neglected as they attempt to escape.Other than the ""Shrek"" films, Eddie Murphy's career took a rather downward turn after the 1980s. And although he may or may not have been right for this part (something seems a little off), it is not the terrible flop that people make it out to be.Fans of the ride will be impressed with how they were able to take so many elements and turn them into a single narrative. If you want a faithful adaptation, this is much closer to the source than ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" (even if that is the better film).There are a few scenes that might scare younger viewers (much like the ride), but overall this is pretty good family fun. Besides Murphy, we get some decent performances from Wallace Shawn and the wonderful Terence Stamp, who does the Karloff-as-old-butler routine quite nicely.",The Haunted Mansion
5,jboothmillard,The Haunted Mansion,3,8 September 2008,"Like Pirates of the Caribbean, this is another film based on one of the Disneyland attractions, I think the only reason I wanted to see it was because of the leading actor and some of the co-stars, I didn't really think of the story or anything, from director Rob Minkoff (The Lion King, Stuart Little). Basically Jim Evers (Eddie Murphy) is a workaholic real estate salesman, and his wife and business partner Sara (Marsha Thomason) is getting annoyed with him working so much, and on the day of their anniversary. So Jim suggests going on a vacation to a lake with their kids, Michael (Marc John Jefferies) and Megan (Aree Davis), just after he's stopped off at a mansion Jim got a strange call about from owner Master Edward Gracey (Nathaniel Parker), looking to sell the property. Unfortunately not long after arriving, the mysterious butler Ramsley (Terence Stamp) insists they stay the night because of the bad weather, and one by one they realise the mansion is haunted. Jim ends up in a secret passageway, the kids follow a floating ball in the attic, and Gracey is being very obsessive of Sara, the kids find out she looks exactly like Gracey's dead wife from a painting. Jim and the kids discover the dark secrets of the mansion from Madame Leota (Jennifer Tilly), a talking head crystal ball, and they are all now trying to stop the obsessive Gracey from getting Sara, with Ramsley and other nasty dead creatures standing in their way. Also starring Toy Story's Wallace Shawn as Ezra and Dina Waters as Emma. Murphy is good at adding small jokes to the not very scary horror feel, the only bit that really made me giggle a lot was the singing head statues, but other than that, I think the kids will enjoy it more than the adults. Adequate!",The Haunted Mansion

7,paul_haakonsen,A mansion full of secrets and ghosts...,6,16 August 2016,"I have watched this 2003 ghost movie three times by now, every time with a couple of years in between each viewing. But I can't claim that it is an overly impressive movie. I just had the chance to watch it once on DVD and twice on TV.This is by no means a scary movie or a horror movie, nor is it intended to be so. This is a ghostly comedy, if there ever was such a genre. And with Eddie Murphy in the lead, of course you know it will be a comedy of sorts.The story is about a busy and fast-talking real estate agent (Murphy) who is going away on vacation, but has the opportunity to make a huge sale on an old mansion estate, a chance which is just too good to waste. Taking a detour there with his family as they make their way to their vacation, the family stumbles upon an old house with a ghastly story and even more ghastly inhabitants.This is a family movie, and it is suitable for younger viewers as well. And that is what is good about this movie, because there is something for just about everyone, from old to young.The effects in ""The Haunted Mansion"" are good and they serve the movie and the story quite well. And it is important to have good and believable special effects in a ghost movie. So thumbs up to the special effects team on their efforts in ""The Haunted Mansion"".The acting in the movie was good, although you shouldn't expect a Shakespearian experience here. People do well enough jobs with their given roles. In my opinion then it was without a doubt Terence Stamp and Nathaniel Parker who carried the movie with their performances.All in all, this movie is the type of movie that would do well in a Halloween repertoire of movies to watch. I am giving it six out of ten stars.",The Haunted Mansion
8,BandSAboutMovies,Ugh,4,24 July 2021,"Originally opening at Disneyland in 1969, The Haunted Mansion was one of the last Disney theme park attractions overseen by Walt Disney himself. Two years later, a similar one opened in Walt Disney World. Originally it was going to be a run-down building, but Walt rejected the notion of a worn building in his brand new theme park. A trip to Winchester Mystery House - filled with straits to nowhere and doors that opened into brick walls - put Disney and his team on the right path.The dark ride is one that has its own fans who obsess - and rightly so - over the history and multiple versions of the attraction. After Disney's death in December 1966, the opening of the ride on August 12, 1969 finally brought numbers up to the theme park that has his name on it.When you talk into the main room and hear the voice of Paul Frees intone, ""When hinges creak in doorless chambers, and strange and frightening sounds echo through the halls, whenever candle lights flicker where the air is deathly still, that is the time when ghosts are present, practicing their terror with ghoulish delight..."" you know that you're in for a ride unlike anything else. I am notorious for not enjoying theme parks and I've gone through The Haunted Mansion multiple times.Following Tower of Terror, Mission to Mars, The Country Bears and the Pirates of the Caribbean series, this would be the fifth Disney attraction to get a movie of its own. Written by David Berenbaum (Elf, Zoom) and directed by Rob Minkoff (the co-director of The Lion King), it opened to near-universal scorn.The film stars Eddie Murphy as Jim Evers, who along with his wife Sara (Marsha Thomason) runs a real estate business. He barely has time for their kids Michael and Megan and even sells a house instead of meeting his wife for their anniversary. To make up for it, he suggests a vacation before the occupants of Louisiana's Gracey Manor ask him and his wife to help sell their gigantic home.The real reason they are summoned is that the lord of the manor, Master Edward Gracey (Nathaniel Parker) believes that Sara is the reincarnation of his long-dead wife Elizabeth. Yet for some reason, everyone else in the house - including Wallace Shawn as Ezra - is afraid of his butler Ramsley (Terence Stamp, who as always deserves better).Eventually, Ramsley threatens the children and forces Sara into marrying Gracey before her husband returns to save them all and reveal the truth of what happened on the day of Gracey's wedding.As interesting and exciting as the original ride is, the movie is pretty lifeless. In an odd choice, it's based on Phantom Manor, the version of the Haunted Mansion at Disneyland Resort Paris, instead of the more familiar versions of the attraction. It's also funny that Eddie Murphy had a routine about how he'd leave a haunted house immediately when he was a young and vital standup comic, but by 2003, he was willing to sleepwalk through this film.But hey! Jennifer Tilly is Madame Leota and that has to count for something!",The Haunted Mansion

10,hitchcockthelegend,Scarily Bad.,3,9 March 2012,"The Haunted Mansion is directed by Rob Minkoff and written by David Berenbaum. It stars Eddie Murphy, Terence Stamp, Marsha Thomason, Nathaniel Parker and Jennifer Tilly. Music is by Mark Mancina and cinematography by Remi Adefarasin. Based on the Disney Park attraction of the same name, film finds Murphy as real estate agent Jim Evers, a man who is so driven by his work he neglects to notice he is neglecting his family. Setting off for a weekend family trip, it is no surprise that when a call comes through to go see about another property to be sold, Evers whisks all the family out to the bayou mansion with him. What is a surprise is that this mansion is haunted and a curse threatens to engulf the Evers family when they are forced by bad weather to spend the night there.Well it has lovely colour photography, a production set of some excellence by John Myhre, great costumes from Mona May, nifty effects by Jay Redd and Rick Baker once again delivers quality make up work. But these high points are part of a very bad movie. Script is lazy, almost as lazy as Murphy's performance in actual fact, front line cast members are playing second fiddle to the outright homage of the park ride itself. As film progresses the plot becomes a Whirling Dervish of style over substance, where it is neither funny or scary. The very young will be transfixed by the noise, motions and images, those from teenager upwards will surely know they have been conned by the mighty house of the mouse. 3/10",The Haunted Mansion
11,preppy-3,"THIS is what we got for making ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" such a big hit!",5,12 July 2005,"Eddie Murphy plays a workaholic real estate man. He loves his beautiful wife and two kids--but can't resist working. He gets a call to see an old, rundown mansion (the title one). He arrives with his wife and kids. They meet the mysterious butler (Terence Stamp) and his even stranger master (Nathaniel Parker) but they soon realize they're there for a sinister reason...and their lives may be in danger...Believe me it's NOT as good as it sounds! This is a supposed ""family movie"" from Disney. It OPENS with two suicides and includes sequences with the kids in danger and being attacked by the (pretty gruesome) living dead. This would give most little kids nightmares. That aside this is supposed to be a comedy...but none, and I mean NONE, of the lines are funny. The plot gets increasingly stupid as it unfolds and (for no reason) the main villain tells Murphy his whole part--giving Murphy plenty of ammunition to use against him. That's just lazy writing. The ending is extremely stupid and pointless--it's as if the scriptwriters just threw up their hands and gave up.Murphy is pretty good but even he can't overcome the stupid script. Marsha Thomason (as his wife) is good and so are the kids--acting like real kids would (for once). But Stamp walks through his role (not really his fault--he has nothing to work with) and Parker is very good--TOO good for this movie. Jennifer Tilly has a FEW somewhat cute lines too.This film is chockful of (admittedly) fantastic special effects--but there's no story and it's filled with painfully unfunny one liners. This was obviously made for two reasons: 1) Eddie Murphy desperately needs a hit and 2) ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" was such a huge hit. I didn't like ""Pirates"" either but it's not as bad as THIS! This movie bombed badly at the box office. That's good--it hopefully means no more Disney theme park rides will be made into movies.I give this a 5--and that's just for the special effects. But I can't recommend this at all.",The Haunted Mansion
12,Boba_Fett1138,Perfect horror entertainment for children.,8,2 August 2008,"As weird and as unexpected as it might sound, I really liked this movie for what it was and it's no way as bad as everything tries to make you believe it is.I thought that this was just a great children movie. Or well, maybe it's just because this would be the type of movie that I would had liked to have seen when I was young(er). People just often seem to forget or ignore their inner child. While watching this movie you just have to think and feel like a child again, since this is also the target group the movie got aimed towards. When you do so, you'll see that this movie is simply good at what it tries to achieve. It brings some good clean and safe horror entertainment for children. Young ones often seem to like reading horror stories (at least in my days this was the case) so they are likely to get a blast out of watching this movie. Some sequences however might be a bit too disturbing for really young children though, so be aware of that.Of course when you start watching this movie as an adult you'll notice the movie its weak and quite formulaic story. Nothing is ever really surprising about it. The movie nevertheless has a great sense of adventure though in which a group of people gets trapped in an haunted house, with a new adventure in every room.The movie is great looking, with also especially its special effects. Normally horror and special effects are never a good or effective combination but in this case of an horror movie for children, it isn't really a complainant. The special effects mostly serve to give the movie its feeling of adventure and it provides the movie with some of its entertaining moments as well. The movie also features some or the recently deceased Rick Baker make-up effects, which is always something great to look at.Not sure if the movie is really as effective as a comedy than as an adventure movie though. Oh well, perhaps children will still find the movie funny in parts, though some of the jokes are obviously aimed toward adults. Something Disney movies often do so, especially lately.I also can't say if I'm too sure about Eddie Murphy casting as the main lead. Now I have nothing against Eddie Murphy really but he just isn't suitable for all types of comedies. I think this is one of those movies that would had been better off without him. Besides the well known Eddie Murphy, the movie also features well known and respected actors such as Terence Stamp, Nathaniel Parker and Jennifer Tilly. Especially Stamp and Parker were great. On top of that the movie also features the wonderful Deep Roy, in a really small role though.The movie its musical score by Mark Mancina also really deserves recognition. It was surprisingly great and effective. It can be described as a great and effective horror score as well as an entertaining one.Great children entertainment!8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",The Haunted Mansion

14,anaconda-40658,Haunting Murphy's Career.,1,10 February 2016,"The Haunted Mansion (2003): Dir: Rob Minkoff / Cast: Eddie Murphy, Terrence Stamp, Jennifer Tilly, Wallace Shawn, Dina Waters: What can one possibly say about a film based on a theme park ride? One can say that it is desperate Hollywood in action churning out one of the worst films of the year. Third grade art students can create better effects than the junk presented here. There is no real plot worth mentioning. It is just Eddie Murphy as a real estate agent who promises his frustrated family a vacation and are about to do that but must make one fatal stop. From there it is scene after scene of bad production values and pitiful storytelling of how scared they should be and how bored the audience is. Director Rob Minkoff previously directed The Lion King but you would never know it from watching this despicable garbage. Murphy will be haunted by this career kill. Being in this and Daddy Daycare the same year gives an impression that he desires to tone himself down in terms of humour but his film choices are hitting lower than any dirty humour in his more adult films. He is not at his best here but that is nothing compared to the embarrassing performance of Terrence Stamp as a butler. Others wasting valuable time are Jennifer Tilly and Wallace Shawn who can do better than this. The production values are on par with one's diarrhea. Score: 0 / 10",The Haunted Mansion
15,HotToastyRag,Great tribute to the ride,8,28 September 2021,"Many Disneyland rides were inspired by Disney movies, so it's really cute that the studio wanted to produce a couple of movies inspired by the rides instead. Those of you who love waiting in line for the Haunted Mansion ride will definitely want to check out the Eddie Murphy spooky movie of the same title.Eddie plays a workaholic who ignores his family; he's played that type many times, but if you like Imagine That, Doctor Dolittle, and A Thousand Words, you'll like his character in this one too. After all, he always learns his lesson! In this one, both he and his wife, Marsha Thomason, are realtors. They get a call from a mysterious man, Nathaniel Parker, wanting to sell his mansion, and even though his request to come over immediately in the middle of the night is a bit odd, they want the commission so they pack the car with their kids and drive over.The mansion itself is beautiful - the creepy ones always are, aren't they? But once the family is safely inside, mysterious forces conspire to keep them there. Is it the weather, the floating psychic head of Jennifer Tilly, the creepy butler, or the strange feeling that the place is haunted? As a side note, when your kids get scared of Terence Stamp, you're going to have to work to convince them that forty years ago he was young and gorgeous. Everyone gets old, folks. But I still like him.The story itself is interesting, but the great part of this movie is the obvious: how it ties in with the ride. As someone who's gone inside the Anaheim Haunted Mansion dozens of times, I loved seeing all the little touches, like the carriage, the ghosts in the cemetary, the pictures whose portraits change, and the dialogue taken from the ride's famous narration. It was a little scarier than I thought it would be, but then again, when I was little, I was too scared to go inside the house at all. A delightful treat for the whole family (if everyone is old enough to enjoy scary movies), and a perfect pick for Halloween!Kiddy Warning: Obviously, you have control over your own children. However, I know this is a Disney movie, but the ending does get a bit scary, so I'd wait until my kids were in the double-digits before letting them watch it.",The Haunted Mansion

Smelling the biggest deal of their career, Jim, Sara and their two children pay a visit to the mansion, located on a remote bayou. A torrential thunderstorm strands the Evers family in the old mansion with the brooding, eccentric Gracey, his mysterious butler, Ramsley, and a variety of residents both seen and unseen. At first Jim scoffs at Gracey's stories about ghosts and hauntings, until he unearths the mystery of the mansion and finds that his wife Sara has unexpected connections to its haunted past....The thing is when you base a film on a theme park ride, you cannot help but use the same story and narrative. This film could have been done very seriously and been made into something that could have had the potential to be quite scary, but even Disney wouldn't take that gamble.The film is fine, Murphy is the reason to watch this, but the film is rarely funny and never scary.

The movie is has quite a bit of comedy in it and really cool special effects for a family/kids Disney film.

20,OllieSuave-007,Better than I've expected!,8,29 October 2016,"Based off of the Haunted Mansion attraction at Disneyland, this movie is about Realtor Jim Evers whom was asked to to sell the famed mansion by the owner. So, he and his family are summoned to the mysterious place and soon ends up being caught in its paranormal world.It's a better film that I've expected - solid plot, funny (but not over-the-top) acting, incredible visual effects, and catchy music. I liked all the references to the Disneyland attraction like Madame Leota, the singing busts, the lost traveler and his dog, the moving portraits and the floating candlesticks. The story about the groom looking for his lost bride fits the attraction-based movie well and it mixes in with the Evers realty subplot perfectly.Eddie Murphy was his classic funny self and gave off some really hilarious moments in the movie, especially him getting creep-ed out by all the hauntings in the old house. His kids in the movie, though, were a tad annoying at times, but I could tolerate them. The ghost characters were entertaining to watch; especially liked the famous Madame Leota character - floating around in her crystal ball with intrigue and suspense.The film, though, could have used more creepy and gotcha moments, but overall, it's an entertaining family film.Grade B+",The Haunted Mansion
21,bensonmum2,"""How wonderful. You're going to kill a ghost.""",3,26 June 2021,"Realtor Jim Evers (Eddie Murphy) and family visit a large, creepy mansion that Evers may have the opportunity to sell. But the mansion's owner has a secret reason for summoning the Evers family. The owner is actually a ghost. He's haunted the old house looking for his long lost love. It seems that Evers' wife is the spitting image for the dead woman. Can Evers put a stop to the unholy union and save his family?Over the years, the family and I have been to Disneyworld about a dozen times. There is no attraction at Disney that I look forward to as much as The Haunted Mansion. I love it! Unfortunately, the same can't be said for this film. While there are a lot of things that I dislike about The Haunted Mansion (the movie), my biggest complaint is just how dull it all is. Re-watching last night, it put me to sleep. I had to slog my way through the rest today. The story is predictable, the comedy doesn't work, and I wasn't invested in the characters. As a result, I find it to be one incredibly boring experience. None of the charm and joy I feel on the ride are in the film. My reaction to the movie is the exact opposite.Eddie Murphy may be known for his comedic abilities, but I don't remember his performance bringing so much as a smile to my face. Whether it's his fault or the writers (more likely), nothing he says or does works on me. Also, I'm kind of surprised that Disney cast Murphy in the lead here. This was right in the middle of his run in the wildly successful, non-Disney Shrek series.There are some homages the film pays to the ride that I appreciate. From the singing cemetery busts to the wedding dress in the attic to the hitchhiking ghosts to Madame Leota (Meg Tilley is easily my favorite thing about the movie), fans of the ride will enjoy these touches.3/10.",The Haunted Mansion

23,tabuno,Fun But Irritating Eddie Murphy,7,25 January 2019,"28 November 2003. This delightful Casper-like movie for a more intelligent youthful audience (more grown up kids) was fun and entertaining but Eddie Murphy seemed to get in his own way. His own brand of humor and his perpetual Shrek-like character just wasn't in sync with the rest of the movie and trying to make this otherwise comedy-drama-horror-ghost-thriller in a Murphy vehicle was a mistake. The comedy other than Murphy, Murphy, Murphy was sharp, the judicious use of special effects consistent with the movie's theme, the relational angles good, but the director allowing Murphy to do his stuff over and over and over again became somewhat nauseous. It would have been nice to have see Eddie Murphy do something funny differently this time around. I would say he was miscast, its just there was too much of what Murphy has always done.

24,Rectangular_businessman,Terrible,1,30 June 2012,"This movie is horrible.It is one of the worst family films ever made, being shallow, dumb, annoying and soulless. It was quite clear from the beginning that here the producers wanted to achieve the same success from the ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" franchise (Since those movies and this one are inspired Films based on theme-park attractions) but at least, ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" have a nice visual style and some entertainment value.This has nothing of that, being an obnoxious and dull. The plot is almost non-existent, being just an excuse to show lots and lots of special effects and add some bad comedy sequences. The characters are the most uninteresting ones that I have seen in a film of this kind: They had zero personality, and were annoying at best. The jokes from this movie are stupid and unfunny.This movie is a complete waste of time, without any redeeming value. ""The Haunted Mansion"" had zero artistic or entertainment value, being one of the worst films for the whole family ever made, and the worst Eddie Murphy movie (And that's saying something)",The Haunted Mansion

26,lukem-52760,A GORGEOUS LOOKING GHOSTLY COMEDY ADVENTURE,7,14 March 2020,"Eddie Murphy is great fun as usual & has always been a favourite of mine as i grew up watching his Classic 80's & 90's films. Since the 2000's, Comedy legend Eddie Murphy has become a more goofy but fun family friendly movie star as he's moved onto big budget family films like ""Daddy Day Care"" & ""I Spy"" & ""Meet Dave"" & ""Dr. Doolittle 2"" & the ""Shrek"" films, so Murphy has become a new Comedy star for a new generation of kids which is nice & has kept his Career very much alive & relevant.
I've enjoyed pretty much most of his films & Murphy always cheers me up. My favourite Eddie Murphy movie would have to be his 90's Comedy CLASSIC ""The Nutty professor"" & i loved it's goofy-silly sequel & I've got big Nostalgia love for the first ""Dr. Doolittle"" film, but hey i like most of his films.
This big budget supernatural fantasy family comedy-adventure is another great film to add to your Eddie Murphy collection. ""The Haunted Mansion"" is a beautiful looking film with some of the best & detailed products design I've ever seen in a movie, especially in a family comedy!!! The huge Haunted Mansion set is absolutely beautiful & visually stunning with gorgeous cinematography. The special effects are fantastic as this is a huge mega budget Disney production, so everything looks spectacular & the best of the best, like the Zombie scene that is done like a proper Horror movie sequence with fantastic looking Zombies created by legendary movie effects master, Rick Baker.The simple story is about a busy realter (Eddie Murphy) & his family are summoned to a massive old mansion & discover it's haunted & must try to solve the mystery of the mansion. Also it's about Jim Evers (Murphy) realising he's been neglecting his family & wants to be there more & take them on an adventure but of course they end up at the ""Haunted Mansion"" it's a nice sweet funny family film but also a really great supernatural adventure with Horror elements.
There's still a heart & that sweet Disney magic toward the end but it all plays out nicely.
If you like Horror movies then this is a really nice watered-down version, thats still rich with stunning gothic scenery & a real spooky atmosphere complete with a rain storm & lightening. The Ghost effects are Awesome & very glowing & colourful.A great fun ghostly fantasy comedy with a great Eddie Murphy.
One of Murphy's best ""Family"" films.",The Haunted Mansion
27,jfgibson73,Low Expectations,4,26 May 2013,"I heard it was terrible, so I went a long time without watching it. But since I like the ride so much, I wanted to see it in case there were even a few things from the attraction that they working in successfully. As a fan of the attraction, I angrily hate this movie. It is so far off from something so well done, it shouldn't even exist. But watching it with my young daughter, who knows nothing about the ride, I saw it a different way. It drew her in immediately and kept her attention. She wanted to see what happened to the family, and things progressed at a good rate. Nothing was too intense, although not every kid will be able to handle the crypt scene. So from that point of view, it is an entertaining family film that works good as a first scary movie. I still hope they make another one that is more for fans of the attraction, though.",The Haunted Mansion
28,TOMNEL,Not as bad as many lead you to believe.,6,17 April 2007,"This was a very poorly reviewed film, and it didn't deserve such flack. For me, it was a dumb, entertaining movie with some heart. For others, it was a terrible job of emulating the classic Disney ride and just another stupid Eddie Murphy comedy vehicle. Though I'd rather go on the ride as opposed to watching this, it still has it's charm. This movie is about a Realtor (Murphy) and his family traveling to a haunted mansion for a business deal. While in the house they learn some strange things and end up traveling through various rooms found in the ride (the bride, the ballroom, Madame Leota, the graveyard with the singing busts). In the end, this is a fun movie for kids, and amusing for adults, with fun references, and a fun performance by Murphy and the kids.My rating: ** 1/2 out of ****. 85 mins.

29,aidanratesmovies,Not as bad as the critics say,5,22 October 2021,"Entertaining, if rather corny, this Eddie Murphy led family comedy may not have as much charm as the filmmakers originally intended- but it does still manage to be a rather fun time. This films script is nothing new, a rather bland daily goes to a mansion where a bland series of tragic events from the past have occured and hijinks ensue from there. The special effects can be rather dated at times, especially the CGI, and some of the performances can be overdone. The dialogue can be a bit repetitive at times as well, and its story familiar, but despite all of its flaws- the film does manage to be entertaining to watch. Murphy isn't anything special in this film, but he does make the film very watchable, as well as his onscreen wife played by actress Marsha Thomason, and of course the legendary Wallace Shawn adding his signature campiness throughout. It's not much, but it does mean well and can be rather sweet. It's a fun halloween watch, and despite its flaws, it's able to hold its own among the countless horrendous live action Disney adaptations over the years. It may not be anything groundbreaking, but it does manage to be better than most.My Rating: 5.5/10.",The Haunted Mansion
30,Kamurai25,"""Love from Times Past""",6,18 October 2020,"Good watch, could watch again, and can recommend.Eddie Murphy is almost always a good watch, even under his horrible Disney contract.The sheer amount of production value in the movie to make the mansion look as good as it does, plus all the ghost effects, is daunting. The story is good, and the way they go about investigating the mystery is good in the traditional sense: a good cycle of drip fed information, search and discovery.The premise of the haunting itself isn't that interesting, but it is somewhat compelling that it has a ""Beauty and the Beast"" vibe to it, and Terence Stamp does ""creepy old guy"" very well.The kids are fun, and the movie has a certain amount of charm to it, but nothing about the movie really stands out as amazing.",The Haunted Mansion

32,MartianOctocretr5,Lifeless humor that should have been embalmed,4,21 August 2006,"After the surprising success of Pirates of the Caribbean, it was inevitable a second theme park ride would find its way to the movie screen. Actually, the idea was promising; haunted houses are no strangers to cinematic success. The film made some playful references to the ride it's modeled after, but somewhere during the ride, it forgot to include a plot.The line from the ride ""there are 999 happy haunts...there's room for one more"" is about all they offered as a plot premise here. A family takes a look at a long abandoned mansion for sale: guess which one. Eddie Murphy's machine gun style of line delivery, where he endlessly babbles on, never coming up for air or letting anyone else talk works in his role as a real estate agent, but for only so long. It becomes annoying, then disturbing; ultimately, you just hope the ghosts croak him.There are some brief scares, and a few laugh lines. I especially liked the disembodied head that reads crystal balls, which was a clever and humorous incorporation of an original element of the Mansion. However, the story really doesn't go anywhere. There's some spooks chasing people around who have some issues left over from their corporal existences, but nothing of memorable value.Less of Murphy's mouth. More plot. Ghosts given something to actually do. These and other improvements might have helped; instead, the whole thing dies and smells like a rotting corpse. Close the coffin.",The Haunted Mansion

I didn't think any movie could top Pluto Nash in suckyness.  This one did.  Eddie Murphy , as much as I want to see him in a comedy , um like did not act in the movie.  Perhaps he's on drugs?  I think he was doing an impression of John Wayne.  Reading the lines outloud.  The kids didn't help much.  Most of the ghosts didn't seem to have any acting skills.  Though it was nice to see the guy from the princess bride.Marsha Thomason was perhaps the only attraction.  She has hope in a career. The acting was so so.  Better direction should improve her.  She's just stunning.  I swear I've seen her elsewhere.  She almost looks like Aaliyah.Terrance Stamp is fairly good, but hey the script is utterly dumb  It's boring.  No replay value.  Our crystal ball is starring Jennifer Tilly, and that's usually a bad sign.By the end, frankly I could care less who gets who.  The before credits ending was rushed.

35,Beta_Gallinger,"Not much of a comedy, but a slightly better movie than I thought",6,3 May 2008,"In 2003, ""Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl"", based on a Disney theme park ride, turned out to be a big hit. So, a follow-up soon came, another film based on a Disney ride. This movie was ""The Haunted Mansion"", which flopped. I remember seeing this on the small screen about four years ago, and do not recall being too impressed. However, my memory of the first viewing wasn't 100% clear, and I have gotten around to watching it a second time several years later, despite low expectations. At first, it seemed my expectations were being met, but eventually, they were slightly surpassed.Jim Evers is a workaholic real estate agent who runs a business with his wife, Sara, called Evers and Evers Real Estate. Jim has been working so much that he hasn't had much family time lately, which his wife is not happy about. One night, Sara receives a call from a mansion called Gracey Manor, which the owners are apparently planning to sell. Jim sees this as a great opportunity to make a lot of money, so on the weekend, the entire family leaves home (even though Sara is the only one who is wanted at the mansion), and he promises this will be a family trip. When they are finished at the mansion, they are supposed to leave and have their family trip, but due to the weather, they are forced to stay overnight. During the night, the Evers' find themselves in different mysterious parts of the building, gradually learning the ghastly truth about the place! I can tell you for certain that the humour in this movie is NOT why I give it an above average rating. As a comedy, this movie is definitely a failure if you ask me, and most would probably agree. I did find some mildly amusing scenes, but not too many, and certainly nothing hilarious. For the most part, it's very straight-faced, at least for adults, no doubt about that. It seems Madame Leota is supposed to a very humorous character, but that doesn't work out. There's also some pretty poor dialogue at times, such as, ""Well, some people have swimming pools, others have private cemeteries. It can happen,"" which is another thing that makes the film lose points. However, later on in the film, I found quite a bit of suspense, and for that reason, I can't exactly say it was a boring film overall. At least it does have its moments. The film certainly doesn't have the most original premise, but that doesn't mean it can't be entertaining.""The Haunted Mansion"" is generally thought of as a bad movie, it seems, and when movies are as poorly received as this, I usually don't find any entertainment value in them. I may have been with the majority the first time I watched this movie based on the Disney theme park ride, but I guess I'm not anymore (though I may be pretty close), even though it's certainly not a must-see in my book, and I wouldn't want to watch it multiple times. Some people might hate me for giving it an above average rating, but I can't let the opinions of others completely control me. This Disney effort definitely could have been better, and it may have been rushed after ""Pirates of the Caribbean"", without as much focus and care as it could have used. As a result, it turned out to be far from Oscar material, but much worse has been done, that's for sure.",The Haunted Mansion
36,phubbs,The Haunted Mansion,6,1 January 2014,"Ah 2003, the start of Disney's major theme park ride adaptations into the movies...not counting a few earlier nondescript flicks and 'Mission to Mars' which I never realised was a theme park adaptation. If you think about this premise you could be forgiven for thinking it would turn out crap, especially with Eddie Murphy involved. And you wouldn't be far wrong on that one point, the casting of Murphy and his 'family' members in this film was a terrible choice.The reason being they all stick out like a sore thumb in the story, they all look totally out of place and none can act too well. The film has been turned into a Murphy vehicle and the film suffers for it, it feels forced, his family in the film feel forced and fake, the silly humour and annoying dialog from Murphy feels forced and its all in there simply for Murphy, awful decision.That aside the rest of the film is actually pretty sweet. The plot has been cleverly turned into a romantic ghost tale where upon the mansions owner is seeking his one true love whom he lost centuries ago. Of course his true love is Murphy's living wife so a battle of supernatural proportions ensues as Murphy must stop this aristocratic spook floating off with his wife.What works is the extra casting of the main ghost servants and their master within the mansion. Stamp is perfect as the stiff upper lipped butler with a dark secret, Wallace Shawn is perfect as the quirky sidekick footman ghost, Tilly is surprisingly good as the crystal ball gypsy spirit and Nathaniel Parker plays the noble British toff manor owner to a tee complete with thick dark locks. Not too sure how these ghosts work though, at times they can't or don't seem to interact with the living, then all of a sudden they can touch and pick things up.Its all very clichéd and hammy of course being based on a stereotypical haunted house attraction but that's fine, you expect that. In fact they capture that atmosphere perfectly, the whole eccentric Disney ambiance coupled with an eerie fanciful glow. Indeed the film does work better if you have actually been on the attraction at Disney World. There are many many little homages to the ride throughout the film from visual references to dialog, some sequences showing identical sections from the attraction. It does sounds kinda tacky but it really works nicely and gives you a pleasant ghostly trip down memory lane.I really liked how the ghosts become 'more dead' visually the further from the mansion they are. So once outside all the ghosts have a really cool supernatural blue glow or aura which looks quite striking. I liked the graveyard and how it housed many of the ghosts from the attraction including the three famous hitchhiker spooks. As said I also liked the replication of sets from the attraction too, the hallway of portraits being the main one easily. One thing I didn't like was the swamp set New Orleans look for the mansion, not my personal cup of tea, I prefer the Liberty Square Dutch Gothic design from Disney World's Magic Kingdom.But how did that ghostly horse drawn hearse crash through the walls of the mansion complete with Murphy and co inside?. How would ghosts be able to knock through walls when they are...errr ghosts. And how on earth would living people be able to go through the wall with the ghosts??.On the whole the film does look really good and clearly a lot of thought and craftsmanship went into making the visuals realistic. Its really nice (and amazingly surprising) that they actually constructed the mansion instead of relying on CGI. The interiors and props all benefit from genuine craftsmanship too which really sets the mood, for all you 'Nightmare Before Christmas'/Addams Family/Munster lovers out there (like me) you'll love it.This is a film you really really really really did expect to be utter utter utter tripe...but its not!. Its actually a really decent looking light-hearted supernatural ride just like the real attraction. The homages are great for folk who have been to the attraction but for those who haven't they just come across as neat spooky visual candy. As I said the only let down is Murphy and co as the endangered mortal family, well mainly Murphy. His tomfoolery lets down the quite decent performances of the supernatural cast.6.5/10",The Haunted Mansion

Much of the stuff in the movie is the same as the ride, but in the movie, you cant experience it for yourself.  Even though it is another movie ride, it wasnt that bad. A lot of the actors in this film have been in previous Disney films such as Eddie Murphy, who led an exceptional role, and Wallace Shawn who has been on Teachers Pet(tv show), and My Favorite Martian.  Most of the scenes shot in this movie were very good, including one where Eddie Murphys character spins around the room, with a crystal ball.

39,aesgaard41,Almost There Movie,7,31 January 2008,"This was a very made effort to create a movie to go with the Haunted Mansion ride in Disneyland. The effects are appealing, the cast is delightful, the set is a character in itself and the plot is enjoyable... up to a point. It's the typical idea of the working man played by Eddie Murphy not spending enough time with his family; an idea quickly turning into a cliché, but barely updated and hardly believable. There's no new spin. Eddie forces the family to tag along with his wife to look at a house on the way to an outing, but the house turns out to be haunted and an extremely convenient storm forces them to stay the night. Eddie works good in the family movie. He does great as the loving but strict dad, and Terence Stamp adds to the atmosphere. Wallace Shaw is fun to watch as he chews the scenery, shadowing Dina Waters whose cuteness and presence keeps her afloat. Sadly, Nathaniel Parker is forced to be a supporting character behind them, but his elegant presence and regal posture nearly makes up for it. The true star is the house, for what we see of it, and the ghosts, dimensional and stereotypical as they are. Where it falls apart is the ending. The love story tag is forced where it shouldn't have been. It tries too hard and in the end effects the mood. I think it would have worked better stating a ghost story than a love story. Kids may like the movie, but parents, unless they like haunted houses filtered through family movies, won't.",The Haunted Mansion

At Gracey Manor, Mr. Gracey is enamored with Sara, and they discover that Sara looks like Mr. Gracey's old girlfriend Elizabeth, who died young and they think it was suicide...or was it?

This is one of those movies that I never saw in theaters, but have seen it on Disney Channel a few years ago because there was nothing to watch for me.While it's not as bad as Battlefield Earth, Batman & Robin, The Garbage Pail Kids Movie, and Kazaam (those were terrible movies, but I digress), this adaptation of a ride from Disneyworld is not that good either. The story's predictable with it's painfully obvious anti-climatic ending and the dialog didn't surprise me at all. Even the humor wasn't that funny at all and some of the lines in the script are repetitive.There are some good things that saved this movie. The cinematography's very nice and the visuals are impressive with some great music that gives the movie an atmospheric charm to it. The costume designs are cool and the special effects are the best I've ever seen in most movies. The cast isn't that bad either. Eddie Murphy was good, but didn't quite handle the script. Marsha Thomason and the kids were good and so was Wallace Shawn and Nathaniel Parker, but I think that Jennifer Tilly steals the show for having some great lines as Madame Leota. Terence Stamp, however, is quite underused with the material he's been given.Overall, not as bad as some say it is, but with a much better story and a better script, it would've been so much better. I've heard that there's gonna be a reboot and it sounds like it's going to be written and produced by Guillermo del Toro while Disney is trying to find a new director for the remake.

The art direction is beautiful, and there are plenty of visual gems. The ghosts seen in the graveyard are probably the best part of the movie.

I have been to the one in Disney World and it is one of my favorites. The ride features ghosts, ghouls, and haunts that are amusing and fun. This movie, however is far from the ride.Although it centers around the Gracey Mansion which is the same as the ride it is based upon, the movie The Haunted Mansion isn't that good. The only thing worth watching are the comparisons to the actual ride. Much like Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl, they makers of the film put in features from the ride like Madame Leota's head in a glass ball and the singing statues. These were all cute and a nice touch, but the plot of the movie is incredibly boring. It centers around Jim Evers (Eddie Murphy) and his family trying to make a deal on the house for his job. The kids are tricked into going and it seems like Jim is losing his family. When weird things start to happen around the house, it seems that Jim must save his family from certain disaster when some of the ghost mistake his wife for another woman who already passed on.The story itself is cute, but lacks luster.

46,christian123,Below Average Kid's Film,3,13 July 2005,"The Haunted Mansion is a lame children's film that is short on laughs and a good story. Realtor Jim Evers and his wife and business partner Sara get a call from mansion owner Edward Gracey, who is looking to sell his property. Smelling the biggest deal of their career, Jim, Sara and their two children pay a visit to the mansion, located on a remote bayou. A thunderstorm strands the Evers family in the old mansion with the brooding, eccentric Gracey, his mysterious butler, Ramsley, and a variety of residents both seen and unseen. Will they be able to figure out what's going on and survive the night? The plot is based on a ride so I wouldn't really expect a really good story. However, the story is weaker then expected and its stupid. Kids won't be interested in the story though, they just want a fun film to watch. Kids may have some fun but anyone over the age of twelve probably won't. Its just a bit of a boring ride since there is really nothing exciting about the film. The acting is, at best, average with the best being Jennifer Tilly. She is a bit underrated and she would sometimes have some really funny lines. Eddie Murphy was enjoyable to watch in Daddy Day Care but he is really bad in this film. Terence Stamp plays the butler and does an okay job. Marsha Thomason plays Sarah and she did a terrible job. She was really boring to watch on screen and didn't show a lot of emotion either. Marc John Jefferies and Aree Davis play their two kids and they both actually give tolerable performances. Rob Minkoff seems to have lost his touch after making The Lion King since his last two kid films have been average at best. The best thing about the Haunted Mansion is that it had pretty good special effects. Nothing spectacular, but still not too cheesy looking. The music was horrible, but I guess they were trying to get a scary vibe which didn't work. The film is of course not scary and I don't think it was trying to be scary. If the film was supposed to be scary then it might work on little kids but it's a weak effort. The running time is only 97 minutes which makes the movie a little more tolerable to watch. Its better then The Country Bears but not as good as Pirates of the Caribbean. It's also not as good as Daddy Day Care which was a lot more enjoyable to watch. In the end, Haunted Mansion has little going for it as its hurt by shoddy direction and a weak script, there are few positives to be found here so I recommend you just skip it.

47,PeterRoeder,Very good movie!,7,7 March 2004,"I saw this movie with my mother yesterday, and I think it is great. The horror elements are very good. It is funny in the best Disney-like way, the ending is great and Eddie Murphy is great in the lead role. The ghost story, although not too surprising, makes a lot of sense and is very touching. I almost couldn't help crying towards the end where all the ghosts go to Heaven. This movie is build on the attraction in Disney land by the same name. I went there with my mother 14 years ago. That was pretty funny, although it's not as scary as similar horror attractions in the Copenhagen area where I live. Anyway, this movie is highly recommended if you like horror or was born in the 80s and grew up watching Eddie Murphy movies like The Golden Child and Beverly Hills Cop.",The Haunted Mansion
48,AndyVanScoyoc,This is one movie best to avoid...Possible Spoilers,3,12 November 2004,"I was so excited when the previews for this movie came out...I simply had to see it. As a professional, Goth/Macabre/Erotica author, anything chilling, romantically tragic and down right elegantly creepy is right up my alley. From the first glimpses of the mansion and the surely wonderful scenes I would see, I was ready to go. I was *very* doubtful about Eddie Murphy being in this movie (his comedic talent is better used elsewhere where he can actually be funny) but I decided to give it a try...Now...I wish that I hadn't.Was this movie supposed to be a kid's movie? Was it supposed to be a teenager's movie? What WAS this movie supposed to be? Whatever it was supposed to be, romantic, tragic, funny, thrilling...it didn't make it. The plot, the story and the acting got terribly lost *somewhere* in it and was never found. This movie has so much wrong with it that I hardly know where to start, so I will simply stick with the acting.First off, the cast with the exceptions of Nathaniel Parker, Terence Stamp and Jennifer Tilly was a disaster...Where they ""dug"" this cast up, I have no idea, but they should have re-buried them. Wallace Shawn and Dina Spybey were absolutely great in their parts, but you can't expect two funny and cute people to carry an entire movie...the way this movie was laid out, they were expected to do far too much work and that was simply too much to ask. Nathaniel Parker's obviously beautiful and elegant acting talents were so far wasted in this movie that I felt sorry for him. Take the *entire* cast away, give him the house, a roaring fire in the study, and a wonderful wardrobe of silken smoking jackets, black pants and dress shoes and let *him* do his own movie filled with ghosts and things that go bump in the night and I would gladly buy a ticket to see it.Terence Stamp's broad range of acting talent was also a total waste in this movie and a few times judging by the expressions on his face, he may have thought so too. Jennifer Tilly was the only truly saving grace for this film and then yet again, she couldn't have been expected to carry it any more than she did.Marsha Thomason should have been far bypassed for this film. I think her talents could have been better used elsewhere as well. It was painfully obvious that she, nor could anyone else in this movie with possibly the exception of Terence Stamp, hold anywhere near the court that Nathaniel Parker did when called to be entrancing and tragic...she just was not believable.The only reason I own this movie is to look at the beautiful settings (the house is magnificent on the grandest scale, and the cemetery is wonderful!) and to sigh forlornly alongside the elegant and ever so dashing Nathaniel Parker who was truly one devastatingly tragic and beautiful ghost...Avoid this movie...",The Haunted Mansion

First of all, Eddie Murphy does not belong in this movie at all, he just does not fit in with this movie.  And the leading lady was a poor choice as a supporting cast as well as the two bratty know it all kids who looked more like rejects from some shelter with crappy one liners through the movie.  Even the plot of the story was bad, a man who fell in love with his fiance' in whom he was to marry dies of a supposedly suicide and years later he tries to bring her back to life and fall in love with him again by locating Eddie Murphys wife who we find that she is not his fiance' reincarnated but then she is and then she isn't again and the whole movie is just one mess.

51,Brogan,"Ride the ride, skip the movie.",5,25 November 2003,"For me The Haunted Mansion at Disneyland is one of my favorite rides at the entire park.  I put it high on my list along with Splash Mountain and Space Mountain.  I even enjoy it more than Pirates of the Carribean.  I even have a copy of the limited soundtrack of the entire ride, as well as the other ""Haunted"" houses at Disney parks worldwide.  For me The Haunted Mansion was the ultimate spook house ride, adding thrills, chills, with state of the art special effects.  When I saw the movie, my hopes were high considering that the Disney Studio did a decent job of making a ride into a film with PIRATES, but after watching the movie, I was extremely disappointed. The story involves Jim Evers (Eddie Murphy) a successful real estate seller along with his wife/partner Sara (Marsh Thompson).  When the Evers advertisement flier was left in front of the mansion, Sara gets a phone call to arrive at the mansion alone for a proposition.  Jim who messed up his anniversary, decides to take Sara and their two children, 13 year old Megan (Aree Davis) and 10 year old Michael (Marc John Jefferies) along with them to the lake.  But when Jim hears Sara taking the phone call about the mansion, he sees it as a real estate opportunity. When they arrive at the mansion, they are greeted by a emotionless and creepy butler Ramsley (Terence Stamp) who works for Master Gracey (Nathaniel Parker). The mystery about why Ramsley and Gracey invited Sara to the mansion has something to do with Gracey's past, as Jim along with Megan and Michael discover the secrets among the mansion. I will say that when I was watching the movie, at the beginning it looked very promising.  The story for the movie was going along with the ride and I was getting pleased with the film.  Then after the credits, and opening scene, Eddie Murphy's character appears, and for a few minutes I thought I was watching deleted scenes or a sequel to DADDY DAY CARE.  I was sitting there wondering, this movie is ""The Haunted Mansion?""  This is suppose to be based on the ultimate spook ride on any amusement park, and it seems way too much like a family comedy. Then as the movie progressed, I was pleased with the sets, the costumes, and even the plot involving Ramsley and Master Gracey, but it was the presence of Eddie Murphy that was really bothering me.  It felt like that I was riding the Haunted Mansion ride, yet I was sitting next to an obnoxious and chatter mouth man in the ""doom buggy,"" (which is how I felt about Eddie Murphy in this film). Then more things began to bother me, the throw away characters of Ezra (Wallace ""Inconceivable!"" Shawn) and Emma (Dina Spybey).  It's bad enough that Shawn has to keep saying ""Unexplainable!"" to try to get some laughs out of the adults who recognize him from PRINCESS BRIDE (it doesn't work).  Then there is the character of Madame Leota (Jennifer Tilly) who I thought was a great choice for the film and does appear at first to be what I expected, similar to the ride, creepy and mysterous.  Then, in order to obtain the ""Disney cuteness"" they make her a reoccurring character, even having a scene with the crystal ball being fasten in a seatbelt in a car, oh boy. I did enjoy also the references the movie made to the ride (the statues that follow your move before going on the doom buggie).  Then there were scenes where some of the ride refrences could have been a little more scarier or just plain better. Like the singing statues, they should have been singing ""Grim Grining Ghosts"" a song that is used on the ride and even creates that frightening image of their presence.  Instead, for yuks they sing ""By the Light of the Silvery Moon"" or ""She'll Be Comimg 'Round the Mountain,"" ho ho, ha ha. For me it seemed like that director Rob Minkoff was trying to use elements from GHOSTBUSTERS and THE MUMMY in trying to make HAUNTED MANSION successful, he failed.  What he should have done was watch PIRATES then possibly rework the film to get the feel of what it takes to make a feature film based on a popular theme park attraction.  Also, Eddie Murphy, I felt was a MAJOR casting error. It gets very annoying very fast when a actor has to make a wise-crack with every scary image or object that is being shown. Plus, like all comedians, when the actor is ""mugging"" the camera thinking the material is funny, it's not funny to the audience.  Comedy works with reaction and surprise, by telling a joke and thinking it's funny, the joke turns out to be annoying, and that is what Murphy was in this film.  I enjoy Eddie Murphy, TRADING PLACES, 48 HRS., and BEVERLY HILLS COP were great!  Even Eddie Murphy ""toned down"" in NUTTY PROFESSOR, BOWFINGER, SHOWTIME, and DADDY DAY CARE were enjoyable. Then again, Murphy starred in VAMPIRE IN BROOKLYN and PLUTO NASH, and we all know how those films turned out. In this film, he comes off more annoying than anything else, similar to his vocal role in SHREK (which I thought was a very overrated film), it seems that Murphy was limited to what he could say and react since Disney wanted this to be ""a blockbuster family film.""  Murphy should have gotten advice from Ramsley (Terence Stamp who also co-starred with Murphy in the hilarious BOWFINGER) with K.I.T. (keep it together) and that is what Murphy really should have done with his performance in this film.Why did Minkoff try to make HAUNTED MANSION more cute than frightening? Because it carried the Disney logo? That didn't stop other more intellectual and dark films like BLACK HOLE and TRON from being made. It seems that PIRATES director Gore Verbinski didn't set any barriers with tone of violence and fright and made PIRATES a enjoyable picture.  With HAUNTED MANSION, Minkoff appeared to try to make the film scary, but not too scary, since I'm sure the Disney executives were saying, ""there will be five year olds in the audience, this is our blockbuster Holiday family picture Rob."" Overall, I wanted to enjoy THE HAUNTED MANSION but I couldn't, and I'm pretty darn lenient when it comes to liking movies (I enjoyed LEAGUE OF EXTRADONARY GENTLEMEN for pete's sake!)  But it felt like I was cheated and robbed of what I wanted this movie to be.  The movie had the sets, make-up, and special effects; but that doesn't make it a good movie.  I haven't been this disappointed in a anticipated film since MEN IN BLACK II.  Go ahead and see it, but... BEWARE! *** (out of five)",The Haunted Mansion
52,ScottDMenzel,A decent family horror film but may be to scary for some little kids,6,27 December 2003,"When I first seen the trailer for this movie, I was like oh no not another Eddie Murphy film. I am so tired of Eddie Murphy; he hasn't made a good movie since the early 90's. This was the main reason I didn't really want to see this movie. But somehow after seeing a ton of trailers for it and a bunch of TV Spots I decided to take one of my brothers to see this film. Luckily for me it wasn't as bad as I thought it was going to be.The movie is like a regular haunted house movie just toned down with very little cursing and some humor. My brother Jaharan, who is 8, jumped a few times because he found it scary at times. I have to give Disney credit here because they tried to expand their normal family goodness films. Disney tried to make a horror film that you can take kids between the ages of 6 and up to. The film at times is very detailed which may fly over the little kids heads. I heard someone behind me in the theater ask a few times isn't this kid's movie and what is this film rated. Disney for once uses their name on a film that isn't like the normal Disney style. They didn't use their name in the credits on Pirates of the Caribbean when it was in the theater. I don't know why.The acting in this film was pretty decent surprisingly. Eddie Murphy wasn't too annoying so that is always a plus.  Terrance Stamp was very good as Ramsley, same goes for Nathaniel Thomason as Master Gracey. Eddie Murphy's wife in the film Sara Evers played by Marsha Thomason gave the best performance. The directing was pretty decent as well. There were a lot of quick camera movements and good angles. The settings were pretty cool. I liked the whole gothic feel of the house and the background sets. Disney did a nice job in that department.So in conclusion, Haunted Mansion is nowhere as good as the Pirates of the Caribbean but if you want to see Disney try to make a Tim Burton Movie without Tim Burton then go see the Haunted Mansion. It has a little bit of laughs, a little bit of scares, and a little good ole wholesome Disney Ending to make you always remember it is a Disney film. It's really not as bad as the trailer made it look. So if your bored one day check it out at the matinee or wait to watch it on video or DVD when it hits the rental selves. My final rating for Haunted Mansion is a 6/10.",The Haunted Mansion
53,iwatcheverything,How to scare your kids!,7,26 November 2003,Lesson one:  Let them see this movie.  This is not the comedy that the trailer portrayed but is more of a light humored Poltergiest (which was also rated PG).  I enjoyed it myself of course but would probably not take kids under 9 or 10.  Eddie Murphey is still funny but I still liked him better in his R rated films.  The special effects were pretty good but nothing just outstanding.  This film was not bad considering it was based on an amusment park ride.  I would go watch this again and I probably will own it.  It was fun entertainment for almost the whole family.

54,RhapsodyReviews,Better Than What People Say.,7,23 October 2019,"Review:
'The Haunted Mansion' is a supernatural-horror-comedy directed by by Rob Minkoff. It is based on the Disney theme park attraction of the same name.
The film revolves around Jim Evers (Eddie Murphy) is a successful real-estate agent along with his partner wife, Sarah (Marsha Thomason), but doesn't seem to find the time to spend quality time with his family. He's missed soccer games, anniversaries and barbeques for his work. Seeing his problem, Jim decides to take the entire family out to the lake for the weekend to make up for his mistakes. At the last minute, Sarah receives a call for her to stop by the Gracey Manor to help sell the decrepit estate. She first declines but Jim urges her to take up the offer for the sake of the business and the family. Unfortunately, they get more then they bargained for as creepy incidents occur around every corner and the entire mansion itself seems to be hiding a disturbing secret.
The cast in this movie is a bunch of no names, but they try to their best, which works effectively for the most part. Eddie Murphy leads the group with a moderate performance as Jim Evers. The problem lies in the fact that Murphy is not all that funny in the feature and really isn't given anything to do that gets a laugh.
This movie is one of those movies that have no reason to have all of the hare it has. I personally like everything it has t offer, and that might be because I know what it's going for where it seems a lot of people don't. It's a family movie at its core but with a horror-comedy element in there.
Overall, it's a movie that knows what it wants to be. Not everybody is going to love it, but it's one I can definitely recommend.

55,highwaytourist,"Silly and cheesy, it's barely tolerable",4,16 June 2012,"What was Eddie Murphy doing in this movie? The idea of having married realtors and their two children getting trapped in the haunted mansion while there on business and trying to escape wasn't a bad idea, but the execution was all wrong. Murphy endlessly mugs the camera, which makes his miscasting even more obvious. And the script? It's painfully obvious, with predictable lessons about not giving up, follow your heart, face your fears, love conquers all, and blah, blah, blah. The story is so generic that it's mechanical, all the way to its predictable ending. Very little of the original story or characters are used and when they are, they just have bit appearances. Amid all of this are beautiful costumes, decent special effects, sets that are elaborate yet artificial looking, and wisecracks that raise the occasional smile or chuckle but are never as funny as the filmmakers think they are. The best that one can say it's harmless and easy enough to take. Very faint praise indeed.",The Haunted Mansion
56,rcavellero,ENTERTAINING BUT NO DISNEY MAGIC!,6,30 November 2003,Haunted Mansion boasts wonderful spfx and great zombie makeup. Haunted mansion is fast paced. Haunted Mansion is quite creative with it's storyline and imaginative sets. But what the film does lack is good performances despite Jennifer Tilly's Madame Liotta. Thew other ones just seem ok. The film's wrap up is just so contrived and seems like one of many endings thatw ill be available on the dvd. I realiaze it's an amazing feat to turn a ride into full length film. But you just don''t have enough to work with and You churn out an hour and 20 minute semi stinker. maybe it's best it shouldn't have been made. Don't get me wrong whats on screen is quite entertaining not due in large part by another annoying performance ny Eddie Murphy. But what the film truly lacks isn't enough to block the film what the film truly tries to be. A blatant family entertainer designed to bring in the bucks and it most likely will.,The Haunted Mansion
57,travisimo,Unique Family Fun,7,28 November 2003,"When I first heard that Eddie Murphy was going to star in The Haunted Mansion, I was initially disappointed.  As a former intern at Disney World and as a Haunted Mansion fan, I wanted a more serious, scary look at the stories that surround this awesome attraction.  But then I thought that there's been so many ""haunted house"" movies recently that have bombed (The Haunting, House on Haunted Hill), a lighter, more comedic approach to The Haunted Mansion may be better.And I think that is the case here.  It's not necessarily the scariest movie out there or the funniest, but there's a good mix of both to make this a good, unique movie for families.  Honestly, I can't think of any other movie out there that combines a horror-type genre with the family genre.  When I saw this in the theater, packed full of families, people laughed, gasped, and clapped at the end.The tie-ins to the ride were nice too.  From the beginning of the film, I enjoyed the ominous organ music that whisked me back to the ride.  The singing busts were awesome, and Jennifer Tilly did a great job as Madame Leota.  And I don't really need to mention that the special effects were mighty impressive.Nevertheless, this movie isn't a perfect one.  The story wasn't the most intriguing as I found myself bored at times, and the acting was kind of stiff and rigid (unintentionally by the Evers family).All in all, though, this is a good family movie that's unlike any other movie out there.My IMDB Rating:  7/10.  My Yahoo! Grade:  B (Good)",The Haunted Mansion
58,goolizap,Twizard Rating: 67,7,6 October 2015,"This is a good example of a film where the premise is promising, but the outcome doesn't really deliver. It's actually a great kids film, but the only problem is that some scenes may be too scary for kids. Adults, on the other hand, will find the movie pretty unfunny. With Eddie Murphy in the lead role it should be way more laughable, but there's maybe one good chuckle in the whole movie.Nonetheless, it's intriguing in the sense that it takes place in a mysterious mansion and much of the plot being uncovered when real estate agent, Jim Evers (Murphy), and his family get trapped inside after Evers gets asked to represent the home on the market. Little do they know the mansion owner has his own agenda and secrets to hide.It's an obvious vehicle for Disney to promote their ride of the same name. Not that we always mind it (e.g. Pirates of the Caribbean) but when a premise is stretched thinly and the film still only comes in at under 90 minutes it's safe to say that they don't have much to work with. And with a ride that has so much potential for a brilliant story, we get stuck with a film that doesn't really live up to expectations.Although large portions of the film lack any substantial plot development, it's enjoyable to watch the family explore and discover the secrets that the mansion hides. But the information that we get is received in clumps at a time. I won't give anything away, but there is a curse involved in the movie and the details of said curse are highly convoluted and evoke so many questions to the viewer that the film loses a lot of credibility in the process.But the set pieces are great. The filmmakers do a good job replicating the feel of the ride itself. Children will be awed by the mystery of the whole story and even though they may not understand certain plot details, it will definitely spark their imagination.With a better script I would love to see Disney try this one again. Not that we can't like 2003's Haunted Mansion for what it is, but it's nowhere near having a ""modern classic"" status.Twizard Rating: 67",The Haunted Mansion

Rob Minkoff made this film true to the ride and that's what I like about with Disney. Eddie Murphy was all right in this film and Stamp's character of Ramsley was excellent and scary. Jennifer Tilly did a great job as Madame Leota. Rick Baker did an outstanding work making the zombies. Mark's composing is excellent with the theme song and it's played all over the film.

61,GuyCC,A Better Film Than The Trailers Portrayed.,7,27 November 2003,"But it's not a life-changing film.  But you wouldn't expect it to be.  After all, the entire premise of this film is based on a theme park ride.  So in that respect, it does its job.I have to admit that I had been looking forward to this film, as the Disney theme park ride is my first and most favorite attraction to visit every time I go.  But this film had also gotten a lukewarm reception from early critics, and I think mostly because of the inclusion of Eddie Murphy.  Gone is the hard-edged, sharp-witted Murphy of yesteryear.  His greatest film roles in the last couple of years have been in animated films like ""Shrek"" and ""Mulan.  And while his performance wasn't one of the best, it wasn't enough to diminish the fun I had found in this movie.The highest praise I can give this film is in the mansion itself.  It is a gorgeous work of art, and fans of the ride will see more than a few references to the ride throughout.  Most of it is subtle, but some things are instantly recognizable, like the portrait gallery.  Everything has a beautiful, stylish look once the mansion is entered, and doesn't end until the Evers family leaves.  I can not praise enough how beautiful and ornate the house looked.The film itself keeps true to the idea of the ride: light-hearted and playful with a dash of creepiness thrown about to make you wonder what sight you'll see next.  And while meant mostly as ""fun"", there are a few ghosts and zombies that do add some higher-level frights.  But if you've seen something like ""Ghostbusters"", it doesn't get any scarier than that.  It's kid-friendly, but doesn't patronize fans of the ride if you get the idea behind it.What surprised me the most was that the story was actually very competent. A tale of lovers not meant to be that actually touched upon (but never directly said, making it either focus on the fact that it was all about love, or just incredibly politically correct) the dangers of interracial love during that time in history, and how it was frowned upon by society. I'm very surprised that Disney would touch upon a theme like that, especially in a film like this, but it was handled very well, and it became of core of the plot.  Even more thankfully, the plot resolved itself in a believable manner.  I can't really see a sequel for this one, the way things ended.The music score was of note as well.  I realized how much I would have missed ""Grim Grinning Ghosts"" had they not included it in this film, but it made for the majority of the score, and except for one light moment was very somber, foreboding, and for a film like this, it suited it very well.  It would have been sorely missed without.As for the ""not so goods"": You knew this was coming... Eddie Murphy.  With the plot of the film, it was understandable why he was there, but with a film like this, I thought he'd be able to have more fun with this role.  A lot of his jokes just fell flat on the ground and stayed there, and there were times in this film that his emotional range needed to extend farther than it did.  There were times that his character needed to be sad or angry, and I wasn't getting that from him.  It felt at times that everyone else was acting, and Eddie Murphy had just suddenly stumbled into the ""Haunted Mansion"" and was just hanging around on set.  Not all of it was his fault, though.  Some of the dialouge was just flat, and with a few revisions could have sounded a little less cliche.  Dina Spybey as Emma could have used some help, too.  She seemed a little too hyperactive for some of the moments in the film.  Nathaniel Parker and Terrance Stamp, however, did fine jobs, and added to the house.I liked this film but some acting and dialouge issues brought this film down a few notches.  It's not as good as ""Pirates of the Caribbean"", but it is definitely a better film than the previews portrayed.  Take it for what it is: A film based off a theme park ride that is meant to be light and fun.Now, bring on ""Fastpass: The Movie"", and ""The Monorail: One Train and its Rail"".",The Haunted Mansion
62,mwendel,Entertaining and Fun to Watch,7,13 January 2004,"This is an example of Disney on one of their better days.  This movie is enjoyable for both kids and adults alike.  Plus, it's safe for the kids both visually and verbally (I believe ""crap"" is as bad as it gets).  It is full of silliness and fun.  Eddie Murphy is in his element doing his comic mile-a-minute dialogues as the bad guys chase him, and the good guys try and point him in the right direction.  There is a decent supporting cast and great sets and the ghostly animations are some the better ones in my opinion.  Enjoy this movie!",The Haunted Mansion
63,crowrobot,Actually not half-bad.,8,14 October 2005,"'The Haunted Mansion' got a lot of bombs thrown at it by critics, and almost nobody liked it. Well, guess what: I did. It's a faithful homage to the ride, the actors are interesting, and the horror side of the story is appropriately creepy. The plot is partially based on the French version of the ride, and it's decent. Although the movie never answers the question of why Master Gracey (Nathaniel Parker, who's really good here) couldn't marry his sweetheart Elizabeth (who was black), the hints are pretty obvious. And I liked the whole concept of the curse (even though it doesn't make any sense). The little nods to the ride throughout the movie are fun, especially Jennifer Tilly as Madame Leota, a disembodied head inside a crystal ball who speaks in riddles. Tilly can do this husky-voiced role in her sleep, and I liked her (the special effects involving her are pretty neat too). Although Eddie Murphy is miscast, and there are zero laughs in the movie, his mugging for the camera doesn't hurt the movie. The kids are OK, and Marsha Thomason does what she can with a thankless role, but it's Terence Stamp who steals the movie. He is Ramsley, the sinister butler of Master Gracey. With his deep rumbling British accent, Stamp gives a deliciously over-the-top performance, and he does here what Johnny Depp did for 'Pirates of the Caribbean'. Back to Eddie Murphy for a minute: Although he earns no laughs, he plays noncomedic scenes well, and he has some good banter with Stamp. The production design of the mansion and the ghostly special effects are very cool, particularly a zombie attack that pushes the PG rating to it's limits. Is 'The Haunted Mansion' a great movie? Absolutely not; they could have punched up the comedy aspect of the movie. It's not a bad movie, though. I thought it was very entertaining, and it's certainly better than the awful trailers. Not as good as 'Pirates', but a fun ride nonetheless.",The Haunted Mansion

Almost one year after that box office flop, Disney bounced back big with the surprise hit of the summer, Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl, which steamed rolled its way to $300 million domestically and possibly two sequels. With both a hit and a miss in their hands, Disney's third and final theme park adaptation, The Haunted Mansion, could swing either way but the company executives would have it be a hit for sure. The presence of star lead Eddie Murphy should assure this. Granted Murphy has had plenty of recent adult oriented flops such as Showtime and I Spy but his reputation as a family film star has been remarkable including his most recent hit, Daddy Daycare. Can he continue the streak with The Haunted Mansion? If the marketing campaign for the film has anything to say about it, the answer should be a big yes.The story focuses on a man who enters a haunted house with his family and must do whatever he can to save them from its ghostly in habitants. Jim Evers is a successful real-estate agent along with his partner wife, Sarah, but doesn't seem to find the time to spend quality time with his family. He's missed soccer games, anniversaries and barbeques for his work. Seeing his problem, Jim decides to take the entire family out to the lake for the weekend to make up for his mistakes. At the last minute, Sarah receives a call for her to stop by the Gracey Manor to help sell the decrepit estate. She at first declines but Jim urges her to take up the offer for the sake of the business and the family. Unfortunately they get more then they bargained for as creepy incidents occur around every corner and the entire mansion itself seems to be hiding a disturbing secret. Jim Evers must discover the mystery in the Haunted Mansion before it's too late for his family and himself. The story for The Haunted Mansion, though well intentioned, seems lacking and predictable. The opening sequence of the feature ruined any suspense for many later events and could have been done in a different way that didn't give away much of the story before the audience even had a chance to settle down in their seats.The cast of The Haunted Mansion is a relative bunch of no names but they try to their best, which works effectively for the most part. Eddie Murphy leads the group with a moderate performance as Jim Evers. The problem lies in the fact that Murphy is not all that funny in the feature and really isn't given anything to do that gets a laugh. Nathaniel Parker, who portrays Master Gracey, gives a wonderfully Victorian style performance that's both creepy and effective. He starts off a sinister character but by the end, you realize his true intentions are as evil as they may seem. Terence Stamp achieves an amazingly creepy performance as the butler, Ramsley. Though the character seems to be a supporting role at first, as the feature rolls on he becomes more central to the storyline and therefore much more effective. Jennifer Tilly is a delightful highlight as Madame Leota (aka the floating head in the crystal ball) and stays true to character within the attraction for most of her time on screen. The only disappointment in the casting area involves Terence Stamp and Dina Waters who play the servants of the mansion. Stamp, who is most famous for his role in The Princess Bride, could have been used in a more humorous way then he was here but the filmmakers fail to do so. The two were barely used at all which results in a disappointing aspect of the feature, which could have been avoided if they were used more prominently.Overall, Foolish mortals should heed this warning! If you are looking for another Pirates of the Caribbean, wait for the film's sequel rather then searching for it in The Haunted Mansion. Not to say that the film is not entertaining, it has its moments, but The Haunted Mansion doesn't even come close to the spectacular filmmaking that was presented in the summer swashbuckler. The problem lies mostly in the plot that is often flat and predictable ruining many of the film's twists before they are even set up. So what is the offender of this horrible filmmaking crime? The actions of the opening credits. If you have to see this film but don't want the film's secrets given away early then keep your eyes closed for the first three to five minutes. If anything reasonably favorable can be said of this film, it has to be the solid special effects and the creepy atmosphere the filmmakers are able to maintain despite a weak story. Disney fanatics will love the many tips of the hat towards the inspiration of the film including the hitch-hiking ghosts on the side of the road. There is no doubt that this film will be a family-friendly hit over the Thanksgiving weekend but for those looking solid filmmaking should save their money for the likes of Elf.My Rating: *** ½ out of 5 (Grade: B-)",The Haunted Mansion
65,EchoMaRinE,Give it a try,8,28 February 2010,"This is a very under-rated movie. OK, it is not the best movie ever but its rating is 4.8 by now and this is way too low. The movie starts great but unfortunately gets cheesy after the first half hour. Nevertheless, the atmosphere is great. The house is detailed brilliantly. One problem can be the action plus horror content of the movie. It is not scary for an adult but may be a bit much for kids. They could have taken this into account and made this a nice family movie. In terms of cinematography, I think they did a great job. This much CGI loaded movies usually do not look as natural as this one. Light and material usage is certainly eye catching.

This is a great family film but I wouldn't recommend it that smaller children(10 and under) see it because like the ride there are some scenes that would scare them.  This movie is more for younger kids than Pirates was but adults would like it too.  Eddie Murphy was great in his role, I would not have picked a better actor for that role.  The special effects were amazing and I wouldn't be surprised if this movie at least got nominated for an academy award for visual effects.

At least the Bears was entertaining for small children to see talking animals.  Maybe a talking animal could have helped this movie, but I doubt it.  The performances were not that bad but the story was awful.  There was virtually no humor and so many plot holes it was incredible.  For example (without spoiling anything), characters speak of a curse but I sure never heard anything cursed or saw a curse being given.  What curse?  Who cursed it?  What could break it? Yes, the beginning of the movie shows some of the soon to be ghosts but there is nothing there about a curse.I saw this with my wife and daughter and we were all very disappointed.

69,drunken_critic,Mindless Escape,8,3 April 2005,"Movies are supposed to bring you to places you have never been, and this movie does that. It brings the audience into a Mansion that is hundreds of years old. The mansion is beautifully decorated and detailed. Oh yes, and it is haunted. Eddie Murphy and his wife are real estate agents. Eddie's character is a workaholic. His wife complains, and Eddie agrees to take a family camping trip away from work. On the way to the camping trip, Eddie convinces his wife to visit a Mansion that just went on the market. The family ends up being prisoners of the mansion. Oh yeah, and this mansion is haunted.This movie has great special effects. The computer graphics are good, and not considered annoying. This movie is a Disney movie. It would be appropriate for the whole family. The Ghosts are a little scary, but it is nothing the kids cannot handle. There really is not shocking violence either. For me this movie was perfect after a hard day of work. It was mindless escapism. It was funny and scary and dumb enough to help me forget my worries. Sometimes I just want to relax with a mindless movie. Not all movies have to make you think. This movie definitely did not make me think. Actually it successfully did its job by stopping the thinking process. The hour and a half I sat there, I did not have to stress about things like work, bills, ex-wife, etc It brought me to a comfortable state of non-thought. 75/100",The Haunted Mansion

It's worth seeing if you like the ride but I wouldn't hope for too much from it.,The Haunted Mansion
71,MeloDee,Not as bad as I thought.,7,18 August 2007,"Haunted Mansion was a movie that I didn't have much of a solidified opinion of. I more or less expected it to be one of those ""seasonal flops""- forever locked in the category of holiday films that were obviously created to make money- not laughs.I guess I could say that I was pleasantly surprised. Eddie Murphy, as usual, was hilarious. There's nothing negative to be said about his performance at all. Aree Davis and Marc John Jeffries are competent in playing the role of the Evars children. Marsha Thompson, who gave me the impression that she could handle much bigger roles with relative ease, fit in well.The plot follows the story of career-driven realtor Jim Evars, who is quite willing to sacrifice family time to seal the next deal. When wife Sara Evars receives a call from a cool and reserved butler who says that his master desires to sell his expensive mansion, Jim puts their vacation on hold in favor of a supposed ""quick"" visit to talk business with the man. The family ends up staying overnight due to unexpected rain and flooding, and it becomes apparent that selling the house was not what Master Gracey had in mind.I enjoyed the movie more than I expected. Of course, its originality can be questioned, but that doesn't go without saying that the movie presented a kind of old story in a fresh and fun way.A peeve of mine was how daughter Megan Evars seemed to be adventurous to the point of caricature, but otherwise, Aree Davis was enjoyable enough to watch.Of course, this movie isn't ""awesome."" Would I mind watching it again? Probably not.",The Haunted Mansion

And sometimes, you end up with this.But is that really a bad thing? Sure, a lot of people hated the movie, but I genuinely enjoyed it. The plot, while far from scary at any point, wasn't half bad. It was creative, and actually quite fun.And the best part? The movie was hilarious. Some of the jokes were pretty clever, but the funniest parts were unintentional. In some scenes, the CGI is absolutely atrocious. And that makes it funny. It's hard not to crack up when poorly animated minuscule tubas are orbiting Eddie Murphy.Oh yeah! Did I mention Eddie Murphy?

It might be scary to 3-5 year olds maybe, but it really isn't scary. But I liked the movie, it was a pretty good kids movie, and the only part about it I didn't like was the whole not scary thing. I think that all of the4 actors and actresses were really good, and you could tell they really tried to make it scary, I think that no matter how good the actors and actresses are, they won't be able to make this movie a scary one.

I thought Eddie Murphy was funny and the little boy had some funny lines too. The only time I was scared is when Ramsley kept showing up and it surprised me and I jumped. There are a few flaws to this movie, and the major one is this: the ending was disappointing because it was like every one was going to heaven. Also the one woman swore in a ironic way just before she ""rose up to heaven."" But, this IS a Disney movie. I can't expect everything to theologically correct. Out of 10 stars, I give it a 7 or 8.

75,MadWatch,Good for kids and parents too.,7,1 December 2003,"Haunted Mansion review.Summary: Eddie Murphy plays Jim Evers, a self-employed real estate that cares enough for his wife and family that he sometimes works too hard at providing for them and neglects his parental/husband duties, in pursuit of earning a better life for his family overall. To this end, he brings his family to a what could be a huge deal that could really benefit them all; selling a sizeable mansion out of town. It turns out that the place is haunted and all manner of ghostly high-jinks ensue as the family seeks to unravel the mystery of the Haunted Mansion.I believe that Eddie Murphy did very well with the role that he was given. Unfortunately move-makers try too hard to make fathers seem ""bad"" in todays movies that Eddie's character seemed rather ""forced"". I mean, he is frequently portrayed as caring for his family, seeing to their needs, teaching them about things in life like ""facing your fears"", yet Hollywood cant seem to have a positive father role-model these days. Jim Evers is victim to the standard negative movie father cliches: He works too hard providing for the family that he neglects them, then bumbles his way trying to make amends for this.The movie overall had a decent story about two lovers that were ill-fated (similar to a Romeo and Juliet type of story) and have doomed a mansion and its ground to perpetual purgertory. The special effects are great. Marsha Tomason does a great job as Sara Evers. Nathaniel Parker and Terence Stamp do a great job as Master Gracey and the butler Ramsley. The child actors to a decent job, but are hardly oscar-winning performers. Jennifer Tilly is awesome as Madam Leota and Wallace Shawn and Dina Spybey are excellent as the servants that try to assist the Evers family.The set design is superb and the ghostly special effects are really good. The story is rather simplistic, which makes it great for kids, but interesting enough with enough humor to make it worthwhile for adults to enjoy. This is not the type of movie that a group of teenagers looking for a horror flick would enjoy or a group of rowdy adults. This is a movie that is great for a family.Rating: Family movie: 8 out of 10. As a ""general"" movie: 6 out of 10.",The Haunted Mansion
76,Dorkboss,Foolish Movie,4,29 September 2020,"Haunted Mansion is based on the famous theme park ride in Disneyland and it's also the fifth theme park based movie.The opening plot tells us that over one hundred years ago, a wealthy landowner named Edward Gracey falls in love with a woman named Elizabeth. But when he receive a letter informing him that she rejected his love, she poison herself to death which cause him to hang himself in despair. Moving forward to the present day (of 2003) Jim Evers and his wife Sarah Evers are both realtors with two children and are being called in to the mansion to what it's supposed to be a deal of selling the house, turns into a journey of unsolving a mystery while surviving from the supernatural.If you rode the Haunted Mansion, then you'll know that the ride has a balance of being both horror and comedy, but the movie tends to focus more of the comedy than the horror and all that is because Eddie Murphy is the main star of the film and if wondering does he deliver his funny material in the movie; I think you should know the answer to the question since his last film he did before this was ""Pluto Nash"". Everybody's acting was average, Terence Stamp as Ramsley sounded silly, Jennifer Tilly to me feels like a miscast to me. The only good things I can say about the movie is that it has a descent set design of the mansion and the zombies scene I did find interesting, basically because Rick Baker also helped designed the zombies. But sadly those two aren't enough for me to rate the film with an above average score.Overall: While the film is the worst I've ever seen, it is uninspiring, not well written, and a unfunny mess that doesn't feel like it deserve the PG-13 rating. It's a shame because there is a lot of ways you can create out of the Haunted Mansion, theirs even character on the rides that his interesting story's to tell than this film.",The Haunted Mansion

Something told me that a movie based on a ride wouldn't be the deepest plot in the world, and I really didn't expect character development of a major order, I expected some gee-whiz FX, a few laughs (the son is pretty funny,""I see dead people"") and a happy ending. I got all that, and a bit more. VERY impressive FX (anyone else notice one of the Barbershop Quartet guys looked an awful lot like Vincent Price?), moody, creepy sets, great visuals, and a nice bit of nostalgia for the ride I've loved for years at Disneyland (second fave, right after Pirates).

Oh, and the Mansion is very detailed but hardly utilised in the film.This movie could have been so much better but a bad story and script just ruin it. The characters are flat and the movie fails to be scary or funny. A younger audience (children under 12 years old) may find it entertaining but older kids and adults will probably be bored.I give it 6 out of 10 (and I'm being very generous here) because I like ghost stories and E.

The only silver lining to this movie was the beautiful Marsha Thomasan, i hope she gets more and more and more and more roles.

80,stamp1,"Good, But Not Great",7,12 December 2003,"I enjoyed this movie for the most part. NO SHOCKING SURPRISES, like in some other wicked evil movies released lately. This movie was not as good as ""Pirates Of Caribbean"", so you will be disappointed if you are expecting one of the best movies ever, like Pirates was. But it is a good family film, for ages above 5 or 6 anyway.There are a couple of scary parts that might frighten young children. I was scared a little when the mummies were chasing Eddie and his daughter in the crypt for the key, and the spiders crawling all over the crypt door freaked me out a little! ALSO, when Terrence Stamp summoned Satan up from hell (I think that's who it was, it was a demon or devil made of fire), that part was also scary somewhat. (It looked like the EXACT same Satan as in the movie ""Spawn"", which was scarier and grosser than this movie was.)In my opinion, Jennifer Tilly was the BEST! I really enjoyed seeing and hearing her as the Gypsy in the crystal ball. That was great SFX too! I thought Terrence Stamp was good as a really creepy butler, and sorta scary also. I thought Eddie Murphy was OK, a little annoying, maybe he was written that way. The butler in the film says he can't stand to listen to Eddie talk anymore, it is getting on his nerves, well... That is exactly how I was feeling too! Eddie was getting on my nerves a little. I thought the kids were cute, VERY REFRESHING, after watching the horrible movie ""Cat N Hat"", where the kids were obnoxious horrible brats! Their mom was beautiful, seemed so sweet, had such a beautiful smile, she was really a stunning woman. I believe her name was Marsha Thomason. She Definitely looked like a movie star. Wallace Shawn was funny too. The statues singing barbershop quartet were really great effects, I really enjoyed them. The ghosts looked good also. If you have a family with kids, who don't have nightmares too easily, then I recommend this film. This was a good movie for teenagers too. If you buy ""Pirates of Caribbean"" DVD, you get a free matinee ticket to see this film, so you might like this better if you have a free ticket!!! I think Disney Studios should really consider turning this movie over to Jerry Bruckheimer Productions in a few years, and let them remake it. It would be interesting to see if he turns it into a Great Movie Classic, like ""Pirates Of Caribbean"" was!",The Haunted Mansion

82,jul-kinnear,"There's one thing that people should be very clear on, and that's that Eddie Murphy does not care in the slightest what people think of his acting career.",4,15 January 2015,"There's one thing that people should be very clear on, and that's that Eddie Murphy does not care in the slightest what people think of his acting career. And that's good, because this film is unspeakably bad and is only viable as a tool for wantonly consuming 90 minutes from your life that you will never get back. Yes, this is an Eddie Murphy project that functions better as a fourth-dimensional black hole than anything else.What audiences have here is a project in which Eddie Murphy plays real estate agent Jim Evers, who hopes to transform a dilapidated mansion in New Orleans into financial success. Before venturing out in search of a buyer for wreck, he and the family he's been somewhat neglectful towards visit the house for an inspection. They discover there is more going on with the property than they could have ever anticipated.Eddie Murphy's character is hapless, with little awareness of what is going on outside of his real estate duties. Terrance Stampis, confusingly, in this movie as one of the 999 ghosts that reside in this mansion, even though his acting career easily and understandably puts the film ""beneath him."" Jennifer Tilly is present in the film in a significant role as a disembodied medium and adviser to Jim Evers. Despite the quality of the film overall, their talents are put to good use, considering what little they're working with.The acting is stiff and contrived. Murphy turns in a performance that is completely alien to the talent that brought him success throughout the 1980s. The relationship between Evers and his wife appears unnatural and difficult to believe within the context of the film. The film might have had greater success with an increased focus on the efforts made by the home's original owner, a ghost, to reunite with his long-lost wife. Certain contradictions were apparent in the film as well, such as what physical objects ghosts were capable of manipulating. Sometimes they were able to move objects. Other times they were relegated simply to phasing through them. The visuals of the film are quire colourful. The effects, both special and practical, are top-notch and clearly show a great deal of effort had been put into producing them.This film is mainstream pabulum of the highest order. Murphy delivers a performance that's typical Murphy schtick — frantic, energized inanity with a dull edge and inarticulate delivery, devoid of any nuance or subtlety. Murphy's more sophisticated and impressive roles, not nearly as upsetting, are not easily remembered. Everyone can remember his Saturday Night Live origins, his work in 48 Hours, Trading Places, Coming to America, The Golden Child, Bowfinger, the Beverly Hills Cop series, and Dreamgirls. People often want to remember these, but seldom do they wish to recall the likes ofMeet Dave, Norbit, Daddy Day Care, Nutty Professor, Dr. Dolittle, and the infamous Pluto Nash. People can find themselves anxious with the likes of Ben Affleck because they remember roles he's ""phoned in,"" such as with Jersey Girl, because they know he can produce absolutely amazing work like he did in The Town. People know he can do better, so they become, understandably, disappointed. That perspective we have for Murphy has inflated to such proportions that you can't help but see anything else. The Haunted Mansion is a good vehicle of work to add to the pile of problems movie- going audiences have with his intentions. It's good that a man that has done ten Shrek-related jobs since the first Shrek doesn't care what audiences think of him, otherwise this might all seriously effect him on an emotional level.Former Village Voice writer Rob Minkoff may have put it best when he said, ""Rob Minkoff has directed a movie that's nearly laughless and nowhere near as frightening as what's happened to Eddie Murphy's career."" Even famed film reviewer Richard Roeper simply described The Haunted Mansion as ""dreadful."" While Disney proved, earlier in 2003, with Pirates of the Caribbean that a film based on an amusement park ride can be successful, Eddie Murphy proved that substantial talent is a significant portion of the equation required to project the success of such a film.You'd get more for your dollar if you were to visit the actual Haunted Mansion ride at Disneyland rather than engaging with The Haunted Mansion. There's no particular reason this film should exist. The world is worse off it now that it exists. Rather than waste your time with this cinematic detritus, you would be better off sitting somewhere and reading a book for 90 minutes.",The Haunted Mansion
83,jkylebennett,"Hasn't Aged Well, Unfortunately",3,26 October 2018,"I remember really liking this movie as a kid. It was just creepy enough, but not too scary, and the setting was beautiful. The mansion is exquisite. However, It's been 15 years since this movie came out and it just doesn't hold up in terms of story and characters. The effects are still good. They may not impress the the average person today, but they also haven't aged nearly as poorly as others may argue. The real falter is in the characters. This is easily one of Eddie Murphy's worst roles. His character really doesn't have many, if any, redeeming qualities, and the rest of the cast just falls flat with unremarkable and unmemorable performances. Everything that goes on throughout the movie definitely comes across more as corny rather than scary or creepy. Still, if you want to let your kids watch this move, I think they will definitely enjoy it enough and find it just scary enough to get into the Halloween season without having nightmares later on. There are definitely worse movies, this one just falls into the realm of unmemorable and unremarkable. You can watch it and not remember that you just watched it when something else comes on.

Jennifer Tilly was solid as Madam Leoni and Marsha thomason was perfectly addequette for the role. However the slightly obvious ways of getting themselves out of the problem of ghosts and skeletons were a bit frustrating. For example when Eddie Murphy and the girl were in the crypt the skeletons came after them. They say that the skeletons heads were easy to remove so why didn't they whack them. They had no special powers and didn't seem threatening in the slightest.l This film was fright free and even the younger kids in the cinema with me weren't in the slightest bit scared. The ending was a bit confusing and I felt it dragged on a bit. It is mainly a movie for the kids or maybe Roy croper out of Coronation street(a pathetic guy in a soap for people who aren't English), but not for anyone over the age of about 13.",The Haunted Mansion

I thought Murphy was a bit flat and would have preferred they would have approached it from a different point of view. Maybe Disney kids staying in the place on a bet, whatever... I also thought the love interest (an African American women and white male) for a person in the deep south during the mid 1800's was a strange decision. Don't get me wrong, I think Marsha Thomason is beautiful, but I couldn't help think how out of place the relationship would have been.

Special effects were pretty good, and almost made up for the flimsy plot.But did anyone else notice that this movie was set in Louisiana (the ride at Disneyland is in the part of the park called The French Quarter, and the cars had Louisiana license plates) and not one character had a Louisiana accent?  Not even the guy who'd lived all his life in the mansion?Mindless entertainment, nothing more nor less.  4/10",The Haunted Mansion
89,roblop,A movie with plenty of heart and even more soul(s)!!!,10,2 February 2004,"I must admit I expected alot after viewing the trailer of The Haunted Mansion, anything made by Disney and starring Eddie Murphy is sure to be great and this was no exception.Right from the word go I enjoyed this movie. The acting, the story, the catchy tunes, the special effects it all came together well.
The important thing with this movie was that its main target audience were kids... so how do you create a scary movie for kids??? They have definately hit the nail on the head with this one :-)Firstly keep it as short as possible, whilst it wasnt extremely short it was always happening so time seemed to just fly by whilst I watched the movie.Secondly keep the laughs up and for that Eddie Murphy did really well.Thirdly keep the scares distant and few.Altogether the movie did an amazing job and I would like to congratulate everybody involved for such a brilliant and enjoyable flick.I gave The Haunted Mansion 10/10",The Haunted Mansion
90,PsychoKlown,Not as bad as everyone says!,7,11 August 2005,"When this movie came out critics and audiences were saying how rubbish it was and it was a waste of time and money, but as i have a keen interest in the paranormal i still wanted to see it anyway and i glad i did! This is a family film but there are elements of adult horror here such as suicides, murder and even zombies! The story is of a typical workaholic dad who neglects his family and decides to take them away to make up for this, but when he receives a call asking him to sell a mansion he can't refuse so off he and his family go.Once there they meet the creepy butler Ramsley and the owner Mr Gracy who are obviously ghosts, and from then on all the supernatural events follow one-another from zombie reflections to levitating around a psychic in a crystal ball called Madame Leota. And i thought she was the best character in the film, not just because i'm a Jennifer Tilly fan but because she is very funny and has a strong personality for just a head.The effects are as amazing as the sets with the green glow of Madame Leota, the zombies and more even the people who didn't like this film can't deny that the effects are excellent. As i said the sets are also some of the best i've seen the mansion is absolutely breathtaking.The only thing that i think is bad with this movie is the child actors, they just look bored going round the mansion with straight faces even though they follow ghostly orbs into unknown places. But apart from this the rest of the film is great fun for kids and for the adults who aren't afraid to turn their brain off for 90mins. WATCH IT!!!!",The Haunted Mansion
91,jazni,For The Young...and The Young at Heart!,8,30 November 2003,"The Haunted Mansion is definitely a movie for the whole family to enjoy. By this, I don't mean the son who's away at college buying tickets to see it with friends. If you're looking for blood, gore, sex and violence you won't find it in The Haunted Mansion. That's what makes it refreshing.I used my 5 and 10 year old cousins as an excuse to see this film and must say: We ALL had a blast. 'Haunted won't go down in history as  the scariest movie of all time, but there were just enough thrills, chills and  monsters to safely introduce the horror genre to a younger audience. The CGI was pretty nice and Eddie Murphy did a great job of carrying the film with a cast of virtual unknowns. Jennifer Tilly was perfect as Madame Leota. The Evers kids were extremely adorable and funny. The rest of the supporting cast were good, but not very memorable, though.Overall The Haunted Mansion can be summed up like this:  Loads of fun for the pre-teen crowd and adults that are young at heart.",The Haunted Mansion
92,okie-22843,Ignore bad reviews,8,12 July 2020,"Don't go in expecting a true horror movie and you'll love it. This movie actually succeeds at capturing the mood of the titular ride. The jokes are subtle but funny, the mansion itself is amazing and Murphy & Stamp deliver memorable performances. It's stunning how much they squeeze into the run-time and the pace is fast & fun. This is a good time popcorn movie so don't look for anything deep or scary. Simply putting it, if you like the ride, you'll find something to enjoy in this movie.",The Haunted Mansion

Aside from Eddie Murphy, whom I find tiresome when he isn't being the butt of the joke, the movie is like the amusement park ride.  You loved it when you were little, but as you grew older your reasons for going changed.
The effects are, of course, state-of-the-art.  Only a couple of genuinely spooky scenes, not too much for the real little kids.  Enough action to keep you from checking your watch.  Take your kids but leave the teenagers behind!",The Haunted Mansion
94,tombeaman,Fun for Disney Fans; Shallow for others,6,12 January 2004,"To see the Haunted Mansion come to ""life"" on the big screen is a treat. Other than that, the story is very thin, yet the acting helps to carry it along.Murphy and his family, trapped in the mansion for the night, makes for some typical haunted mansion-type encounters, carried out well with solid special effects.  Murphy's trademark expression of shock/surprise is exchanged only with his trademark ""genuine honesty"" grin.  Both expressions work well for a real estate agent scared out of his wits.  They then spend the next hour running away from various ghosts and goblins in the mansion, many clearly taken from the venerable Disney ride.  Some good humor accompanies the scares, as does some mildly un-Disney language.I enjoy the ride, and I always go on it when I visit the park.  I enjoyed the film...I will not, however, see it again.",The Haunted Mansion
95,jcorpuz@ucsd.edu,"It's ok, for what it is",5,27 November 2003,"""The Haunted Mansion"" is a deep, theological allegory centering on the great powers and similarities of heaven and of hell. The question has the boldness to ask ""Of which does thine soul belong?"" No wait hold wrong flick... ""The Haunted Mansion"", out in theatres for Thanksgiving in a genius move of holiday-movie theme timing, is acceptable light entertainment, an easy shallow Disney flick with a meandering plot that doesn't really move you in any particular way. It delivers some PG thrills, some PG yuks and then politely wipes itself from your memory not more than a few steps out of the theatre. So go take the family to see it if you are so inclined (although Elf is a much better famoly flick). It's not terrible, but it seems like it should've been aired on the Disney Channel a month ago. Very ineffectual movie with that expected manufactured by Disney stamp on it. It could've been a more creative, more filled imagining of the ride but for what it is, it's ok. 5 outta 10.",The Haunted Mansion
96,dblaine316,Fully crapped CGI,3,29 April 2004,"The lamest, most stupidest film I've ever seen. How can Disney make such stupid movies. Money waste and time waste. It is even a comedy type to have a hearty laughter. Just some crazy and stupid animations. Horror for 3-year olds.The story is as usual. Jim Evers (Eddie Murphy) is a workaholic real estate dealer and is in debt in terms of family's entertainment. So after some quarrels the family decide to go on a vacation .But en route Jim stops to deal with another house which happens to be haunted. So there are ghosts in the house and some events take place concerning his wife and these events teach Jim the importance of family & love.Thats pretty much the story. Lame story and you can guess the end and everything from the beginning itself. There is not much real people in this movie. Most of the cast include CGI of actors and actresses which have been animated through. Only good thing is the daughter. Normal, practically thinking kid. Cool.So if you're a teenager or someone associated with computer then this movie is crap CGI, but if you're a person who has NEVER even heard of computer or who like casper movies then this is money worth. So make your decision and go ahead. But this is the last straw for me. I, for heaven's sake WILL NOT watch any more Disney pictures from now on.My Verdict : Recommended for 3-year oldMy Rating : 3/10",The Haunted Mansion
97,superhawk-69132,Pretty fun Halloween family movie no matter what reviews say,7,12 October 2020,This movie is a family movie and should be reviewed as such. Effects are not bad for its time period.

98,PackmanWSU01,"Un-frightening Failure ""Minor Spoilers""",4,24 September 2009,"Disney decided to ""modernize"" their attractions by making movie tie-ins. I suppose they decided it would induce nostalgia lovers of the attractions to attend the film, or at least generate awareness of the attractions among a younger audience. They committed 3 attractions to film within the last decade. Only one proved to be a success. The Haunted Mansion, although better than The Country Bears, is still a failure. Eddie Murphy seemingly sleepwalks through the role, attempting to ham it up (unsucessfully) playing the old ""fish out of water"" routine. The movie has an identitiy crisis. Does it want to spooky, creepy, or just fun? By trying to play all 3 angles (and trying to please everyone type of audience) the end result is that the film leaves no satisfaction. I don't object to making a movie about The Haunted Mansion, (I loved all of the Pirates movies by the way)I just am upset about it's execution. The Mansion takes a backseat to Eddie Murphy's character's family dynamics. Is anyone in awe of the ghosts? No, they all trust them and follow them around immediately. Fans of the ride will enjoy picking up subtle references and odes to the ride, and that's the only thing that makes this film bearable. I hope they remake it someday, not as a comedy (although it could have comedic aspects, like Peter Jackson's The Frighteners). In the meantime, I guess I'll have to see what attraction makes it into a film next. Will it be Tower of Terror? Jungle River Cruise? Space Mountain? My vote. 4 out of 10",The Haunted Mansion
99,convincing60,Stupid Eddie Murphy Black guy Comedy,1,11 November 2013,"This is a very basic and plain movie, its just another stupid black comedy with Eddie Murphy. He's always in stupid kiddie movies, it's ruining his career. The Haunted Mansion isn't that great of a movie, the script and plot are very basic and predictable. The special effects were cool but they should have included a little more. One good thing about the movie is that there wasn't a lot of horror scenes.Don't bother watching this garbage, its a silly Disney movie with very little comedy and action. These ""so-called"" black comedies are so dirt, they suck. This is just a cheesy rip-off of kiddie craps mixed together with kiddie horror.",The Haunted Mansion
100,hmghosthost,Disgraceful,2,14 March 2006,"As president of the unofficial Haunted Mansion Fan Club, one would think that I could scrounge up even a little bit of love for this movie. However, I would have to lie to say that this movie has anything worth giving credit to.The actors: Eddie Murphy - I don't think there could have been a worse choice of casting than Eddie Murphy, who hasn't made anything close to the term ""quality"" since Beverly Hills Cop. He has made himself famous through his vulgar, racist and homophobic stand up comedy shows, and how the Disney Company could select him to star in such an important proprietary film is beyond all comprehension. The Children - The two kids who were cast to play the children were consistently arrogant, smart mouth, and just plain irritating. They showed very fake emotions, such as little fear at the sight of zombies and virtually not one tear for their dead mother. They are so unremarkable it wasn't even worth my time to find out their names. Terrance Stamp/Wallace Shawn/Dina Waters - the domestic help were about the only thing in this movie worth watching, but not because they had good roles. These are great actors stuck in bad-written roles, and they did the best that could be done with it.The Plot: There was a plot? Oh yeah, I guess there was. Let me see if I got this right. A Southern white plantation owner with an out of place British accent, Master Gracey, is in love with an upscale black woman at the height of the American Black Slavery era. Now that's believable. Not. Then this black beauty is murdered by the plantation owner's also-British racist butler who fears Master Gracey will bring shame on his prissy white southern family name by marrying a black woman. Well, duh. As a ""white"" man I was mentally insulted by this senseless and insensitive story line, and I sympathize with African Americans who are also insulted by it. So then the story goes on with Master Gracey forcing the very married Mrs. Evers to commit polygamy by threatening to harm her children if she doesn't marry him. She drinks poison and dies at her wedding while her stupid children just stand there looking at her dead body as though it were an alien that just landed. This is quickly followed by a fiery dragon who burst up from hell through the fireplace to devour the butler, who had for some reason suddenly become a minister just in time to perform the wedding ceremony. Finally the dead wife/mother becomes possessed by the spirit of Master Gracey's dead lover and she pointlessly floats up into the air ala' Elphaba the Witch of the West from Wicked the Musical (also premiering the same year as Haunted Mansion). The plot was overly predictable. I waited over a year to see this movie in the theater, and promptly fell asleep half way through it. (I'm not kidding).Special Effects: the special effects were very good, except they were used at weird times and inappropriately. It seemed as though special effects were used just because they had to use them. I don't reject this movie out of a lack of imagination. I'm not your typical film-goer. I usually likes what most people DON'T like because I can see when a movie was at least made with love. But this movie might as well have an opening disclaimer announcement: ""We made this movie because we were bored and just wanted to make an extra buck off the Disneyland Ride."" To sum up my feelings about this movie, I'm pretty disgusted with Disney for this disaster. A big ""shame on you"" to them.",The Haunted Mansion

I don't really know what Eddie Murphy is doing with his career lately because it is evident this film will not do well with critics or profit, but it was still a good film.

That said: The movie was very well done. Some parts were overly predictable, while the story flowed rather easily. It's another, ""been done before plot"" with some added special effects and humour, all of which added together equal a movie worth seeing. Eddie Murphy is Eddie Murphy at his usual sillyness, reminiscent of his ""Beverly Hills Cop"" style of acting. All supporting cast do a wonderful job and the direction gives it those scenes that'll make you jump then laugh. I would not recommend this movie to children under 13 as some scenes may frighten them. Should have been rated PG-13 instead. Other than that, good movie.

The sets, costumes and makeup are wonderful, and the music which was based on the ride's music was beautiful. A lot of references to the ride are also made which excited me also.The part I wasn't too fond of was the dialog itself, and especially their deliveries. Had they'd been less childish, but still children accessible I think it would have worked a lot better. David Berenbaum had a good story, but did lousy job with the dialect.I also think that Eddie Murphy still could have worked well, had it not been for Rob Minkoff wanting to keep it so childish. I simply can't stand the face Jim Evers, Murphy's character, makes while he tries to shake the hand of Edward Gracy played by Nathaniel Parker. But with the dark visuals, I suppose a compromise had to be reached.",The Haunted Mansion

That said, it's not nearly as bad as everyone makes it sound. The movie does have some genuinely funny, and dare I say effective moments. While the special effects are dated now, it does have some impressive practical make up, and fun callbacks to the ride. At times there is a hint of a somewhat spooky atmosphere, but it is often undone by having throwaway jokes that don't always land. All in all though, I'd say it's perfectly harmless, and a good movie to watch with the family. Not perfect, but not deserving of the hate.",The Haunted Mansion

This was the first horror film I ever watched and was scared only really once during the whole run time. The story over all was great but the twist and turns it took to get there were kind of confusing. The ending was to happy from what a think a horror movie would be.

When he decides to go on a weekend vacation, his family gets a call to go to a mansion for the weekend.A great cast combined with typical Eddie Murphy humor makes this movie really good, but what makes it better is the more serious tone of the movie, it isn't trying to make you laugh every second, but make you remained interested as well. 8/10.",The Haunted Mansion

They think it is to discuss a sale however the owner and his butler(Terence Stamp) have other more sinister reasons for their visit.This film is OK for kids , but for anyone else it is sometimes boring and not at all scary, although some scenes may scare very young viewers.Eddie Murphy is good but he has given the same performance before in better films such as Dr Dolittle and Daddy Day Care.

However, i have seen this movie over 100 times and i do love it. It does what it should, it has ghosts and ghouls and bad spirits and good that are all trying co-existing inside this mansion and at the core of it all is a love story.I recommend this movie if you like the ride, even if it is just to see the cute nods to the ride that exist within the movie, like our favourite three hitch-hiking ghosts.

Madame Leota (the head in the crystal ball) was very well animated, and you could almost imagine her in front of you, giving you the advice.

Disney's attempt to capitalize on a halfway-decent theme park ride with this bowser of a movie was nearly as bad.I will admit, there were two things that I liked about it: First, the self-animated crystal ball, complete with its englobulated (oooh, new word!) gypsy-with-an-attitude. Second, watching Eddie Murphy get upstaged by the barbershop quartet of singing busts (one of which bore a suspiciously strong resemblance to Walt Disney himself).Don't get me wrong: I like Eddie Murphy as an actor, generally. His first 'Doctor Dolittle' movie was pretty decent, even though he'll never be able to truly replace Rex Harrison. He also did pretty well in 'The Golden Child' and the first couple of 'Beverly Hills Cop' movies.I really think, though, that he deserved better than this pale wraith of a flick.

I felt like the movie was one big commercial that I PAYED to watch. It wasn't till after the movie that I found out that Disney already has a Haunted Mansion ride. Ugh. However, I laughed at some of the jokes and enjoyed some of the affects, but not much.",The Haunted Mansion
124,maggie_rufflo,A great movie for kids-just like the ride!,10,27 November 2003,"I went and saw this movie with my eight year-old sister and my fourteen year old cousin. It began dark and creepy and we were all into it right away. The effects were amazing and every scene reminded me of the classic Disney ride.It was perfect for my sister; creepy and funny through a child's eyes but it isn't an adult movie. The plot is weak enough so a child can understand it and Eddy Murphy is O.K. in his role. I personally enjoyed it because it was a breath of fresh air to see a clean movie with a happy ending. It definitely isn't Disney's best, but it was still a fun picture to watch.

The premise, I understand, but what followed after the beginning credits rolled was beyond boring. Actually, I slept through about half of the movie. I'd wake up, look at it, and its boredom would knock me right back out. I felt like I needed to continue watching it, however, because I had paid for it on Pay Per View, and that was definitely one I'd ask my money back for had it been at the theater. Eddie Murphy did the best he could but could not pull it out of the fire. My cats usually watch TV, and counting their responses by walking out of the room and not coming back till the movie ended said it all! I do not recommend this movie to any one unless they want to be bored to death and join the ""dead people in the backyard""!

My only beef with the ride is its lack of Eddie Murphy, who was clearly the best part of this movie. I think his brilliant performance in The Haunted Mansion will probably definitely spark a much needed revival in the funny man's career. Everyone cast as his family were spot on as well. I honestly could have done without the ghosts or the mansion and just seen a movie about Eddie Murphy selling real estate and teaching his son how to kill spiders.Oh and I cannot forget the classic ""If you is or if you ain't"" song that played at the end.

132,purplegirl247,Painful experience,2,26 November 2003,"Bad script, worse acting.  The newest Disney venture seems to be almost an afterthought.  After the resounding success of Pirates of the Caribbean, you would think that Disney had some inkling of an idea of what the public wants.  Clearly, this is not true.  This 100-minute yawn fest lays out the storyline within the first half an hour, but continues to meander here and there without really accomplishing anything.  Eddie Murphy an irritating, money-hungry real estate agent who cares nothing for his wife and less for their children (I'm not sure why they bothered naming the character -- Eddie seems to be playing himself as usual).  He coerces his family to venturing to Gracey Mansion in hopes of selling it.  I won't go into detail, mostly because it is too inane to repeat.  The characters weren't developed, there's only a few things of interest from the ride, and the final resolution is predictable at best.  In short, don't bother -- go buy Pirates of the Caribbean!

It was well-acted and Eddie Murphy was absolutely great! Although the plot it not something unusual (we have seen many haunted house movies with similar plot), it is very well supported and it manages keeping you entertained at the whole time.

There were parts that were a jump-out-of-the-seat thing, but it wasn't too scary. This is a must see for any Disney fan!",The Haunted Mansion
136,mr_aaron,Don't waste your time with this film.,1,29 September 2011,"First of all let me begin by saying Director Rob Minkoff, isn't a bad director. After all he directed The Lion King, but this film is awful. To be fair what do you expect from a film based on a Disney theme park attraction. The sad thing is this film isn't the first to do so. The film also has an issue with its genre, its listed as a comedy, horror. It is neither funny or scary, unless you consider the fact that this film was allowed to be made, then its terrifying. The problem is since its made for kids it can't be too scary, but trying to lighten it up causes it to be unfunny as well.The film stars Eddie Murphy as Jim Evers a workaholic real estate agent, who takes his family to a mansion with the hopes of selling it, but oh no its filled with ghosts. Not only that the master of the house thinks Jim's wife is the reincarnation of his beloved, so he does what else, try to woo her. Any way the butler did it, I know it seems like I skipped a lot but I didn't. Most of the films story is pointless, and makes no sense. Jim travels all over the mansion discovering the truth, finding out the butler did it, and all I'm thinking at this point is. Why did the butler leave all this evidence laying about, didn't he think to destroy it before he died? Anyway the butler kills the wife, then hell opens in the fireplace, takes him down and then closes. That just comes out of nowhere and no they do not explain why or how, but wait it gets worse. The ghost of the masters beloved enters the body of Jims wife, not only does this break the curse, thats right there was a curse in this movie, they just don't explain it. But it also brings Jim's wife back to life, and how? I have no idea. You would think that since the wife was dead she would have had a ghost hovering about. But nope, she had no ghost because? I have no idea about that either. Hey if you think those plot holes are bad then lets take a look at it's continuity as throughout the whole film, the story jumps from the ghost's able to interact with living objects and not, you know when the story demands that it be that way.I will give the film this, you can see that the film had huge sets allowing the setting to look real. And the lighting was actually good in some parts, which is why I give it 1/10. But apart from that one compliment the rest of the film is a waste of time and I wouldn't recommend it.Thanks for reading",The Haunted Mansion
137,kenai,Wonderful!,7,1 December 2003,"I loved the beginning titles as well as the ending. The music and costumes were stunning! The mansion and special effects were equally stunning! So much work went into this movie and it really shows. I just wish they would have shown the ballroom (Mardi Gras) scene more. I was really looking forward to that and they only showed it for a few seconds. Overall I recommend seeing this movie, it is dry in a couple of parts, but what movie isn't!

Eddie Murphy and his wife are realtors. On their way to a family outing with the kids, they make a last minute stop to check on a potential client. What they get is a lame movie. The story of the house and the ghosts is dull and confusing [the writers obviously were trying to show the entire house by whatever means possible]. the special effects were overplayed and ho-hum at best, and the acting [from all parts] was obviously second-seat and unimportant.

And watched the movie before I left for work that evening.Boy was I shocked! Even in the first few moments of the film I was blown away by the visual effects, and the eerie beauty that was set off by the scenes that enfolded before me.I'm a huge fan of Tim Burtons work,and these scenes very much reminded me of his style.The mansion,in itself,is breathtaking.It felt like the Vampires mansion scene from ""Underworld"",only better.I thought this was a comedy Eddie Murphey shouldn't have done,but you know what? The movie isn't even about him! His character is a more supporting role.There's a whole tragic/romance angle that I was completely surprised with.Nathanial Parker (whom I'm so happy I discovered) and Terence Stamp brought such a great element to the movie with their grace,nobility,and amazing acting skills.Needless to say,the features on the DVD are also incredible,including a virtual tour of the mansion.There were a few things that bugged me,and that was the kids,whom I felt could've been slightly less annoying.But thats easily overlooked in a movie I am pleasantly surprised to say is a very good flick.Don't believe the negative hype.Go see the movie for yourself.Trust me- you won't be disappointed.I know I wasn't!

Once every few years this movie has come to hunt me back, twice at school and thrice on TV. Even when I was 8 I hated this, six years have passed and the situation isn't much better. The biggest flaw of this movie is its humor, which practically non- existent. Eddie Murphy just wobbled around the haunted mansion and blurts out supposedly funny. Another huge flaw is that the characters are mostly uninteresting, and when they aren't they are simply walking comedic atrocities, with unfunny jokes and annoying voices galore! However, it's not all bad. The actors playing the various roles are not bad (except for of course the big Eddie), and the sets are so delightfully corny. However, decent acting and sets is not enough to make up for a terrible screenplay and atrocious humor.In the end, I give this movie a 2 out of ten, because at least it is not Mr. Popper's penguins...another film that has haunted me from the day I saw it.",The Haunted Mansion

149,bnc91,Good for the Family,9,18 May 2010,"A movie about a haunted mansion sounds scary doesn't it? But not Disney's ""The Haunted Mansion."" This film is more of a romance and comedy mixed with the paranormal.Jim Evers (Eddie Murphy) is a workaholic of his real estate business with his wife Sara (Marsha Thomason). Jim promises to take his family to the lake, but makes a detour to a potential customer's mansion. They soon meet the butler, Ramsley, and Master Gracey. After a while, Jim finds himself in a secret passageway. The kids follow a ghost ball and eventually see a picture of a woman that looks just like their mom. They finally meet up with Jim. Ezra and Emma, ghost butler and maid, and Madame Leota explain the mansion's secrets to Jim and the kids. They eventually find out that Ramsley murdered Elizabeth, the woman in the picture whom Gracey loved. After learning how to work together they save Sara and break the curse that was put upon the mansion.The storyline was consistent throughout the movie. It kept me wandering if they were going to be able to break the curse. Eddie Murphy brought out his usual comedy side in ""The Haunted Mansion."" He made some of the intense moments ""lighter."" The supporting actors and actresses also did a wonderful job. The special effects were amazing. The ghosts looked real and it really felt like Madame Leota was actually in the ball. ""The Haunted Mansion"" had a lot of special effects, and they were done well.Overall, ""The Haunted Mansion"" is a good movie for the family.

150,livserge331-770-10929,Nat Parker is the only reason to watch this...,5,3 March 2011,"Okay, so I love horror movies, and I love Disney World. When I heard 8 years ago that they were making a Haunted Mansion movie, I was excited. Then it came out and before I could see it, people were saying unanimously that it was awful. So I never watched it.Last year I accidentally caught it on TV and gave it a shot. It is quite beautifully filmed, but the story is full of holes, and I can't stand Eddie Murphy's constant mugging. The only thing that kept me watching was Nathaniel Parker as Master Gracey. The man has presence! I couldn't wait for Eddie Murphy's scenes to be over so Nat Parker might come back on screen.I've noticed a lot of reviewers criticize that Elizabeth and Edward Gracey would never have been a couple in 1880's New Orleans. Yes, it was taboo, but that was the whole thing. He fell in love with her, they had a secret relationship, and he was willing to give up his social standing to marry her. Ramsley, his ever loyal butler, could not stand to see his master fall from grace (no pun intended) so he cruelly killed Elizabeth. I've read true stories from New Orleans and this is a recurring theme - forbidden love between black and white that ends in death. So it's not impossible. Anyway, Elizabeth and Edward's sadly doomed love was the best part of the story - I wish the movie had been based on that and not a crazy kids' story with Eddie Murphy mucking up everything. Anything that would have put Nat Parker's face on the screen more would have been an improvement.At any rate, this movie had one redeeming factor: it introduced me to Nat Parker's body of work. Being American, I probably wouldn't have stumbled across him any other way (not having watched Beverly Hills Ninja, the other awful American movie he was in - poor Nat Parker, if he could only get cast in a decent American movie so that more Americans would get to see him!) and I've enjoyed watching the Inspector Lynley series and other British projects he did. So thank you makers of Haunted Mansion! Also, I bought the DVD just to see him hamming it up in the deleted scenes. It was only $4 including shipping on Ebay; well worth it to a Nat fan. The director's commentary has some stuff about him too - including that he worked out the day he flew in from London to look good for the movie, but then his arms were really sore and the first thing he had to do was carry Elizabeth up the stairs over and over in the opening sequence, and it was really painful!Terence Stamp is also delightfully creepy as the evil butler (so there, I have a compliment that has nothing to do with Nat Parker!) Worth watching at Halloween for a mildly scary thrill if you have nothing better to do.",The Haunted Mansion
151,SlytherinsRSexyr,Big disappointment for a big Haunted Mansion fan.,1,27 November 2003,"For anyone who's a big fan of the ride, prepare to be both delighted and disappointed. The basic atmosphere of the film is right in line with the ride, and it's obvious that the script-writers & producers made sure to include as many Haunted Mansion staples as they could (examples: the classic ""many-eyed"" purple wallpaper, the singing busts, the Hitchhiking Ghosts, and even the bulging door which is featured in the Corridor of Doors).  Even the opening of the movie starts off with a shout-out to the ride's staple Ghost Host monologue, with an eerie utterance of, ""Welcome, foolish mortals..."". Unfortunately, then the movie begins.Where they excelled in the set, they lost in the script.  The actual storyline isn't a bad one: Trapped inside the Mansion by the reminder of his long lost love, the ghost of Master Gracey seeks out who he believes to be the reincarnation of his lost Bride - Mrs. Evers, the wife & business partner of real-estate fanatic Jim Evers (played by Eddie Murphy). But aside from a backstory with good potential, the dialogue is cheesy and forced, and the acting is below-par.  Eddie Murphy does what he can, and Jennifer Tilly has some shine as the psychic Madame Leota, but the characters never seem to match up with the tone that the movie calls for.The addition of the Evers' children is an irritating one.  The tacked-on side-theme of ""Face your fears/it's okay to be scared"" is out of place (even in a ghost movie), especially when the son's idiotic fear of spiders almost gets them killed by rampaging zombies.  Instead of sympathizing with the child, I felt like punching him.  Pirates of the Caribbean excelled in that, though based off of a children's ride, they left out extraneous and pointless child roles.Still, if you're going into the movie based on your sheer love of the ride, you're sure to get some enjoyment out of seeing the Haunted Mansion ride cast onto the big screen.",The Haunted Mansion

I can assure you that you will soon think of something better to do. This is without doubt THE worst film ever made and I have seen 'Faust'. Wallace Shawn plays the exact same character he did in 1987 in The Princess Bride with no obvious point to it. The story goes absolutely nowhere and numerous times I found myself just wandering around the house looking for something better to fulfill my hour and a half. So in summary if you feel like watching this, don't, just go stare at your hands in the corner. You will have a much more enjoyable time.",The Haunted Mansion
153,songwriter2day,This film had its moments,6,19 September 2005,"There was so much potential here. Eddie Murphy simply was miscast. With the right script, this picture could have been wonderful! But the Dapper Dans are absolutely terrific. The ending is a real charmer. The late great voice talent Paul Frees is indeed honored with the inclusion of the ride's famous lines. THe comedy here is contrived and not terribly honest. Without honesty, any comedy is doomed! The Pirates movie worked because it revealed wonderful things about the background of the ride that we simply did not know. But here, the focus is on the unfunny moments which doomed it. One day great studios will realize that a great film is more than simply high concept thrown together quickly.

Really the only thing that stood out to me in the film was Terrence Stamp's performance as Rasmley, the Gracey Manor butler. On a side note, he was the only decent actor in the entire movie. Believe me Eddie Murphy does a much better job at voicing Donkey in Shrek than he does by portraying the main protagonist of the movie. Even so, the film lacked the seriousness and foreboding that its title had suggested and fails to be a winner for the director, audience and of course Disney. With that being the case, ""be sure to bring your iPad"" with you just in case you get bored watching the entire film. 'Nuff said.",The Haunted Mansion
162,arlee-topgunn2,Absolutely loved it!,10,6 August 2018,"It was a good mix of funny and ""horror."" All those people who give Eddie Murphy and the other actors crap are just being mean. Yes, there were a few things that didn't make sense, and there were changes that could have been made. But that's the case with nearly every movie.",The Haunted Mansion
163,smccamley97,Bad movie for lovers of Disney ride.,4,7 March 2015,"I enjoy some of Eddie Murphy's movies, but this was simply painful to watch. Between the bad-mouthed children and the boring plot line, this movie really brings shame to those, like me, who love the Haunted Mansion ride in Walt Disney World. The 90 minutes of film included almost nothing ""haunted"" and I'm struggling to think of any reason to rate it higher than a 4. However, the technical effects and attention to detail of the set is what made the movie somewhat of an enjoyment. With certain areas of the mansion recalling to the famous ride, it is enjoyable and nostalgic to watch those come to life on screen. Overall, very disappointed with this Disney movie. They had the opportunity to create something magical and failed- especially with Eddie Murphy as the lead actor.",The Haunted Mansion
164,coffeejedi,Like watching 2 movies at once,6,30 May 2006,"Disney's Haunted Mansion is a very conflicted movie. It's as if the filmmakers wanted to make one sort of film experience, but the ""suits"" wanted another, and so we're left with a bizarre mash-up that has some fantastic parts, and some horrible.The movie underneath is great. Beautiful art design, phenomenal special effects, and a real commitment to honoring the Imagineer's legacy that made it possible. Not only did they include sets, dialog, scenes, and characters lifted directly from the attraction, they expanded classic bits like the fantastic score, and made Gracey Manor ""come alive"" (or should that be undead?) on celluloid. Other homages to Disneyland are included, such as hidden Mickeys, a vocal performance by Main Street's own Dapper Dans, the sofa from 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea, and even a sly Tiki Room reference. THIS part of the movie lends a great story to the classic attraction.Then there's the movie ""on top"". Filled with bored kids, Eddie Murphy endlessly mugging for the camera, and out-of-place pop culture references that will send shivers up your spine (out of cringing though, not fear); the movie on the surface will possibly make you want to throw your remote at the TV. You can almost hear the ""sharp pencil boys"" reviewing the original treatment, scheming away at how they can make the movie more marketable to hyperactive kids. My advice? Skip right to the director's commentary and bypass the terrible script. You'll understand what's happening and not have to listen to the ridiculously shoe-horned hip hop song over the credits to boot. (they couldn't end on Grim Grinning Ghosts? Seriously, what the heck does picking up girls in a Lamborghini have to do with the Haunted Mansion)",The Haunted Mansion
165,tbfalsename,Bland light hearted fun,5,30 September 2006,"This film is not a cinematic masterpiece, but then that's something it was never trying to be. It's fairly bland fairly, light hearted, fairly routine and fairly amusing. It won't make you think, but it's not meant to. It's aimed at kids and it's something you can watch with them without having to worry that you'll have to explain anything. it's not Murphy's best work but it's not his worst either. I've seen better films and I've seen worse, often when someone took a good premise/plot and presented it poorly.In short this is an average film which you can use to switch off waste 1.5 hours of your life with. Just don't expect to come away from it feeling enlightened or taxed mentally, and you shouldn't be too disappointed. It's a kiddie movie and it shows.",The Haunted Mansion
166,sydneyyoung05,Entertaining and slightly funny,7,27 January 2006,"Haunted Mansion was a decent movie. Compared to the other Disney movie based off a ride Pirates of the Caribbean. Haunted Mansion does not compare. It's true Haunted Mansion could have been a better movie. But the humor, riddles, beautiful imagery at the beginning, and romance story help to flush out a wacky storyline. The movie has it's good points. Eddie Murphy is not that funny but the supporting cast makes up for that. The story is easy to solve but it still is a movie worth watching. It's a little comedy and romance movie. Rent the DVD and see if you like Haunted Mansion for yourself. If it does not please you maybe your kids will like it if you have any.",The Haunted Mansion
167,jana-55,This was the worst movie I've ever seen.,1,24 October 2005,"I can't believe Disney would even put their name on this one. It's NOT for children, as there are suicides towards the beginning, and at the end of the movie, when they send the Master to hell, they use very foul language and it scared my kid to death with the fire and sound effects. This movie is an embarrassment for Disney. Disney is known for their outstanding effects, and story lines. They are known for entertaining the whole family. The originality and quality are what Walt Disney invisioned for his company. And this movie probably has Walt turning over in his grave. Whoever gave the ""go"" on the filming of this story plot, much less the release of the movie itself, outta be fired.",The Haunted Mansion
168,iuliacgrama,Great film for its genre,10,22 October 2020,"If you want to watch a nice, family friendly film with very tolerable spooky scenes, this is the one. I do not understand why it has such a low rating. This is great for what they went for! It's funny AND spooky, and kids will understand it - speaking from experience.I loved it as a kid and still love it as an adult! I imagine the bad reviews come from people who were expecting to see either the funniest movie on earth or the spookiest Halloween one. This is in the middle, a chill version of both and some really lovely scenes!!!",The Haunted Mansion
169,maddieaurora,how did Disney even get away with this movie,5,15 February 2020,"This movie literally gave me nightmares as a kid. The graphics were pretty good for that day& age, and the plot was really good. Forever one of my favourite movies",The Haunted Mansion
