0,SnoopyStyle,needs more tension,6,24 March 2020,"In 2007, Destiny (Constance Wu) is a struggling new dancer at a Manhattan strip club. She befriends veteran dancer Ramona Vega (Jennifer Lopez) who shows her the ropes. The clientele are Wall Street traders and times are good. Then the 2008 crash happens. The movie jumps around in time with Destiny being interviewed by reporter Elizabeth (Julia Stiles) in 2014. After the crash, Destiny gets pregnant, kicks out her no-good boyfriend, and reluctantly returns to stripping. That's where she runs into Ramona again. She joins her and her minions, Mercedes (Keke Palmer) and Annabelle (Lili Reinhart), in a scheme to return to the good old days.This movie is in need of more tension. Filmmaker Lorene Scafaria should be thinking about injecting tension into every scene. Quite frankly, this doesn't start until the halfway point. Destiny finding her way in the strip club is the least exciting drama. I was expecting Ramona to be a dominating presence. I would insert a line where she tells Destiny that her split is 70-30 at least. Destiny should be a little more wide-eyed. It would help if she sheds a few tears when she goes up to smoke with Ramona. She needs to be more damsel-in-distress. For the second half, I like the moral descend of Destiny. I want Ramona to be harder sooner. It may be silly but Annabelle's vomiting is at least funny. On the other hand, Elizabeth is mostly a mistake. Her sections reveal too much and saps more tension away. She could get into the movie at the end. She does have something to add to this movie but she cannot reveal the ending before the plot.",Hustlers
1,Prismark10,Hustlers,5,9 December 2019,"Hustlers is based on 2015 article in New York Magazine about some New York pole dancers. The women reacted to the downturn in their fortunes after the 2008 financial crash by drugging some of their more lucrative clients and running up a high tab on their credit cards.Before that Hustlers is more like Showgirls. It invites its audience into the glamorous yet sleazy world of strip clubs. Destiny (Constance Wu) is the new girl, struggling to make ends meet until she encounters the veteran stripper Ramona (Jennifer Lopez.) Destiny learns how to bag the rich clients and make real money.Unfortunately Destiny was never taught how to save money for a rainy day. Everyone thought the good times would go on and on.Hustlers claims to be a feminist film, it even has a female director in Lorene Scafaria. It is a tawdry film, the early part of the movie could had been directed by any sex crazed male director under instructions from Harvey Weinstein. My wife who watched this with me commented. How could J-Lo degrade herself like this.These ladies are not hustlers. They are drugging men and robbing them. The film claims to have a defence that the rich financial guys used women so these pole dancers just got their own back.Scafaria gives the film an energy like a music video. Usher makes a cameo at one point as himself. For the dramatic moments, the film is a letdown. I got the feeling that this was a thin story stretched out.",Hustlers
2,nogodnomasters,We're breaking the law. We don't want to work with criminals.,4,27 September 2019,"The film centers on Destiny (Constance Wu) who is trying to make a living as a stripper so she can take care of her grandmother. She is taken under wing by Ramona (Jennifer Lopez) who teaches her the ropes to do 4 figured lap dances in the backroom for Wall Street fat cats. After the 2008 crash, the girls are working retail. Destiny returns and turns cheap tricks to care for her girl and grandmother. Ramona has discovered a scheme where they can drug rich guys and max out their credit card. It is all fun and games until someone loses their house.Call me white, but I preferred Demi Moore as a stripper. Jennifer Lopez overplayed her part and made it looked fake. The acting was not convincing and the script was horrible at building character. Perhaps the worst thing about this film is that it will give working girls ideas.Guide: F-word. Brief sex. Nudity (not the main stars- they play strippers but don't get naked)",Hustlers
3,kosmasp,True story,7,19 August 2020,"Who's hustling who? Well in this case it is obvious, at least when it comes to our main characters here (Cardi B not being one of them, though she has quite the interesting scene in the movie). Now I wasn't aware of the story this is based on, but of course I had heard some stuff. As to how true to what actually happened this is: I can't answer that.I can say that I didn't think much of the movie, before watching it, the theme did not strike a chord with me, especially the circumstances this supposedly went down. Now having seen it, especially the first half of the movie, the build up, is quite something. You get to see behind the scenes, you get to understand the motivation behind some of the craziness. I still am no fan of what went down. I still consider this a bit too positive at times, considering what they did, but that's me. This is no Robin Hood club and sometimes it does get very apparent (when it dares to actually show the ugly side of it). Excuses are made though and that is something you have to be aware of. Yes the world is mean and bad - is there a reason to make it even worse? Am I being too naive? I understand if you disagree, but there it is - and the movie is still able to entertain overall (morals aside). On a different note: J-Lo asking Usher for his name in a scene, must be the one of the most Meta things in movies in recent times ... With that being said: enjoy your/the dance!",Hustlers
4,jboothmillard,Hustlers,8,22 September 2019,"This film, inspired by a true viral New York Magazine article, was getting a lot of attention, including talks of Oscar nominations, and being described as something like The Wolf of Wall Street, so I was really interested, written and directed by Lorene Scafaria (Seeking a Friend for the End of the World). Basically, former New York City-based stripper Dorothy (Constance Wu) is being interviewed by journalist Elizabeth (Julia Stiles), a journalist working on a story involving her former friend and mentor, Ramona Vega (Jennifer Lopez, also producing). In 2007, Dorothy, known by the stripper name Destiny, is working at a strip club to support her Grandmother (Wai Ching Ho) but is barely getting by. Dorothy watches a performance by popular stripper Ramona, they meet on the rooftop and hit it off. Romana takes Dorothy under her wing to teach her all the moves and to recognise the three different types of customers. The first type are stingy insecure men who can be for weeks if not months can be strung along, the second type are frequent regulars at the club, and the third type are CEOs, bankers, and hedge funders ready to spend thousands for a good night. Together, Dorothy and Ramona make a formidable team targeting their third type of clients, with Dorothy learning to enjoy her newly acquired wealth. In 2008, the financial crisis strikes, the club loses business and Dorothy and Ramona find themselves short on cash. Dorothy's boyfriend abandons her, and she is unable to find a new job. With no other options, Dorothy tries to return to stripping, but her old club is now used for prostitution, which she is unwilling to enter. Ramona, with fellow strippers Mercedes (Keke Palmer) and Annabelle (Lili Reinhart), introduces Dorothy to a new scheme: targeting rich men at bars, getting them drunk, and then escorting them to the club where the girls steal their credit card numbers and charge them to their limit. Dorothy joins them and learns that Ramona has also been using drugs like ketamine and MDMA to give their customers memory loss and impair their judgements. Dorothy argues that drugging the men is worth the risk since none of their victims will not want to be humiliated, admitting to being robbed by strippers or going to the police. The scheme seems to work, but some of the targets prove to be too aggressive, so they bring in other girls, who are carefully trained to avoid drinking or using drugs. Ramona's partnership with the club makes the credit card fraud lucrative for them, all workers are given their cut of the profits. But cracks start to form in the operation, when other strippers start copying them. A furious Ramona cuts business ties with the club, and the group service clients in hotels and their homes, they split the earnings between themselves. Following Christmas, the girls become increasingly unreliable, so Ramona brings in strippers with drug problems and prior criminal convictions to replace them, something Dorothy feels is extremely risky. Dorothy's fears prove true when a client nearly dies and she is forced to take him to the hospital while another girl, Dawn (The Handmaid's Tale's Madeline Brewer), needs bailing out of jail. Dorothy returns home one day and finds her grandmother has died. At the funeral, Ramona promises to take care of her from now on. In 2014, Dorothy becomes uncomfortable when Elizabeth insists on talking about Ramona and stops the interview, telling her to leave. Elizabeth returns home, but Dorothy calls her and agrees to finish their conversation. Ramona's callousness creates tension between her and Dorothy, who finds that she can no longer justify her crimes. Dawn is arrested and grasses on her partners, while investigators manage to locate several victims and identify the other girls. Destiny, Ramona, Annabelle, and Mercedes are arrested, but only Dorothy takes a plea bargain. Ramona manages to avoid jail time, while the others serve short sentences before being released on probation. A year later, Elizabeth goes to see Ramona, who now works a retail job, and she muses that Destiny was the only person she trusted to have her back, and that she treated her like one of her most valued possessions. The article is published, and Elizabeth encourages Dorothy to reach out to Ramona and make amends. Also starring ""Juice"" singer Lizzo as Liz, rapper Cardi B as Diamond, Mercedes Ruehl as Mama, the club's den mother, rapper G-Eazy aka Gerald Earl Gillum as Johnny and singer Usher as himself. Wu is splendid as the sympathetic protagonist, trash-talking Cradi B is memorable in her brief screen-time, Lizzo is likeable as well, but this film belongs to Lopez, strutting her curvaceous figure and with her fantastically swaggering diva performance. It has a fantastic soundtrack, featuring Sean Kingston - ""Beautiful Girls"", Britney Spears - ""Gimme More"", and Usher feat. Young Jeezy - ""Love in this Club"". The script is very witty, the themes of friendship, female empowerment and hustling are clever, and the club sequences, many being glamourous montages, are full of lavish colour, obviously there is titillation, with the sleazy men (most from Wall Street) being just fodder for the women, it a fresh and most impressive crime comedy-drama. Very good!",Hustlers
5,BandSAboutMovies,Lots to think about here,6,31 December 2019,"Hustlers is based on the New York magazine's 2015 article ""The Hustlers at Scores: The Ex-Strippers Who Stole From (Mostly) Rich Men and Gave to, Well, Themselves"" by Jessica Pressler. It confirms to me what I've always known about men's clubs. The men think they run the world, but they have little to no power at all, despite the small bits of cash and ego they try to sap from the women who are way above them.Lorene Scafaria, who wrote Nick & Norah's Infinite Playlist and wrote and directed Seeking a Friend for the End of the World, wrote and directed this film. It's told through flashbacks as reporter Elizabeth (Julia Stiles) is working on a story about the girls and how they robbed men to pay for their lives.Destiny (Constance Wu, Crazy Rich Asians) is dancing at Moves - you know, Scores - to support her grandmother but is barely getting by until she learns the ins and outs of dancing from Ramona (Jennifer Lopez). Seriously, this entire movie should belong to J. Lo. The scene where she mesmerizes Destiny before letting her hide under her fur coat on the roof? That's why she's still the biggest star around at fifty.After the financial crisis of 2007-2008 - and one last night with Usher throwing enough money at the girls to solve all of my money woes for life - things get rough. No one has money and the Russian girls that work the club now are more about selling sexual favors than using their bodies to make money the old fashioned way without really having sex.That's when Ramona and Destiny reconnect and start using a mix of Special K and MDMA to knock dudes out and take all of their cash via credit card at the club. Life's good again, but it can't last.The other girls in the film are played by Keke Plamer (who hosts Strahan, Sara and Keke with Sara Haines and Michael Strahan), Lili Reinhart (Betty from Riverdale), transgender actress Trace Lysette (who before she became one of the first trans people to appear as a non-transgender person on prime time television in a speaking role performed as a showgirl in bars around Dayton and Columbus, Ohio), Madeline Brewer (Orange Is the New Black, The Handmaid's Tale) and Lizzo and Cardi B in what are pretty much cameo roles. Plus, Mercedes Ruhl is the mother of all the ladies.In truth, Cardi B has admitted to illegally drugging and robbing men in the early stages of her career, so she pretty much knows exactly what this movie is all about. Lopez personally brought the actress on board, saying ""I know she knew this world better than any of us. I told her she had to do it. And I wasn't going to take no for an answer.""Stand up comedian Big Jay Oakerson plays the club's DJ and one of the customers who gets taken is played by Devin Ratray, who was Buzz in the Home Alone films and the bully in Little Monsters.This wasn't bad, to be honest. It could have used more of the dog, Mister Bruce, who is a scene stealer. And there's one scene I'd like to call out: after the Russian girls start, guys start ignoring Ramona, even paying her to leave one evening. Is this movie science fiction? Jennifer Lopez is setting the screen on fire and this dude is like, ""We're all good, thanks."" Certainly, this man is an android from the Weyland-Yutani company and not a stockbroker from the boiler room.",Hustlers
6,sunwarrior13,A Movie About Bad Ass Strippers,7,14 September 2019,"Jennifer Lopez and Constance Wu stars in this movie that could be classified as a film about women performing crime entitled ""Hustlers"". The film has the main characters -Ramona and Destiny - which could be classified as bad ass women who worked as strippers.One day,they decided to earn more money in their work by manipulating their costumers and stealing even more money from them.The movie was slow in the beginning but it started to get interesting when Ramona decided to take their profession into the next level after they expect economic difficulties that are to come.Their actions of manipulations became more interesting as it was unexpected on the characters' part.In fact,it could be classified as a female counterpart of ""Goodfellas"".The performances were commendable particularly from Lopez and Wu.As for the movie as a whole,it could be considered good one especially for viewers who want to see women in the life of crime.",Hustlers
7,CinemaSerf,"""What would you do for $1,000?""",4,5 April 2020,"A group of gorgeous female strippers tire of running the relentless hamster wheel and so decide to engage in some much more serious series of organised cons to ensure they can keep up their long-term standards of living. Jennifer Lopez and Constance Wu portray the shrewd, determined and pretty unscrupulous women who extort huge sums of cash from their gullible, sex-obsessed marks - most of whom are married. It's all rather tawdry; sure why shouldn't the women rip off their exploitative clients, but it's all just a bit too ostentatiously performed and when they happily start to drug their stupid punters it descends into a classy-looking, but seedy and unpleasant - almost reckless - thing to watch. It blurs in-your-face comedy and reality is a way that delivers well on neither front and any excuse that ""men have been doing it for years"" doesn't make the underlying concept any more agreeable. There is a lot of POV camerawork and quick cuts that attempt to create intimacy and pace; perhaps to help us engage with the characters? Sadly, it's all just a shallow exercise in sexploitation that goes sour with all the inevitability of the sun going down...",Hustlers
8,writers_reign,Mercedes Ruehls OK,4,23 September 2019,"I can take or leave Jennifer Lopez, no one else in the cast rsng any bells and I didn't see a trailer. Then, quite by chance, I learned that Mercedes Ruehl had a supporting role and that was enough to swing it. Apart from three or four episodes of Frasier I've seen Ruehl only once, in the film version (she did it on Broadway but, alas, when it played the UK we were stuck with Maureen Lipman, a legend in her own mindb, self-proclaimed National Treasure, and not fit to hand Ruehl a tube of Leichner) of Neil Simon's Lost In Yonkers in which she was beyond brilliant. Here role in Hustlers is comparatively small but she blows (sorry about that) everyone else away. I had a hard time staying awake when Ruehl was offscreen but I don't doubt it will find its audience.",Hustlers
9,neil-476,Neither edifying nor entertaining,6,22 September 2019,"Dorothy (aka Destiny) lives with her grandmother, and mony is tight. Destiny becomes a poledancer, is befriended by old hand Ramona, and all is well until the sub-prime crisis hits Wall Street, and the easy money dries up. Ramona develops a plan - if you and your friends pick up a mark, and slip him a concoction which renders him gaga, then you can max out his credit cards and tell him he had a great time afterwards, worth every penny, shame he can't remember it.This is based on a true story, and I can believe it. Jennifer Lopez is Ramona and Constance Wu is Dorothy. Both women swear prodigiously and wear little clothing (although always more than the other performers in the club). Both women also act well.But this film is not happy or edifying. What happens is not pleasant, and the female characters aren't particularly sympathetic. Maybe they are more sympathetic from a feminist standpoint, but I didn't care for them much. The film is too long by about half an hour, and I left the cinema without feeling that I had been entertained.",Hustlers
10,evanston_dad,Surprisingly Good,8,15 October 2019,"I didn't have high expectations for a movie about strippers starring Jennifer Lopez, but I was pleasantly surprised by how good this movie was. I saw this a couple of days after I saw ""Joker,"" and it might sound funny to say, but they're kind of kindred movies. They both, in their respective ways, are an angry response to the increasing disparity -- economic, gender, racial, you name it -- plaguing American culture, and they're both about those being trampled deciding to do some trampling of their own for a change. Toward the end of ""Hustlers,"" Jennifer Lopez's character says something about how the whole world is one big hustle; there are those doing the hustling, and those paying for it. She also argues against playing by the rules when the rules are rigged from the start. If her character and Arthur Fleck, the sociopath brought brilliantly to life by Joaquin Phoenix in ""Joker,"" went on a date, they could have a field day jointly venting their disgust at the whole rotten system.Lopez is being bandied about as a potential Oscar nominee for her performance. I don't know about that. She's good, but I'm not sure her performance is much of a stretch for her, and it mostly consists of shots of her strutting toward the camera in slow motion, which she admittedly does very well. Most of the heavy lifting acting falls to Constance Wu, a woman who's just bad enough to team up with other strippers in drugging and robbing clueless guys but who isn't bad enough not to feel conflicted about it the whole time. Though we don't feel overly conflicted as an audience, since almost all the guys are rich white Wall Street jerks, and when was the last time anyone felt sorry for them?Grade: A-",Hustlers
11,HotToastyRag,Disgusting,3,23 March 2021,"The beginning scenes of Hustlers show an un-sugar-coated view of strippers at a low-class club. In a crowded ""dressing room"", the girls talk about their bodies as the pieces of equipment they are, they aren't shy, they look used and beaten down, and the clientele and atmosphere are so sleazy, it makes you feel like you'll catch something merely by watching it. Then Jennifer Lopez shows up. She's beautiful, sexy, confident, savvy, entitled - basically, she's Jennifer Lopez.There was such a buzz during last year's awards season, claiming she'd been snubbed by not getting a Best Supporting Actress nomination. But she didn't do any acting! She's been an entertainer for thirty years, so for thirty years, she's been beautiful, sexy, confident, and savvy. She may not feel entitled on the inside, but her outward persona certainly isn't humble. In Hustlers, she may not be the same character she was in The Wedding Planner, but she's not any different than the entertainer giving concerts since the 1990s. And although she had all the moves and said all her lines correctly, she was out of place. Constance Wu, the actual lead of the movie despite the lack of buzz about her performance, had a constant self-hatred in her eyes that showed she didn't think she was worth anything more than the life of a stripper. Several girls in the supporting cast looked completely filthy, like they've been through the wringer every night for twenty years, and they had a deadened look in their eyes. Girls who become strippers don't believe they're worth a different life. They aren't beautiful, with sensational figures, and they don't live a glamorous life. Before Jennifer Lopez entered the picture, Hustlers was on track to showing it like it really is, but she didn't look like she'd spent a single night in such a dive bar. She seemed like a high-class call girl - and there's a huge difference.While most female viewers will find the glamorization of the featured strippers disgusting, I was more sickened by how they chose to spend their money. Did they save it for a down payment on a house, invest it, start a college fund? No, they spent it on expensive clothes, shoes, handbags, and fur coats. I wouldn't really recommend this movie for female audiences. It was clearly only made for men to drool over practically naked women bumping and grinding against a stripper pole and on clients' laps. There's a shocking lack of character development to show that the women who would choose such a life would have massive problems. Instead of an actual story, there's a quick caper of dropping drugs into men's drinks and robbing their credit cards, mixed in with scantily clad, titillating stripteases by beautiful women. Was there any man who watched this movie who thought badly of Jennifer Lopez and her gang? Or did they think, ""Gee, I'd give up a few thousand dollars to have a fun night with those girls""? My money's on the latter.DLM Warning: If you suffer from vertigo or dizzy spells, like my mom does, this movie might not be your friend. There's a bit of handheld camera in some scenes, and that will make you sick. In other words, ""Don't Look, Mom!""Kiddy Warning: Obviously, you have control over your own children. However, due to language, nudity, and sexual content, I wouldn't let my kids watch it.",Hustlers
12,phd_travel,Most fun movie of 2019!,9,12 September 2019,"Delightfully funny and well written story. From the beginning it gets your sympathy. When Wall Street suffers, it trickles down, all the way down! The effect of the 2008 financial crisis on lap dancers is hilarious and rings very true. Jennifer Lopez looks and dances terrifically and not just for her age. She acts well too just hard nosed enough yet likable. Lili Reinhart of Riverdale and Cardi B are good supporting cast. Constance Wu shows she can do something really different from Crazy Rich Asians. She is sweet and a sympathetic central character. Love the score - a highly original use of Chopin Etudes as a soundtrack. It's quite a feel good story for a crime story. Bit of a Pretty Woman / Mayflower Madam vibe. Of course they do show when they cross the line it is wrong. Wall Street hot shots can be victims too!Hilarious and touching from beginning to end. Better than those done to death crime heist caper movies.",Hustlers
13,gradyharp,'Doesn't money make you horny?',5,24 December 2019,"Lorene Scafaria wrote the screenplay for this 'factual' tale based on Jessica Pressler's New York Magazine story (Jessica -as Julia Stiles - plays a small role in the film) and directs this overly long crude look at the world of women strippers. The fact that Jennifer Lopez not only stars but is also the producer may dismay her fans, but her acting is convincing, as is that of Constance Wu.The précis: women strippers make loads of money until their Wall Street clients belly up during the 2008 crash and they must turn to hustling with the use of drugs to gain 'vengeance' on their male clients. It's about 'family' of like minds (and habits) and the bulk of the film is focused on near nude stripping/dancing and a barrage of use of the F word. Poorly written and inconsistent, the film is entertainment for those who love exaggerated pole dancing. For everyone else - not so much.",Hustlers
14,trashgang,amazing J-Lo on all parts,8,18 April 2020,"Based on true events this one rally surprised me on behalf of Lopez.Just look at her age and then see her perform in the strip club, unbelievable what she does and how her body is preserved.Flick starts with a lot of action taking place in the strip club and so for some it could be a bit too much of that but it shows how things can suddenly go wrong and it does due the crisis back in the day. Once the Wall Street boys are losing all their money it's over with the strip clubs and it's from there that this movie turns into a crime flick. Unbelievable what they did in real life. Smart to add Lili Reinhart from Riverdale in it, so the teens will watch this too but for me she wasn't convincing in the role as a dancer. As in Riverdale were she's the girl next door here against some sexy performances she looks a bit too shy to do like the rest.But not a bad movie after all, I heard a lot about it that it was a must see and I agree for so many reasons.

15,deloudelouvain,"I can't say I enjoyed this movie, even not with all those goodlooking women shaking their bits.",5,5 February 2020,"Hustlers, inspired by true events if you have to believe them, but the truth is that I have serious doubts that this all happened like they showed us. Men (pathetic ones) losing big amounts of cash by watching women (goodlooking ones) shaking their ass and flashing their boobs, all that without having intercourse, that's just really hard to believe. Other than the story, that is pretty boring and repetitive, the only thing you get to see is a bunch of women being full of themselves, having giggling pajama parties by themselves, rather boring to watch if you ask me. As for the acting, it is what it is, Jennifer Lopez isn't and will never be a good actress, she has a killer body, certainly for her age, but acting is just not one of her skills. As for the moral of the story, if a bunch of men drugged women and stole all their money they would all be in jail, in this movie you just get the feeling the law isn't the same for both sexes.",Hustlers

I was waiting for the big reveal or drama or whatever happens in the third act to keep you interested in the characters that were presented in the first part of the movie. And it never happened. This was just... not interesting or appealing in any way. Even the strip club scenes were ruined by either bad editing or choosing to focus on an obese stripper for some reason.And the cast... so many people I recognized that had absolutely no relevant roles: the one eyed crazy lady from Handmaid's Tale, Julia Stiles, Frank Whaley... even Usher made a 2 minute appearance.

18,lasttimeisaw,HUSTLERS triumphantly milks audience's nostalgia to great extent,7,15 December 2019,"""Cramming zeitgeist ear-worms into its chronically arranged plot development (Usher has a cameo to re-enact the glory in his heyday), HUSTLERS triumphantly milks audience's nostalgia to great extent, and proffers another leading role for Asian-American rising star Constance Wu, who ripens into a more world-savvy role that attests her chops (her seething angst of juggling both motherhood and career hustler after frantically fielding an unexpected accident is the highlight), but one can easily see why Lopez, embodying both preternaturally age-defying lissomness and emotional candidness, is raved for her career-best outing, finally, not just a famous-for-being-famous celebrity in the Oscar ceremony, she can actually vie for the highest reword as an actress, that is the life-affirming story the Academy members find pretty hard to resist.""read my full review on my blog: cinema omnivore, thanks",Hustlers
19,cherold,engaging stories and solid performances,8,4 January 2020,"This is a sort of distaff Goodfellas about women building a criminal enterprise. I don't think it's right to call it a ""feminist"" movie except to that extent that ""women can commit crimes just as well as men can"" is feminist. Like most of Scorcese's films, it's not about making a political point but rather about exploring personality and motivation.I actually would have liked a bit more of a political point; the victims represent the excesses and criminality of Wall Street but the script does less with that than I would have liked.The movie follows a bunch of strippers who decide they can make more money bilking than stripping, and we see them grow the business, pushed along by their charismatic ringleader, Ramona.Ramona is brave and ambitious but protagonist Destiny has a little more sense, and the film is both about how criminals get started and how they can plant the seeds of their own destruction.The result is not as dark as you get with Scorcese - the crimes are pretty minor and the women have neither the power or the blood lust that infuses Scorcese's gang films - but it is as entertaining.Jennifer Lopez is good as Ramona, although I don't get while her performance has been lauded so highly by critics, especially since Constance Wu is so excellent in the less flashy role of Destiny.If you're looking for a humorous, dramatic mix of crime and sisterhood, this is the movie for you.

Maybe the bombardment of feminist, male weary undertones in modern pop culture made me feel it might be being hyped up to be something it's not, but now I have seen it, I find the result just something blindly in the middle.Scafaria has taken a group of lead characters, who are essentially pretty morally dubious characters, and attempted to make them into female Robin Hood types, with their prey portrayed as the horrible WS fat cats who deserve what they get, however they steal from the rich and give to themselves, so they're hardly that laudable. As a female director, Scafaria might have been able to put her female cast more at ease, and get more natural, authentically effeminate performances from them. In the lead role, Lopez (the apparent Oscar contender!) possibly does give one of her strongest, most commanding performances, but she's still a mediocre, very average actress, who's better at singing. If anyone steals the show, it's relative newcomer Wu as the innocent newcomer, who has to toughen up quickly.While the story (which, like many others, is all the more unbelievable because it's based on a true one!) is engaging enough, and just about manages to keep you intrigued for the considerable running time, despite the rave reviews it's ultimately just a serviceable, middle of the road film that won't stay in your memory that long afterwards. ***",Hustlers
21,ElMaruecan82,J-Lo as a hooker with a heart of gold... and balls of steel ...,8,2 November 2019,"I really went tiptoeing to the movie theaters, if it wasn't for the huge acclaim J-Lo got for her performance and her being the actual frontrunner in the Best Supporting Actress category, I might have thrown this film thinking it would be a retread of last year's overrated ""Widows"" or maybe a cross between ""Ocean's 8"" and ""Showgirls"" or maybe I expected another male-bashing film using its hustle premise to deliver some feminist message etc.While the film comments on some corners women are driven to in order to make a decent living (sometimes a more-than-decent one), it's not a women vs. men thing but a dirty game where everyone plays with what he or she's got the best. Some with a fountain pen and contracts, some with tight skirts and high heels.... and a mixture of euphoriants and black-outs inducing drugs. That's the fish-and-bait process: target the yuppie prick, bring friends, make him drink the special cocktail, pretend to drink as well and accept whatever drugs he gives you and get him to the strip club to wear his credit cards out.It's like ""The Sting"" repeated a hundred times until an expertise is acquired, until the art of seducing, drugging and taking the money turns to a real business with commissions, percentages on a club's outcome and even outsourcing. And in a game where women are told to undress and exhibit their bodies, it's only fair according to them to make men empty their pockets, there's some kind of inner poetry in that. The idea is that those who have access to these strip clubs are privileged enough to get over a scam and corrupt enough to have had it coming anyway. We're not forced to agree with that but we can't totally dismiss the reasoning either.The plot was orchestrated by Destiny (Constance Wu) and Rosana (J-Lo) who was the true ringleader. But for Ramona, I would paraphrase what Roger Ebert said about Frank Lucas in ""American Gangster"": apart from the detail that she was a stripper and a hustler, Ramona's career would be an ideal case study for a business school. And in another life, she could have gone much further by staying in the good side. About Ramona, I would also say that she's the pillar of the film and J-Lo can win the Oscar, she delivered the kind of raw energy that makes a performance look so natural it eclipses all the others... maybe she was so good that Constance Wu was almost invisible.I understand Wu was supposed to play an insecure woman in awe of her new friend but it took me a while to really appreciate her performance and it seems that the director Lorene Scafaria needed to fill her role with some scenes of crying and breakdowns while J-Lo didn't need any, she could walk or smile and still steal the show. And so far, she provided what I consider the most memorable moment of 2019, her entrance where she makes such an impact she literally swims in a pool of green bills is one of the sexiest scene of recent times, and it awakened the inner teenage who admired J-Lo's body in her ""Let's Get Down""live concert or her ""Jenny from the Block"" clip.The film contains many sexy moments (perhaps a tad too many) but J-Lo couldn't have a better character-establishing moment if we include the tender way she gets the frail Destiny under her aisle (and furry coat) and teach her the tricks of the business. The two had great chemistry and the film is also a great friendship story, which is saying a lot because the hustle story is still the best part. And while Scafaria lets herself sometimes carried away by some desire to replicate the ""Casino"" style and overplays the slo-mo big entrances, the plot flows smoothly, going from a few tricks to little games to bigger games until we get to the big scheme that consist on fishing and ruining the Wall Street guys. By the time it starts, we know everyone and the way it works.Now, should we feel sorry for the guys or happy when the girls are emptying bottle of champagnes in penthouse's sofas? I guess reading an article about the real story made me realize that the film is about unhappy girls hustling unhappy guys, at the end they get their money but they gamble it anyway for superficial stuff. It's a doomed to end spiral when there's one victim too many. The film follows the Scorsesian narrative with the obligatory betrayal and downfall, but I don't think Scafaria intended it as an exercise in style, the editing makes sense and although I had troubles understanding the purpose of the interview with the journalist played by Julia Stiles, it does tie the plot together in a surprisingly moving way.The film's not perfect but the failures of ""Showgirls"" and Demi Moore's ""Strip-Tease"" have proven that it's not that easy to center movies on that particular world and strippers have been so often reduced to poor victims or struggling mothers, which Wu is to a certain degree, that I was blown away by the way Ramona totally subverts the trope, playing a confident and smart woman with guts and ambitions, and that's why J-Lo deserved more praise again. And I applaud the film for not making saints of these women either, showing that even they can be cowardly or treacherous.Any lesser director or writer would have fallen in that trap but Scafaria did a solid and entertaining film with an intelligent approach, a woman-centered film that even men would enjoy, though I suspect many would for the wrong reasons. I must confess I was turned on by J-Lo's entrance, and I wonder if she'd do the same knee-hook or leg-hook or carousel moves turn in the Oscars with a giant replica of the statuette, sorry... give her the small one, that'd be enough.",Hustlers
22,MOscarbradley,A glossy but very minor affair.,5,11 April 2020,"Based on a true story ""Hustlers"" is about a group of pole-dancers who turn to crime; ""Widows"" it ain't. What it is, is a glossy female caper about sisterhood turning sour that takes too long to get to the point, though it is mostly redeemed by a star turn from Jennifer Lopez, (looking stunning), as the tough cookie who masterminds the hustle. The film itself is a fairly minor affair that for some obscure reason has wowed a lot of the critics with 'Sight and Sound' putting it in their top twenty films of the year. There is a story to be told here for sure but sadly we've seen it all before.",Hustlers
23,Pjtaylor-96-138044,Everyday we hustlin'.,6,16 September 2019,"Based on a recent article, 'Hustlers (2019)' tells the tale of a group of exotic dancers who decide to 'speed up their process' by drugging customers and, essentially, conning them out of their cash. While the piece is consistently competent - or more - in pretty much every aspect, it simply isn't all that compelling. It's not exactly boring but it's not exactly engaging, either. It's the kind of story that should be more interesting than it is, I suppose. It's often oddly-paced and, even, sort of cold. The narrative is rather conventional, beyond its most surface of elements, and it isn't clear exactly how much of the 'true story' is actually true (though, I suppose that doesn't really matter). There are moments that are much more successful, though. The two leads are pretty great, crafting believable and somewhat unconventional focal characters with apparent ease. The camaraderie between all the girls is quite palpable, too. You're usually on their side and, even if you're not, you always empathise with them. It's also worth mentioning that the pole-dancing is actually really impressive; the strength it must take is honestly astounding and the pain-staking practice that Lopez apparently put in certainly pays off. As I mentioned before, however, the flick just isn't all that entertaining. Its not particularly memorable or thematically-rich. It's not great, but it's good enough. 6/10",Hustlers
24,ThomasDrufke,We Were Hurricanes,7,6 October 2019,"Fair or not, Hustlers is very much Goodfellas with strippers, but that's not a criticism necessarily, but more of just a comment on the structure and tone of the story. When following main characters that are criminals, more often than not the film shows the rise and fall, and Hustlers is no different as the rise is far more captivating than the latter. I haven't seen a ton of Jennifer Lopez performances, but Hustlers is far and away the best she's ever been. The sequence on the pole that everyone is talking about just goes to show you how impressive she can be as a presence without saying many lines. Is she good enough to warrant a nomination? I'm not sure about that, but it's worth the discussion. The bottom line being that Hustlers is a story that should be told and I'm thrilled it was.7.5/10",Hustlers
25,Cineanalyst,Stripped to the Con,7,12 January 2020,"Fundamentally, ""Hustlers"" is a con-artist film, with all of the performance of actors-playing-actors that usually goes into the double crossing. It's a somewhat unusually straightforward one, though--as straightforward as strippers enticing with sex in exchange for money. Others in the genre will turn the con on us, the spectator, even if only for a revelatory denouement where a heist is explained (the Ocean's series does this a lot, for example). I like these type of movies because, in a way, they're, ironically, more honest than others. Cinema itself is a kind of con that we go along with--the so-called ""suspension of disbelief"" that's required to become invested in fictional narratives and artificially-arranged scenes. By adding another layer of deception on top of this inherent trickery suggests its own reveal--calling attention to the fact that we're being sold an illusion. ""Hustlers,"" however, invites the spectator into the dance instead of turning the con on us. Like Constance Wu's Dorothy, then, our destiny is to become friends with the con artists. Fortunately, Wu, Jennifer Lopez and the other women are a joy to follow through the glamour and sleaze of the world of stripping-turned-larceny.Rightfully, considerable attention for ""Hustlers"" has focused on Lopez's performance. It's easily the best I've ever seen from her, which, albeit, isn't a high hurdle considering the only other picture I recall liking that she was in was ""Out of Sight"" (1998). Nevertheless, she's effective here because of the star image she brings to the role of an actor-playing-an-actor exploiting her sex appeal. Between Lopez in a music video such as ""Booty"" and her character's pole dancing at the beginning of ""Hustlers,"" the only difference seems to be in degree of separation from the patrons paying for the sex. Akin to the difference between live theatre and motion pictures, if you prefer. Moreover, from this beginning, the strippers--already performers--add another layer of performance by, then, pretending to be strippers, or ""sisters,"" when in fact they're brazenly drugging and stealing from their marks. A good deal of time is spent on rationalizing that these marks are bad men who may deserve what they get--that the women are merely stealing from thieves. Indeed, the target is a soft one, as the guys tend to be Wall Street schmucks amidst the 2008 financial crisis, but I don't consider the point here to be that we're supposed to rationalize and argue ethics along with the them. That's the business of plea bargaining and journalists, which occupy a peripheral space here. To get stuck there is to con oneself. ""Hustlers"" is mainly concerned with the pure fun of our being vicariously led along their path from stripping to crime.There is some plot machinations going on here, though, if not entirely in the sense of turning the con back on us. This has to do with the identity of the narrator. First, it's Dorothy's point of view, but this is revealed to only be the case in so much as she's telling her story to the reporter played by Julia Stiles. Temporarily, the story we've been following ceases as Dorothy refuses to tell her any more of it. Thus, the reporter becomes the narrator of the story narrated to her by Dorothy. But, then, the third act unravels all of this for what is seemingly the usual unrestricted narrative--that is, no character as narrator. I'm a bit disappointed by this. As well, hardly any other tricks, such as in the way of an unreliable narrator, are suggested. Consequently, the plot of the movie begins to unravel around the same point that the characters' criminal one does likewise. Oh well, while it lasted, it was a guilty pleasure.",Hustlers

This female directed and written movie by Lorene Scafaria along with co-producing credits going to Lopez and interestingly enough Will Ferrell displays on screen an edgy and authentically, finely balanced mood and tone film imbued with both sharp drama and a genuine comedic humor rarely enveloped into one movie. While there are a lot of titillating suggestive scenes, this movie avoids the glamorization of the striptease unlike that overly stylized in the musical and Oscar winning Chicago (2002). Instead Hustlers focuses on a raw look at women living a life that is both hard and reflective of the struggle that every woman faces, including the responsibility of caring for one another and their children. This amazing and compelling experience of a slice of life is powerful and sensitive portrayal of the connections and the travails of the lives of what seems to amount to be essentially single women living in a high-stakes life in an effort to survive. The only weaknesses that stand out are the absence of a more descriptive understanding of Wu's interaction with her boyfriend and their evolving relationship and Lopez's apparent willingness to retain a connection with one of her more questionable hustlers.",Hustlers

32,eddie_baggins,A grimy & sleazy trip to the underbelly of New York,4,17 October 2019,"If I'm being honest, I feel as though the fact Hustlers has been released and is not being talked about as a candidate for one of the years worst films is some form of cinematic miracle.In what appeared to be film that could've easily have been the modern day Showgirls, group of working class strippers band together to rip off sleazy Wall Street and high rolling clients, Hustler's ability to overcome its seemingly doomed based on a true story premise is something that's worth noting and due largely to the fact Crazy Rich Asians breakout star Constance Wu and the sure to be awards nominated co-star Jennifer Lopez bring their A-games to Lorene Scafaria's feature.Now that we've celebrated the fact Hustlers has become a film with a rating in the high 80's on Rotten Tomatoes and high 70's on Metacritic, against the odds it now feels as though Hustlers has become one of the year's most unworthily praised films, in what's a sleazy and unlikable experience in the underbelly of New York City as a group of hard luck woman combine forces to manipulate and criminally drug supposed bad guys to gain a leg up in life.It's in this core concept in which Hustlers becomes an unlikable event, we're told and made to feel as though everyone Wu's Destiny and Lopez's Romona targets in their scheme, that sees them drugging their way around New York's high end players, are bad people, but it's hard to believe just because somebody is rich, automatically makes them someone it's OK to illegally drug, steal and gain from.There's very little enjoyment to be found from watching this rag-tag group of strippers enact their masterplan's on a collection of victims and while Hustlers starts out strong with Wu at first a likable enough central figure and Lopez as good as she's ever been as the street smart Romona, once Scafaria gets into the groove of the central plot-line that formed the basis of the news article in which Hustler's has been derived from, this film loses any of the entertainment value it could've potentially had.As the film wears one we become increasingly aware that there is no one here we can really root for, most of these characters have made their own bed and reap what they sow, there's nothing overtly placed in front of us that can make us shy away from the fact that these woman are just after a quick buck, in the some of the most depraved and dishonest means possible.When we set out to watch a gangster film we are not asked to enjoy the way they kill, rob and plunder their way to financial success but Hustler's problem is it feels as though its setting up its main group as some type of Robin Hood like woman, sticking it to the man and getting a slice of the pie they feel entitled to but there's no real reason why we want to see them achieve their goals at the detriment of everyone else around them, most of us end up being working class citizens, most of us live through hard times and most of us don't feel the need to drug and manipulate others to achieve financial gains.Final Say -A well shot film that's well acted by its main cast, Hustler's is supposed to feel grimy and dirty but it forgot to offer any real enjoyment for its viewers to take from a film that quite simply follows a collection everyday woman who decided their best bet at a good life was becoming monsters bigger than the supposed ones they were targeting for their personal means.2 Usher visits out of 5",Hustlers

34,TheMovieDiorama,Hustlers maxes out its own credit card by hustling cameos instead of a sensual narrative.,6,26 September 2019,"Strip clubs, twerking, grinding and hustling. On paper, this isn't my glass of champagne at all. An overtly feministic perspective on capitalism built around the hierarchal politics of a successful strip club. It's exploitative without necessarily daring to reveal all, teasing the audience with its profound female empowerment. Yet Scafaria keeps the ""tabletops"" and ""leg hooks"" to a minimum, instead using her intentions to display an empathetic struggle for affected women during the financial crisis, however with middling results. A crew of strippers set out to ""steal what is already stolen"" by drugging up stock brokers and CEOs and maxing out their credit limits.There's plenty to admire in this adaptation of Pressler's article, more than just the provocative flesh on stage. Instead of showcasing archetypal characters that consistently strip for money, fuelling the eternal ethical debate of ""adult entertainment"", Scafaria attempts to inject some humanity into them. Balancing adoration for exotic dancing with desperation. Supporting a grandmother, raising a child, paying for additional studies. She manages to blend the superficiality of corrupted Wall Street with personable scenarios, making the characters emotionally investable to a certain degree. The promise of sisterhood and ambition is plagued by an aggressive stance on virtuosity, with these strippers believing in the validity of their illegal activity. A lavish white Christmas at J-Lo's apartment is a perfect example of the wealthy lifestyle forcibly allowing this crew to bond with one another. After all, money truly is the key to everyone's heart.The ferocious performances solidify the independence of these women. Lopez gaining much attention for her role as the lead con artist and, whilst she is revelatory, tends to overact the restrained moments and ruins the emotional simmering. The overwhelming praise seemingly came about due to the fact she's actually in a decent film finally. However it's Wu who truly elevates this crime drama. Strong yet vulnerable. Determined yet fragile. Acting as the audience's eyes, her moral compass certainly allows us to question the legitimacy of the crime in hand, as she provides this with heft and assurance. Cardi B and Lizzo? No thank you. Unnecessary distractions, only implemented to increase the star quality of the promotional material.Now for the refund...! Scafaria unfortunately failed to dive deep into the heart of the issue. Corruption. Hustlers lacks narrative control. She clearly wants to tackle the subject with sufficient prowess, especially ending on the line ""you have people tossing the money and people doing the dance"", but retains a light buoyant tone throughout that nullifies these heavier scenes. The first act rushes along exploring the world of strip clubs and the audacious politics within. J-Lo is spinning on a pole. Cardi B is, well, Cardi B. And the financial crisis crashes upon them. Then, without much depth, they start hustling together. The second act seemingly explaining the methods of their game through repetitive scenes of targeted customers being drugged, having their credit cards swiped and returning them home. Then the much needed final act divulges into the emotional bonds of these women whilst illustrating the manifestation of greed. However, due to the previous hour glossing over the real character development, these moments never remain.Scafaria's focus on ""family with money"", as if we're watching 'Fast and Furious Presents: Women', inadvertently weakened the resonance of its conclusive half. The excessive humour juxtaposing the rapacity. The interviewing styled narrative, although meticulous and refreshing, dipped towards the end with its unnecessary elongation, rendering Stiles as mere exposition. Oh, and the soundtrack was woeful, even if it was trying to replicate ""club music"" from the earlier half of this decade. I doubt Flo Rida was being played in strip clubs.A dire shame really, as technically the film is incredibly proficient. But it could've been so much more given the exuberant source material. Instead of 'Widows', we got 'Ocean's 8', with an intrepid light tone that didn't match the daunting subject matter. Good, not great. Atleast we can agree that Lopez is stunning!",Hustlers

I blame this lack of flow on the Director Lorene Scafaria.Right from the get go, Director Lorene Scafaria attempts to titillate the male viewers by having Jennifer Lopez shake her booty on a stripper pole but in my view this scene should have been left behind (no pun intended) on the cutting room floor. I think Ms. Lopez is well past her prime date, so can any future vanity projects Ms. Lopez and start acting your age. There were numerous scenes of the strippers getting ready in the dressing room, chatting away to each other but all their lines seemed to be so forced and scripted that I kept asking myself, ""really, this is how a room full of strippers would be chatting and getting along all lovey dovey when they all are competing for the same big bucks to be made on those few stripper poles out there""?I guess I can sum up my review best by referring to the scenes in which TV's Riverdale (2017) lead actress Lili Reinhart appeared in which she always ended up vomiting for little or no reason.

As the movie opens, it is ""2007"" and an Asian-American girl named Dorothy is getting ready for work at a strip club. Then a Latina woman named Ramona makes her grand entrance and does a spectacular pole dance as Fiona Apple's ""Criminal"" blasts from the speakers. Duly impressed, Dorothy reaches out to Ramona for some dancing tips, and the two hit it off. We then go to ""2014"" where we see Dorothy being interviewed by a journalist... At this point we are 10 min. into the movie, but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is the latest movie from writer-director Lorene Scafaria, whose ""Seeking a Friend For the End of the World"" some years ago was one of my favorite movies of that year. Here she takes a New York magazine article and turns it into a wild, wild movie. Beware: not much is left to the imagination. The grand entrance of Jennifer Lopez in that opening scene's pole dance is nothing short of stunning. In fact, the same can be said about Lopez's overall performance, which should be Oscar nomination-worthy, and certainly is a career-best performance. Lopez turned 50 this year, and looks about 35. She takes control of the movie, and requests, makes that demands, your attention. You are more than happy to give it to her. Constance Wu, Keke Palmer, and Lili Reinhardt round out the primary performers. Check out Cardi B and Lizzo (part of the strip gang). When a movie's principal set is a strip club, you can expect a lot of fist-pumping music, and the movie more than delivers on that level. In addition to the aforementioned Fiona, there are songs from Britney Spears, Janet Jackson (""Control"", of course), Fat Joe, Queen She, 50 Cent, and many, many more.""Hustlers"" premiered a few weeks ago at the Toronto International Film Festival to immediate acclaim, and was released wide last weekend (outperforming expectations at the box office).

42,jtindahouse,Features none of the elements that make a good 'Hustler' film,5,15 June 2020,"The standard for hustler based movies has been set very high by Hollywood. It's of the few genres they seem to get consistently right. We have become accustomed to wonderful characters, smart heists and twisty plots. 'Hustlers' has none of those things. It's based on a true story, but the true story is so bland and uninteresting that there is nothing there for them to work with. What we are left with with is a film desperately trying to expand almost zero plot out to a feature length film.There are really only two things I enjoyed about this film: Jennifer Lopez' performance and the soundtrack. Lopez is actually extremely watchable and stands out in every single scene she is in. She is also in tremendous shape for her age. The soundtrack for the film is the only other thing keeping the film afloat. Each song sort of gets its own scene to cover, and it almost always works very well. There were some good decisions made on that front.At the end of the day though those two things are nowhere near enough to save the film. 'Hustlers' is so desperate to stretch things out that at about the 45 minute point in the film you could be excused for still having no idea what the movie is about. I didn't enjoy this film and don't recommend it as one to watch.",Hustlers
43,Turfseer,"Mildly interesting, low-rent saga of exotic dancers turned date rape drug scammers",5,25 November 2019,"Hustlers is based on a 2015 NY Magazine article entitled, ""The Hustlers at Scores."" It stars Jennifer Lopez as Ramona Vega, a veteran stripper who takes the younger Destiny (Constance Wu) under her wings, prior to the financial crisis of 2007-2008.
Ramona and Destiny are both employed at a strip club, ""Moves,"" based on the real-life ""Scores."" Before the financial crisis, the women make quite a bit of money performing before mostly drunk Wall Street types, for whom they both have contempt, due to the businessmen's boorish treatment of the women at the club.
There's quite a bit of exposition establishing the friendship between Destiny and her mentor, Ramona, who basically shows her the ropes in explaining how to butter the men up so they'll throw as much money their way as possible.
It's actually the financial crash that represents the inciting incident in the film. Destiny and Ramona are now faced with a general loss of clientele at the club due to the crash and new girls (of mostly Russian extraction) are now working there offering their services as virtual prostitutes.
As Destiny and Ramona can't countenance selling their bodies, they develop a scheme in which they drug their former clients with a mixture of MDMA (ecstasy) and Ketamine, and then induce them to run up enormous amounts on their credit cards at clubs they bring them to while these men are virtually incapacitated (the women end up making a tremendous amount of cash from the credit card purchases and give a cut to the clubs).
There's little room for character development here and we're mainly interested in learning the fate of the two principals along with their confederates, Mercedes (Keke Palmer) and Annabelle (Lili Reinhart), who round out the group of scammers.
The stakes escalate when Ramona and Destiny run out of clients from their tried and true list, cut ties with the clubs and begin dealing with strangers in hotel rooms and at the victims' own homes. In one semi-comical scene, a client has a heart attack and the women must drop him off at the hospital while he's buck naked.
Ramona and Destiny's undoing begins with the hiring of dubious girls who have criminal pasts and drug addictions. Destiny eventually has a falling out with Ramona after developing guilt feelings about scamming a particular mark, who has lost his life savings along with his home.
Hustlers is a mildly interesting story and I won't give away what happens to the women after they're arrested. Some have praised Jennifer Lopez in the role as Ramona but I beg to differ-she's just too identifiable as a celebrity to be very convincing and her acting is of a one-note variety.
In contrast, Constance Wu as Destiny feels like the Real McCoy as the younger partner in crime. Wu strikes the right balance between a craven materialist and sympathetic mother of a young daughter.
It's no surprise that Lopez and Wu's real-life counterparts justify their criminal activities as they argue that their victims deserved whatever came their way, given their lack of guilt in regards to their own role in exploiting women.
Fanon's dictum of the ""oppressed becoming the oppressors,"" appears to have become applicable here too, as for a brief period of time, these female hustlers took their revenge on a select group of rather callous members of the male sex.",Hustlers

Yet writing a brief review I had to look at a backlist to remember films that were quite so bad.Poor acting, poor editing, drawn-out and paper thin storyline, the movie, if we can call it a movie, is more like a feeble, dramatised whine-song from Mumsnet. One that some sing-along songs by ABBA would at least have improved. The high point is wondering whether the two main (female) characters actually care about each other but, as neither seem particularly worth caring about, neither do we.It fits the current American tropes of ""good-stripper-goes-bad"", ""they are real people after all"", and ""even if the sugar-coated fairytale of empowerment begs for sympathy it always leads to degradation and crime"". So runs the perfunctory moralising (and one that from a sociological point of view is a very one-sided, even political, interpretation more indicative of the times than any underlying reality).If you watched Paul Verhoeven ""Showgirls"" - a film that might be considered among his worst, and compare it to Hustlers, well Showgirls would be an award-winning showstopper.

Other than that, there is no Oscar worthy performance or worthy moral from this showcase. Hustlers is a fun, eye candy filled movie with no quality or substance outside of its ""strip club"" setting. The acting and its subject matter are good at best. Much like the Boy Next Door, the audience is let down by the assumption that they will witness something that Jennifer Lopez will deliver. Unfortunately, those fans will get a taste but not the entire mouthful. Lopez is drop dead gorgeous at 50.

59,jadepietro,A JLo High,9,25 December 2019,"GRADE: B+THIS FILM IS RECOMMENDED.IN BRIEF: A terrific director and a break-out performance by Jennifer Lopez make this crime drama great entertainment.JIM'S REVIEW: We have seen this ""crime doesn't pay"" story before. Based on an article from New York Magazine, Hustlers is conventional in its narrative, but it is done with such flair and insight. The film also boasts a career high from Jennifer Lopez, in a supporting role as Ramona Vega, which cements her star-making persona. (More on that later.)The plot involves two working girls who lure rich businessmen into their web at a strip club and start to steal their money by drugging them and running up their tabs on their credit cards to make a tidy profit. Of course, the foolish men won't complain due to the shame and illegality of their own actions. (By the way, all of the men in this film are not viewed very kindly.) The girls start a thriving business of corruption and sex acts while living the high life. Constance Wu stars as Destiny and the film flashbacks via a contrived interview format. Destiny is a single mom working to support her grandmother (contrived, yes) and her friendship with the shrewd Ramona leads her to the dark side.While the storytelling is strictly formulaic, the technical virtuosity of the film by its director certainly is not. Style complete dazzles over substance and signals a new filmmaker with talent. She is Lorene Scafaria and her visionary verve is shown with her continual use of slo-mos. close-ups, and impressive tracking shots. One can see Martin Scorsese's influence everywhere in Todd Banhazi's gorgeous fluid cinematography. His opening scene follows a crew of strippers from the dressing room, down the hallway, and into the dance club with such authority that any moviegoer is completely hooked from the start.Still Ms. Scafaria's screenplay can't avoid predicability and she falls victim to stock characters and stereotypes. However, she is all so clever in incorporating music as a narrative backdrop by using an array of classical, R&B, pop, and dance, and hiphop songs that establish the edgy mood and tell the story in a creative way. Credit music supervisor Jason Markey for his valuable contribution to the film. Also kudos go out to costume designer Mitchell Travers for his glitzy and expensive looking outfits. It's amazing what some glitter and sparkle and expensive furs can cover.The ensemble is excellent. Ms. Wu makes an interesting character as we follow her metamorphosis from naive stripper to business woman. Giving her strong rapport in a unique sisterhood are Keke Palmer and Lili Reinhart. Julia Stiles convincingly plays Elizabeth, the journalist writing the article. But it is the aforementioned Ms. Lopez who delivers in a multi-layered performance. One moment she is a cold-hearted unethical user, the next, a loving mother to her sisters-in-crime. Ramona's introduction to the film, a memorable pole dance segment, is perfectly choreographed to showcase her talents and instantly creates a character so alluring and sexual. It is a great performance and this 50 year old performer is spellbinding.Hustlers is an unexpected pleasure. Ms. Scarfaria and Ms. Lopez work hard for the money and, believe me, it shows.",Hustlers

Truth be told, I was surprised by how much I enjoyed this movie. Hustlers manages to con you with the trailers and open you to a whole new world of adventure. It's going to speak to the intended audience members, and is a charged tale that holds a lot of heart primarily about the lives beneath the shiny surface of stripping. Hustlers manages to balance fun with deep stories and add that punch that people want in a story. It's primarily accomplished by the acting with Constance Wu who takes leading role, but Jennifer Lopez is the real shining star whose complexity and broad emotional spectrum tie the group together. As the morals start pour out of the shiny fashionable package, the movie achieves the desired girl power and family aspect you might want to see. Yet, the film loses the balance for me in the obsession of glorifying the superficial things instead of the heart of god components below. Extending the run time to nearly 2 hours, the extra stuff the added details of the movie sort of diluted the story aspect, and took away from the secondary characters that high profile actors were portraying. Throw in a rushed ending and sort of sporadic storytelling and the movie loses a little of the glitter. However, if you stick with it and enjoy both aspects shoved in (entertainment and lessons) and can get over the focus of the darker components they emphasize, you should really enjoy this movie.My scores are:Comedy/Crime/Drama: 8.0
Movie Overall: 6.5-7.0",Hustlers
61,burlesonjesse5,VIEWS ON FILM review of Hustlers,6,16 September 2019,"""The game is rigged and it does not reward people who play by the rules"". So says the persona of Ramona Vega in 2019's Hustlers (my latest review). Vega is played by Jennifer Lopez who finds a role she can really sink her teeth into. This is one of the best performances of J.Lo's career and it's marginally better than the unadorned movie she is in.Anyway, Hustlers is like a female version of Goodfellas and 2015's Black Mass (mixed with cult classic Showgirls). The only difference is that no one gets whacked, Paul Verhoeven doesn't slick it up, Joe Eszterhas isn't the writer, and there's nothing at all mob related.The director of Hustlers (Lorene Scafaria) shoots the film in time lines (2007-2015) and A to B state of affairs that cut corners. Not really gritty and harnessed with non-elaborate production values, one would have wondered the outcome of Hustlers had famed director Martin Scorsese or Scott Cooper gotten behind the directorial wheel.Filmed in New York City, based on a true story, and featuring an almost unrecognizable Constance Wu (this ain't Crazy Rich Asians people), Hustlers is about strip club employees who decide to drug Wall Street workers and then use their Platinum credit cards to rob them blind (it's pretty scary if you think about it).In hindsight, my biggest problem with Hustlers is why should we root for these true-life, women pickpockets and why should their true accounts even be told. Heck, they don't actually do any time (spoiler) and their naive, Wall Street victims don't really get a shred of justice.Bottom line: Despite some ample performances from a game cast and some decent, magic Michaelene strip sequences, Hustlers is just another cinematic rise and fall (and rise) requiem. It unfortunately gets ""hustled"" itself. Rating: 2 and a half stars.",Hustlers

We just had far too much repetition of the same scenarios on the screen, it was totally unvarying, and of course the main reason for this was there was in reality just too little story for any narrative drive. It was all padding!What was good and bad.1, the styling was comprehensive, agreed, but we had no sense of the fashion changes as we moved through nearly 10 years.2, woman were presented as universally strong, resourceful, compassionate, nurturers and care-givers, unsurprisingly women have not cornered this market even in 2007. There is no sisterhood of womankind, quite ridiculous.3, whilst it might be novel to see J-Lo in a thong, however considering her stage act it is hardly remarkable and certainly insufficient to sustain a movie.4, the method acting was good but shallow it just lay over the top of the fashions and the furs. There was little or no character development so there was little chance for any nuance.5, the use of Chopin's music tried to instil some class and 'romantic' emotion, pleasant agreed, but it clashed with the calculating, cold-hearted and unemotional characters on the screen.The Director clearly wanted us to like and understand the motivations of these women but this was just clearly not possible as they committed countless assaults and thefts caring little whether the victim lived or died.In conclusion I expected a thriller but there was nothing thrilling here about the tawdry lives of cruel woman predating on men to fleece them of their money. They were selfish and manipulating in their naked exploitation of men not caring about consequences and thus this movie offered no redemption. This could not even be nominated for an award let alone achieve one.In the case of ""times up"" and ""me too"" movements, this reversal of circumstances in a movie at this time is ill judged and the script writer and director should be ashamed.",Hustlers

74,RforFilm,"Jennifer Lopez makes up for repetitive pacing in Hustlers, a cross between Showgirls, Boogie Nights and The Sting",7,13 September 2019,"One of the quotes from today's movie reflects that, ""The entire world is a strip club with some throwing money and the others collecting the money"". It's also the film's reflection of it's setting in the aftermath of the 2007 financial collapse that lead into the Great Recession. It's no secret that a lot of people were affected by it, whether it was average Joes losing their low wage jobs or entire companies going under. It was a time that people reflected just how much they can do and if those at top should receive some type of consequence.Our protagonists certainly thought so and used it as their justification to do the things they felt were right. What makes crime stories fascinating is that we're always going to see a different philosophy on just who the real villain is. Is it the people committing the actions against the law or the people after them who are just as likely to face their own corruption? This is also why several movies about the Great Recession like Up in the Air, The Big Short and 99 Homes have looked explore different viewpoints within a rough era. Hustlers takes it's turn at the time and several women involved in a specific industry.It opens in 2007 where newcomer stripper Destiny (played by Constance Wu) is taken under the wing of veteran stripper/popular attraction Ramona (played by Jennifer Lopez). Ramona teaches Destiny several pole dancing and erotic dancing, along with introducing her to fellow strippers and how to get the most out of the Wall Street types who frequent the club. Destiny not only starts to rank in a lot of money, but she uses her new fortunes to care for her grandmother and newborn daughter. Things come to a halt at the start of the recession.Years of the recession cause fewer people coming to the club and puts Destiny out of work. It doesn't help that her background gives her little chance for other work. She eventually comes across Ramona again where they blame the recession on the same Wall Street guys. To retaliate and to generate an income, they agree to bring in other strippers including Annabelle (played by Lili Reinhart) and Mercedes (played by Keke Palmer) to take advantage of their beautiful nature to lure them into the clubs and take everything on their credit cards. All of this becomes chronicled by writer Elizabeth (played by Julia Stiles).It may be easy to see Hustlers as something as exploitative as Showgirls. But to tell you the truth, I see it more like a cross of Boogie Nights and The Sting, and I ended up like the movie a more then I anticipated. I don't know if I can call it one of the best of 2019, but it has elements that are phenomenal. Speaking of which, I'll start by saying that Jennifer Lopez not only shines, but also gives what may be her best performance in a years. She paints a reflection of her eternal youth within a character whos the prime example of ""looks can be deceiving"".Constance Wu fills in the role similar to Mark Wahlberg from Boogie Nights where she has two goals; to be the innocent whose filled in on the movie's information and to someone the audience can imagine themselves in. Hustlers uses this narrative to make their characters interestingly sympathetic, especially the lengths they go to accomplish their goals. Of course like a lot of crime stories, it all has to topple at some point and the movie has that...though it takes a lot of time to get there.The first half of Hustlers was better then the second half. The con that's set up is a good one, but the pacing causes things to slow down too much. A lot of it is because much of the scenes repeat the con over and over. I know it's to show how much it works, but the movie also has a lot of slow motion edits which heighten moments at the strip club, but can come off as unnecessary during the con. If anything, the best moments from the second half are when the girls get together laugh about what happened and thus, seeing them connect.I'll give this seven stripper poles out of ten. Hustlers is a movie that, regardless of how I felt, is probably going to do good business and have its eye on certain awards. It's too early to determine any guarantees, but I'll remember this; especially for Jennifer Lopez. I do recommend it in general and it'll make a good watch.",Hustlers
75,tbills2,The Real HUSTLERS Review,10,20 June 2020,"Omg LOVE this movie. It's an exceptional movie imho tyvm. Hustlers is super sweet!! It's so good.Constance Wu makes me constantly say whooooo and J-Lo makes me stay low particularly during their exotic red light striptease together but also during their cool smoke session on the roof! Keke makes me geeky the whole time but especially while wearing her hot blue denim swimsuit! And Lili Reinhart makes me really wine hard 'cuz she's so very beautiful! Cardi's like a Barbie and Lizzo is the s*** yo!I love Jennifer Lopez. She deserves the academy award win for best actress in a motion picture she's awesome. It's her best performance since Selena. She's legitimately good. I love Constance Wu, wow, so iconic. I love Keke Palmer. Keke's in the best course of the movie, not surprisingly. Keke Palmer is a gift from our god. She's sensational! I love Keke Palmer, did I say that? I love Lili Reinhart too!!!Hustlers is a real treat. The writing's elite-ish with the clever, cute and carefully written dialogue and great scene by scene story progression. The movie is 2 hours long and it seems to fly by! It's susceptible to criticism because it's a little cookie cutter like none of the main actresses show their tits or booty or coochie ftm I mean it's rated R but it's way more like PG-13.The soundtrack is outstanding! Whoever picked the songs (J-Lo) did excellent and I don't know who was behind it (J-Lo) but obviously he or she (or J-Lo) really knows good music!I love Hustlers. Jennifer looks great.",Hustlers
76,bankofmarquis,Bland and boring DESPITE J-Lo's good performance,4,19 September 2019,"When I first saw the trailer for the Jennifer Lopez ""strippers get back at scummy Wall Street-types"" film, HUSTLERS, I wasn't at all interested in seeing it But then I got wind of strong early reviews with some (very faint) Oscar talk about J-Lo's performance in this film, so I thought I'd check it out.I should have trusted my instincts.What a lame disappointment this film is. It starts out flat and then flattens out even further to produce a movie that starts at one (fairly low) level and then stays there the entire time.HUSTLERS stars Constance Wu (CRAZY, RICH ASIANS) as a a young stripper who is taught the ropes of the stripping game by uber-stripper Jennifer Lopez (if you don't know who this is, then go ahead and skip to the rating of this film at the bottom of this review and move on). When J-Lo's character, Ramona, comes up with an idea to get back at the scummy Wall Street types AND make some money along the way, Wu's character, Destiny (of course) is a reluctant participant becoming - over time - the leader.A potentially interesting, ""based on True Events"" story (this film is based on the real life exploits of Ramona as described in a New York Magazine story), this film just falls flat and I put the blame for this in 2 places.Lets start with Director and Writer of the screenplay, Lorene Scafaria (SEEKING A FRIEND AT THE END OF THE WORLD). She wrote - and directed - this film like it is a modest-scaled, low-key independent film (much like the very good SEEKING A FRIEND...), but the second that this film cast Jennifer Lopez as the flashy leader Ramona, words like modest and low-key should have been thrown out the window but Scafaria chose not to do this, she downplays the best asset in her movie and plunks most of her effort on a lead who could not match Lopez star power wattage.And that lead is Constance Wu - the other weak link in this chain. I thought she was ""just fine"" in CRAZY RICH ASIANS, blending into the scenery when more flamboyant personalities were on the screen (in CRA it was Michelle Yeoh's ""tiger mom"") and she blends into the scenery whenever J-Lo is on the screen in this film - and that just doesn't work here. She needed to step up and step out and match J-Lo blow for blow, but she backs up and backs away in these crucial moments, so when her character is on the screen alone - trying to get the audience's sympathies - I just didn't care.What I did care about is Jennifer Lopez's performance as Ramona. She is the brightest spot in this film and brings her star power and natural charisma to the screen. The ultimate problem with this performance (and NO, it is NOT Oscar-worthy) is it feels that she is fighting the ""low-key"" headwinds of writer/director Scafaria the entire time.Former Disney star Keke Palmer and current RIVERDALE star Lili Reinhart bring some fun and energy to the screen as the 3rd and 4th partners in this quartet of stripper Robin Hoods, but they are all too often sentenced to strut around in the background in tight outfits. I would have loved to see a movie with Lopez, Palmer and Reinhart that was more ""out there"" and less restrained.Finally, two very good actresses - Julia Styles and Mercedes Ruehl - are in this film in ""what-the-heck-are they-doing-in-this-film"" roles that are underwritten and underutilized the talents of these actresses - another missed opportunity by Writer/Director Scafaria.I've heard this film called a ""female empowerment"" film or ""the stripper version of Goodfellas"" and I couldn't disagree more. The only ""empowering"" part of this film is when the credits rolled and I could leave.Letter Grade: C4 stars (out of 10) and you can take that to the Bank(OfMarquis)",Hustlers
77,tm-sheehan,"Good performances , Somewhere there's a better movie we didn't ntget to see",6,25 October 2019,"My Review- Hustlers
My Rating 6.5Warning Spoiler Alert but necessary in this case -In my opinion Hustlers certainly is not a bad movie it's entertaining at times interesting and it's supposed to based on a true story as every movie these days seems to be .
I sort of feel that somewhere in the 110 minutes of Hustlers there's a much better movie but it didn't really happen for me, perhaps if they'd gone backwards in flash back ( not usually a technique I enjoy) but in this case the end didn't seem to justify the means by which the film audience experiences.It's a movie that you must leave any preconceived moral judgements of male or female behaviour regarding sex outside the cinema because male and female behaviour as far as the sex industry is concerned has no rules or boundaries,it's the oldest profession in the world and has always been open to exploitation.At first I found myself thinking if men were doing to women what these women were doing to the men then taking advantage of them by fleecing their bank accounts dry it would be a Me Too scandal. The only difference in the women turning the scenario around and drugging the men is that it's totally for the money not sexual gratification.The men of course would be accused of ""asking for it "" by frequenting the strip clubs and being taken for a ride by the female hustlers and then being afraid to report it as it would probably end their safe marriages and reputation and that's the weapon these women use.
Is this any different to the people who judge the women that have been criminally and sexually exploited by men by saying the were ""asking for it"" by the clothing or lack of it they wore or the fact they were frequenting a club or bar on their own.I just mention this because for me it was the paradoxical aspect that was the most interesting part of this movie the only difference in the women Hustlers motive to the men's was the financial reward for their crime instead of sexual gratification they weren't violent but they put the men's lives at risk and then fleeced them dry.I enjoyed the performances ,especially Jennifer Lopez as Ramona and Constance Wu as Destiny both equally convincing I can't agree as some have said that Jennifer Lopez is worthy of an Academy Award nomination next year but she plays an excellent role and she is a very good actress but at times to my mind Constance Wu in a role totally opposite to her innocent peaches and cream bridal role in Crazy Rich Asians is just as good and shows a completely new dramatic aspect to her acting .The rest of the cast are also impressive it's a Sisterhood movie but these hustlers are no Robin Hoods robbing from the rich and giving to the poor and I think that's where the story lost me a bit because these women were criminals no matter what their backgrounds were and got off very very lightly for their crimes.",Hustlers
78,brankovranjkovic,Hustlers - has feminism gone bonkers?,7,17 September 2019,"Crime thriller with strippers, based on true events.Stars Jennifer Lopez (the queen bee dancer) who takes the notice Constance Wu under her wing and gives her a crash course on how to be an in demand stripper-dancer.The plot really revolves around Constance Wu, who steels all the scenes she's in. Her character is struggling to get by while caring for her grandmother, who she lives with.The girls fleece rich Wall-Street bigwigs of their money and justify this as its only 'stolen' money anyway. The 2008 banking crisis results in a rapid decline in their rich clients, so they trap new clients and decide to drug their drinks, and empty their bank accounts while drowsy but still able to sign a cheque. They start small but this invariably turns into a large criminal business.To answer the contentious question in the title, 'has feminism gone bonkers?' If feminism is all about establishing and achieving political, economic, personal, and social equality then the strippers manage to do this. However, the way they go about this is still questionable.",Hustlers
79,0w0,"Good, but -1 star because of Carbi B",6,29 November 2019,"So it's a 6/10 movie then. The movie isn't based on specific events, but you bet your ass that the events shown in the movie have happened thousands of times in reality... (I mean, Cardi B even admitted to raping men in this exact same way). And while we're on the topic of human trash:Cardi B? Cardi B?! If I wanted to look at garbage then I'd go stare at a landfill! Just the fact that she's a part of this movie, makes it lose 1 star immediately. They don't allow Spacey and Cosby in movies anymore, so they shouldn't allow this  piece of trash either!So back to the review: It's good, but not great or brilliant. It's most certainly the best performance of Lopez's career, so that's a nice (I mean, she ain't no Daniel Day-Lewis OBVIOUSLY, but still, she gave a good performance). If this movie achieves nothing but to educate men (and women) that these kind of predatory activities happen in clubs/bars, then that's absolutely fine. People out there should know that this happens and hopefully this movie will spread some awareness, apart from being a 'mildly entertaining' way to spend 1hr40minutes.",Hustlers
80,Alexander_Blanchett,Weak Execution with some real good highlights,7,8 December 2019,"Solid Stripper-with-a-heart drama. Interesting that it was based upon a true story which gave the otherwise rather cheesy execution a better and more serious touch.
This was the most troubling thing about the film - it was chosen the wrong focus. Instead of showing skin, clutter they should have getten even deeper into the characters. I found it too overstayed at times. The story it had to tell was interesting and the acting good for what they had to work with. Jennifer Lopez was really good. Not sure if Oscar good but really good and this surely goes down as one of her best performances. Constance Wu also had good moments and generally delivered. I really liked the dynamic between all the girls, especially the ""squad"". It was an entertaining movie, that probably could have been a bit shorter because some scenes were overstressed and some situations just stretched too much. A good soundtrack, fresh characters and some nice little twists made it worthwhile. Oh and it definitely a deserves a nomination for Costume Design.",Hustlers

82,CANpatbuck3664,Lopez Steals the Show but Solid Acting and Camaraderie Makes Hustlers Entertaining,8,14 October 2019,"When you're watching a movie about bad people doing bad things (gangster movies, financial crime pictures etc.) its naturally hard to sympathize with the characters. The movie has to do the extra work so you can picture walking in their shoes so you can see why the characters are doing what they're doing. My blueprint for accomplishing this (or the best template to follow) is the Martin Scorsese comedy The Wolf of Wall Street. Jordan Belfort (the protagonist played by Leonardo DiCaprio) and his buddy are TERRIBLE human beings, they're criminals, they're bigots and sexists and they don't care whose lives their ruining to get what they want (bigger parties, more women and most of all more money). But the ride is so crazy and watching them just splurge on anything and everything, its so fun that you let go of your morality just to join them on this journey. This is something that Hustlers manages to do and if this hadn't been accomplished, the movie would have dropped like a stone. The actions of Ramona (Jennifer Lopez), Destiny (Constance Wu) and their partners in crime are awful, sure their victims are @$$holes, but they're still drugging them, stealing all of their money then using their positions as strippers to shame them into not reporting them. If the genders were switched, this would be a horror movie. Luckily, the camaraderie between the girls is so strong and its so fun to watch them enjoy the fruits of their labours, you can put the morality of their actions aside and just follow them. I enjoyed watching this movie just for the performances and the vibe it exudes with these women pulling one over on ""The Man.""I try to never count actors or actresses out, you never know if they're going to get that rebound role that suits their talents or if they just haven't been pitched on that movie that will make their career. Maybe they're taking gigs just for the paycheque? For example, I really disliked Robert Pattison and then I saw him in Water for Elephants and The Lost City of Z and I realized that maybe he wasn't a hack after all. Jennifer Lopez is another performer who falls in this category for me. She's always been beautiful but I've never liked her work as an actress or as a singer. Hustlers was that movie that changed my mind about her. The movie highlights how stunning she is but I thought her performance in this was excellent. She commanded the screen, she exuded power and confidence whenever the camera was on her and she made you want to believe in Ramona even after she turned the corner. She also had really good chemistry with Wu and the rest of the cast. I applaud her for her work here, I don't know if she'll win an Oscar but this is the best work I've seen from her and I wouldn't be surprised if there's some award recognition her future.This is not to sell Wu short either, this is a big departure from Crazy Rich Asians and Hustlers shows she has a lot of range. I already mentioned that Lopez and her work well together butWu helps carry the viewer through this wild ride. She manages to be funny but she also digs deep in the more serious moments. This is solid work for sure. The supporting cast was really good across the board. I want to credit Keke Palmer, Lili Reinhart, Julia Stiles (who is good but very low key) and Mercedes Ruehl for performing capably and they all had their moments. The only one I'll single out is Cardi B, she isn't bad but she's playing it up really hard and she could have toned it down just a little.This movie does have some minor hurdles to get over. The first is the aforementioned morality problem which the movie both addresses but also sweeps under the rug. I didn't have a problem with it but it is a present issue. The next is that if you take a step back and look at the arc of the plot, this is also the generic rise and fall gangster story. Its filmed beautifully and its a lot of fun, but if you need something wholly original, this movie doesn't cut it. My final point is that they really rush the segment where the girls get their comeuppance. The movie ends like someone skimming the last few pages and then slams the book shut. I don't know if they thought it was running long and they needed to wrap it up or if that just wasn't the focus but it ends pretty abruptly.I enjoyed this more than I expected to. I did get to the movie 5-10 minutes late, I saw this with a friend and we entered right when JLO was doing her first dance (it was an awkward moment to enter when you're seeing this with a female friend). It does follow the same beats as a lot of other stories but I credit director Lorene Scafaria and her creative team for finding a new angle on this type of story and the cinematography is noteworthy for a movie that just takes place in the city. Hustlers isn't flawless but it more than does enough to get the job done. If the subject matter doesn't make you squeamish (which it shouldn't... maybe don't watch this with the kids though) check it out on your preferred streaming service. I would tell you to see it in the theatre but I'm late getting this review up and its probably gone by now.",Hustlers

The cinematography was as not as good as critics said. The director could have done better from this plot.

85,andrewroy-04316,"Hustlers has plenty of energy from its strong performances, good directing, and dramatic plot, but where it really shines is when it raises questions of moral ambiguity",7,28 September 2019,"Hustlers may feel like a predictable revenge narrative arc early on, where the women have success and get greedy and go too far, have lots of success and have it come crashing down. At the surface level, that is what's essentially going on, but beneath that questions of morality, victimization, and socioeconomic status lie without easy answers. I had heard the raves about JLo's performance, and she's undeniably very good, but Wu is just as strong in showcasing her character's inner turmoil and evolution. The direction does a good job of putting the viewer in the strip club environment, and tracking shots are employed early to encourage the connection we feel we have with Destiny. It was utterly unsurprising to me to see McKay listed as a producer, as the cross cuts between present day interviewing and the narrative being told felt straight out of his book.
The most interesting question asked in Hustlers surrounds victimization - who was really the victim in the whole hustle, and is anyone involved morally redeemable? There are fascinating linkages consistently shown throughout the movie, particularly surrounding the flow of money. Ruthless businessmen profit in the finance world and then indulge in their vices, which in this film manifests as going to strip clubs. There they throw money away at the women for the superficial and physical entertainment of seeing them dance for them and being in control of the situation. The women, who are clearly viewed in a narrow and superficial aesthetic lens, show their own ruthlessness. Where the parallel is clearly distinct is in the two groups socioeconomic classes - the women haven't grown up with the same background or opportunities as most of the men, and have structural inequities that prevent them from greater financial success. Given these structural barriers, coupled with the financial crash which (from their perspective) was the fault of their former clients and who caused them to be jobless and poor, they get back at them with illegal measures. The superficial and surreptitious nature of the men's attendance at the clubs is used to the women's advantage, as in the short run the men wouldn't tell anyways because of their socioeconomic security. Clearly the extent to which they take it is completely wrong, and unsurprisingly it all catches up to them (though not nearly as much as you'd think - none of them end up having to do hard time!).
The familial emotional stakes did feel a bit forced and not as emotionally developed as intended, and the women's relationship did feel fickle and solely based in financial success, though that may be part of the point. The seeming frivolity of their earnings through the hustle seemed an inconsistent juxtaposition with their demeanor in feeling like they had to keep going and had no other choice - they ended up spending it largely on luxury items like designer handbags, chic dresses, and posh cars and houses. There's nothing wrong with using money that way, but it's not exactly Robin Hood-esque in stealing from the rich for necessary and noble causes alone. There is quite a lot of moral ambiguity to unpack and many societal questions raised (made explicit by JLo's ending line using their dancing and hustling the men as a metaphor for how everyone in the world is just trying to get ahead by any means necessary). Even if it doesn't pull all of them off cleanly, it's quite a strong film with great ideas and performances.",Hustlers
86,sweidman-28016,Interesting Story,7,7 October 2019,"Hustlers Review:
Inspired by the viral New York Magazine article, Hustlers follows a crew of savvy former strip club employees who band together to turn the tables on their Wall Street clients. Honestly I thought this movie looked bad when I first saw the trailer. I had no plans of seeing it until it premiered at TIFF. I was shocked to see the raving reviews. It sort of reminded me of Crazy Rich Asians. I thought basically the same thing with both. It's not as bad as I thought it would be and I enjoyed it. However I don't think this deserves as great of reviews as it has (currently 88% on Rotten Tomatoes). The acting is where it shines. Especially with Jennifer Lopez. This is my favorite performance by her and probably her best ever. I liked her best in the first act which was my least favorite act, but I'll get to that later. People want her to get nominated for an Oscar or Golden Globe for her performance. I doubt it will happen just because I think there will be better ones out there to compete with. The other performance that I don't think is getting the recognition she deserves is Constance Wu. As a lead I thought she did very well. Once again not a rememberable performance for award season. She earned a Globe nomination for Crazy Rich Asians and I think she has grown as an actress since that. The other performances were fine in the movie. There were actresses and cameos (Cardi B, Lizzo, and Usher) that I thought were unnecessary and added nothing really. The Usher cameo didn't even actually happen from what I've read from the article. Going onto the screenplay, I thought the first act was fine. It was enjoyable to watch but not much was happening. Act two begins with the 2008 stock market crash and how that affected their lives since they relied on Wall Street clients. I liked that and that's where I felt more development with the characters. The only character I actually cared about throughout the movie was Constance Wu's. The others I tried but couldn't. Now things got interesting when they started drugging the Wall Street clients and stealing their money. It was interesting the first few times but it got very repetitive since those scenes all followed the same setup, like same shots and setting and everything. It kind of suffered from repetitiveness. Something I liked was how we're seeing the story from their perspective even though it's terrible what they're doing. It's a little hard to empathize with them because of that but then I thought about The Wolf of Wall Street and how some Wall Street men maybe are criminals as well. So it was just interesting because there's no side to really take side with until the third act with one incident. I liked the very end last minute or so. It was just a sequence that brought some feeling to it. The runtime is about two hours and I think they could've cut it down a little. Technically there's some good cinematography and some cool sequences with production. Some of the elaborate fancy costumes were cool as well. Overall I think it's a good movie. It suffered most with screenplay which I can understand. It's kind of a complicated story to tell. It's not going to be everyone's cup of tea. It's hard to recommend so I'm just going to say if you think this is your type of movie go and see it.My Grade: B",Hustlers
87,ethanbresnett,A very stylish film with a great plot and cast,8,20 September 2020,"Hustlers tells the story of a group of strip club employees who navigate their Wall Street clientele, the 2008 financial crash, and the fallout from their increasingly illicit activities. There are two main prongs to Hustlers, one being the crime story, the other being a very meaningful and engaging tale of female friendship, empowerment and agency. The latter theme comes through very strongly in all elements of the film, and it was this that really makes it stand out.What also really makes this film stand out is the exceptional cast. Jennifer Lopez and Constance Wu were fantastic, with such great chemistry between the two of them. Watching their relationship and partnership grow and develop was the best part of the film for me, and the two characters were really well explored. The rest of the cast too were equally great, with not a single one of them feeling out of place (with the caveat that Cardi B's appearance was a bit jarring at first but actually ended up working for me). It's refreshing to see a film blow the Bechdel Test out of the water and present numerous multi-layered, interesting and complex female characters.I also really love films that dive into an underworld, a profession, give us a peak behind the curtain etc, which Hustlers does really well in the context of a strip club. The film was never seedy or exploitative, thanks to the great direction and writing by Lorene Scafaria. The overall vibe is great and I loved the messages, humour and moral exploration of the actions of our characters.Not to mention that the film has a killer soundtrack, with some great pop throwbacks to the late 00s/early 2010s.Hustlers is a great watch.

Roselyn Keo is also releasing a book, The Sophisticated Hustler. after seeing film i was so surprised because this true story happened not to long ago, normal true story filmsalways takes place 10 or 20 years or more but all this just happened 2007-all years in 2015, there is a lot of News article in website that you can read it's most shocking thing after seeing film it's not very hard to watch this film. it's really unforgettable film it feels like i wanna watch it again. but i will wait until it's out on Blu ray. story takes place in 2007 Destiny (Constance Wu) a stripper to support her grandmother but is barely getting by her parents dropped her off to grandmother house when she was baby her parents never comeback for her sadly. she Mesmerized by Ramona's (Jennifer Lopez) performance and the tips she earns, Destiny meets her on the roof of the club. Destiny made a new connection more then that she didn't need to make her into friend they just became friends. Ramona agrees to take Destiny under her wing, and the two form a formidable team. Destiny enjoys newfound wealth and friendship with Ramona. A year later, the financial crisis of 2007-2008 strikes, and both womenfind themselves short of cash. that's when they both got a lot money on that time, then after that Destiny met a guy johnny (G-Eazy) first time seeing him in a movie he has only in it for 10 minutes. Destiny becomes pregnant she was hoping for boy but turns out to be girl. after moments she was arguing with johnny few times she kicked him out. she can't find a new job as well she try to get into retail but she could not get any jobs with no other options. Destiny goes back to stripping. Moves has changed other Russian women are the club is primarily staffed by immigrant women willing to perform sex acts for moneybut destiny refused that. She reconnects with Ramona, she introduces her to a new scheme Mercedes and Annabelle. Ramona had new plan to make a lot money is to target rich men they drug their drinks girls steal their money that's how they hustle men to steal money until their card is maxed out. where the girls steal their credit card numbers and charge them to their limit. Destiny joins in she needed to take care of her daughter, and more money then what strippers normally get. if your curious about Cardi B as diamond in film she is only in it for 20 minutes of film she is good character in film i wished she was involved a lot more being part of film. her character is a former stripper who began dancing at age 19. She said that she used the money from stripping to escape poverty and go back to school. and she wasn't in film as much sadly to say, i thought this film and story, pacing, it's watchable like you can't leave the theater or your seat i thought performance was great Jennifer Lopez after last seeing her in Parker (2013) with statham, after that her career went down in movies that we never heard off but Hollywood has been given Lopez chance to act witch that was great thing to do i thought Jennifer was great she has done a lot good movies in past as well, but in this she did fine. after she comeback in second act more like she can act well. the real life person from J-Lo character Ramona but names are changed in film but the character what Lopez played isSamantha Barbash she thinks that Cardi B, who also stars in the movie, might have been a better choice to play her than J-Lo. that would been interesting idea because i thought Cardi wasn't bad for her role she is not bad in acting she has a lot of charisma presence because matter face she was a stripper in real life something you didn't know about. but still having J-Lo she still does a great job in film she still does work in film i thought story was well done after seeing this and reading real life that happened not too long ago was pretty shocking. this film has a lot of ratings but their are some hates that i don't understand why ??? but the film isn't just about strippers showing off naked, what's good about this film is story, characters, the film is attached to you it's pretty watchable and worth watching of your time from start to middle to end it's entering to see this film ignore silly critics saying oh it's sexist it's still 2019 people are using dumb excuses irgone them like what do they know they have nothing better things to do calling this sexist all that give me a break it's film that you like it or not. not using stupid excuses and obeying people without not knowing if film is good or not. but this is worth watching for story, for people who loves true story films well this is your ticket to see it or Netflix it if you love true story films. the performance i recokin all actress did fine in film Jennifer Lopez does great in film and rest of another cast as well not just J-Lo. but don't waste your time reading critics life is getting too short i am hustling you to see this movie right now because it's hell of worth watching.",Hustlers
89,akcenat,"Repetitive, disappointing, hollow, dull movie about stripper scammers",4,30 December 2019,"An all-female cast, a female director, a female screenwriter (based on an article by a woman) and women getting over on men, ""Hustlers"" doesn't quite know which angle it wants to address - crime, drama, erotic, biography, documentary, social study?! You are just watching over and over again Wall Street idiots who spends their money on cocaine and hookers, get robbed by said strippers, who then spends stolen money on designer bags, all while being expected to sympathize with them. The dance performances are fun initially, but by the midpoint, they feel more like a burden. There is too much flesh and too little emotions. That being said, the movie seriously lacks a character that you can care for, because performances wise, there is little to recommend - Wu comes across as cold and rigid, while Lopez doesn't deliver anything we haven't seen before, especially in her music videos. Ultimately, we're left feeling that this story is one that's incompatible with an inconsistent characters. You wanting to know what else happened to the women but you can't, because director never close the book on it. At the end, ""Hustlers"" never manages to rise above its truly feminist core to become an instant class act, because nothing actually sticks in ""Hustlers"" while movie doesn't have originality, tension or creativity which true to be told fails to succeed in both - the erotic and the drama departments.Rating: 4 - Because it's easily forgotten soon after you see it.",Hustlers

I can appreciate Lopez, Wu, etc. not wanting to perform topless, but that is just absurd. Also, the very ending when Lopez shows a picture of a young Constance Wu to her interviewer muddles things up rather than answers any questions.

92,Magow-Intermean,Hustlers Review,8,4 October 2019,"Struggling to make ends meet, inexperienced New York stripper Destiny (Constance Wu) strikes up a friendship and profitable partnership with star dancer Ramona (Jennifer Lopez). When the recession hits, however, the pair concoct a decidedly more dangerous way to earn their money back at the expense of their clients.
Whether you're a fan of her films or not, it's undeniable that no-one commands a room quite like Jennifer Lopez. That self-made magnetism that has been finessed over years of performing still has the ability to seemingly slow down time, and writer-director Lorene Scafaria appreciates this more than anyone, rewarding such enigmatic energy with the role of a lifetime.
Make no mistake that Crazy Rich Asians heroine Constance Wu gets top billing for Hustlers - a con movie with all the slickness of a Steven Soderbergh thriller - and rightfully so as its pure-hearted protagonist. Yet from the moment Ramona straddles her pole under a waterfall of paper bills, it's Lopez whose legacy is cemented in this film.
""Doesn't money make you horny?"" she coos afterwards to a stunned Destiny, cradling her earnings like a newborn. For the women working at Moves strip club, money is a shortcut to freedom at the expense of a society designed to hold them down. In the New York article that inspired Hustlers, journalist Jessica Pressler frames the women in a Robin Hood context, drugging and robbing Wall Street one creep at a time to afford a better life for themselves and their families at a time of financial disarray.
Scafaria chooses to celebrate what makes women different over dwelling on what holds them back.
This modern band of merry men each come with their own calling card in the film, be it Cardi B's signature cackle or Lizzo's white pillowy pimp hat. Even Riverdale's Lili Reinhart - who takes the hit as the quiet one so the bigger characters can thrive - turns in one of the best vomit scenes of the year, while Wu pairs her signature sweetness with a sharp entrepreneurial streak.
Their collective moxie is thrilling, and stoked by Ramona's prowess allows them to run circles around their clientele, a rare, somewhat rewarding sight to behold until the moral scale is upended and the group's dynamic rapidly unravels. Hustlers is also pleasingly aesthetically assured, switching from travelling, Birdman-like takes to crisp, fast cuts, all captured with a nocturnal neon tinge by cinematographer Todd Banhazl (who worked magic on Janelle Monáe's visual album Dirty Computer).
Where Scafaria finds her strongest footing in a genre defined by the cutthroat dialogue of Soderbergh or even Scorsese, is in the welcome camaraderie conjured up between the film's big narrative punches. There's a joyful rhythm to the girls squabbling over chicken wings, or giggling through a drug-cooking montage that would make Walter White blush.
In giving her heist movie a heart without sacrificing the high-tension tropes of the genre, Scafaria chooses to celebrate what makes women different over dwelling on what holds them back. It's the women in this film that summon its sparky, scrappy edge, who implore you to stick with them through the murkiest of times. And you'll find yourself doing just that, time and time again.",Hustlers
93,Stay_away_from_the_Metropol,A pill that's easy to swallow but difficult to enjoy,6,17 September 2019,"My primary thought is that I'm happy someone made a film that shines a spotlight on a very serious problem currently becoming more common amongst sex workers. As a sex worker myself, I am exposed to the perspectives and activities of a wide array of sex workers on a daily basis. I have observed an increasing amount of sex workers who feel validated in their decisions to become con-artists, bragging proudly about robbing their own clients. While I'm happy that this is starting to be discussed in the mainstream media, that doesn't mean it's a pleasant thing to observe. It's tragic that in an era when sex work does seem to be getting to a place where it's more openly accepted, we have unabashed behavior like this which is going to make people second guess any progress we may have established thus far - it's heavily counterproductive. Overall, the movie mostly just made me feel frustrated, sad, and worried for the future - but it was the correlation to reality that I couldn't get off of my mind. I wasn't very enveloped in the world of the film itself - mostly just reminded of my worries regarding the industry and the way it's pupils and society will carry on being effected by on another from here on out.As a film alone, it was okay. The performances were sufficient but nothing that stood out, which is more a result of the writing. Uninteresting characters caught up in uninteresting events. Overall, the plot FEELS like it should be entertaining, but the movie is a bit redundant - once you get into the thick of it, you're basically watching a repetitive cycle with not much movement to it. And as it goes on, you kind of like the characters less and less, with no real conflicting energies - so it kind of just gets worse as it goes. The movie could have use some cutting - there's not enough depth or complexity to it to validate a nearly 2 hour run time, unfortunately.The movie did have a handful of very amusing moments, but it was not enough to redeem the thing as a whole. It's not a bad movie, but it's also not a good movie...",Hustlers

A smart and visceral heist film that deserves the attention it's getting. Jennifer Lopez delivers a career-best performance that may as well be Oscar worthy.

director: Lorene Scafaria
starring: Jennifer Lopez,Constance Wu,Keke Palmer,Cardi B,Lizzo,Julia stiles,Lili reinhart etcoverall rating 91/100Hustlers is based around Destiny ( Constance Wu) who is trying to make a living at a strip club for her grandma. And When Ramona ( jennifer lopez) gives her an opportunity to make more money by getting money from the men who wronged them in the past they form not only a friendship but a business. Hustlers really surprised me at the quality of the film. It was not just a film about strippers. There was depth,importance and a certain cleverness in the plot and script that makes this film important lets talk about this.First of all the film was actually really funny in multiple places. The humour felt more natural instead of forced due to the connection all the characters had there humour was like any other close friendship in real life so it made the characters more relatable and easy to connect to. Plus i would definitely say Cardi b and Jennifer lopez definitely bought the most amount of humour to the film despite everyone doing a good job.Next i thought the acting performances here were fantastic. Particularly highlighting cardi B,Jennifer lopez and constance wu. Cardi B despite her lack of screen time went all out in displaying her bubbly and wild personality and for this type of film it just worked and due to her past career she would of been in her comfort zone so this kind of role really suited her. Next constance Wu. She was fantastic in Hustlers. She really sold the emotional moments of the film,but yet also had a very likeable charm throughout that made you like her character and respect her decisions. And finally for Jennifer Lopez undeniably the best performance in the film and in her career. she oozed leading women material as soon as she set on the camera and this kind of attitude stayed throughout the whole film. She was somebody that all the characters could look up to and go to for support. This should really give Jlo a lot more respect as an actor and more movie roles should be coming her way. However i do have to say that some characters in my opinion were underused. Cardi Bs character was so likeable that i would of loved to of seen her in the film more as well as Lizzos character they unfortunately were only used in about 2/3 scenes and i just thought they could of been used more frequently.Next i loved i loved that the film had diversity and its soundtrack was fantastic. I just liked that there was a nice diverse cast which should be the norm in films these days but unfortunately is still a rarity so i am glad that there was cast members from multiple different countries and races. Next the soundtrack was fantastic. The music fitted with each scene and just made the film more entertaining in places.My last slight negative would be that there was a really random cameo from Usher. It just didn't really fit in with the film and felt very out of place for me but i can get how it works in other peoples eyes.But now for my last few big positives. First of all they had a good balance of having dislikeable characters vs having sympathy for the victims. Having the inhabitants of the strip club being rude old rich people really made you dislike them and not mind what the women would do to them so therefore there characters were more likeable. But also the film shared a good message of karma always comes back around to you. The gang got to power hungry and started stealing money from sweet innocent men that had families so it had a healthy balance of them both. And finally the film had really good character arcs. All the strippers actually had personalities and wasn't just used for meat as they didn't allow the men to manipulate them. It just was a fresh change and i think gave women that perhaps aren't viewed highly a voice. The characters did there jobs to feed there families and to look after them. Like Destiny ( Constance wu) had her grandma and eventually a child to look after and Ramona ( Jennifer lopez) also had a child that she loved and was willing to get extra cash. So the film did really well with going against gender stereotypes and it really worked for me.Overall Hustlers is a hilarious,surprisingly clever and different type of film filled with excellent performances that deserves all the positive attention its getting.",Hustlers

99,flicklover,Utterly generic and unmemorable...,5,27 April 2020,"Hustlers fall under what unfortunately most film made in Hollywood today. Tge film is very slick and well made but it adds up to absolutely nothing. This film was supposedly inspired by a true story about a group of strippers led by Rampna played by Jennifer Lopez into getting as much money from men as possible. The ladies did well at the strip club until the 2008 economic crash. Their business was really bad until Ramona comes up with a plan to get individual men drugged enough to take money and max out their credit cards. That's it. The film is well acted but not one male character is anything more than a rich moron. The film is rated R because of language, it isn't as gritty as it thinks it is. It could have been PG-13. The plan is very predictable, there is no tension at all. It's just a bunch of scenes with very sexy women tricking guys into giving them money. And alot of scenes of the girls celebrating their bling. Their is no danger, the characters are not very interesting. Jennifer Lopez is good, but she has not much to do except look really good and be the leader of the gang. I get that this film wants to be about female empowerment but it is very generic and unmemorable. The worst thing is that Ramona makes speeches about how the men that they hustle deserve those their money because they do.it to everyone else. How deep.For a much better film about a group of women being part of a criminal scheme, see Widows, much better.Completely forgettable.Grade: C-",Hustlers
100,ginocox-206-336968,Sacrifices credibility for a muddled social/political statement,3,29 November 2019,"Hustlers sacrifices credibility to deliver an incoherent social/political commentary that blends fourth-wave feminism, Democratic-Socialist talking points, and themes of female empowerment, sprinkled throughout with a generous measure of misandry.It's interesting to compare and contrast the storyline, based on a New York magazine account with a distinct feminist slant, with the prosecution and perception of Bill Cosby. In one, men seeking sexual encounters are drugged and robbed of tens of thousands of dollars, with one losing his home and another a high-paying job. In the other, women seeking financial gain through career advancement, are drugged and sexually exploited. The same elements, but switched around. In both, the victims are initially loathe to prosecute. In both, the perpetrators have shown little remorse. The dancers received slaps on the wrist, which would likely incite protests and demands for removal of the judge, had this been a case of sexual assault. Cosby was sentenced to ten year's imprisonment, which will quite likely prove a life sentence, but many feel he got off easy.Perhaps it would be more accurate to say the film eschews the typical cinematic image of strip clubs and exotic dancers in favor of one that panders to feminist perceptions. The real-life Samantha Barbash (Ramona, played by Jennifer Lopez) is described in the New York article as ""Her body was Jessica Rabbit curvy, her lips Angelina Jolie puffy"" and ""ultrafeminine."" Roselyn Keo (Destiny, played by Constance Wu) is described as ""a rather more overtly sexy shape, with the sort of waist-to-hip ratio scientists have concluded affects men like a drug."" According to the article, ""By the time Rosie met her, Samantha was in her 30s - ancient by stripper standards . . ."" When they met in 2007, Samantha was 34 and Roselyn 23, which makes the events in the movie seem much more credible than if they were 50 and 37. Most of the dancers look more like soccer moms in trashy outfits than the dancers portrayed in action films or the dancers at an actual high-end gentlemen's club. None of them would likely be called svelte. Even the cokehead would have a healthier BMI, if she were to trim down. The leads spend much more screen time playing dutiful daughter and mommies than dancing or hustling tricks.Although much of the action occurs in the no-holds-barred, anything-goes private rooms, the dancers seldom take their clothes off, even on stage or in the dressing room, and the leads never do. If one were to assemble a reel of all the shots with bare breasts, it would last no longer than a few seconds, while a reel of dancers wearing full-length fur coats would probably run fifteen minutes. In part, this reflects a feminist aversion to sexualizing female characters. Conversely, there are several lengthy shots of a nude male, proving the filmmakers aren't squeamish about nudity. This seems to reflect the film's underlying misandry. The character humiliated himself while drugged out of his mind, and is now stripped naked to the world, and completely at the mercy of his abusers.A New Jersey cardiologist was scammed out of $135,000 over the course of four visits to Scores. In the article, a spokesman for the club offers the lame excuse that ""If he was drugged the first time, I guess he liked it."" Talk about victim blaming! In the movie, a similar comment is made by one of the investigating officers. Apparently, the victim didn't realize such substantial charges had been made until alerted by a call from American Express. Several of Cosby's and Weinstein's accusers maintained close relationships after the alleged incidents. Imagine the public outrage that would have ensued if such a comment had been made about a sexual abuse victim.How are we to say the shame caused by a sexual assault that prevents a woman from notifying authorities for several decades is more odious than the shame that makes a man reluctant to report the theft of fifty thousand dollars?",Hustlers
101,movieman6-413-929510,Hustlers brings good the dark side of the stripper profession forward.,5,12 September 2019,"Hustlers is a new crime drama directed, written and partly produced by Lorene Scafaria, the director of Seeking a Friend for the End of the World and The Meddler.In the film, Destiny (Constance Wu) started working in a new strip club. Destiny has become stripper to earn money to take care of herself and her family, but she is still a bit unsure about how she gets the money.
Professional stripper Ramona (Jennifer Lopez) sees that Destiny is having a hard time with her work and decides to train Destiny out of her own interest, because she expects to earn more money together with Destiny.
When a credit crisis arises on Wall Street in 2008, the world changes. The strip club receives fewer visitors because people cannot afford this anymore. Destiny and Ramona are losing their jobs. Destiny can hardly make ends meet now. When she meets Ramona again later, the two think of a way to get money again. Together with other women who have also lost their jobs due to the crisis, they seduce men who have worked at Wall Street to subsequently drug them and use the credit cards. This scam seems to be going well for a while, but when the greed of some women gets a little too big, the ladies begin to stand out with their income at the police. The ladies must now choose whether they want to continue with their thefts with the risk of being caught, or to stop what their friendship may cost.
This film is based on a true story about which journalist Jessica Pressler has written an article for in the New York Magazine. Lorene Scafaria also brings out the dark side of the stripper profession. Most people do not choose this profession because their passion is here, but more out of desperation to still be able to get money in a way. Many men saw strippers only as objects to be used for their own pleasure.Constance Wu also plays the leading role in the film well, but due to the simple script she doesn't seem so special compared to her acting in other films. Apart from Constance Wu's character, the viewer has little sympathy for the other characters, because they have no real background story in the film. Jennifer Lopez delivers the best acting in this film. For her role in this film, she has attended pole dance lessons and visited comic strip clubs to see how the work works in practice. This is also a different kind of acting than she normally delivers in romantic comedy films. The actresses that the scamming women play in the film look good as joint threats, but otherwise not really as friends. This is due to the tension between the group when they have to choose whether they want to continue with their actions or better stop. Rapper Cardi B also has a cameo in this film. The ironic thing about this is that before she broke through as a rapper she actually drugged men and then robbed them.",Hustlers

These women were sexual workers and that is how they made their living, so is logical that it is heavily shown on screen. Having said that, it is an interesting retelling of a true story but ultimately doesn't truly deliver a satisfying offering, since it falls flat at some key points, with no real payoff, which makes it a mildly fun ride on the surface but eventually falls apart with only a bit of dignity left. Some of the performances were okay at best, but nothing that truly stood out. I felt relieved that Cardi B didn't play a big part because she is so unbelievably obnoxious that no one could have sat through ten minutes of this piece without wanting to tear their ears off.The directing is fine, but a bit messy in some parts, resorting to cliché camera shots seen in every scene of a club before. So, many of you probably won't like this film, because it's a hard watch, as there are hardly any likeable characters, but you can certainly try and take a shot at it, there are no guarantees though.

We also see some attempts at Lap Dances, but nothing erotic as all this goes by too fast.The rest of the movie centers on the scam that Ramona and Destiny came up with and this goes on for too long a time and became quite bland and annoying. When the girls made a lot of money all was good and they celebrated often. Then the girls noticed copycats and things slowed down some. Desperate times had the girls push their Johns too hard to a point many became very ill. Also there was some internal friction among the girls and Destiny was the one who talked to Elizabeth (Julia Stiles) a reporter to try and exonerate herself from all this madness that developed. This article by Elizabeth alerted the police to what was going on.This is a very bland movie. We didn't care at all for any of the characters. Perhaps the speed of the scenes caused all this turmoil to such a point we didn't care for anyone. Maybe the dialogues weren't good enough at any point. Too bland here too. One more thing: this was way too long and many scenes didn't need to be there. Too many of the same type of scenes kept going on and on and on. See?Notables: Julia Stiles as Elizabeth, the Reporter who wrote the article about what was going on with the Strippers; Mario Polit as Detective Hernandez; Paul A. Nielsen as Detective Hunter.What did we learn from this movie? Just the scam that Ramona and Destiny came up with and In time the reporter's article alerted the police to what was going on. Maybe it was we who got hustled expecting a better movie. Didn't happen.Before the credits ran we see statements of what happened to all the girls and we were surprised to see what they got.

The plot / storyline is nothing ground breaking. But this movie was definitely entertaining and fun to watch. J Lo looks absolutely amazing at 50.,Hustlers
113,Michael Fargo,"a long way from ""A Pig's Foot and a Bottle of Beer""",7,14 September 2019,"There are two characters in Lorene Scafaria's ""Hustlers"": Constance Wu (in a performance killing wig) and Jennifer Lopez who exudes enough energy and glamour to power Times Square for a month. It's an odd coupling because Wu, who's cast as a wallflower (in a strip club, no less) has perhaps twice the screen time as Lopez, but all you remember and want more of is Jennifer Lopez, who finally fulfills the promise she showed in ""Out of Sight.""I wandered into the movie on a hot summer night looking for, oh, something silly and fun. It was my fault for not doing a little research about what the subject matter of the film was about turning my expectations on their head when the film was closer to ""Wise Guys"" without the guns. Well, wise guys and a lot of window dressing pilfered from films like ""Pretty Woman,"" that assume we're all content to watch high brand fashion being paraded back and forth.In ""Wise Guys"" we're never invited to envy the life a gangster; in this film we're meant to long for how easy it is to make money rain down while you--rather expertly--show your naked bum while twirling around a pole to an audience of screaming men dressed in Armani suits.What the film didn't include was the desperation and consequences of the sex worker's trade. No one ever gets sick or misses work because they're hung over or strung out or have been beaten half to death. There are hints of that but including it would have required production values that had a wrinkle or a stain or a costume that didn't look like they'd just been run off the seamstresses sewing machine.The veneer of the film becomes its subject. Wu can't break through that; Lopez shatters it every time she appears, whipping her extravagant furs hither and yon like they'll be disposed of after one wearing...which apparently they are. None of this excess is the actors' fault. While everyone is on the take in one form or the other, apparently everyone is happy, happy, happy with the fist loads of cash they accumulate (then later steal). All you need is money and a tendency to vomit under stress which is just funny and adorable.We don't see that the victims of the con that develops is on men who deserve it; we're told that and have to assume no harm is done to people who can afford being robbed of thousands of dollars in one evening, often sent off in a cab mindlessly drugged and drunken, as if whatever transpires at the destination they've been sent to is as happy to see them in that condition as the people are happy to get rid of them...ecstatic with the cash they've lifted off them. The whole idea of drugging someone, stealing their credit cards and charging larges sums of money is easy and has no consequence becomes as unbelievable as all the expensive clothes that pass by while watching the film. And you can either laugh at it (which is what the film wants you to do) or be offended that the film thinks we're that gullible and lacking in morality. Morality is something assigned to a reporter, Julia Stiles, mugging shock as she's told this wild tale excess and greed.Make no mistake. It's fun to watch. It's just not...fun-fun. There's a short speech about how everyone is on the take and deserves being exploited by the exploited, and that's where it becomes offensive and cynical. We're not asked if we want to agree with that, it's assumed we do. I don't.",Hustlers

115,mr_bickle_the_pickle,Will Jlo HUSTLE for that Oscar?,8,24 September 2019,"A lot of the criticism I seem to find on here is that these women drugged men and robbed them and oh no...they're not nice people. Yeah, so what? Im not seeing you people complain about something like the plot of goodfellas. And no, Im not saying this film is as good...I just think its bit a petty to complain for a similar issue of them being bad people doing bad stuff. I've also read that the men aren't sympathetic. And I'd say thats mostly true. There is one male victim who is written to be sympathetic. He's had a rough year with his house burning down/wife leaving him, and we do see his conversation after the fact where he begs to have his money back so he can pay his mortgage, and he's also the crux for Destiny (Constance Wu) to have a turning point and really see how things have gotten out of hand. Now, is he the most fleshed out character, no. None of the men really are. You may see this as a fail...but I think this works for one main reason. The story is being told from these strippers (or really mainly Destiny's) point of view. They saw them and treated them as walking talking wallets, so why would the film show them as anything else either?Now all that being said, how did I feel about the film itself? I liked it. A lot. It was fun, funny, emotional. I really liked the character dynamics and felt the cast had good chemistry together. Acting wise, I actually really liked Constance Wu the best (which is important as its really her story, they are telling). You could really buy the starry eyed wonderment she had when around Ramona, and I thought she was great at the dramatic scenes as well. Now, Jennifer Lopez eas really good too, and I think one of her best roles, but her role was a bit more ""flashy"" to me and I think thats why she will probably get more attention. The rest of the cast is good too, but it really focuses on these 2 women the most.I really liked what they did directing wise at the scenes at the strip club, it really made you feel like you were part of this world. And there was some good use of sound design as well. The film takes place over several years, and jumps around (as the framing device is that she is telling her story to a journalist) but you never feel lost.Now, Im not saying its a perfect film. One aspect I didnt like was that there was too many characters introduced, that later get dropped. Cardi B and Lizzo are maybe in the film for the first 10-15 min. Then they're gone. And I get that with this film taking place over several years, that people come and go but you dont really find out what happened to them and it makes you wonder why they had so much screentime if they werent really important except the fact that they're practically glorified cameos. Even later on, theres some girls that joined the operation (I have forgotten their names, but one has the dog and one has asthma) and they both are shown doing the operation once, (they maybe show up at the Christmas scene) but then thats it. They have disappeared. Even the other characters like Mercedes (Keke Palmer) and Annabelle (Lili Reinhart) who have more substantial screentime than the other strippers still arent fully fleshed out. The only really thing you know about Mercedes is that she has a fiance and he is jail, and the only thing you know about Annabelle is that was kicked out of her home and she barfs when she gets nervous. I get the men not being fleshed out as I mentioned above, but these were supposed to be her ""sisters"", and you think you'd learn more about them.Overall though, I thought it was highly entertaining.",Hustlers

There are many women taking power control one hundred of their live, escaping crap, movies that made in positive light or not overly harsh. This movie just has women running a con as strippers, not formerly abused wives, mafia late wives, other more deserving cause plots to put forth etc..The movie had no nicety to it and never stopped. Same steals different victims, it got boring and redundant fast. There was no early brain flashes to get out when getting past money need. A movie like this, Who cares if few tits popped out. Jennifer played the boss great as of course going to take lead in film. Whomever put out all acclaim notices for future awards is not doing job correctly. Constance Wu looked like crap in movie with hair chosen, not fan of, so as co-lead not helping me along. The real person character based on said look was nothing of the sort.

The producers and director told the story with sensitivity - undoubtedly JLo's sexy performance has come in for praise but it didn't need the nudity of the film striptease to get the pint across and that's where it wins - you were able to concentrate on the story - those who titillation just look for what's going on in the background .It's a film about female empowerment in a world run by men - it's based on a true story - it's about friendship somewhat similar to beaches - it's about love it about trust it's about knowing and not knowing who has your back .It's about ambition .Ultimately it's a great story , not perfectly executed but definitely worth seeing .Pad.A 7/10",Hustlers

122,hunter-friesen,"Scafaria and Lopez make it rain in ""Hustlers""",7,15 September 2019,"We all know how the Great Recession of 2008 affected the American economy. There are countless stories of large financial and automotive firms going under, taking thousands of employees with them. But one industry you may not have heard of that had one of the biggest direct impacts on workers: strip clubs.Based on a true story, ""Hustlers"" tells the story of four New York female strippers as they scam and crawl their way out of the financial crisis that left their usual Wall Street clients with no money to flaunt.Probably one of the most fun movies of the year, ""Hustlers"" flows with great kinetic energy that makes it endlessly entertaining. Director Lorene Scafaria takes a lot of influence from the works of Martin Scorsese and Adam McKay (also a producer on the film) as she effortlessly keeps the movie going at top speed. Watching this, you're reminded of great films like ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" and ""Goodfellas"",Scafaria also shows off her great productional talent as she makes use of several slow-motion montages mixed with a perfect soundtrack of mid-2000s R&B hits. Numerous moments of fluid camerawork that mix both quick cuts and long takes give the film a fresh and brisk pace.There's one moment where all these great facets come together in a surprise meta-cameo from a well-known singer/dancer. The perfect music choice, the choreography of the dancers, and the blocking of the movement make it the most exciting and memorable scene in the film.In addition to directing, Scafaria also pens the script, imbuing the narrative with the themes of family and sisterhood. We see the four women come together and follow the journey of bonding through redemption. Sometimes it does get close to ""Fast & Furious"" levels of overdoing it, but the strong performances from the leads make it believable to watch.Scafaria also uses a flashback framework structure as the story cuts between the past and present with the quartet plunging deeper into the moral grey areas of their actions. There's a constant feeling of having already seen this technique done before several times. However, it's very interesting to see this kind of story told not from the demeaning point of view that plagues similar films, but an unmalicious female perspective.Scafaria does slip up when it comes to the moral reasoning of the actions and character development as they are both put to the sideline in favor of more dancing scenes. In her defense, the dancing scenes are the best part of the film and a treat to watch. But they each start to become empty near the end as the lack of depth and ethical stakes become too obvious to ignore.Holding the story together are two excellent performances from the leading ladies of Constance Wu and Jennifer Lopez.After her breakout hit in last year's ""Crazy Rich Asians"", Wu here turns in another star-making performance as Destiny. With the good material Scafaria gives her, she sinks deep into her character and shows off her more dramatic chopsJennifer Lopez, surprisingly fifty years old, plays Ramona and is the best she's been in a long time. She struts that movie star glow that keeps your eyes always glued to her, especially during her more physical scenes that give off a sense of both grace and power.The rest of the supporting cast is stunt cast with the likes of Cardi B and Lizzo, who play themselves. They each don't mean anything to the story apart from their name value on the poster.""Hustlers"" is one of the sleekest and entertaining movies to come out this year. While its politics may be a bit skimp and misguided from time to time, the brilliant directing by Scafaria and powerhouse performances by Wu and Lopez make this a great time well worth your investment.",Hustlers

124,snowfre,A solid movie that misses out opportunities to become much more memorable,7,2 January 2020,"The real-life story ""Hustlers"" is based on has a lot of potential when it is turned into a feature film. We get to follow a group of strippers, led by Destiny (Wu) and Ramona (Lopez) as they drug rich men in New York and then empty their credit cards. Just the right ingredients for a thriller. ""Hustlers"" however, struggles from the start with finding itself. First of, it takes quite a while for the film to get to the actual plot. No there is nothing wrong with following Destiny on her early days at the strip club, but the pacing isn't the best and Wu doesn't have charisma enough to keep you interested. It's almost half way into the movie that the interesting crime plot emerges. We are however blessed from quite early on with Jennifer Lopez in her best performance of her career. She is a scene stealer from her very first moment as the sexy, independent Ramone. Ultimately, it's her that the whole film relies on; without Lopez, ""Hustlers"" would be quite a flat movie, only highlighted with its more humorous scenes. Reason being that the film only scratch the surface of the stigmatic, secretive world in which Wall Street CEOs meet with young, money hungry women. Instead of really exploring the driving forces for the characters in the movie to why they make the decisions they are making; the writers of ""Hustlers"" seems indifferent to what could have been a brilliant twist to the movie. As there are no heroes or villains in this story, that is an emotional subject that could have been delivered nicely to the audience. As that does not happen, we are simply given a retelling of these events, more or less justifying about everything the women did. ""Hustlers"" is however a solid film with a good entertainment value and if not for anything else, why not watch it for the glamours Jennifer Lopez doing the acting of her life.",Hustlers
125,gcsman,"A pretty good film, and another lesson in how to get Troll-Free Ratings (TFRs)",6,15 September 2019,"You probably already know the basic plot line: four strip club dancers set out on their own to fleece a series of clients by combining sex appeal with judiciously applied drugs. But the story line is really just a slightly unusual scaffolding for exploring the personal relationships within this somewhat misguided sisterhood. Constance Wu (playing Destiny) and Jennifer Lopez (Ramona) are the co-equal stars. Wu does fine, as she did in Crazy Rich Asians, but Lopez is the standout. She plays Ramona as a force of nature: she strides across the performing stage as brazenly and confidently as she does through her own life. She's simultaneously the top dancer at the club, and a kind of mother lioness to and for the rest of the girls. It's Ramona's idea to conscript the three others (Wu, Lilli Reinhart, Keke Palmer) into a team and through sheer force of personality she stiffens their spines enough to carry through with this sideline hustle, which quickly starts earning them far more than their jobs at the club. Predictably things go a little too long and too far, and eventually the string runs out -- it doesn't exactly come crashing down, but certainly has an abrupt end.It's all told from the women's viewpoints, so even though there's occasionally a lot of flesh on display it doesn't really feel prurient. For the strip club dancers, it's just a regular job with a schedule and various techniques to learn; the goal is simply to make enough money to live on (Ramona has a daughter to put through school, and Destiny has both a baby and a grandmother to support). Like all kinds of trade workers, they have to find ways to live after the financial crash of 2008.The women -- at least, the ones with speaking parts -- are all different: they're distinctive, they're individuals, and aside from the basic goal of making enough to get by, they have their own lives. By contrast -- I assume very deliberately -- their male clients and the men who populate the club audiences are all faceless clones. Not a single one is interesting on his own, and that's because this movie isn't about them.So now, what about the ratings this one is getting? What a surprise -- the internet trolls have piled on this one to drag it down. But thanks to IMdB, you can filter out
all their nasty efforts and find the Troll-Free Rating (TFR) that you might be looking for. It's really easy. On the IMdB page for the movie, at the upper right you'll see the big yellow star and the average numerical rating. Just click on the ""number of votes"" below it, and up pops the bar graph giving the complete distribution of votes from 1 to 10. Ignore the bin at 1 (those are the trolls) and look for where the obvious center of the vote distribution is. For Hustlers, that center is clearly between 7 and 8. You can even see the ratings broken down by gender and age group; in this case, females rate it almost a full point higher than males. Bravo for IMdB!",Hustlers

Seriously, the movie is good and the acting is as it should be, period.
Awful is thinking that many people find themselves in trouble with money and they do something that is against the law. Unfortunately is not the right way to act, but sometimes you are not able to find something else.
Many doors slammed on your face, because you don't have that paper or that certificate and you might be better than someone who has that stupid paper or certificate.
Some women could find themselves on a fork... prostitution or homeless and maybe they have kids and no husband. So some of them, (in the movie, but it's a true story) might decide of doing something else, but illegal... taking some rich men (not all of them were though) in a strip club or night club, drug them and steal their money. If they haven't been drugged, then nobody could say anything, a night club is very expensive, a strip club even more and four beautiful women at the same time would cost a lot. Anyway after ""working"" for some time, something happened and they got caught. End.
Many people steal money in many different ways and even ""legally"", but to do that you have to be very clever and smart and sometimes it's not enough.
There are problems, but there are solutions and even if it's not easy to understand, the solutions are much more than the problems.
Breaking the law never is a solution.

Both gave good characterizations of Ramona and Destiny respectively and did not rely on their physical attractiveness and sexiness alone particularly Lopez. Although I personally believe that it won't be enough to merit an Oscar nominations,it is worthy of a mention.It could have been a classic.

Juanita(Alma Martinez) tells the young woman that her unconscious father belongs in hospice. She can't. That breathing body in the small house is her only living, breathing friend. At the karaoke bar, it's every girl for herself, just like in ""Hustlers"" when Destiny(Constance Wu) returns to Moves, a high-end gentlemen's club, where Mama(Mercedes Ruehl) tends bar now, since the new breed of exotic dancers have no use for a den mother. Kacie needs family; a big sis surrogate like Ramona(Jennifer Lopez), Moves' headlining stripper, who helps Destiny in all phases of her life, both personal and professional. So this is why she finds herself chasing RN nurses in the parking lot, begging for their help. Tony(Ronnie Kim), a regular, knows Kacie by name, but only dad called her ""princess"". There is one person she could call. Carey(Teddy Lee), her brother, but Young-Il threw his son out of the house when he was fifteen. Kacie is desperate. She makes the call. To her surprise, the prodigal son returns.No woman sets out to be a stripper as their chosen vocation. At senior prom, she slow dances with a boy, not for the boy, and there is no pole in sight at the hotel ballroom. Destiny, a ""triple threat"", as Ramona likes to call her(""You're new, you're gorgeous, and you're Asian""), stems from a family tree even more fragmented than her west coast counterpart. Both parents rejected this L.A. woman, so she was brought up by her destitute grandmother(Wai Ching Ho), who needs help with mortgage payments to stave off foreclosure on the house that Kacie grew up in. On her first night at Moves, the emcee introduces Kacie as the ""new girl"", the caboose in a g-string that follows a train of regulars onto the club's main stage, while Janet Jackson's ""Control"" booms out of the P.A., intermeshing with the hooting and hollering of their patrons, composed mostly of Wall Street movers and shakers. They're a rowdy bunch of girls, Destiny's new friends, be it if the club is open, in which the dancers' manufactured sensibility, cultivated over a long period of time, that they have control over their paying customers; or closed, when Ramona enlists Diamond(Cardi B) for her expertise on the finer points of lap-dancing. All that bravado, all that sound and fury, signifies denial of their own victimization. Usher, playing himself, pays the club a visit, the last good night before the 2008 stock market crash, Destiny tells Elizabeth(Julia Stiles), a stand-in for journalist Jessica Pressler, whose article for ""New York"" magazine, ""The Hustlers at Scores: The Ex-Strippers Who Stole From Mostly Rich Men..."" this ""Goodfellas"" for the 21st century is based on. Usher made it rain that night. But without rain, there can be no ""hurricanes"", and the eye of the storm is not what it cracked up to be. It's a rude awakening, post-crash, this control that Destiny and the other dancers thought they possessed. Outside the subculture of adult entertainment, Ramona learns that she's powerless, reduced to begging her boss at the clothing retail shop, and not being granted an earlier quit time in order to pick up her daughter from school. Destiny, meanwhile, never gets past the interview. Now, the opposite holds true; the job of disrobing for dollars chooses them.Siblings nights out was a smashing success. On the way home, they walk past her old job. Kacie is recognized by the valet she briefly talked to once on their respective smoke breaks. The former hostess lies to Octavio(Octavio Pizano). His inquiry into Kacie's relationship status is met by a story that's part brush-off, and perhaps, part-self-delusion. Tony is not her boyfriend; she's a paid escort, who accompanies him to social functions. No sleepovers, but getting undressed is part of the deal. A kept woman, this distinction, the best a prostitute could ever hope for, keeps girls such as Kacie going, because a live-in relationship, albeit at a monetary cost, keeps them away from the toxic club scene and, at least, has the veneer of romance, a gateway fraught with the possibility for true love. Any other doumi girl wouldn't think twice about the textile mogul's proposition, but Kacie hesitates, offending Tony, who is bewildered that a bar maid would have the audacity to mull things over. This glamorous life gave Kacie the impression that she had some agency; she couldn't see how life with Tony was an extension of the karaoke club; a spiritual prison with outdoor privileges. When Kacie returns to her old job, technically, it's as if she never left.There is a body in the trunk. Tommy DeVito(Joe Pesci), in Martin Scorsese's ""Goodfellas"", just killed a ""made man"" at some greasy spoon and now he has to dig a hole. Jimmy Conway(Robert DeNiro) and Henry Hill(Ray Liotta) accompany Tommy to his mother's house. The mafioso needs to borrow a shovel, and for good measure, a large knife, explaining to his mother(Catherine Scorsese) that the blood on his shirt was the result of hitting a deer. The knife, he continues, is for the hoof caught in the car's grille. Does the mother buy this flimsy excuse? She plays along. Does Mrs. DeVito know what his son does for a living? The old woman is ambiguous. We're not sure. The audience asks the same questions about Destiny's grandmother? Does she know where her generous benefactor gets the mortgage money from? The surprising answer is yes. Grandma knows that Destiny belongs to a crew of ex-strippers who drug unsuspecting men looking for a good time and run up their credit cards to the max while they're knocked out unconscious. ""Hustlers"" echoes ""Goodfellas"" the loudest when Destiny and Justice(Mette Towley), one of Ramona's new girls, drops off a barely breathing client at the hospital. It's not the first time that a client nearly dies. ""Are we going to kill him?"" Annabelle(Lili Reinhardt) asks Ramona, when they put Gary(Zac Jaffee), looking very much like somebody who overdosed on a ketamine-MDMA-laced cocktail, in the car and drives him to the strip club where they revive, then fleece him, before sending him home in a taxi cab. Whereas Kacie looks for a man to take care of her, Destiny wants to take care of herself, and has no qualms about driving men to the brink of death as a surefire money-making scheme. But they're a nice mafia. Destiny waits for the paramedics to collect the body outside the emergency room, but still, she's a criminal.Tommy's mother congratulates her son on his big day; a ceremony where they make this psychopath a made man, an untouchable. She is proud of her son, the gangster. Wives respect mafiosos, which Karen(Lorraine Braco), Henry Hill's wife, makes abundantly clear' mothers, too, by all appearances. The grandmother, in ""Hustlers"", is a first generation Chinese emigre, who realizes late in life that it's better to be rich than poor, and more importantly, law-breaking instead of law-abiding. Destiny invites her to a Christmas party, and quite jarringly, gets along with Ramona, who calls the elderly lady her ""spirit animal"". And then the audience remembers and shouldn't be shocked, after all. The bank, without reservation, would have repossessed her house if Destiny wasn't willing to cut corners. Bankers.They're the real goodfellas.",Hustlers
143,nightringer-76840,Overexposure,4,19 December 2019,"The movie begins well, but it dragged on with the overexposure of strippers' glamorous point of view that IMHO losing it's gripped on audience's attention. It's a drama without too much drama.",Hustlers
144,zpzjones,Feminist or typical womans' view of strip world,7,30 January 2021,"I watched this for beautiful Constance Wu, whom I loved in CrazyRich Asians. The story is conduit to it's title, that is strippers hustling for money away from the dancing stage. The movie falters only because it's a story about strippers and hardly any of them, including J-Lo are nude. Not even over-exposed Cardi B who is nude all over the net. Nevertheless, Wu, J-Lo and others are beautiful in what we 'do' see of their bodies. I've seen better movies about strippers such as Helen Mirren in a 1980 British movie called ""Hussy"" which I wrote a review for. A 1963 film ""Irma La Deuce"" with Shirley MacLaine was splashy and colorful but because of the times was understandably antiseptic. Joanne Woodward starred in another 1963 film actually called ""The Stripper"".",Hustlers
145,ajikude,Believe the 1/10 scores,1,26 December 2019,This movie was a joke if they said Oscar worthy....simplistic story..bad acting. What were they thinking making this to a motion picture? Dont believe the 9/10 scores.,Hustlers
146,brianjohnson-20043,Far better than I expected. Just see it!,9,12 October 2019,"I hesitated to watch this film at first because the trailer looked SO BAD(even though it had good reviews). So when I saw it, I was pleasantly surprised to have fabulous time. I now recommend this film to friends. It is funny. It has some nice drama. It touches on some real world issues. And I found it fascinating to observe a lifestyle by these men and women which is so foreign to my own experiences.I don't personally have a lot of personal life moments with strippers or their customers at strip clubs. I think most of the hate in this movie comes either from viewers who thought the specific strippers in the film made all strippers look untrustworthy and unethical, or (to a larger degree) that the film made the clients or victims of the strippers seem like they deserved what they got. I think in both cases that these criticisms are unfair. And I'll explain why.First off, the level of sympathy that the male clients deserve depends on the man and the situation the women put him through. Some men are unquestionably violated. Others get the experience they paid for. It's also worth noting that the vast majority of strippers didn't end-up becoming criminals in response to the recession. But they aren't the focus of this story because they aren't very interesting in comparison to the strippers tracked in this film. The main way films make money is by telling interesting stories. Not by being perfect impartial journalists (there's no such thing) for the public.The film tries to play into the mind of the strippers justifying their illegal conduct as they get deeper and deeper into criminality. The following point I can't stress enough: EVERY story which follows corrupt people does this exact same thing. From breaking bad to goodfellas to the wolf of Wall Street to the social network.I can't help but find it sexist (and I'm a man) for so many people to whine about this movie having this particular story component, when people no one complains about other films with men as the criminals which do the same exact kind of thing. If anything I thought this movie defends the actions of the criminals less because it's told with regret within flashbacks. One senses while watching this movie that the women are eventually going to be caught. So the viewer doesn't have to be concerned about them not being held accountable.What I think really bothered so many people(mostly men) is how comically the movie portrays the women taking advantage of the men. I didn't mind it because I have a rather morbid sense of humor and a difficult time envisioning me as one of their victims. I think i it's also worth pointing out that, in life, jokes are common tools for allowing people to emotionally justify bad behavior. They didn't seem out-of-place to me in this film.The movie shows how the ideal business model of the stripper is often being risky and brazen. Which is similar to the frequent New York Wall Street workers who are the main clients of these particular strippers. And Wall Street screwing-up around 2008 had a more widespread effect on the rest of society in a very real way. Yet Wall Street workers were never criminally charged for their actions. I'm not saying this means the men deserved what they got. But I'm saying that it makes for a more interesting story when the women have some sympathetic case for their behavior. As opposed to no case. Especially when it's being told from their perspective. A movie is dead-on-arrival if the protagonist isn't somewhat sympathetic.Another criticism for this film is that it's too slow. This one I think is a bit more legitimate. And why I gave it 9 stars. I though the last 40 minutes could have shaved off about 5 minutes. But overall I wasn't upset with the pacing. Especially at the beginning. I've seen far worst pacing in movies of this type.Another common criticism was along the lines of ""people only liked this movie because they liked Jennifer Lopez"". I thought she was great in this movie. But I thought the movie overall was better. And I certainly don't go out of my way to see her movies because she's in them. Some people certainly do. But I don't think JeLo made this movie good by herself. It has a nice script, direction and overall acting from the entire cast.I'd recommend seeing Hustlers and Ignoring the overall review score of the public. In this film's case I think the critics are right. It was no Ad Astra (which the critics loved and I found to be terrible, like most of the public). The people in the theater with me certainly seemed to have a great time.I thought this was one of the better films I've seen this year. There are just a few butt-hurt people (mostly men) online describing this movie as ""terrible"" because they're insecure and clueless that the overall interesting nature of this story was the point. It wasn't trying to demonize men or give all sex workers a bad name.",Hustlers

I don't know if they brought in elements to make the viewer more sympathetic like Destiny grandma, Ramona kid etc but it seemed a little too convenient for story points.
The acting was good I suppose ... but it felt a bit too much like it was a girls night out film than anything directed to a general audience.

It ended up being over fraudulent credit card charges made by a bunch of down on their luck strippers. It seemed like it could be a Lifetime movie that comes on after 11:00. That being said, the actors were good enough, but there was just not enough of a story to make it a good movie. I don't understand why people are arguing JLo was robbed of an award over this movie. It should have never been made. I've seen far more interesting true life stories on ""Snapped"" or even 20/20.",Hustlers

As a fellow journalist myself, I did admire the idea that they took an real life article and turn this into a inspired-fictional movie. But, the whole story behind the ""taking down the wall street giants"" was not that presented in the movie as most of the movie was just strippers dancing and strippers poisoning drinks and getting money which to me, did not match the movie description which was disappointing. I will give props to the actresses for their acting as they did do a good job with their roles but overall, Hustlers could have shown the main parts of the article and the story and for me, this isn't one I wouldn't go see again.",Hustlers

156,Stream2BigScreen_Movie_Reviews,Get Swindled by Hustlers,7,7 January 2020,"The Stream: An uneven final act feels both rushed and incomplete.
The Big Screen: Jennifer Lopez. Jennifer Lopez. Jennifer Lopez.
The Final Bill: A superstar performance by Jennifer Lopez, an awesome soundtrack and deserved comeuppance for the Wall Street-types makes for an energetic time at the movies.-Trip FontaineThe Great Recession hit the American economy like a ton of bricks. Banks! Foreclosures! Retirement Accounts! Strippers! Yes, multiple facets of the American society felt the pinch of the economic bust of the late 2000s and early 2010s. The dazzling crime drama, Hustlers, directed by Lorene Scafaria, details how when the money dried up on Wall Street the ladies on the main stage at Moves had to make some other moves *wink* to keep things afloat. Hustlers is based on true events reported from a New York magazine article. As outrageous as the tale all seems, the fact that there is some basis of truth makes it even more engrossing.Constance Wu plays the neophyte dancer, Destiny, who just wants to be successful, powerful and as confidant a dancer as the veteran, Ramona, portrayed by an awe-inspiring Jennifer Lopez. Ramona is Destiny's mentor in the good times and, eventually, partner in crime in the bad. The fact that these women hustle some guys looking for a good time is no secret, but the how of the scheme is interesting. Plus, Ramona's justification for their actions is thought-provoking as well. Do these slime balls deserve to get swindled like they swindled the American people!?! Do two wrongs make a right? Exotic dancing Robin Hoods.Well, Jennifer Lopez is the reason to see Hustlers on the big screen. I don't want to oversell her performance, but it is the best things she's ever done. Jennifer Lopez was a bona fide superstar before Hustlers. Her performance in Hustlers only underScores *wink* what people have known for the last two decades, even if it hasn't been evidenced in some of her previous films. The determination that Ramona has is palpable through Lopez's every move in the heights of her dancing and the desperation of her crimes.I'll also say that Wu is very good as the conduit for the audience. Keke Palmer has some great scenes as one of the fellow Hustlers. And, Cardi B has a hilarious cameo. The remainder of the cast is uniformly good, if not a bit overshadowed by Lopez's strong presence. And, there's an awesome soundtrack from the late 2000s that is full of earworms.While the ending feels a bit rushed, the movie does get to what happens and the how even if that's a bit of an after-thought. There's an interview framing device that is kind of distracting. All you will really want is the film to get back to the club and back to whatever Ramona is doing.Ultimately, Hustlers is an entertaining time, with a great performance by Lopez, and a thoughtful moral tale about money, desperation and the limits of friendship. It really feels like an easy theater going experience for all that will fulfill your expectations. Hustlers is worthy of your movie theater dollars, and if you can't make it before it leaves theaters, definitely catch it as soon as you can on your streaming device. In fact, Lopez's first appearance on screen is worth repeat viewing.",Hustlers

158,helenbassett,Hustlers Film Review - Lorene Scafaria Directs Wall Street Bankers Going Pop When J.Lo & Constance Wu Spend Their Cash,8,18 September 2019,"A film about women directed by a woman making big at the box office is great news for film audiences. I've kept the faith with J.Lo and seen her movies, the last was Second Act, always luminous on screen. In Hustlers Lorene Scarafaria directs as strippers make money from the same guys that trashed the USA's Firemen's pension among many others. They were just providing a much needed redistribution of wealth that governments didn't see fit to make themselves.To be honest it's not subtle, but its heart is in the right place. And there's not many who wouldn't like to see bankers fleeced, some of whom liked it so much they went back three more times. Sex and money. Because money makes you horny.Julia Stiles is our way in to the action, interviewing the girls, and based on real life reporter Jessica Pressler's original 2015 expose. But Constance Wu's Destiny tells the story of how as a new stripper she made friends with the radiant Ramona. Megawatt J.Lo wraps Destiny into her fur coat like the Ice Queen, and lights up every scene she's in. She teaches Destiny how to make cash from the punters. J.Lo can have mine after her pole dancing scene. Surely it must become an Olympic Sport very soon, just to be more inclusive? The strength needed to work that pole is phenomenal.With Ramona's help Constance is soon pulling in the cash to help keep her Grandma, played by Wai Ching Ho, stay afloat in Queens, and provide herself with an apartment and the wardrobe to match. Louis Vuitton's Takashi Murakami speedy IT bag of the day gets its own cameo. But apart from being about strippers, this is a story of women bonding together, just with nipple pasties on. And something that Jennifer Lopez movies are very good at. Even with her wealth and advantage she can still play a woman who shows solidarity with other working women. And we believe it.Note Cardi B, a real life previous 'exotic dancer', her lap dancing technique works just fine with her all inclusive Fenty X Savage working wardrobe. Thank you to Rihanna for the perfect strippers outfits. And with Lizzo's ample charms, stripping seems to be a very inclusive career. If you can shake it you can make it in this industry.But all good things come to an end and when the Financial Crash of 2008 hits, and the club sees less cash, they lay off people. With a new baby to feed Destiny is soon shopping at the cheaper end of main street, and kicking her no-good baby daddy out. And for the girls who managed to stay on at the club, Mercedes Ruehl's 'Mother' to them, is now tending bar, and the ruthless Russian hookers have moved in with their $300 for extra services. But for Destiny the punters are still cheating with every mouthful they serve up. Things sure aren't what they used to be on Walton Mountain.But Ramona is still around. And when Destiny meets up with her one day she tells her about a little game she's got going. You get the guy just high enough, a little goes a long way they find out!, so that he hands over his wallet, but doesn't remember the night. Just tell him it was that good. And these high net worth individuals are too embarrassed, or too rich, to mention to the cops they've been fleeced.And it's a sister act with the hilariously weak stomached Lili Reinhart, and Keke Palmer as Annabelle and Mercedes. And they're successful. Pulling in more money than they've ever seen. Christmas in Ramona's Upper East Side apartment is a really sweet and happy family occasion. Maybe not so much for the chinchilla.But the weak link is Dawn. Madeline Brewer of The Handmaids Tale. Ramona is always bailing her out and she's one line away from being a coke head. Although she doesn't want to go to jail. But it's nice to imagine that the judges thought the little enterprise was no more than a Robin Hood style caper with the prison sentences. But still more than the real robber barons of Wall Street ever got.So let's hear it for the girls in a funny and vibrant look at how they made the system work for them, for a change. And if Hustlers goes all the way to The Oscars, then bring it on. Jenny from the block has the potential. And just imagine the outfits. Stripper style is on a roll.",Hustlers

Ramona schools Destiny to become better at what she does, with the help of a few friends. Eventually they all set up a sting operation that targets dumb rich guys into parting with their money until we get a montage of the same schtick over and over again.The problem is that it's Destiny, a non-essential character, telling the story about Ramona, the only essential character. There's nothing new or interesting about Wu's destiny, she comes across as lacklustre and only comes to life because Lopez's fiery Ramona is bursting with attitude and takes her under her wing.When Lopez isn't on-screen the film flounders terribly.",Hustlers

163,PeachesIR,"Enjoyable film, great performance by Lopez",8,9 August 2020,"I loved ""Hustlers."" I clapped at the end. It's refreshingly honest and gritty without being vulgar. Too few films explore the financial stress that many contemporary working-class American women face. It's based on a true story, and the film combines glitz, glamour and realism. The characters in the film are streetwise, sexy, tough at times, achingly vulnerable at others. They become scammers, truly hustlers, out of financial desperation, but also because they see our society for the money-hustling ripoff it is. ""Hustlers"" also explores the sleazy faux glamour of the strip club world with no apologies, and director Lorene Scafaria treats the dancers with respect, unlike most of their drunk, grabby male customers.This is a woman power movie, and I think women will enjoy it far more than men. It's all about women: their lives, their viewpoints, their dreams. ""Hustlers"" is not about stripping, stripper's poles, lap dances, champagne rooms, booze or drugs, although all of those things abound in the movie. It's about working-class women and what they often put up with from men, and what they feel they have to do to support their families and access the ""American Dream.""Jennifer Lopez was robbed-she should have won an Oscar. Her portrayal of Ramona, the mastermind and ringleader of the strippers' scams, and the effusive, generous mama lioness to the younger cubs, shows her range and depth. She is a complex, gritty character with deep soulfulness mixed with steely resolve to get what she wants for her family. But she also exudes a level of glamour and sexiness almost absent from the screen these days. Her opening dance scene will leave you with your jaws hanging open. J-Lo is a fantastic dancer with a legendary physique, and she singes the screen in her dance numbers. Wow!Constance Wu is very good as the ostensible lead, a young dancer and single mom who survived a difficult youth and family problems, and is too ethical to scam men without deep guilt and worry. The rest of the cast is good too: Keke Palmer, Lili Reinhardt, Julia Stiles (who doesn't get to dance!), Mercedes Ruehl, Cardi B, Lizzo (the latter two mostly cameos).",Hustlers

This film encompasses all of that and boobs!Yessir, flesh out the wakooza as a group of strippers take what they want from a collapsed economic system in the form of egotistical Wall Street, pumped up, selfish traders. Constance Wu shines with or without JLo's shadow as she recounts her fall from grace, and the strip pole, brushes herself off and goes about making it big in a questionable manner.No pity for the male victims of these girls' crimes, as you cheer on their bravado and daring.Not as intellectual or in-depth as the other Wall Street film mentioned above, but an antithesis to that 80's drug-fuelled pro-greed film of the same name (Wall St) starring Charlie Sheen. Hustlers shows what happens when the hustlers get hustled!JLo showing her booty from the block excessively may be the reason not more name actors were attached to this film. I could imagine a Baldwin, Sheen or Affleck playing a great supporting role, yet the cops, bouncers, boyfriends, pimps and bankers were all little known and did not lend any credibility to their roles.

Unfortunately, the film often feels disjointed and uncertain of what it wants to be. In addition to Lopez, the rest of the cast is also solid. The film closely retells a true story, but it is not clear what the filmmaker hopes the audience will learn from the experience. Perhaps like the real-life victims of this caper, audiences for Hustlers will be out the price of a ticket and have few lasting memories of what happened.",Hustlers
168,Bad-Good-Great,Most of the naysayers' reviews are not fair,6,17 December 2019,"Whenever I decided to watch a movie, old or just released, I used to read the reviews from the lowest below 4 stars, then go to the 5 to 6 of the middle ones, and read couple of the top 8 to 10 reviews, to get a roughly idea about the reviews and the reviewers in general. Mostly, I usually would despise those who gave the highest 10/10, and considered them either mostly fake or simply moronic. These reviewers were extremely ridiculous, if they were so generously and so easily giving a full 10 for some mediocre movies, I just didn't know how they scored those really great movies. So other than the fake ones, these reviews only showed how shallow of those reviewers. But I usually could find a more realistic judgement from the lowest ones.Those who gave the lowest scores could also be divided into two groups: The extremely biased or the extremely political, usually, those reviewers were self-righteous right wing extremists or the extremely religious church goers. These low score givers considered themselves the only righteous persons in the world, they would attack and claim those movies were just liberal propaganda and nothing else.What I paid the most attention were those reviews contributed by the so-called ""Thinking"" reviewers, they usually would give the reasons why they've scored that movie with the lowest score, due to its poor logic, poor directing, poor editing, poor acting, poor dialog or implausible scenarios or ridiculous plots, terrible shaky camera work, sometimes, even the soundtrack which was inappropriate, too irrelevant or too loud would also be included. These shortcomings and flaws they pointed out in their reviews were especially valued by me. They would teach me to view the movie at a more wider angle. They are also the reasons why I never watched the ""Horror"" genre ghost movies.Yet ""Hustlers (2019)"" accidentally proved that I was somehow incorrect to my belief in these lowest scored reviews. I think most of the 1/10 reviews against this movie were mostly biased; they were biased to JLo, they were life-long hateful kind, a bunch of modern day Puritans. The reason why I would and could say so is because after I watched this movie, I think JLo did a great job, her performance was top-notched and believable. That segment of her pole dance on the stage was out of the world fantastic, one of the very best I've ever seen. It shows how she prepared for her role.Furthermore, let's first talk about her age: She was born in 1969, folks. Can you believe a woman over 50 could still be that sexy and almost perfect in every way?Dana White, the UFC CEO, always said when some of the fighters didn't make the weight before the weight-in. What he said in general was like this: If you are a fighter belongs to certain weight class and consider yourself as a professional, maintaining your weight to meet that weight class is the most important way to prove that you take your profession seriously. As long as there's weight class to categorize fighters, making the weight is the only way to prove that you are a real pro. You could be just meet and exactly at that weight limit or a little bit below the weight limit, but you should never overweight your class before the fight, no matter over 1/2 pound or over 5 pound, if only shows that you're not a profession and you're a fighter without disciplines, an insult to MMA's ethics and to yourself.If we use this standard and basic requirement to actor like Jennifer Lopez, a woman already over 50 could still be so healthily sexy and beautiful, only means she takes her profession seriously and respect her image as she should be and at the same time, it also shows that she shows respect to the audiences, the movie goers who pay the fares to look what she performs, not just her acting, but also her look, her figures, her flesh, her hairstyles, her costumes...maintaining her sexy symbol and sexual appealing, never overweight the CLASS she belongs. She is a very serious professional, period. Yes, some moments in this movie inevitably showed her a bit aged face, but that did not affect her in the least. You guys who never gave her the deserved respect, please take a look around you, look at those females at the same age of JLo, then you should at least show some respect to her. I don't say this, it's my wife's unbiased and fare comments on JLo. I completely agreed to what she said about JLo and her strict professionalism and her own self-respect attitude and her sincerity to her audiences. That's why I think JLo is the only reason to hold this movie together from the very beginning to the end.Constance Wu in this movie, on the contrary, proved to be a complete wrong cast in this movie full of the flesh. She looked terribly out of place, out of her limit, not just she looked just plain; poor figures, no bust, short, thick waistline linked to non-sexy bottoms....She's absolutely unqualified as a stripper. Her acting was also very mediocre and uneven. But I don't blame her, because an Asian female with such short height, thick waist and no pompous behinds, wearing knee-high leather boots, she was indeed not just looked ridiculous but eye-sore. But I don't blame her at all, I blame the casting agency's poor choice.Hustlers 2019, no matter what, is an extremely cheesy and shallow movie, full of cliches. A movie very hard to categorize its genre. An over-the-top comedy? A social satire making fun at those Wall Street meat lovers? A serious drama but somehow overly exaggerated? A movie with certain degrees of depth but most of it just shallow cliches because it's a story about the meat seekers vs the flesh givers? You name it.But there're two things I can be so assured telling you: Jennifer Lopez did a very believable role, a very sincere one. Constance Wu was a poor cast.",Hustlers

The energy and power of this film just leaps off the screen at points. Gotta give credit to the script and performances which elevate the experience in a big way. Constance Wu and Jennifer Lopez were the clear standouts and did a good job with the material.I have a feeling this film might be a satire of films like The Wolf of Wall Street but it could just be my meta brain overworking.

Constance Wu and the other actors were all good, and Jennifer Lopez has never looked better. She is strikingly beautiful and commands the screen, and her athleticism on the pole was amazing. She more than acquits herself in the role, but there's no way this is Oscar calibre. All this chatter about her being nominated for this movie is bit over the top.

Sure we get the message that the men they deserve to get destroyed in a reverse bizarro metoo kind of way. However if you've ever been drugged or date raped this isn't going to give you any satisfaction. The script as a catastrophe. The film was also cartoon like depicting a potpourri of characters similar to a cross between Sex and the City and Charlie's Angles. Jo lot is ok but in her debut dance scene she's obviously been substituted by a standing dancer. Oh so much inarticulate and poorly edited crap. You will when she you hadn't invested your precious time but if you have absolutely nothing else to do it's a time filler. Conclusively a chick flick no chick would really enjoy or identify with.

173,faroukgulsara,Robin Hood complex,8,31 December 2019,"Look around you. It is no brainer that the divisions between the haves and the have nots are increasing as we speak. The price of essential goods only goes one way - up. There will be many justifications to raise the price of a commodity. It could be the weather, artificial shortage, the hike in petrol price, the value of our currency, you name it. Interestingly, when the offending factor is relieved, the price stays the same. Minimum wage barely changes but the lure to buy, purchase and spend never ends.The members at the lower end of the economic spectrum always seem the target of these baits via subliminal advertisements in the media or movies. In this cruel world of punishing the poor for being poor, it appears like the wealthy have it all too easy. We get to keep their cake and eat it.A case in point is the 2008 and the many similar economic meltdowns that the world frequently experiences. The poor need to tighten their belts and pull themselves up by their bootstraps. The big conglomerates, investment bankers and the Wall Street hotshots instead get fat bonuses and a chance to run away with their obscene stash even though they singlehandedly were the cause of the mishap.The law seems impotent to be dealing with all these shenanigans. It takes a lifetime to get the legal system to mete acceptable justice. The only beneficiary of this exercise is the legal fraternity itself. It pats itself as it assumes a demigod status displaying pristine honesty, laughing all the way to the bank.
Hence, the alternative strategy would be an ala 'Robin Hood' method, to rob from the rich to feed one's own lifelong desires. Unfortunately, society does not receive this kindly. Perhaps, they want a piece of the action. They want a share of the loot in the form of taxes. Robin Hood becomes the bad guy while the greedy wealthy bankers become the victim.In a nutshell, this film tells how a group of exotic dancers (in everyday language, striptease) during the 2008 economic downturn, use their entrepreneurial skills to outwit the members of the financial market. The effort is nothing more than to live the high life that they always dreamt and to improve the lives of those around them. It is based on a real-life story where high-flying executives were cajoled into partying with them. They were drugged with a concoction of ketamine and MDMA (date drug) to max out their credit card and not having any recollection of it the day after.The story is not new, but the moviemakers sex it up with the continuous flow of naked ladies in different stages of undress engaged in various unlady-like postures. Understandably, it proved too raunchy for screening in many Asian countries. Meanwhile, the media, parroting the voice of liberalism and freedom of expression, screams praises of the story and the acting. They even suggest it as one of the best offerings of the year to be churned out from Hollywood.",Hustlers
174,babybuletgani,the 2008 economic crash changes everything,8,24 October 2019,"While Destiny is soon making more money ""than a brain surgeon"", the 2008 economic crash changes everything. As the high-rollers stop coming, the girls are reduced to seducing wealthy types in bars. With fellow dancers Annabelle (Lili Reinhart) and Mercedes (Keke Palmer), Destiny and Ramona drug their marks and bring them to the club, fleecing their credit cards.
Using Destiny's interview by journalist Elizabeth (Julia Stiles) as a framing device, writerdirector Lorene Scafaria goes full Scorsese, with a Casino-style voiceover guiding us through the ins and outs of the strip-club business. Seasoned with humour - notably when Usher, playing himself, turns up and the girls go wild - it's an engrossing tale for the post-#MeToo generation.
With juicy cameos from singers Cardi B and Lizzo, the vibrant cast is spearheaded by the excellent Wu and J-Lo, who hasn't been this good since Out Of Sight. What really intrigues, though, is the way that Scafaria paints Hustlers' world as a microcosm for a cash-crazy America. As Ramona bluntly says, ""This whole country is a strip club.""",Hustlers
175,tomtalbotty,Hustlers is a funny feel good film you really do root for them even though they are committing crimes on these rich people to steal their money.,10,23 September 2019,"We first meet these people at a strip club in New York where they are strippers trying to make a living, but in order for them to make enough money they need to go into a bit of illegal business. We see these strippers as the hustle gets a lot harder resulting into drugging their clients in the film to try and get them to use their credit cards, signing cheques to spend money on them while hopefully not getting caught in the process, which the precaution is mainly these drugs that play on the clients memory while giving the clients a good time while being conned out of thousands by these strippers. Jennifer Lopez is hilarious the moment she breaks into a split after her strong independent liberating pole dancing scene is just Oscar worthy, which her character Ramona is the main instigator in this side hustling illegal business remaining in complete control over her friends that eventually becomes family.
Overall this movie is hilarious, dark, thrilling, well thought out and makes you overall feel good seeing these people come together to help each other in their hard time of need, where you find yourself rooting for these vulnerable strippers that are doing the illegal activities that they are in as you just want them out of this compromising position, then to be happy overall as close friends practically family too. Jennifer Lopez , Constance Wu, Cardi B, Keke Palmer who is especially hilarious, Trayce Lysette and Lili Reinhart has done an amazing job in there acting. Even though Lili's character Annabelle could not stop throwing up randomly which was a bit weird and funny at the same time, also her sitting on Jennifer Lopez's Lap was a bit bizarre too still, cute, warm, sweet and hilarious though just especially shows the close friendly family bond between Lili's character Annabelle and Jennifer Lopez's character Ramona too.

We arrive into the film on the back of the new Asian girl Dorothy, stage name Destiny (Constance Wu) trying to find her way into making enough money to help her grandmother (Wai Ching Ho) keep her home. The first set of scenes also include Dorothy sitting dressed up in a pristine office environment being interviewed by Elizabeth (Julia Stiles), a journalist. We now know that the club and stripper scenes are a flashback.Back in the club, after watching Ramona (Jennifer Lopez), a veteran stripper and pole dancer, give a money showering performance at their club, Dorothy asks Ramona for some tips on how to be a better dancer and use her ""money maker.""
Ramona, knows the ropes, was raised with a healthy streetwise attitude, and now lives a charming place and raising her daughter independently. Dorothy sees all this and would simply like to make enough money to support her grandmother and herself - independently.They start working together and create a gang of four girls by adding Mercedes (Keke Palmer) and Annabelle (Lili Reinhart) to maximize their money-making potential. As they all work men together in the lap dancing rooms, they start making some good money and begin to control the cut the club takes. Most all the men they work, are either independently wealthy or are in the finance trade as investment or stock brokers.Disaster happens when the market busts in 2008 and the men, from whom they make their livelihood, lose their jobs or are squeezed too much to spend money on girls in a strip club.The group falls apart, and now Dorothy is living with a boyfriend, and they have a child together. After she kicks her boyfriend out, she has to get a job. Not having appropriate experience, we see in a funny scene where she gets turned down for a cosmetic sales job and ends up back in the club to strip. 
Running into Ramona, they get the team back together and create a scheme to entice and fleece men of their money. To do this, they drug them with a mix of ketamine and MDMA to induce memory loss and causing judgment impairment. Once the girls slip this mixture into their target's drinks, they charge a large transaction on their credit card, and split the money while the men have no idea how it happened.The girls get greedy and start making charging large amounts, $50K or more, and the men quick meeting up with them for dates. After a time, the deceit catches up with them, and in one scene, Dorothy gets a call from a client whose life is ruined because of her actions.Dorothy is the consciousness of the group and dislikes the recklessness of Ramona and some of the other girls she's brought into the fold, so she turns witness against Ramona when they are all captured by the police.The early scenes in the club and as Ramona and Dorothy's friendship develops are touching and sweet. Where the film goes awry for me, was the ongoing scenes of fleecing the men. In my estimate a good half-hour could have been cut from the film and the story would have been crisp and engaging. I didn't think Annabelle's characteristic of throwing up at almost anything added to the film, and somehow I got the feeling this was a Will Ferrell (as producer) sort of flourish. The way this film unfolded, I kept wondering why I had to watch all this, to get to a conclusion.Wu was excellent. I thought her portrayal of being unsure on the inside while giving the illusion of being strong and OK was well done. Lopez did a wonderful job of being the streetwise aging stripper that knew how to navigate the world of clubs and men to get what she wanted. Stiles was good as the interviewer. Palmer and Reinhart were very good as the two who rounded out this racially mixed foursome. However, as previously stated the Reinhart's throwing up on a moments noticed, seem like it was an unneeded add-on to the character. Ho was wonderful as Dorothy's grandmother and during the scene at Christmas, when they were telling stories, she stood out. Lorene Scafaria wrote and directed this film. I really think she wasn't clear enough in the intent to tell a crisp good story. Some of the visual scenes, especially in the strip club, were really well shot and give the sense that you were there.Overall: This could have been a much better film if it reflected the speed and intent of the first fifteen to twenty minutes.",Hustlers

185,nehpetstephen,Shallow and forgettable,4,17 September 2019,"This is purportedly a movie about money--what it means to not have enough of it, what it means to have too much, what people are willing to do to get it--but the film presents this theme in the most simplistic and minimal of terms.On the main character's climb up and down the ladder of wealth, there are somehow only two rungs. One rung is ""not having enough money."" This part of the film is rushed through as quickly as possible. When you don't have enough money, you give your forty-two dollars of cash to your speechless, housebound grandmother for reasons that are not at all clear. When you don't have enough money, you buy things that are marked ""on sale."" When you don't have enough money, you have to swap shifts at Old Navy. All of this is, of course, demeaning. All of this is impossible. Nobody could ever live such a life. Old Navy! Because this part is so unbearable and awful, the movie only focuses on this rung of the wealth ladder for approximately four minutes.The second--and only other--rung on the ladder of wealth is ""being extravagantly wealthy."" When you're extravagantly wealthy, you buy very expensive clothes. You have a penthouse Manhattan apartment with fifteen-foot-tall windows and a Christmas tree to match. You buy your friends fur coats. You are very happy and feel you are a part of a family. Having money equals having a family.And that's it. There's no in between. One is good, the other is bad, and because the world is an amoral place full of damaged, cutthroat people, you're entitled to do whatever you can to make sure you're in the good spot.That is the essential tone that this movie conveys. The movie is way too jubilant about its scenes of extravagant wealth to be making any satirical or critical point about materialism. Having the newest iPhone is, truly, the only thing that makes life worth living.At the very end of the film, the movie tries to tack on some character development. There's an unexpected conflict between the main character (Constance Wu) and her mentor (Jennifer Lopez) that develops from out of nothing and isn't really elaborated on screen. This conflict is meaningful because apparently these two women had a very strong friendship, but why this friendship developed in the first place or why they cared so deeply about each other aside from their mutual interest in making lots of money is left completely unexplored. These two friends may have had their conflict because of some childhood trauma that the main character endured, but how that trauma affects a character who is otherwise very one-dimensional is never really elucidated. HUSTLERS doesn't care about details, nuance, complexity, or depth. The film tells us that these two people are friends, that they had a bad conflict, and that this conflict was inspired by something bad that happened a long time ago. We're supposed to nod and agree that that's very deep and meaningful and touching. One character even cries while talking about a nightmare, so of course this movie is very deep.This movie is a chore to watch. It's overlong and stylishly quite inert. There are a few good laughs, but the plot rarely has momentum. Jennifer Lopez is fine, but far from the award-caliber that many critics are claiming. Constance Wu, who is incredible in her role as the mother on ABC's ""Fresh off the Boat,"" is thoroughly vapid and unremarkable here, though that's probably more of the screenplay's fault than her own.For a better film about sex workers, consider TANGERINE or even SHOWGIRLS.",Hustlers

188,popcolin,Completely without morals,2,29 November 2019,"The movie tries so hard to make the events of the movie look glorious or spectacular. Shame on Jenifer Lopez who wanted to be the starring role in a lifetime movie that's praising women male-bashing criminals. There were scenes in the movie extremely reminiscent of Hallmark commercials for the holiday. Just poorly shot and directed by someone who has no understanding of what making a good movie entails. There needs to be someone for the audience to root for.Here there is nothing. We have the story about a group of 4 strippers who decide "" Wall Street"" And they decide to start drugging Wall Street executives and stealing their money. I guess there is a sense of irony in all this because it seems like they have regulars of guys enjoying this who come back again and again. But one time the girls drug a ""normal"" guy, one who looses his job and his house because of the shenanigans the girls play on him drugging him and stealing his money. So he goes to the cops and from there the ""empire"" collapses in what amounts about 5 minutes of the movie.Ok, great, and it turns out the girls all turn on eachother when they are arrested and by the descriptive text at the end one of the women does not have to do jail time at all because she admitted what she did was wrong, the other girl got 5 years probation, and the final 2 girls got weekends in jail for one summer or some dumb like that. So what scene does the director choose to have as the final scene? Some scene where the main character calls the reporter that interviewed everyone for the news article the movie is based off of and asked her what the other friend thought of her, then we go to some flashback that is completely meaningless.I guess hustlers will be hustlers. I understand the dilemma, on one hand we have a group of New York bankers who seem to be responsible for the collapse of the financial security of this nation. They are generally spineless nothings that sit at desks all day and are very rude to others but have a disconnect about them that make them look ruthless and evil. So maybe or maybe not they are doing considerably evil things but they don't actually get their hands dirty because, you know, they are spineless and just sit at a desk all day. And on the other hand we have a group of ""poor"" strippers being exploited by not only the people that come and go the the stripclubs but the owners and the people working at the stripclubs, but hold on, because the strippers also seem to feel exploited and abused by the society that forces their worth to only be defined as how much money their sexy little bodies can bring into their hands any given nite. So what do they do? They drug and rob people with no regard to as if they are innocent or not. And then everyone just kinda gets away with it, no body admitting any of this was wrong.I don't know what this movie was suppose to mean but hustling means something different to everyone else. I remember living in NYC and one nite a homeless guy who had been self-proclaimed hussling in Times Square decided to follow me all the way to the train station while he kept telling me he was going to come home with me and I kept telling him no...all just part of their eternal hussle... so... in other words, this movie was crap.",Hustlers
189,OlgaGorelik,There was a good movie in that story. Hustlers is not that movie.,5,2 January 2020,"I like Constance Wu. I think she is a very good actress. I couldn't buy her as a stripper though. Or maybe she intentionally played her character, Destiny, as not quite like the others - a little stiff, a little awkward. Either way, whether in spite or because of it, she is the one who carried the film even as it got messy and unpleasant to watch. By the end Destiny was the only character that still had my sympathy. What started as the story about good women trying to survive at the expense of bad men who seek to exploit them became one about pure, unadulterated, and completely unrepentant greed. The beautiful friendship between Destiny and Ramona (Jennifer Lopez) was hard to sustain while trying to keep up with the Kardashians. And the immigrant back story added to it was undermined by sloppy writing and casting. We are told that Destiny is a daughter of immigrants, but they cast Mercedes Ruehl as her mother, while her grandmother spoke without an accent and dropped an American cultural reference. (I think that's what I was because the women recognized it, but I, being an immigrant myself, did not.) I think there was a good movie in that story. Hustlers is not that movie.",Hustlers

194,thetyvonlesure,Soft-Core Stripper Tale,6,14 September 2019,"Hustlers is a dumbed down version of the article it's inspired from, ""The Hustlers at Scores"". The movie stars Constance Wu and Jennifer Lopez as Dorothy and Ramona. The movie's narrative is a retelling of the interviews that made up the article. The movie does a decent job bouncing back and forth between interpretations of the events, however at times interests conflict and the voice of reason for the film is nonexistent.These characters are supposed to be Anti-Heroes, however NOTHING they do is heroic, or warrants them the nomenclature of protagonist. The film wants you to feel bad for them, solely because they are struggling women. Hustlers makes a very vain and dry attempt to pull on emotional strings, especially with all of the chaos going on within the film. The only emotion this film captures fully is euphoria. The illegal action taken within the film are never justified by the circumstance of the film. It's very hard to feel for any of these characters. You find yourself feeling bad for the victims of the white collar crime (Doug in particular), as opposed to the actual protagonists.The story's pacing is very natural. The jumping through timeline is well done. As the timeline changes, so does the world within the story. There are some major inaccuracies on the music and fashion used in certain timeframes of the movie. 2007 didn't have some of the songs used. Outside of that, the film does a good job of portraying the years of 2007-2014. Some of the scenarios within this film feel like fantasy, and it dilutes the serious route that the movie tries to take. At times, this movie is less mature than it tries to be. It's literally a stripper's depiction of what it means to be ""woke"". Once again, incredibly vain and dry - with a particular hint of ignorance.Many will hail this film as a breakthrough for Jennifer Lopez, however Constance Wu is the star of this film. Constance Wu's range of emotion is well done. Her tears are real, her laughter is real, her grimaces are natural - she's great in this movie. Despite having a story that lacks natural emotion, Constance Wu and the cast deliver on that front. Jennifer Lopez does deliver as Ramona, however at times it feels like she's just playing herself. The random cameos from certain celebrities are incredibly unnecessary and they take away from the story. Cardi B should not get as much screen time, especially when she's not a major facet of the film.Hustlers has a cinematic style to it that (at times) makes the movie feel more so like a fictional comedy, as opposed to a drama that's ""Based on a true story"". The glamour shots of the film work in certain places and are overdone in other portions. The shots within this film lack creativity, however they are not bad. The camera work is decent. At times, the movie feels like a rapper's music video and despite its appropriateness - it hurts the realism behind the film. Camera work aside, the audio is by far the best part of this movie. It's easily this year's best usage of audio in any movie. This film deserves a Best Sound mixing nomination come Oscars season. The fluctuation between dialogue, and sound on tape is masterful. The sound is a shining moment from this film.Overall, Hustlers is a soft core take on a ruthless, hard-hitting story of White Collar criminal strippers. It squanders any realism, in order to tell a third wave feminist journey that lacks accountability, but thrives on immorality. Despite the themes within the film, its still an average movie that has some redeeming qualities.",Hustlers

Hustlers is one of the most surprising films of the year with an intriguing true story and stellar performances with a possible career best performance from Jennifer Lopez.The film follows a group of strippers as they hustler their way to the top to get back at Wall Street men that frequent their club as they try to make their lives better. It's a simple story, there's nothing particularly flashy about it and that's what works about it.Hustlers settles for something interesting, but never goes into the gritty details and that's perfectly fine. It's just trying to have a lot of fun with itself and that is brought out by these performances. Constance Wu continues her great work in this film and truly is the heart of the film and her friendship with Jennifer Lopez's character is phenomenal. Speaking of Lopez she is excellent in this film. She gives an unhinged performance that only she could have pulled off in this way.The film manages to be fun and enjoyable while also touching on ideas of poverty and the 99%. It's never super deep, but it doesn't seem to be going for that. It's unhinged at times and can be a funny film as well. It just manages to work and flow into a very entertaining ride.",Hustlers

What the film seems to promise and what it actually delivers are complete polar opposites, that it's hard to keep up.""Hustlers,"" written and directed by Lorene Scafaria, is advertised as a light-hearted (as light-hearted as you can get with a story about extortion), rambunctious film hyping-up stars Jennifer Lopez, Cardi B., Keke Palmer and Constance Wu. What audiences really get is a serious drama (a bit of comedy) closely focused on characters Ramona, and Destiny played by Jennifer Lopez and Constance Wu respectively, minus Hip Hop artist Cardi B who was a real-life professional stripper, given approximately roughly four minutes of screen time out of the movie's full 109 minutes.It's a period film which occurs between the years 2003 to 2015 and doesn't miss the mark on re-creating that environment. ""Hustlers"" starts with happier, care-free times of audacious spending habits flaunting huge amounts of designer clothes equal to a season of of ""Sex in the City."" That all changes in 2008 when the stock market crashed. The story is nestled in New York city around the uber elite males and the strippers that serviced them. In order to survive financially, Ramona becomes the ringleader of the group of strippers, or ""sisters"" who set-out nightly to reclaim there glory days of making loads of cash. If the rich no longer come to the strip club, bring the strip club to them. Did these men deserve this? Hmm...according to Ramona, yes they did!The movie didn't sugar-coat the actions of these women which I couldn't help but feel a bit of a moral conflict in watching what went down and feeling like an accessory. Not a great feeling. Maybe ""Hustlers"" should have NOT sugar-coated what actions went on with the men in the strip club to the women. What the group of strippers did perhaps might be best explained by Constance Wu's character who rationalized, ""hurt people, hurt people.""During my viewing of the ""Hustlers"" movie, it peeked for me in the first act, featuring what I thought was the best part of the movie with Jennifer Lopez's pole dancing at the strip club. If you missed her in concert, this is an excerpt of what you missed. Followed by a scene of her outside wearing a huge fur coat. Also during the first act was where Cardi B's screen time occurred, as well as ""Transparent"" actress Trace Lysette, and singer/song-writer Lizzo, whom I would have liked to have seen more from all three of these ladies. Second fun scene included a cameo from R&B artist Usher. The initial setup of the movie with these scenes landed the movie falling short of the expectations resulting in a more serious film in the end.It's clear that the whole story is a re-telling from journalist Jessica Pressler's (played by Julia Stiles) article in a 2015 issue of the New York Times. What the movie audience sees are scenes depicting what was revealed in Pressler's interviews from Ramona, Destiny, Mercedes (Keke Palmer) and investigators.

It's unbelievable the light sentences they got for what should at least be considered felony assault and grand larceny. They could've killed any one of those guys and the damage they did to their lives was immense. Did they deserve it because they wanted to get laid?
So who are we as a society, more open and accepting about sexuality or are we still ""bad"" for wanting it? Are only men bad for wanting it? Cognitive dissonance for 1000 Alex.As for Jennifer Lopez, no doubt she still has a smoking hot body at 50 yrs old but I think the role of her lifetime is just about anything prior to this.I still gave it a 4 because it was intriguing enough to make me want to see it all and find out what happened.

I actually bought this film because of the high Rotten Tomato score. Boy was that a mistake!
This film takes a premise that made good reading, but could not translate well into an hour and 49 minutes (or less) of film that was good entertainment. There wasn't even enough left over to make for good outtakes or bloopers.The story is about a group of women who ""dance"" in a strip club. They realize, after the crash of 2008, that there has to be a better way to make money so they begin to drug men and rack up their credit card limit to the max.
There, that's the whole storyline. No other minor storylines and this movie really needed it. The film just drug on and on.
I love Constance Wu and Jennifer Lopez but seeing them in this was a disappointment. The acting wasn't the film's problem, everyone gave great performances with what they had to work with. It's a film that tries hard but in the end runs out of gas after the first 15 minutes.",Hustlers
222,brent-27849,"Not offensive, just boring",2,20 September 2021,"Hard to know what to say. It's not particularly offensive, it's just not all that good. The character relationships are poorly developed, as are the characters individually, it feels so contrived and fake. J-Lo's kid is little more than window dressing, see, she has a kid that she's trying to take care of, yeah, I get it; she's also going to college, ah yes, the mythical stripper who's doing it go through college, you hear about them all the time but rarely do you ever find one for real; in fact I'm not actually sure if she finishes since it's dropped about as quickly as it's brought up, but then, I have to say she does seem a little old to be pursuing either goal.Again the story isn't particularly offensive, at least not any more than any other drug movie about criminals, but like every crime movie of its kind, it's all been done better. There's the natural rise in the crime world, reaching a high point, and then it's all down hill. Except it's all just so mediocre. Ok, so they drug a bunch of guys and rip them off. I don't know, it's not exactly The Sting here. It's not even Ocean's 11. Seems just slightly above purse snatching or trying to rip off seniors for their old age security cheques. I assume they draw the line at rolling drunks in the park.Again, as in most crime movies, there's that point where they truly succeed beyond their wildest imaginations, represented by some amazing house or toy they buy, the pink Caddy in Goodfellas, what is the matter with you, what is the matter with you, what is the matter with you, Tony Montana's mansion in Scarface, the world is yours, but here, it's in an overly long Christmas sequence where they show off all their bling. I don't even care if they had gotten the money by honest means, the whole thing seemed kind of pathetic. I guess the saying is true, money doesn't buy people happiness, unless they're unbelievably shallow to begin with.I think of Sharon Stone in Casino. Of course money and jewelry is totally important to her as well. I find it ironic that in both movies, there's a chinchilla coat. But for her, you get that the money means something else. Besides the transactionary nature of it, it's how she does business, to her it represents a type of safety, as well as power and control, and in many ways she conflates it with love, both in giving it to her dirt bag boyfriend and it being the only way Deniro can show that he loves her. In Hustlers, I can't help thinking that all it's about is a new pair of shoes.Then there's the downfall, except it feels more like Mean Girls, oh, she likes the other girl more than me, boo hoo. Even the final end, again it's not exactly Tony Montana going down with his little friend. Just the fact that they all get suspended sentences says what the real stakes are in the movie. Not much. I would have liked to at least known how much money they stole and what exactly happened to all of it.I know it's based on a true story but the movie needed a real bad guy, a reason to root for them. You need a Robert Shaw or even an Andy Garcia. Instead it's just a bunch of boobs getting rolled. Even the comment about them being a bunch of Wall Street guys who deserve it. Ok, speaking to the choir here, but it just comes across as so phony. Same as the last comment, the whole world is a hustle, ok, again singing my song, but it might help if they actually showed it instead of just saying it.As I said, I didn't find it all that offensive, but it does seem a little wrong. I mean consider the relationship between the stripper and the client, it's sacred. Guys want to watch women take off their clothes, women take off their clothes for money, whether right or wrong, it is a pretty honest transaction. Seem like the strippers in this movie break the code of honest stripping, there must be a written handbook where this would be near the top of the list of things you shouldn't do.

One would hope there would be a little socially redeeming value in this movie, but there is no moral or even moral ambiguity.

As such, I kept waiting for something to happen, something interesting that created some kind of meaningful plot.It never came. This is a really mediocre film, with very mediocre performances, and a lousy plot. I think there is a great film to be made about this topic, the idea of strippers getting their own back on the Wall St high rollers had great potential. This is not that film and is best avoided.",Hustlers
237,barrelhousegutboy,A Lesson in Filmmaking,8,4 December 2019,"Cold viewing, knew nothing about it going in but by the marquee expected something between Show Girls and Dancing at the Blue Iguana. I watch a lot of movies and I do my best to watch them for what they are instead of what they aren't. (Something I had to be taught to make movie going much more enjoyable). First off most of the movie is very upbeat, things happen fast and everyone is having a good time. The primary players did outstanding work and production value is very high. Until Julia Stiles showed up I had almost forgot I was watching a studio film and this is where I was most impressed. Many films have what I like to call 'filler' or 'fluff'. Sometimes its the result of editing, other times production formula, and some film scenes of this nature for a variety of reasons. There is almost no fluff in this film. Every minute is spent pushing the story element instead of 'setting mood' or 'creating tension' up until 'the fall' and then you get a little, but not much. I am unfamiliar with the director, Lorene Scafaria, but the economy of each scene is outstanding. If you aren't put off by subject matter and just like to be entertained you could do a whole lot worse than this one. I didn't have it on my watchlist but I'm glad I got to see it. While its not a 'chick flick' per se I have to imagine women will enjoy the film more than men will.",Hustlers

239,bettyconway,Life is A Strip Club,8,23 January 2020,"From the moment Jennifer Lopez walks on screen in Hustlers, everyone else might as well pack it in and go home. She oozes charisma, sex appeal, smarts, and charm from her first entrance to her last. This is an actress in her prime who's finally been given something a little meatier and more interesting to sink her teeth into and she doesn't disappoint.Lopez plays the ""old timer"" at a strip club where she's still raking in the cash every night (and when you see her act, you'll understand why) who decides to take a younger stripper (Constance Wu) under her wing and teach her the ways of the business. Soon, they've concocted a genius scheme to make more money by drugging Wall Street knuckleheads and using their credit cards to get them extra tips. Of course, this will come with a price.Both funny and moving, Hustlers is the kind of movie you don't see much of anymore. It's a movie that would have felt more at home in the 70's when movies about interested, but deeply flawed people were more en vogue. Thankfully, everyone involved in the film seems up to make a memorable movie and they do just that. There's a little act 2 sagging here and there, but the film gets back on track and delivers a great, satisfying conclusion.",Hustlers
240,benji-UCLA,Haters dragging down the score,10,23 November 2019,"The current rating is a 6.6....I'd probably give it a 7. All these 1's and 2's are ridiculous. This movie may be hard to watch at times, but it is very REAL. And regardless of how you feel about JLo (she tends to be a pretty grating presence) she gave a solid performance of the role she played. Cardi may be ""trash"" but Cardi LIVED this life...love it or hate it, it IS authentic.I will say I was super impressed with Constance Wu...I felt like she was completely out of her element and I wasn't sure how she would do. JLo is getting a ton of credit (and again, she was okay) but Wu stole the show for me. This role was so different than anything I've seen her in, but she was actually really believable. This movie is a GOOD movie as far as telling the story that was written with as much authenticity and believability as possible. It may be a type of movie that some people are not into and that's fine....some people may think it's ""trashy"" and in a lot of ways it is....but it is supposed to be. It's a movie about exotic dancers hustling people...what did you expect? Did you think the dancers IN A MOVIE CALLED ""HUSTLERS"" were gonna run away to Narnia or something? Give me a break. These people knew exactly what type of movie they were seeing (if they even saw it) and are bashing it because they don't like JLo or hate Cardi and her cameo.It's a solid movie, and if you want to see this movie KNOWING THE TYPE OF MOVIE THIS IS, you will not be disappointed. I was genuinely entertained. IMDb is getting less and less reliable because of the way some people, who are completely biased, bash movies out of spite or without ever even seeing the movie...a lot of others who saw the movie and still rated it a 1 probably decided they were going to rate it a 1 before seeing the movie.

The rest, it's pure garbage, I was falling asleep most of the movie, and also the story of the movie doesn't resonate with the audience. I mean, ok you want easy money, you steal it from people, but don't try to sell it to us that these woman had the higher moral ground.

Or maybe she just watched Netflix and thought she could do the "" is it a comedy ? Is it a drama ? Nobody knows "" but, very very poorly (unlike Netflix).I am in-love with JLo and she was actually good in this but even she, could not save this poorly made film.The characters are not relatable at all, at all !
The storyline and most of the dialogue are so boring, it's as if they just filmed a boring conversation through most of it, very lazy.
The soundtrack moves between Buffy the vampire slayer moms death scene To Saturday Night live, To a cheesy 90's comedy, this makes no since what so ever and if the sound editors / director knew what they were doing, it could.To summarize:This movie was like a really bad dish made out of the best possible ingredients.

254,kevinthecritic-15200,Hustlers: Initially Titillating Drama Can't Seal the Deal,6,14 September 2019,"2.5 out of 5 stars (decent)Hustlers wants desperately to be Goodfellas for women. It's a fact-based story about a group of people who use their knowledge of a dirty profession to manipulate their customers and rise to power that has style, wall to wall music, and a career-best performance by Jennifer Lopez. The key difference between Goodfellas and Hustlers is that the former developed its supporting cast and understood that its characters were scumbags, whereas the latter can't decide how it wants us to feel about its characters' actions and overstays its welcome. Despite solid direction and performances, Hustlers is let down by bad pacing and inconsistent view on its characters.In 2007, Destiny (Constance Wu, Crazy Rich Asians) gets a job as a stripper to support her grandmother. She is embraced and educated by the high-earning Ramona (A film-stealing Jennifer Lopez), who works the Wall Street guys, until the 2008 economic crash hits the club. However, Ramona offers Destiny an opportunity for quick cash: They'll get the clientele drunk (and later drug them) so they'll max out their credit cards. As the operation grows, they bring in Underdeveloped Supporting Characters (Keke Palmer, Lilli Reinhart, Cardi B, and others), with Destiny feeling increasingly uncomfortable about the enterprise.Hustlers has all the pieces to party with the big boys, but can't put them together correctly. On the positive side, Lopez and Wu give strong performances and director Lorene Scafaria makes the stripping scenes titillating without objectifying the characters. It's also quite funny at times, and Lopez and Wu have good chemistry. Unfortunately, the setup takes far too long and the movie treats its supporting cast like Christmas ornaments. Some of the song choices are frustratingly on the nose, and the monotonous shopping and hang-out sequences stop the pacing dead rather than develop the group dynamic. However, Hustlers' Achilles heel is its inability to decide whether it wants us to root for its characters or against them, and isn't clever enough to do both. Despite good direction and performances, these Hustlers needed a better long con.Rated R for Pervasive Sexual Material, Drug Content, Language, and Nudity.",Hustlers
255,rdjoties,Let it marinade.,10,17 September 2019,"Oh this is some good stuff. After a long time I was swept off my feet by a story this engaging.I have to be honest: I did not want to see this movie at all. I saw this movie because it was movietime in my busy work/family schedule and I had to choose between this movie or the Lion King or no movie at all. The last one is not an option. And I had already seen the Lion King in 1994.I was pleasantly surprised by the unique narrative device they used to tell the story. The female bonding between the main characters had such a impact on me. It's the heart of the story.And yes they (the main characters) weren't that fancy in their manners. They had a questionable moral compass, to say the least. But it was triggered by something in their lives/situation.It seems that moviegoers are underrating this movie, because of the (im)moral compass of the main characters. If morality is a measuring device for the quality of movies, at least their (the hustlers) moral code was more koosjer then that of the main characters of Wallstreet, the wolf of wallstreet and Goodfellas. And those movies get better moviegoer ratings hmmm..why is that.. I wonder....A nomination is in order for Lopez, Wu and the director/ writer, if you will dear academy.

Literally, the most unsentimental, unmoving story I've come across in some time and I only watched it because of the hype. It's over-hyped. It's been done.

All the talk about J-Lo deserving an Oscar for her performance must have come from A-Rod, because all she did in this film was shake , curse now and then, smoke a couple cigarettes, and stomp around looking ""fierce"". Constance Wu was so out of place in this film it was laughable. Who would hire someone with the body of a 10 year old to strip in a high-end strip club?

I felt the film failed to capture the big city New York vibe where it is set.
The characters were extremely boring, and had I could not find likable traits in any of them.I found it quite shocking to have Cardi B make an appearance in a film that is about drugging and robbing men, something she has admitted doing herself in real life. Its almost like having Harvey Weinstein make an appearance in a film about film producers abusing their power and taking advantage of actresses.
'Bardi' offered very little to the film.

At the end they became just ciriminals. It is just weird for me that in the press they praise the movie as ""a movie about women"" and ""it puts the spot light on women"".

I don't think that's what the movie was doing at all.I always review the movies I see for my own records, just to jog my memory later on. Here's what I wrote about this one:Constance Wu stars as Destiny, a young Chinese-American girl driven to stripping to make ends meet, but Jennifer Lopez (""J Lo"") easily steals the movie in the costarring role as Ramona, the veteran stripper who takes Destiny under her wing. After a while they and a couple more stripper pals graduate to steering well-to-do Wall Street johns into the club for a cut of what they get them to spend (which can run into thousands), and finally to drugging them to get it done more quickly and surely.The screenplay (based on a real case chronicled in an article in New York Magazine) is intelligent and believable, so is the dialogue, and all the acting is very good. All except Jennifer Lopez, because ""very good"" isn't strong enough for her, she's really outstanding in the role, a performance without a single false note.The relationship between Destiny and Ramona does not appear to be sexual, yet you could say the whole movie is really their love story. The music is good too, and the eye candy is wall-to-wall.All in all: A fun flick with some intelligence and depth to it.",Hustlers
288,fuzulu,Too long and fizzles out,4,1 February 2020,"This is a pretty decent and watchable movie till a certain point but really fizzles out after about half or sixty percent point, and it is also too long for no reason at all... so the second half of the movie is a complete drag and difficult to watch. Also it leads to pretty much nothing interesting in the end.
The overall quality is not bad, it's watchable but could have been a lot better, the way the story is told is not great.",Hustlers

I think most of the reviewers here went into the film expecting the former but got the latter.It's tonally more like The Big Short meets Marriage Story than the Oceans movies. And if you're into that you might enjoy it as much as I did. Constance Wu and J Lo were great, and I found their story genuinely moving, interesting and engaging.",Hustlers

292,nichelsearobinson-18552,Expected more,3,17 September 2019,"Given that I read the article written by Jessica Pressler and seen the 20/20 The Hustler documentary, the movie left me unfilled. By any means not saying what these women did was right but three women hustling rich Wall Street men out of their money was fascinating but the way this movie was told was too hollywood. Here's what I thought was missing and didn't make sense. The 20/20 documentary gave me more insight than the movie. I had more respect for these women. They were like the wolf on Wall Street, three women hustling Wall Street men out of their credit cards. But watching the movie I didn't see that. There were good laughs here and there but I walked away without a complete story. This movie had too many big names and wasn't focusing on the storytelling. If this film had did more research and took more time, this could have been bigger than wolf on Wall Street. Their story was in a continuous loop of the crime rather than getting to the root of why it really started in the first place. Working at gentleman's club is not all glamours and these women don't go after their money because of the stock market crash. This film did not have a lot substance for me to want to see again. Second movie JLo has produce that I was disappointed.",Hustlers

To read the critics are calling this film ""the Goodfellas in a g-string"" comparison is laughable and quite honestly shows how much the WOKE crowd were striving hard to give this ordinary film a few brownie points off the back off an absolute legendary film from 1990. I also can't see why everyone is lauding the performance of Lopez claiming it's her best to date - sorry peeps, you're wrong. Lopez is never better when she isn't shaking her bits on screen. This film took me two evenings to get through because I found it overrated and fairly boring. Do yourself a favour - if you're in the mood for an ensemble female cast crime drama, go watch the minor 1990s classic ""Set It Off""- something with real things to lose and high stakes.

You have been brainwashed to believe everything is fine for everyone with the current system of 1% vs. 99%.
I think its very brave for Jennifer Lopez to produce and act in this honest approach of a real case, that happens every day in the biggest Empire Humanity has experienced. And if the USA is the boss, it is a truth happening in almost every corner of the world, where governments have accepted USA programming through implementing their business model, their film propaganda and their data trafficking system through internet, without receiving anything back: the way I see it, we have become less than laboratory monkeys.

All the male roles - either tricks or cops - are wafer thin and the female characters really aren't that much better developed. The writing is banal at best and much of the film is spent following characters between locations on long, dull steadicam shots. You get the feeling that Lorene Scafaria is seeking to channel Martin Scorcese with laugahable results. How Jennifer Lopez came to appear in this turnip is beyond comprehension; the fact that takes a producer credit means it's project in which she somehow believed.
If you do manage to get through till the end - and there is little reward if you do - you'll keep wondering who in fact the audience for this mess was meant to be. It offers little in the way of validation for women. Perhaps it is meant to titillate the male gaze with the overwhelming number of scantily clad women on offer.
As with so many failed film endeavours there is problem of tone. Scafaria doesn't seem able to decide what kind of film she was trying to make. The presence of Julia Stiles is curious; she appears to be wandered on set from a neighbouring shoot. Is there anything good to say about this film? Lopez is OK and the cinematography is good.

After struggling, they get back into it and Wu and Lopez hatch a plan to milk these Wall Street traders by drugging and stealing a chunk of their money.Another element involves Julia Stiles as a reporter who interviews Wu and others about the events that occurred.There was a lot I liked and disliked about this movie. As I mentioned before, I liked the performances, especially by Lopez and Wu. What I didn't like was that it feels like it's just a bunch of random Wall Street creeps but there is no real reason as to why, it's like they're picked at random for who gets drugged next.

But ""Hustlers"" shows what J.Lo can do. Director Lorene Scarfaria stages the 50-year-old as a seductive femme fatal and clever businesswoman who transfers the mentality of Wall Street to the microcosm of a strip club: ""We have to think like the Wall Street guys,"" Ramona (Lopez) advises her colleagues when it comes to the financial crisis in 2007/2008 and the wallets of the gentlemen who amuse themselves every evening in the club is no longer so wide open.

I felt really mad at the protagonists, actors, producers, directors, everyone involved really. Because it's the kind of piece that shouldn't have existed but does in a free society. Still it shouldn't have gotten this much attention. The movie continuously promotes and incentives inhumane practices of money extortion and larceny, like drugging, blackmailing, forgery, racketeering and it does all that whilst still laughing at victims. We're all used to that, but the keyword you should focus is inhumane. The way it presents the action it's as if it's the right way and it never shows the other side of the story nor the consequences of atrocities. It's full of crocodile tears. It's almost dystopic but only in principle. It gives extraordinary value to falsehood in discomforting levels. One thing they got right was the soundtracks, I Shazamed like 10 songs the entire movie but even that prevented me from giving it the lowest score. I can confidently say it's one of the worst pieces I have ever saw in my entire life. It is filthy from top to bottom, just very very sad and depressing the way it was portrayed. The problem is not the story, because people like that do exist in IRL. The problem is that the entire film continuously glorifies and promotes those behaviors.",Hustlers

Why is she so close to Destiny, to the point where she keeps a photo of her and not the other girls? Why did she take Destiny under her wing in the first place?

She seemed too embarrassed to dance, act, join in the general jollity in any given situation. Like me when I'm asked to dance in a group at a club. Id rather talk to the plant in the corner.
Storyline is lacks originality. and plot hole :why the hell was a journalist questioning these women following conviction. seemed like a massive build app for absolutely no pay off. also little cues like using names of victim and putting the sound down are techniques that suggest they'll lead to a some great reveal later. The just don't. So its just baffling.I originally paused this movie after15mins because it glorified scams . I came back to it 1y r later because I watched Netflix (yes all of it during lockdown). And hoped for the best. But because there was no redemption for characters, or new insight into why these things happens I didn't find it satisfying. You might want to consider it a mural depicting a collection of american geishas who like money and lack solidarity when it counted . The movies just not cerebral enough. It showcases some dancing skills which seems difficult to master.I like seeing Cardi B, she was standout in her cameo and funny. Also Lizzo was ok.

The performances are steady but no actor can inspire when reading from something so insipid. The glowing reviews for this film are a true testament to the utterly corrupt multinational media propaganda machine. The film reviewers themselves should be sad and ashamed.,Hustlers

It's my fault that I expected a fun, entertaining movie and didn't heed the user reviews that contradicted the critics' reviews. I, too, fell for the Critics' Hustle of an all-star cast but of course even the starriest of cast couldn't save this dog of a movie...not even a cameo from Usher.This movie is NOT fun, it's NOT entertaining, and I really wanted to walk out but I'd paid my money and resolved to stay to the end.

344,nickmorenz,Good movie if you can moralize their dispicable actions,5,17 September 2019,"First and foremost, the movie is entertaining and well made but for those of us who look deeper and analyze what a movie is saying, it is quite awful and justifies terrible things. While people properly pointed this out in the upcoming Joker movie, i'm sure it will be overlooked in this movie because it's a diverse cast f females and not a white male. Rather than write my own crappy analysis, i found an article which i summarized which lays out my argument well.You can enjoy 'Hustlers,' on its own terms. But to celebrate its heroines - based on real-life scammers who victimized people - as feminist role models is twisted and morally bankrupt.There is supreme cynicism in the way the gang justifies each action by glibly comparing America to a one big strip club - in which everyone is out for themselves. Tell that to the building site worker finishing his 12-hour shift, the emergency department doctor, or the barmaid who doesn't triple swipe the customer's credit card.Or the way the camera manipulatively exploits the strippers' children as a human shield for their immoral behavior. She just wanted a nanny for her straight-A student daughter! And the next scene wallows in naked materialism as its heroes gift each other Louboutins and chinchilla coats.How it dehumanizes the men, who are victim-blamed as deserving marks for having the gall to go and ask for a private dance, or make a lewd comment, or just be rich (one assumes that the perpetrators did a thorough audit to find out whether they had gained the money through virtuous methods). And whose bodies, often helpless from the administered drugs, are used as comedy props with a delighted cruelty.None of that is a deal-breaker - a film can have its viewpoint.No, the real slap in the face is that we are told, both by producer Lopez, director Lorene Scafaria, and by dozens of fawning reviews and articles, that this film somehow represents a triumph of feminism, because these are ""empowered"" women who are ""reversing the roles"" and ""taking control,"" that they are ""Robin Hood thieves""sticking it to the man.To me, gaining someone's trust, then forcing them to unknowingly ingest horse tranquilizer, mugging them, then dumping them semi-conscious, and blackmailing them if they later say they'll go to the police, is one of the scuzziest crimes. Not some fun caper.
Anyway, good movie with a terrible moralization of criminal activity. At least in Goodfellas no one pretended they were doing good work.",Hustlers

I see IMDB's rating includes the word comedy, although I don't recall seeing anything to laugh about in this tale based apparently, on fact. The acting was top notch as well, but again I must complain about the overbearing music. I really am a music lover, but am not happy with the trend these days of nearly drowning out the dialog with music or weird sounds to enhance the mood. I truly do hope that technology will soon give home viewers the ability to control the level of what used to be called ""background music."" Sound engineers please note.

361,onesixtyreviews,Film Review: Hustlers - A stylish saga about the cost of greed.,8,19 October 2019,"Lorene Scafaria absolutely kills it. Hustlers is a well written, tremendously directed film. The co-leads in Constance Wu (Crazy Rich Asians) and Jennifer Lopez (Jenny from the block...) act their asses off. For a $20 million production this film looks huge and glossy. It's everything you want your trip to the movies to be. Worth the price of admission and engaging enough to justify the large coke and popcorn.I felt like for a portion of the film that some characters were forgotten about. They felt key to the character's motivations but went missing. These threads were picked up again however and it resolved my biggest gripe. The cast is quite large especially during the films first act. More and more cast members are added as the film progresses and the initial ensemble is made redundant by the plot. The girls were so charming at the start that I wish they'd found their way back into the story. This isn't a criticism so much as a wish for more of a good thing.My experience seeing this movie was my main takeaway. I'm a self-professed film geek. Often when I head to the pictures I'm flying solo because my One Sixty cohort Shane is busy or finding like minded film fans is hard to come by where live. It's not uncommon to see a few other guys watching the film by themselves as well. What I saw during Hustlers was sort of unprecedented out in the 'burbs where I live (at least in my experience). I saw many women, by themselves, in the cinema seeking this film. Young and old alike.It's no great mystery that movies are made, at least marketed, with men/boys in mind. Great inroads have been made in changing the opinion that they are solely for men and Hustlers seems like a huge leap forward in defeating this stigma. Whilst I was watching the movie the sense that this movie wasn't trying to appeal to my more basic man-brain became increasingly apparent. The movie wasn't exploitive of its female cast. It told the story as it was, it didn't fantasise.I felt refreshed seeing a movie that I wasn't the target audience for. Seeing a movie that could easily have fallen into the trappings of becoming a male fantasy movie. Instead it was a female story. Told as it was. I am absolutely here for more mature movies that aren't just about the white male experience. As his history shows in order for anything to survive becoming stagnated it need diversity. We need more stories from more people. We need more stories from Lorene Scafaria.A film about greed, told with grace:4/5 Stars",Hustlers

394,m-r-eggink-905-239808,A moving tale about friendship and bad choices,8,15 March 2020,"Based on the reviews here, I went in with zero expectation and was happily surprised. This movie is a great tale about friendship, bad choices and unlikable characters that still seem relatable in their humanity. I was very moved by it and against all odds even impressed with Jeniffer Lopez.I think a lot of people feel this movie is glorifying something bad or trying to make bad characters look good. But I feel they miss the point. It did definitely uncover some problematic issues in the scene, and it did look glamorous while doing so. But most of all it's just about friendship. And how fate throws people together sometimes. How they make bad choices based on their past and have difficulty believing they are worth something. And then think money is gonna solve the issue. How they put others and themselves in danger because they believe dollars will make them happy. Ultimately of course this is a lie and reality catches up with them.In the end they may have spent a lot of their stolen money and lost the rest of it. But it's clear their biggest loss was each other. Their friendship was believable and heartfelt to me. I recognized some of the dysfunctional behavior of people grasping on to each other when there's no one else in sight. It's only human. They pose as confident and big but on the inside they are so broken. And often it shows when their dysfunction breaks through the cracks and makes mistakes.Could it have been more realistic or gritty? Sure! But this is not that kind of movie.

And the portrayal put forth in this movie is fair, and the insights into the connection between the 2008 crash and the strip club culture changes were very well covered.You don't have to love that people got ripped off in strip clubs to understand and enjoy this movie. You just have to be honest enough to accept that this is where the XXX rated culture was in this time and place in New York City.If you give it a 3, you don't know anything about big city strip clubs.

397,amboseman,Transgressive Masterpiece,8,26 April 2020,"Very reminiscent of Paul Verhoeven's Showgirls. I think this is a really good film in disguise if you're willing to look a little deeper and appreciate some of the subtlety. For one this is one of the greatest celebrations of female sexual power ever made, it is entirely driven by the inverse of the idea of exploitation. In 99% of films strippers, prostitutes or models in the background are the faceless, voiceless anonymous subjects of exploitation and enjoyment by male characters. In Hustlers it is the male characters that are ""uncharacterized"". I also think there is tremendous heart to the friendships depicted, and depth to the female characters you don't often see. They turn on each other, scream, cry, manipulate and hug it out. They aren't angels or demons they're people in a way that women don't often get to be.The film is also a surprisingly harsh critic of the 2008 financial crash and the robber baron NY elite. The film's final line I believe is ""America is a strip club, you're either throwing money around or you're dancing for it."" I think that is a sad and beautiful summary of late stage capitalism in America.Finally I must also praise the filmmaking here by Lorene Scafaria. I enjoyed her previous film ""Seeking a Friend for the End of the World"". There are some very good shots and scenes. I think the lightning is wonderful, the contrast between dark and light. There are also a few very neat and creative moments throughout like a brief dream sequence, a brief ""mute"" and a subtle 4th wall break.This film will be misunderstood and poorly judged for many years to come unfortunately. Reading some of the other user reviews is very disappointing but not surprising. You don't have to love everything you see but you should think about what you see just a little bit.

Jennifer Lopez is on fire! She is so confident and in control of her charisma and show-stopping energy. Lopez paints a delicate portrait of Ramona, the caring and protective matriarch of this stripper family. A really well edited film. Director Lorene Scafaria goes in on the glitz and glamour of the world these women inhabit. She depicts the professions of these women almost like this beautiful dance rather than this overly sexualized performance.

400,georginacroft,Fantastic film - give it a chance!,8,4 April 2020,"I think a lot of people in the comments really missed the point of the film - feminist films to me shouldn't be about women who are wholesome superheroes, perfect in everyway - it's about giving real women an equal chance for their real stories to be told. This film does exactly that - a story about a group of women who are not trying to be heroes or get Robin Hood style revenge on bankers but who are making money for themselves through illegal means - something many of the Wall Street bankers of the time did and like the main character in Wolf of Wall Street did and everyone seemed to love that film. I think it's a classic issue of women not being allowed to be 'antiheroes' but must instead be girl-next-door likable characters. Also why does a film with a large female cast have to be a 'feminist film' with a big moral message - why can't it just be a good film?I think the dynamic between Constance Wu and J-Lo is brilliant and I loved the editing and soundtrack!Give it a chance!",Hustlers

402,octoberorison,An Elevated Lifetime Movie,7,18 April 2020,"Some stylistic choices and a handful of performances save this from feeling like a straight to VOD/TV flick.I enjoyed the Goodfellas-type long shots and the closing sequence where they all got arrested (I especially liked how Keke Palmer was arrested after visiting her boyfriend in prison).JLO is fine, but it's the height of irony that she's the one to deliver a 'stinging' critique of the American capitalism. Come on, now.The cameos (Lizzo, Cardi B) are pretty superfluous and they drop out of the picture after the first 15 minutes. I would think Cardi B could offer some creative input on how to properly drug and rob someone.Surprisingly, the interpersonal relationships are cloying and saccharine. Especially the wrap-up of JLO and Constance Wu's relationship:""You should call her.""""Yeah.""(Roll credits)The grandma character was a plot device to get us on board with Constance's actions and she's shafted as soon as that purpose is served. Hey, I'm fine with rooting for unlikeable protagonists, but at least have the courage to actually make them unlikeable rather than saying they're doing it for their poor grandma. Maybe that's how it happened in real life, but it's still a cliche onscreen.There are some neat dance sequences and the club dynamic overall is interesting.I fun (ish) movie, though my finger hovered over the stop button several times.",Hustlers
403,ratnabhsl,No real plot,3,10 April 2020,"This movie didn't have any real plot - it was similar scenes again and again. The story line was pretty much given away in the trailer but it took so long to get into the point in the movie.

Nice scenography! Jennifer Lopez and Constance Wu did a great job! I really feel like their general attitude completely fit the characters they were portraying.

411,rpomposo-1,Lowering the bar for what's considered a good movie.,1,21 July 2020,"From the beginning of the movie to last line where JLO mentions that the world is basically a ""strip club"", this film isn't worth .99 cents at a redbox. Movies like this one were usually relegated to midnight showings on Cinemax, are now seemingly worthy of an Academy Award? Not really sure who the protagonists are in the movie because they certainly aren't the strippers ripping off horny old men of their money. The whole premise is ridiculous as obviously this movie wouldn't be made if the genders were reversed. So who would play Bill Cosby in Hustlers part 2? For anyone wondering, Cardi B's ""cameo"" was atrocious, basically playing herself. Everyone else was lackluster, but what would you expect considering the plot of this abomination.",Hustlers
412,sstroudailife,Am I seeing the same movie?? Worse than Showgirls,1,24 September 2020,"First, I have to agree with ""flicklover"" and their recommendation of the movie Widows. Absolutely amazing and blown away by the shock of certain actors playing a part completely opposite their stereotype and pulling it off. I would also recommend The Kitchen for woman empowerment. Who knew melissa McCarthy was so versatile?I will have to google but I'm reading JLo has an Oscar nod for this? Huh?? The movie was an advertisement for the fact that if you are a multi millionaire, you can afford to look fantastic at 50. Sure, personal trainer, private gym, personal chef, personal everything. Hell, if I had that I would look a hell of a lot better too! No substance. No emotional pull.And Constance Wu....I had never heard of her until Crazy Rich Asians and I adore her there. I understand actors wanting to have diversity in their roles, but there are just some things that don't fit, like her wig. She was Absolutely adorable in Crazy Rich Asians...and in Hustlers she literally made my face hurt because it was in a constant state of shocked dismay and confusion. And she has ZERO sex appeal. ZERO. ZIP. NADA. Her role as a stripper following the lead of JLo was super comical to me, and had they intended the film to be a comedy, that may have worked. She gets props for crying on cue...but all they had to do was put her in front of a mirror because if I had a wig and bangs like that, I would cry too.
So, I respect the desire to diversify your resume, but my goodness, her agent should be fired. This ranks up there, IMHO, with Octavia Spencer in ""Ma"". I've watched that movie a couple times just trying to make sense out of why she chose that movie to change her character. She was mesmerizing in The Shack, as well as the Help, and so many others. Movies like Ma for her and Hustlers for Constance Wu are just wrong.Did I mention Constance had ZERO sex appeal? In a movie about strippers, with unattractive and over the hill women playing strippers and very few baring skin, the ONE person who's skin is worth baring shows nothing, horrible story line, horrible everything...is it possible they finally made a stripper movie that's WORSE THAN SHOWGIRLS??? Yup. At least with Showgirls, you see pretty naked bodies and the people in the film openly acknowledge how horrible it turned out. So the tongue is cheek aspect is funny there.
Hustlers is just an annoying poser that provided a big pay check, judging by the box office success.Constance, please, for the love of god, go back to being the naive and sweet Econ professor. I can't handle more of this.",Hustlers
413,Moroccowaters,Based on true story. No glamorizing of strip club world,7,26 December 2019,"Excellent job of showing the desperation of some of the characters.

414,Nikimouse311,Actually much better than I anticipated,8,29 April 2020,"First off, not to sound all female, but if your a dude then you probably won't get this movie. I went in not knowing what to expect. I wasn't expecting any kind of emotion from it but I actually did. In the reviews the movies get a bad wrap for being trash and I feel like it's partly because it's a movie about strippers doing trashy things but a movie like Wolf of Wall Street about business men doing trashy things is amazing. I digress.I think the acting is great by the stop billed actors. Some of the extra players could of stepped it up. The dialogue was authentic for that type of environment. My best friends sister is a stripper and it's pretty spot on. It captured the idea of something we all do in our lives and we see corporations doing it all the time; illegal things for a big pay out. It's a story as old as time told on the smaller scale. I have see reviews were people say it's feminist and empowering and others say it's very degrading. I see both sides of the argument and this story is by no means a how to guide. Personally I don't care whether it's empowering or degrading and you should either. Take what you want from it. So anyway, have an open mind. I am typically a film snob and I am really surprised that I enjoyed this.",Hustlers

Hustlers gives a compelling look at a group of female strippers and the ripple effect of the economy for them to support themselves. The women dive into illicit and dangerous means to strip the money off the remaining hight rollers of Wall Street. Jennifer Lopez gives a performance that will earn her nominations this award season. She's the screen commanding Ramona. From the moment she dances, you want to join her in her fur coat with Destiny. Destiny is the Point of View character that is sweet, vulnerable and is drawn to the strength of Ramona. While the two of them fall down the rabbit hole, you can't help empathize with their worlds. Destiny says it best with ""what would you do for $1,000?"". I've seen some of the other reviews posted on this site that are unsupported insults of the film. Americans need the perspective of how hard it is in life for non-Caucasian women who don't have affluent families and aren't college educated to make a living for themselves in life. The world is stacked against certain groups. The films shows that these women are no more evil than the men that crashed this country's economy.",Hustlers

I felt like I was taking an intro class in feminist/capitalist critique while being marveled by excellent acting, a fun soundtrack, beautiful lighting, in-depth character development, and a bunch of enjoyable 'slow-mo walking shots'/transitions with trippy elements.The plot (while creative-licencing a true story) is meticulously crafted commentary on the ills of a capitalist-obsessed society, while simultaneously capturing the feminist bonds that keep us pushing through it together.The film centers around the economic collapse of 2008 and the lives it upturned in trickle-down effect; it critiques capitalism brilliantly, as it arguably captures one of the most OBVIOUS ways we assign inherent VALUE to individuals; through sex work.Hustlers reminds us that we're all the same players in this violent game we call the American dream; and that some of us are simply better, smarter, more ruthless players at that game than others; those who learn to work the system.",Hustlers

We live in a sad sad world and men have been paying for women since the beginning of time and it's never going to stop. I don't condone using people or ruining peoples lives. I feel the tables were turned and we tend to accept mens bad behaviour or turn a blind eye, so I found it interesting to see what happens when women say f it. I walk in my own shoes and I'm far from perfect, so who am I to judge. Sell your soul for a dead end job that you hate and can't afford to pay the bills or hey marry a guy and be dependent on him (still getting paid for sex in my opinion) maybe the small percentage of women that make a fair wage and can support themselves. So to all the people that try and justify why this movie deserves a low rating need to give there head a shake, people are shady and will do what they need to do, it happens every second of everyday, this is real life and yes it truly is unfortunate I'm all for peace and equality but it's not going to ever be fair and these gals did an awesome job portraying that, killed it!

They drug the Wall Street clients in their club to steal their money.

For the most part this film explores such territory relatively successfully, although granted with a bit of male gaze-y eye candy thrown in. It's not John Wick and doesn't pretend to be. It has a naturalistic pacing.However, what has happened to the reviews on this site is that a lot of dudes who are upset because the 20th century happened and women got the vote and films are being made from a perspective other than viewing them as objects, prizes to be won, or damsels to save feel threatened and think that airing their toxic hatred of women by review bombing movies that don't conform to their tastes will somehow make the world be the 1820's again.

I have to say it took me a while to finally watch it due to some of the not so great reviews. However, after viewing it I found Hustlers to be a compelling and moving portrait of young women trying to get by in the New York strip club scene of recent years. This movie is realistic, alternating between gritty and glamorous, fun and frightening. Just like real life. Every scene is perfect, all of the actors are very talented, and the music is excellent. Especially notable are the performances by Jennifer Lopez and Constance Wu. Hustlers may not be the "" feel good hit of the summer"", but that's not what it's intended to be. This is an important film that brings up societal issues like economic disparity and questionable patriarchal systems. This is a film that celebrates female empowerment, and yet warns of the dangers of crossing the line between what's OK and what's not, both morally and within our societies' framework. In my opinion, Scafaria has brought us two of the best films of the 21st-century, this one and ""seeking a friend for the end of the world"". If you want to see a fun and light romcom, this is probably not what you want. If you want to see a powerful, captivating and important addition to our cinematic history, this would be a good choice.",Hustlers

Even though this is based on a true story I didn't feel the relationships between the characters was well set up. It was a bunch of shallow people doing criminal things and it wasn't even appealing. When JLo says at the end of the movie ""the entire country is a strip club"", I wanted to take he cue of the younger Hustler and throw up the popcorn I ingested throughout this 2 hour movie.I gave it a 2nd star because JLo did look outstanding, so credit to her there, but anyone trying to say she should get an Oscar nomination for this movie is either someone contractually obligated to be pushing this propaganda or someone who has a vested interest in JLo's career.",Hustlers

The songs hit you just at the right time. What I feel about the negative reviews is that people are trying to find justice or looking for some girl power in this. Well there isn't. It's a beautifully depicted story of lives of strippers during a certain period of time and how they tried to upgrade their game in their own way.
I enjoyed this movie from beginning to end. And loved it.",Hustlers

461,macaronipony,Trailer more exciting than the Full Movie,6,19 September 2019,I was drawn in by the trailer and all the commotion of Lopez' acting. I was disappointed and expected more. Lopez does a good job but definitely not Oscar worthy. The movie is entertaining however the first 100 minutes are stuck in a rut of the same thing over and over.

The casting was stellar. Obviously Jlo and Constance e Wu everyone is talking about . But even the smaller roles were very authentic, very NYC . The strip club patrons, the sleazy wall street guys and especially the cops. The two detectives seemed like the real deal to the point I wondered if it was actual documentary footage.

I was, however, surprised at how much I enjoyed this film. Jennifer Lopez carries this film, and not nearly enough screen-time was given to Cardi B. It was, nevertheless, an enjoyable, almost hedonistic few hours.

When I watch a new film I try to appreciate the full vision of it. The lightning, camera angles, and the overall cinematography , to me embraced the feel of a NYC strip club & lifestyle back in 2007. I enjoyed watching JLO in a different element that I personally wasn't use to seeing her in. She was a HUSTLER and it was refreshing to me to see the BX come out of her! Don't listen to all these petty reviews, give it shot for yourself!",Hustlers
479,reusjy,Hustled my time,6,11 January 2020,"Hustlers is a fine movie, but it's just that. JLo does a convincing job of playing a depraved pile dancer but my problem is with Constance, but moreso her character Destiny. Destiny really doesn't contribute anything to the storyline. She's a glorified viewpoint for watching Ramona and the other girls. The movie wants us to sympathize with Destiny, but the movie does not do enough to get me to care for her emotionally. Hence the whole Destiny/Mother, Destiny/Daughter plotlines fall flat.The plot is very convoluted. The movie loses its identity halfway through. For a moment it's a mockumentary, for another it's first person narration, then for the other it's suddenly third person. Certain storylines were also confusing. What's with the Destiny in a driverless car thing? Is that supposed to convey her anxiety? If so why does it only appear once, moreso briefly? And who the fk is the reporter? I know by context that she is the article write IRL, but in the movie it was very unnecessary. To people without context it looks like a half baked plotline. Moreso, the movie climaxes very early, too early to justify it's near 2 hour runtime. Once it climaxes, we sort of get the gist of it, and the remainder of the movie feels like déjà vu, like we're seeing the movie a second time. It kinda feels like the Wolf of Wall Street, but not nearly as good.",Hustlers

487,quietchica,Surprisingly even better than I anticipated,9,29 September 2019,"Great movie portraying the life of strippers in the late 2000s/early 2010s in the wake of the Great Recession. Post Recession, wall street clients were becoming scarce, and their payouts were becoming meager. Solely dancing wasn't cutting it anymore. The girls were forced to get creative so they began engaging in some risky behavior with their wall street clientele. I loved how they used different music from the late 2000s, older cell phones, and purchased 2000s- esque bags and cars to take you back to that time and really make you feel like the movie was taking place during those years. Constance Wu and Jennifer Lopez absolutely crushed it. Cardi B and Lizzo made small appearances as well. I've heard from many that Cardi should have played Jennifer's part. I don't think she has the acting capability and classy-yet- aggressive swagger that JLo has in order to play the part of the ring leader. I found her to be an unnecessary addition to the film; her acting was irritating and exaggerated. Overall, I was absolutely mesmerized by the film, from the intricate dancing the music, and the emotion of the actresses. Great film.",Hustlers

Ali Wong would have done a better job. Entertaining to a point, as others have said, the film didn't go anywhere and the plot/writing was thin. The whole set up with the journalist didn't work and added nothing to the story. J Lo handled herself fine but I don't know where the Oscar talk is coming from. All the other roles were 2D.

499,cpatd-00439,One of the best films of the year! Insanely fun and thought provoking.,10,14 September 2019,"Hustlers is an absolute gem of a film. It's essentially an independent film (starring women of all colors, made by women - director/writer, producers, craftspeople - about strippers nonetheless) that has sleek studio sheer in spades!It's fun and engaging but it's also the best depiction of female friendship and camaraderie this year. Wu and Lopez are tremendous, their chemistry is the beating heart of the film. Again, this is the type of movie that only a female filmmaker can compellingly bring to cinemas.A love letter to female friendship and a scathing critique of an economic system that objectifies and undermines women, ""Hustlers"" is an unlikely hybrid of subversive-revenge crime saga and pop-feminist ""chick-flick."" It's an uproarious independent film AND a thoughtful, critical, heartfelt studio picture.",Hustlers

I think the cast is amazing and they all did an amazing job and portraying the roles they were given.

Her acting: Constantly staying off into something, looking either confused or interested. JLo was alright, she did a decent job but for what it's worth I didn't believe her in that role lol if that makes sense. I've probably seen the most cliched version of Wallstreet guys I've ever seen in this movie. They're either stressed out like crazy, top execs that like h o e s, or complete idiots outside of the office.Cardi B was the most interesting character, and the one who could get it the most, just cause of how she acts and looks.

Hustlers isn't about how amazing these women are, it's about a cycle of greed and the corrupting nature of money. It's a film about America and any glorification of the actions of these women is coming from an unreliable narrator (hence the use of the interview style frame narration). Get off your high horses!

I'm not sure about the original story line, but any other actress in this film would have been a better fit that Constance Wu.

However, after watching this movie she just lost a fan. This is the most humiliating, degrading, movie that I have ever seen. It was boring, and seriously, not even entertaining to watch at all. It raised many flags though on the image that she is promoting for those women who are forced to do those type of stripper jobs due to human trafficking, lost of mentorship, financial resources, self-esteem. I used to see JLO as a role model, but after this movie, she's nothing more than the character that she acted. Very disappointing to watch her do a movie like that. How selfish can she be towards her own children, and all those women who used to look up to her. There are only two words to describe JLO now: greedy and selfish. What a lost!

Second half didn't make sense, felt rushed.
Looked like they put all their money into making the first half of the movie full of action, all the celebrities were there.. then 2nd half the producers ran out of money..

I found it very materialistic, no heart and plain superficial. I didn't feel bad for the characters, I actually felt bad for the men they hurt. The only thing that was impressive was Jennifer Lopez on the pole, that took some skill, it was incredible.

While I am sitting here watching this, I keep thinking, why on earth did JLo expect an award for this?? It's bad. Like really ..bad. I'm not even upset with what the characters are doing (trying not to spoil the movie). I mean, it's based on a true story or whatever so no reason to bash JLo for that part.

There is no real substance to it, you're just watching something that someone went through and it's nothing special, the drama is not that dramatic, the tragedy is not that tragic, at the end of the film you're not left with much, it does not leave an impression. It does tell the story well but the story itself is not that interesting (perhaps not to me).

I turned it off and thanked the good Lord I didn't spend $10 bucks to go and see it at the theater. I then wondered why I even wasted 20 min on that trash. It worked none of the artists acting muscles. After reflection I thought maybe Ms. Lopez got involved because she turned 50 and was going through a Madonna phase, you know hanging around in whorehouses to prove she still was sexy or something. Without her name on this it would have not even made budget. Anyway don't waste your money.",Hustlers
556,mjz688,"Ignore the incels -- this is a very, very good movie",8,16 April 2020,"Red-pill trolls who get butthurt whenever a woman succeeds in life are dying inside because ""Hustlers"" was a bona fide hit, both with the critics and with audiences. They did their best to knock it down, but ""Hustlers"" took every punch and comes out on top. The two main stars -- Jennifer Lopez and Constance Wu -- are excellent as strippers without a heart. I mean, beyond the tight bond they share with each other, there's not a lot to like about these two, or the other strippers they recruit for their campaign to make themselves rich at the expense of the Wall Street dude-bros who wrecked the nation's economy in the 2008 financial crisis. As a guy who has spent my fair share of time both dealing with Wall Street jerks and frequenting strip clubs, I can say with confidence that writer-director Lorene Scafaria nails both sides of her film's narrative dynamic. She captures the ambience of the strip club experience in all of its seedy, dehumanizing glory, and her depiction of the dancers' disdain for their customers, and the way they are exploited by the men who own and manage the clubs, is spot on. I knocked a couple of stars off for some unneccessarily sappy stuff involving Wu's grandma and some other detours in what otherwise is a tight, detailed and compelling screenplay. Other than that, I found very little to dislike about this movie. If you're a woman, check out ""Hustlers"" for the patriarchy beatdown and stay for the sisterhood. If you're a guy, check it out for J-Lo's incredible pole dancing technique and stay for ... well, a lesson in gender equity that goes down as easily as one of the hustlers' scotch-and-MDMA cocktails.",Hustlers

Welcome to the world of women in film for the last 100 years. The disdain for this movie from men is equivalent to the 'All lives matter' idiots. Just because a film is almost unique in concentrating on the female perspective does not mean everyone involved hates men, just as BLM protestors do not detest all white people.Anyway the movie has some flaws but I found it refreshing to see men so insignificant - you can imagine a version of the script with a nice guy character who saves the day - how awful that would be.

578,curtwnichols,Two Wrongs Still Don't Make a Right,4,20 September 2019,"I've been robbed!I guess I went into J Lo's revenge-gone-wrong flick, Hustlers, with too high of expectations. The critics love this movie, but I can't see why. The film struggles mightily - and ultimately fails - to justify why two wrongs make a right.Most everything in a good Robin Hood -type story is missing or underplayed. The ""bad"" Wall Street guys getting fleeced in the movie are rarely shown behaving horribly. Oh, we are told they steal from the Firefighters retirement fund... while they are off-screen... but they are not visually portrayed as very menacing or degrading to the lady strippers. Hell, by the end of the movie, even the main protagonist's character (played by Constance Wu) is feeling sorry for the stupid saps her crew is robbing.And what of this merry little band? Here an attempt is at least made to provide the audience with a jolly, free-spirted, group of bandits to bond with. I assume those coming away from this movie with positive impressions were simply better than I at relating to the troop of thieves at the story's center.The problem with J Lo's frisky little group - and ultimately the movie - is that they cannot escape the reality of their actions. They were not out to steal from the rich and to give to the poor. Sadly, Hustlers is less a tale of female empowerment than it is a story about criminals - who happen to be women - seeking to enrich themselves.",Hustlers
579,ethicaltechnologies,Is Anyone Else Tiring out From Female Reboots,5,1 October 2019,"Perhaps, if they invested in attractive, younger women without accents bathed with urban overkill and tons down the pretentiousness entirely. Strippers by proxy can not vocalize sincere ego fantasies, save in the privacy of other strippers or an autistic child who has not developed speech recognition, yet. The cliche of choosing a Slumdog profession to provide for mommy and kiddies is so redundant that I would place a dangerous bet, nearly 85% of Western women spit the same line during thier early 30s as the moment when some poor guy settled to take them home from the bar at Applebee's leaned more toward last call and the dishwasher than someone your mother would be jealous of.
The saving grace is the hypocrisy of parody. Without deep insight, the cast and studio found it not only appropriate to celebrate theft through sexual seduction and narcotic inebriation. Fine by me, but maybe The Great Bill Cosby should receive equal respect.Moreso, per chance since he never stole from the women who likely visited him in private to extract a professional favor. I'm disappointed with with cultural embarrassment at the obvious tests perverting one reality as a horror and a near equal female version as inspirational and heroic.

582,katie-god,Should have been better,4,13 April 2020,"The star studded cast is what initially caught my attention to this film. The trailer hinted at a girly, easy watch and I'm sure most people, like me would have assumed that the movie centres around Jennifer Lopez' character Ramona. I think ultimately this would have made for a better perspective of the story and a more engrossing protagonist. Lopez' charisma comes across more effectively on screen than Constance Wu's portrayal of Destiny. I think audiences will struggle to really engage or sympathise with the character or story from Destiny's perspective, the performance fell a little flat, especially when side by side with other compelling actors such as Keke Palmer and Lili Reinhart.
Based on a true story, the original tale is fairly interesting but seems to lack the depth and emotional content to translate well into a feature length movie. Moments where the audience should have felt moved or excited didn't seem to have the desired effect.
I think the tale was explained well enough, although a shift towards either an upbeat, female empowerment movie or a gritty but glam insight into the seedy side of struggling city women, would have made for a more interesting watch than something that floated somewhere in the middle.

The movie sometimes get off the tracks, narration is not always as good, unsure if it should be a comedy or a drama, but it does holds its ground.

It's not trying to say that women are greater than men or that all men are horrible and are deserving of any hurt that is brought upon them. It's not commenting on feminism. I don't believe that this movie is meant to exemplify how women should demand power and wealth in the real world. It is a crime movie. There are no forces of good vs. evil. These women took shortcuts to live their lives in luxury by lying, cheating, and stealing.No one is condoning this type of behavior, but most low-rated reviews I've read here seem to have been written by people who have taken offense or feel morally disturbed by the decisions these women have made in the movie and are unable to separate their personal feelings.I think this movie was developed extremely well despite having its source material based on an article. The movie adaptation was funny and warm due to the women's personalities and chemistry with one another. The music was amazing and really caught my ear when they played classical music during non-clubbing scenes. The visuals were cinematic and captivating. The only reason I give this movie a 9 instead of a 10 is because I believe that some sequences ran a bit too long before continuing on with the storyline.",Hustlers

The best parts of all crime movies is almost always the investigation and when they finally get caught, the ending to this one was very rushed, there was no suspense. I think of the Goodfellas ending when Henry Hill is constantly watching his back, paranoid about the helicopter, paranoid about Jimmy. I'm Hustlers, it seemed like one minute they were committing their crimes, and the next they are arrested. No suspense whatsoever with it.

You were meant to feel uncomfortable with the decisions they made. It's not a movie about girl power. It's about these women reacting to the circumstances they were put in.The great thing about it is that it is solely focused on the women and their stories.

I thought it would be just another Showgirls or Player's Club or even worse, Magic Mike-the female version. But I was pleasantly surprised. It was such a well-told story, well-directed and well-acted. This is Jennifer Lopez's best performance since Serena and Constance Wu was excellent. Lorene Scafaria's directing was nuanced and exciting at the same time. I was always looking at the screen. I notice some of the users on here who have given this movie one star are clutching their pearls because the film is about a group of strippers (mostly of color) scamming wealthy and middle class white men. It is a movie about a crime ring. Yet, I think we have become so accustomed to movies that sympathetically portray white male criminals (e.g The Godfather movies, Goodfellas, Joker, The Irishman, Oceans 11-13 etc etc etc) many of us automatically reject any movie that tries to depict women criminals in sympathetic ways, or even women superheroes- as evidenced by the sexist backlash against Captain Marvel.

602,nycgal-17279,Like watching paint dry,3,19 November 2019,"Omg, so ridiculous! Especially the brouhaha over J-Lo getting an Oscar nod? What has become of the Oscar standards? Frivolous, waste of time and money. I was generous with my ""3"" score.",Hustlers
603,shwermalover,J-Lo is in it,7,10 September 2019,"J-Lo is in it, that literally is enough to make it a 10 out of 10 movie",Hustlers
604,jader-24493,Waste of time,6,27 December 2019,Didn't catch my attention through the whole film. Beginning was decent though it struggled through the middle. Can't believe they are nominated for an Oscar,Hustlers
605,chrissiejpayne-39237,"Great story, great performances",7,13 February 2020,"I recently watched this with no expectations other than a great performance from Jennifer Lopes following the Oscar buzz/snub. Although I found her performance very enjoyable and nuanced she neither dominates the film nor overshadows her fellow actors (infamous pole dance lesson scene aside).There's been a lot of talk of how pseudo-woke and Hustlers comes across however I did not find this the case at all. The seedy underbelly of the strip club scene is displayed in all its glamorous, dark and twisted glory without obvious sympathy to any of the main protagonists. Their crimes are never applauded nor vilified but merely presented for the audience as a reflection of the times and the weaknesses/strengths of men and women.Yes, the Goodfellas format is applied here to an extent but works well for the arc of the story and thankfully never resorts to lazy narration. Our main protagonist, Destiny (Constance Wu) during her interview scenes performs brilliantly with plant and payoff moments throughout the film. The audience is left asking questions from the get go and they are answered punctually and with subtlety.The emotional depth of Destiny and Ramona's friendship feels completely natural and at times downright beautiful. Despite this you are never encouraged to root for their crimes nor demonise them. They are simply human and fall hard to greed and temptation just as much as the Wall Street financiers they are ripping off.Is Hustlers perfect? No. Is it Oscar worthy? Maybe. It achieves it's goals brilliantly, entertains, provokes thought and discussion whilst not being preachy. My main criticism is perhaps that this film was marketed to be something it's not; a tacky, titillating stripper romp with a based-on-true events crime theme.Hustlers is a sensitive, disturbing look at a world so many of us pretend does not and should not exist.",Hustlers
606,jtwweller,Better than expected,6,28 December 2019,"Not a JLo fan so wasn't expecting much but was pleasantly surprised. She plays this role very well and the story of Hustlers is an interesting one, moreso because it's based on a true story. The cast is full of suprises which adds to the fun of watching. Yes, the topic is dark and sleazy, which is a side of life you may not agree with, but the movie is entertaining with some funny scenes.",Hustlers
607,shekotun-16436,Sin glorified,2,9 February 2020,"Disgusting.Prostitutes and crime glorified. The main idea is: we are so beautiful and cool that we can anything including crime, and get off with that. Clear message to the new generation of -censored- prostitutes and -censored- criminals.When she was forced to -censored- pet -censored- client's one eyed snake for 60$ instead of 300$ (because of crisis) I cried from pity to a poor little -censored-.the financial crimes of their clients do not justify stealing and poisoning they did.",Hustlers
608,akinbolabolutife,Definitely not worth the hype,4,23 January 2020,"The movie does not have a defined story line, no suspense or anything to look forward to. It was just not worth the time.",Hustlers
609,ramtintav,Lopez,10,7 September 2019,"Lopez Is Amazing. Her acting is 10/10. The others are amazing aswell
Brilliant acting all around. But I understand this is not for everyone. The story is a bit all over the place but it pulls it off amazingly",Hustlers
610,soltankeyvan,I give the rate of 10 by myself.,10,27 November 2019,I feel a kind of companionship with this title and the whole movie. It was great.,Hustlers
611,blablainsertnamehere,Why do people think this is more morally objectionable than Joker??,8,14 October 2019,"Some people seem to have this idea in their mind that this movie is pushing the message that women drugging men and stealing from them is a non-issue, or that it's somehow ""empowering"" for them to do so. Did we watch the same movie? Hustlers is about desperate people who have been used and abused all their lives, who have tried to make it within the system but get rejected and have to make a living stripping for entitled rich clients. Eventually they're fed up and get back at them. Do they do that in the right way? No! Their hustle is illegal, morally objectionable and at best flawed. But the goal of the movie is not to glorify this, but rather show that people who are desperate enough will do almost anything to succeed. There were definitely issues with this movie, but the message wasn't one of them, because it has nothing to do with glorifying their crimes. Did you miss the part where they get indicted by the end?The real issues in this movie lies in its pacing, it's underuse of side characters and the overuse of montages in every story arch, but those flaws are not enough to make it unwatchable. It's an enjoyable movie with certain flaws. Not Oscar material, but certainly not Razzie worthy either.",Hustlers
612,yigitipek-70759,Big surprise,10,16 September 2019,"The movie was good and that is why i am still surprised lol. And yes, jlo was good too...",Hustlers

614,quinon,Great Movie,9,18 September 2019,"I enjoyed the movie very much, the story was emotional and the way it was filmed felt like I was back in 2007.
