0,TheLittleSongbird,More than well worth tracking down,9,9 September 2017,"Having been responsible for writing 'Sicario', directed by Denis Villeneuve, and 'Hell or High Water', directed by David McKenzie, Taylor Sheridan's directorial debut 'Wind River' was seen with great interest and high expectations. Mainly to see how Sheridan would fare as a director, showing himself as a great writer for those two mentioned films.And what a directorial debut 'Wind River' is. Sheridan proves himself to be the completely right director for the job and be as good a director as he is a writer, handling the tension, disturbing creepiness and pathos with a near-perfect balance and despite being a slow-burner 'Wind River' is mostly compelling and rarely dull. There have been a number of directorial debuts this year, Sheridan's to me is one of the best in one of the stronger films released so far this year.'Wind River' does have a couple of drawbacks. It does drag at times in the middle act as a result of being bogged down by having a little too much talk, and the philosophical elements are a little patronisingly heavy-handed. On the most part however, 'Wind River' is impeccably made, directed and acted, highly atmospheric and well balanced in tone. Of the films seen so far of all the films released last week in my country, 'Wind River' is in the top four along with 'God's Own Country', 'The Farthest' and 'IT'.Visually, 'Wind River' is impeccable. The scenery is stunning yet atmospherically desolate, accompanied by some of the most beautiful cinematography of the year so far. The music score is suitably haunting but not in an overt way.Despite being imperfect, occasionally being a little too talky and not faring so well in the philosophising, the script is intelligent, thought-provoking and understated. The story has suspenseful tension, poignant pathos and at times chillingly disturbing while also being an effective slow-burner and rich in atmosphere. It does get off to a great start, still engages but meanders slightly in the pacing in the middle and then goes with all guns blazing in an electrifying climax.Characters are well realised and interesting, while the acting is superb. Jeremy Renner gives one of his greatest performances in a role that stretches him but he shows no signs of being challenged. Elizabeth Olsen has also never been better, being responsible for one of the most convincing portrayals of an FBI agent since Jodie Foster's Clarice Starling in 'The Silence of the Lambs'. The supporting cast are more than up to their level, especially a heart-breaking Gil Birmingham.In conclusion, 'Wind River' is more than well worth tracking down, for those who loves this sort of film it's a must albeit it won't work for anybody. 9/10 Bethany Cox",Wind River
1,Leofwine_draca,A real slow-burner,6,1 December 2018,"WIND RIVER is a slow-burning detective mystery featuring a couple of interesting actors as the leads and a plot set on a Native American reservation in snowy Wyoming. It harks back to earlier American thrillers such as FARGO, but the main inspiration seems to be Scandi-noir here, with intense white-outs and an investigation that plays out as slowly as possible. The good news is that Elizabeth Olsen and Jeremy Renner are old hands by now and they carry the film very well with good depth of characterisation and the like. The mystery is a little too slight for my liking, although doubtlessly important and more relevant to our times than ever. The best scene is a late-on flashback in which Jon Bernthal proves electrifying (as usual) in his one-scene cameo.",Wind River
2,SnoopyStyle,brutal crime drama,8,21 November 2017,"Cory Lambert (Jeremy Renner) is a hunter working for Fish and Wildlife Service. He is brought in to Wind River Reservation to hunt down an animal in the mountains of Wyoming and discovers the frozen body of a dead local girl. Ben (Graham Greene) is the tribal police chief. New FBI agent Jane Banner (Elizabeth Olsen) arrives to investigate the case. She faces jurisdictional conflicts and cultural intransigence.This is very much in the tradition of In Cold Blood. The characters are well-drawn. There is a sense of place. The violence is brutal. The shootouts are shocking, abrupt, visceral, and intense. There isn't much of a mystery. It's more about a straight forward investigation. The scene with Cory confessing his lost to Jane is something different. Although I appreciated it, Jane getting the information from his wife would be more compelling in the traditional sense. Jane would know something about Cory without him knowing about it. When the perp is on the run and sees the porcupine, I fully expected the mountain lion to jump him from behind. There is a poetry to what Cory does to him. This is a brutal and effective crime drama.",Wind River
3,Horst_In_Translation,"My expectations were high, but they still got exceeded",8,3 March 2018,"Here we have ""Wind River"", a new American movie that finally made it to German theaters too, and this is the most recent work by writer and director Taylor Sheridan, who to me proves that he is right up there with the best as this is certainly one of 2017's finest film achievements. After his success with ""Hell or High Water"", he creates something even better here, even if this one is not getting as much awards attention. But don't be distracted by that, it's an excellent film. It's set in the snowy isolated Indian territories of Wyoming where a young woman is murdered and her brother and his drug-addicted gang members as well as the workers on an oil rig may be connected to said murder. The moment you find out what happened exactly is the very best part of the film in my opinion. And one of the best film scenes in 2017 in general as tragic as it may be. Or because of how tragic it was. And as I am a huge Jeremy Renner fan, that means quite something because these scenes are the only ones he isn't in. He still reminds me a bit of a big screen version of Timothy Oliphant. Anyway, Renner is good here, has some pretty decent material to work with, probably more than Olsen who is more about the contrast between city girl and the region she is forced to work in now. In a bad movie, the case about Renner's character's daughter would have been solved too out of nowhere and the two protagonists would have gotten visibly together as a couple, but luckily Sheridan decided to go for harsh realism instead. Realism that fits the region where this 105-minute movie is set. This is not a winter wonderland. It is bleak and cold surroundings that you really would want to get away from as fast as you can.The film will have you at the edge of your seat for a long time I'm sure just like it had me. It's as violent as it needs to be, so if you are easily offended by gruesome bloody scenes, then you should avoid it, even if you are missing out on a great experience this way. Be warned that innocent are gonna die. The only sequence I was not too fond of was the first escalation at the rig where everybody was pointing their guns at everybody as this came as much out of nowhere as it felt a bit exaggerated. But everything afterward and before is top-notch like, in terms of afterward, the moment the film moves back to the tragic events when we look into the trailer and enter the door. Renner and Olsen had pretty good chemistry and like with them and everybody else I never had the impression I was watching actors, but actual characters. They became what their surroundings made of them. Oh yeah, and Renner really has some pretty badass moments too towards the end, even if he pulls off the more serious moments effortlessly too and I am talking of course about the grieving father parts here. The film reminded me a bit of Sicario at times and overall I think this is one of the best crime thrillers of 2017, maybe even the likeliest contender for the top prize. I highly highly recommend checking it out. A must-see for everybody who likes the genre and Sheridan proves to the world that he is not just an incredibly fine screen writer, but also has all it takes to deliver top-notch material from the directing perspective. Shame it took him so long to get going in these fields away from acting. I smell many Oscar nominations in the future, Oscar nominations that for this film he has been unjustly denied. Watch it.",Wind River
4,Prismark10,Wind River,6,7 March 2020,Wind River is a cold thriller set in and around a Native Indian reservation. The snowy and the cold temperatures is essentially the protagonist in this movie.Cory Lambert (Jeremy Renner) is a hunter in the mountains of Wyoming who has discovered a dead body of a teenage tribal girl.Rookie FBI agent Jane Banner (Elizabeth Olsen) arrives to investigate the case. However the medical examiner cannot label the case as a homicide. It was the subzero temperatures that killed her.Lambert helps out Banner's investigations. He knows the landscape and the people. The dead girl was a friend of his own daughter who also died in suspicious circumstances several years earlier.There is an underlying gloom to this movie. Everyone feels lost or displaced even Banner who arrives without the right clothes for the environment she is in. The reservation police chief (Graham Greene) adds some droll humour. The film has a message about Native Indian women who end up missing each year. However it ends as a moody visceral violent revenge film.,Wind River
5,nogodnomasters,This isn't the land of back-up. This is the land of you are on your own.,8,18 September 2017,"Cory (Jeremy Renner) is a hunter tracker who works on the Wind River reservation. When is discovers a dead body, he suspects foul play and the FBI is called in. They send Jane Banner (Elizabeth Olsen) who is green and new to working in the great outdoors. She enlists the help of Cory who has experienced a similar loss of a teen daughter.While the mystery is light due to the lack of suspects, the main entertainment of the film is how two polar opposites work together to solve a crime. The film is a crime drama with good performances. A little faster moving than ""Winter's Bone."" Guide: F-word. Implied sex. Brief rape. No nudity.",Wind River
6,kosmasp,Cold as Ice,9,2 April 2018,"Maybe even colder. But one thing is for sure: A slow story telling and one that does not care for a romance between its leads. Other movies might have tried to pair up the two character, but I think this works better this way. There is chemistry don't get me wrong and both play well off each other. But don't expect anything flashy or great happening ... well not the whole time.The pacing is key, so when something happens it appears bigger. Be it a chase or a possible stunt/action scene. This is about unraveling a story and finding the truth - but more about a certain seed that is planted that will get exploited later on in the movie. I won't say what, but it's fair to say that it will leave a mark. As does the movie - it does reward those with patience. Very fine acting and a nuanced story ...",Wind River
7,Sleepin_Dragon,Engrossing and dramatic.,9,8 April 2019,"This is a truly gripping, engaging and dramatic film. The first thing anyone will be aware of, is the quality of the production values, it is superbly made, gloriously acted, and meticulously filmed. A very classy production indeed.You have to credit the sheer quality of the source material, a wonderful and sad plot, with plenty of twists and turns. Murder mystery fans will enjoy, thriller fans will also enjoy.There are some truly big moments, one that will make you empathise with the victim's family, one that will leave you with your mouth open, as a big fight occurs.So impressed by this movie. 9/10",Wind River
8,classicsoncall,"""How do you guage someone's will to live?""",8,27 October 2021,"Jumping right in, one of the things I liked best about this picture was Jane Banner (Elizabeth Olsen) in the uncharacteristic position of an FBI agent who didn't come on like a know-it-all and demanding everyone else follow her lead in the investigation of the rape and murder of Natalie Hanson (Kelsey Asbille). She deferred to Cory Lambert (Jeremy Renner), who knew the territory and the locals, and wasn't afraid to ask for his help. At the same time, she showed remarkable courage during the showdown at the trailer between the local authorities and the work crew out at Matt's (Jon Bernthal) trailer. I thought she defined a classic example of a strong, independent woman who wisely put to use the resources she had to effectively do her job.This was a compelling murder mystery set in the stark landscape of a Wyoming winter, with sub-zero temperatures and personalities affected by the harsh environment. Some effective misdirection is utilized to steer the viewer one way, which is then negated by a flashback scene inserted quite abruptly into the picture that reveals what happened to Natalie and her boyfriend. From there it becomes a tense thriller as Lambert tracks down the last man standing (I should say limping) who initiated the deadly turn of events. With Lambert's earlier promise to the dead Natalie's father (Gil Birmingham) that swift vengeance would be exercised, one's anticipation turns to how Lambert will deal with the low life Pete Mickens (James Jordan). I have to say, it was a creative way of dealing with the rapist and murderer, but all the while I kept wondering - where were those mountain lions when you needed them?",Wind River
9,lee_eisenberg,a lot will happen in a bleak setting,9,2 January 2018,"Taylor Sheridan's ""Wind River"" is essentially two stories in one. The main plot is the murder investigated by Jeremy Renner's US Fish & Wildlife Service agent and Elizabeth Olsen's FBI agent. Since the murder has taken place on an Indian reservation - the Wind River Reservation referenced in the movie's title - the issue arises of whose responsibility it is to investigate. Renner and Olsen press forward with the investigation, and there's a lot to discover. The other plot is a focus on the status of people living on the reservation. The Indians are a minority in their own land, and are now relegated to dismal, isolated pieces of land with living conditions often comparable to the third world (not to mention high levels of alcoholism). Indeed, one of the movies addressed by the movie is the murders and disappearances of women on the reservations.I guess that my one complaint about the movie is Olsen's character. We get to learn about Renner's character's background, but not about hers. I would've liked to hear more about why she chose the field that she did. Other than that, I found it to be a fine movie. I recommend it, and I'm eager to see Sheridan's next movie.",Wind River
10,Quinoa1984,"the best movie of its kind since Insomnia: a snow-bound tale of murder, dread and existential horrors",8,25 August 2017,"With Wind River, I'll get a nitpick out of the way first, There's in Wind River a mournful score (by none other than Nick Cave with Warren Ellis), and it gives scenes that would otherwise have a stock tone to them a sense of tragedy that isn't laying it on thick but is there and one you can feel in your bones, like being out there in the sort of cold that would give Marquis Warren in Hateful Eight some pause. The nitpick is with the voice in the score, this whispery male voice that is saying things as Jeremy Renner trudges through the snow or a character goes through a mysterious part of the woods. What is that? Why is he doing that? I feel like a grump for even bringing it up, but it took me out of the movie.OK, what is this movie? Wind River is another Taylor Sheridan script, a man who has cut a' real figure in recent cinema making violent, brutal films with the sort of brutality that is about how people can be just awful creatures, and we all know it but somehow get subsumed in it. Wind River probably shares more of a kinship with Sicario, Sheridan's first produced script (here he directs for the first time), as it's almost as much about the setting and how it contributes to the discomfort.Actually both movies also have a woman who *is* already a tough cookie and can do her job well (to the point where one should feel foolish even trying to equate her to a man, as if she's not good enough, and both Blunt and Olsen make these women such), while around men who have been shaped by the world around them... Come to think of it, there's also a male protagonist who has lost his family and has transformed him over time into something much harder. I could probably go on and on with the comparisons, including the unforgiving nature of the whole culture.But while del Toro in Sicario was lost forever to his darkness, Renner's Cory is someone who still does have family - we see him with his son, still doing his best, though separated from his wife now (why this is is... one of those movie things, I can buy it, more due to the mother's pain as they both lost a daughter to some tragic circumstances) - and he has another job as a tracker. But that pain is always there, and internalized in a different way. He can be scary, but it's not in his immediate nature; he is a good person, but has been shaped by so much around him and has had to adapt. The girl in the middle of the plot of this story who is found dead, frozen, miles from the nearest place she could have been from (it's the sort of mystery that really isn't, and we know that, and it makes it sadder), has a father and of course he is devastated. When Cory offers up his consolation, it's genuine, and how Sheridan writes in and Renner plays it has all of the pain but grudging knowledge of what comes with... time.Like Pine in 'High Water' last year, it's easy to take certain actors for granted - it's been a long time (maybe since The Hurt Locker? probably not Bourne Legacy I'd bet) that Renner has had any character to play that's challenged him, much less as a lead, and he sinks his actory teeth into this completely. He has Olsen to play off of too, and she does well, but the framing is really from his point of view; some may find more identification with her, as the one who is not from such a place as Wyoming. I found myself totally in Renner's point of view, and it made it a richer experience because of how every moment has a simplicity and truth to it. One of the pleasures of seeing movies for, well, grown ups that Hollywood does(ish) in a genre is to see actors not just getting to but allowed to show all the complexity they're capable of. I'll remember those scenes where Renner gets to really shine as the awesome actor he is (i.e. when he tells about his daughter to Olsen), but it's the quieter scenes that are tougher and that he does so well.This isn't a pleasant experience inasmuch that you'll leave feeling elated or something. What makes Wind River stick out as being a very good film is that Sheridan isn't ostentatious about it. He has confidence in showing us all of this out-in-the-middle-of-nowhere-ness and we get it, and he even finds quality in those scenes with characters that are only there so briefly (Jon Bernthal does pop up, but I won't tell you when or what his role is, for example). My favorite is the dead girl's brother, who is about the same age as her and a waste of life drug addict. But Sheridan does the work, even in several minutes of screen time, to get us to understand who he is, why he's come to this place, and that he's not very sympathetic (Renner's Cory helps make this clear). I don't even remember the actor's name, and he'll stay with me for a long time with that scene in the car at night. Sheridan's setting may seem or just be obvious as was the Mexican one - heat is oppressive and so is the cold, and, as we see, it can kill if one is not careful - but he stays true to what he's after, and when he goes into the dark parts of the human experience, it feels earned. If he's not quite to where Villeneuve is yet, he will be soon.Just, you know, tell Nick Cave to cut out that voice s***.",Wind River
11,george.schmidt,One of the year's best films worth seeking out.,10,23 August 2017,"WIND RIVER (2017) **** Jeremy Renner, Elizabeth Olsen, Graham Greene, Jon Bernthal, Julia Jones, Teo Briones, Kelsey Asbille, Tantoo Cardinal, Gil Brimingham. Well-executed slow burner about a murder on a Native American reservation investigated by a rookie FBI agent (Olsen) and a game tracker (Renner in one of his best roles) who find there is more than meets the eye. Filmmaker Taylor Sheridan (in his directorial debut) delivers a taut, intriguing screenplay as the plot unravels with noir precision and canny supporting roles including Greene as a world-weary police chief and Bernthal as a worker whose introduction is shrewdly conceived.

12,neil-476,Brutal sobering drama with facrual overtones,9,16 August 2020,"A rookie FBI agent enlists a wildlife tracker to help solve a murder on a native American reservation.Writer/director Taylor Sheridan brings to life a tale which illustrates a forgotten class of people - missing native American women, the only group for whom no records are kept. Worse, any investigation into such cases is hobbled by jurisdictional uncertainties and wrangles. This underlies a story which is brutal and very emotional. JeremyvRenner and Elizabeth Olsen star, but everyone in it is quite excellent.I was grimly enterta8ned, but also appalled.",Wind River
13,evanston_dad,Enough with the Vigilante Movies,5,19 December 2017,"Last year Taylor Sheridan wrote the screenplay to ""Hell or High Water,"" a rural thriller that asked us to feel pity for the poor and working class folks wasting away in America's dying towns. I might have felt the pity Sheridan asked me to, had the film not been full of a bunch of hot-headed white men with guns and itchy trigger fingers, who take justice into their own hands with a macho Texan swagger that Sheridan was all too clearly proud of without a hint of irony (not to mention compunction about the current state of gun violence in America).This year, he's both written and directed ""Wind River,"" another gloomy rural thriller, this one set in Wyoming. Yet again, we're given a white male who goes vigilante in order to seek vengeance on a bunch of horror show redneck goons. He has to, you see, because the only people helping him are a couple of inept Native American police officers and a white female FBI agent who's thoroughly incompetent because she's from -- GASP!! -- the city. In Sheridan's world, apparently, people who live in cities are pampered and worthless and don't know how to do pretty much anything, and it's only the tough country folk who know how to get the job done. You could cut the condescension with a knife.I don't expect artists necessarily to compromise their visions in order to contribute productively to a given cultural conversation, but it would be nice if they at least engaged in it. In our current cultural climate, with the very serious division between urban and rural populations of America that has experts talking somewhat seriously about the possibility of a new kind of civil war, a movie like ""Wind River"" feels not only facile, but also rather irresponsible. With the rampant stereotypes being thrown every which way about various populations of America, and the gun problem, and the rise of militia groups with vigilante attitudes, do we really need a movie like this?Oh, and at the very end, Sheridan throws in some facts about the prevalence of Native American women who end up as missing persons, and tries to turn what has been a white boy's revenge fantasy into a public service message. Nice try.Grade: C",Wind River
14,ferguson-6,"good, bad and snow",7,14 August 2017,"Greetings again from the darkness. With his two most recent screenplays, Sicario (2015) and the Oscar nominated Hell or High Water (2016), Taylor Sheridan seemed acutely attuned to the fine line between right and wrong, and the twisted complexity of new age American values when contrasted with ""old school"". This time out, he both writes and directs. The themes remain familiar while the landscape shifts to the frozen tundra of Wyoming.We first meet Fish & Wildlife Service tracker/hunter Cory (Jeremy Renner) as he picks off (with a long range rifle) a pack of wolves that is methodically encircling goats on a ranch. A very similar type situation plays out later in the film  only with humans in place of wolves and sheep. Not long after dispensing with the wolves, Cory stumbles upon the barefoot corpse of a young girl he recognizes as the former best friend of his daughter. Her frost-bitten bare feet visible, face buried in the snow, bleeding from an apparent assault, and miles from the nearest house or dwelling, the girl's corpse is telling a story that Cory knows requires the immediate attention of law enforcement.Ben, the Native American Reservation Police Chief (Graham Greene) has jurisdiction unless the Medical Examiner rules it a homicide. In the meantime, FBI Agent Jane Banner (Elizabeth Olsen) shows up dressed more for winter in her native Florida than the brutally cold Wyoming plains. Jane quickly proves she is no ordinary ""fish out of water"" (even if she lacks experience for such a case), and commissions Cory to help her out with the local people and land.The film has many ties to the fine TV series ""Longmire"", and though Mr. Renner and Ms. Olsen are well known in the Marvel Universe as Hawkeye and Scarlet Witch, there are no superheroes present here – just a convoluted society within a seemingly forgotten (or at least) ignored part of the country. It's a police procedural blanketed in the always-falling snow, an underground drug culture, and the quiet animosity between the outside world and the Reservation (where many have given up hope).These aren't people that talk much, although they say plenty. Sometimes the dialogue is a bit too obvious in Mr. Sheridan's goal of leaving no viewer behind, especially when combined with overly detailed flashback that will have the amateur sleuths in the audience feeling a bit letdown in receiving a full explanation. However, when cinematographer Ben Richardson (Beasts of the Southern Wild, The Fault in Our Stars) loses the shaky-cam from indoors, and beautifully lays out the vastness of the snow vistas, forest and mountains, the remoteness and stunning landscape becomes a character as important as any other.The supporting cast is stellar and features Julia Jones, Gil Birmingham (Jeff Bridges' partner in Hell or High Water), Jon Bernthal, Kelsey Asbille, and a crazed James Jordan. Mr. Greene adds a touch of deadpan humor and resignation to his plight, while Ms. Olsen is effective as the 'green' agent dealing with an unfamiliar white-out. Mr. Renner truly excels as the throwback cowboy carrying out his duties while bearing a burden exacerbated by this case. The crunching snow, predatory lions, and high-speed snowmobiling never cause us (or Cory) to lose sight of how important it is to know the land and the people  and walk that line between right and wrong.",Wind River
15,Wuchakk,Murder mystery on a wintery Reservation in Wyoming,8,4 March 2018,"RELEASED IN 2017 and written & directed by Taylor Sheridan, ""Wind River"" chronicles events at the remote Wind River Indian Reservation where a curiously barefooted young Native woman is found dead in the wilderness; a Fish & Wildlife tracker (Jeremy Renner) and an FBI agent (Elizabeth Olsen) team-up to solve the mystery. Graham Greene plays the Reservation police chief, Gil Birmingham appears as the victim's grieving father and Jon Bernthal & James Jordan are on hand as security guards at a drill site. There are several others. The film is based on hundreds of actual stories similar to it. The issue of assault against Native women on Reservations, many mysteriously disappearing, has existed since the inception of the Reservation system, but in the past 15-20 years it has exploded and yet gets no attention, which was the motivation for the film. In ages past the tribes (e.g. Eastern Shoshone and Northern Arapaho) would migrate out of the area during the unrelenting winters, but the Reservation system basically forces the tribespeople to permanently stay where people weren't meant to live year round (or so it is argued).This is a straight-forward crime drama/murder mystery/thriller taking place completely in wintery conditions in the remote modern American West. The story starts kind of dull, but interest slowly builds until everything eventually explodes in the second half. If you like stories where the clues slowly lead to the culprit/culprits you'll probably like this movie. Renner is a quality taciturn Westerner and likable Olsen with her cutie face & figure is strong on the female front. The action scenes are effective because they're sudden & realistic and not over-the-top cartoonish. THE MOVIE RUNS 1 hour 47 minutes and was shot in Utah (Coalville and Park City Studios) and Wyoming (Wind River Reservation, Fremont County and Lander). GRADE: A-",Wind River
16,mm-39,Reason I go out to the theater instead of watching T V,8,28 August 2017,"Wind River is the reason I go out to the theater instead of watching T V. What I hate about T V Wind River avoids. Instead of 2 d characters, there is a developed story here not another overly too tough Jodi Foster F B I lead, the usual evil bad guys, and the happy face, likable over heroic Sheriff with the over preachy social message. Instead Wind River unfolds a story of what really happened. The film is set on and around a reservation in Wyoming.

A dead woman, a murder and characters trying to scrape by melds into a story. Kelsey Asbille's character is a fish out of water F B I agent who needs Jeremy Renner's, a fish and game officer's help.

17,deloudelouvain,Good mystery thriller,7,19 January 2018,"Wind River is a good mystery thriller about the murder of a woman in an Indian reservation in Wyoming. There's a lot of snow what gives beautiful scenery shots. There are enough intrigues to make this movie interesting to follow. The cast was good even though I would have chosen somebody else than Jeremy Renner to play his character as the hunter. Not that he is a bad actor or so, I just don't see him as the though guy hunting in those bad circumstances. He just looks to polished for that role. The FBI agent played by Elizabeth Olsen was good. In fact the whole cast was good. If you like mystery movies where you have to wait until the end to find answers then you're good with Wind River.",Wind River
18,namashi_1,Absorbing & Atmospheric!,7,25 October 2017,"Written & Directed by Taylor Sheridan, 'Wind River' is an absorbing & atmospheric Neo-Western Murder-Mystery Thriller Film, that works due to its strong making & solid performances. It may not be perfect, but it weighs higher on pluses way more than on minuses.'Wind River' Synopsis: A veteran tracker with the Fish and Wildlife Service helps to investigate the murder of a young Native American woman, and uses the case as a means of seeking redemption for an earlier act of irresponsibility which ended in tragedy.'Wind River' grippingly unfolds a brutal murder & how the people in charge get to the culprits. Cory Lambert, the protagonist (Jeremy Renner) is a man who's dealing with his own demons & gets a shot at redemption when this brutal murder occurs. The lady in command, Jane Banner (Elizabeth Olsen) is a complete contrast to Cory, a rookie FBI special agent, who teams up with a man who's confronting way too many battles to get into another. And its the diversity & the connection of these 2 characters that make 'Wind River' all the more interesting. And Taylor Sheridan's Screenplay intelligently intertwines the extreme gap of its leading characters in a world of brutality & crime. The Writing builds up slowly, but never loses the momentum. What works more so for the Writing is the consistently serious tone, that never changes gear for the sake of cheap thrills.Sheridan's Direction, too, is competent. Ben Richardson's Cinematography stunningly captures the wilderness as well as the brutality. Gary D. Roach's Editing is sharp. Art & Costume Design are authentic. Action-Sequences are nicely choreographed, but are too violent. Performance-Wise: Renner & Olsen do some of their best work here. Renner, a splendid actor, portrays the guilt-sickened protagonist with genuine heartache & also flexes machismo when required. Olsen is beautifully restrained & proves her mettle as a performer. Others lend remarkable support.On the whole, 'Wind River' is moody, chilling & engrossing. Don't miss this one.",Wind River

20,sddavis63,A Strangely Gentle But Powerful Movie Combining Sadness With A Sense Of Spirituality,8,9 September 2018,"""Wind River"" has only a few fleeting moments of high drama or excitement (most of them packed into a handful of scenes perhaps three quarters of the way through the film.) Basically it's a slow-paced but well-paced movie that builds towards its ultimate resolution. And there's a sense of sadness hanging over the whole thing; a reflection on past trauma; maybe some hope of being able to move forward. It's the story of the rape and murder of a young woman on an Indian reservation in Wyoming. Her body is found by a Fish and Game officer (Cory, played by Jeremy Renner.) The tribal police, led by their chief (played by Graham Greene) get involved but they're undermanned and so a young FBI agent (Jane, played by Elizabeth Olsen) is sent to lead the investigation. She's in over her head. She doesn't know reservations or Wyoming or blizzards or any of the things she'll be dealing with. That's part of the sadness. She's all that the FBI could be bothered to send for this kind of case. But she does care. She and Cory team up to find the rapist/killer. Cory's dealing with his own past - the death of his own daughter and a broken marriage to her mother, a native woman.) I thought the pacing of this was wonderful. It starts with a jolt that lasts only a minute or so and then settles down into a slow and deliberate build-up as the investigation continues. What actually happened to Natalie (the young woman who was killed) came as a surprise to me. The story leads in one direction, and then takes a sudden left turn, and then the revelation of the killer and his ultimate fate at the hands of Cory settles back into a slow and deliberate final few scenes. There's almost a sense of spirituality about this movie, I thought. It was engrossing. The wind swept and snow covered landscapes of Wyoming added to that. For a movie about a rape and murder, it was a very quiet and reflective story. When you add on to the core of the story the reflections that are contained about the harsh realities of life on the reservation, the uncaring attitude of the authorities toward natives, the loss of native culture - it was very powerful, all leading up to the closing captions which tell us that no one even bothers to keep any statistics about missing Native American women. It should make all non-Natives wonder why we're so uncaring.This is an American movie, but I think it's a very relevant and powerful movie for Canadians to watch. We have our own baggage with horrible reservation conditions and the now well-known issue of ""Missing And Murdered Indigenous Women."" I'm not sure you can watch this movie and not be stricken with a sense of horror and guilt about the conditions and attitudes Native Americans (and Native Canadians) are forced to endure. This is highly recommended watching. (8/10)",Wind River
21,Hellmant,I got pretty teary eyed multiple times throughout the film.,9,30 August 2017,"'WIND RIVER': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)The new crime-thriller from acclaimed screenwriter Taylor Sheridan; who also wrote 2015's 'SICARIO' and 2016's 'HELL OR HIGH WATER'. Sheridan also directed the film, in his sophomore directorial effort (following the 2011 horror flick 'VILE'). The movie stars Jeremy Renner and Elizabeth Olson (Hawkeye and Scarlet Witch together again) as a US Fish and Wildlife Service agent, and an FBI rookie, trying to solve a murder on the Wind River Indian Reservation in Wyoming. The movie has received nearly unanimous positive reviews from critics (like Sheridan's other two screen writing efforts), and it's also been a success in it's limited theatrical run at the Box Office so far (also like Sheridan's other recent movies). I found it to be pretty dang good. Cory Lambert (Renner) is a US Fish and Wildlife Service agent who's currently investigating the killing of livestock at the Wind River Indian Reservation in Wyoming. While trying to find the den of the suspected lions involved, Lambert comes across the body of an 18- year-old female resident. The FBI sends a rookie agent, named Jane Banner (Olson), to lead the Tribal Police there in their investigation. Due to Lambert's skills at tracking in the area, Banner asks him to assist them as well. Their efforts soon lead them to some very dark, and brutal places. Places that Lambert is very familiar with, having also lost a daughter there (the same age) in a similar way. The movie starts out a little slow, in my opinion, and then it keeps picking up pace, until a very intense and dramatic conclusion. The climax is definitely my favorite part of the film, but it's also very dark and violent (and you have to have some patience to get to it). The character development, and performances, are both excellent though (Renner is always good outside of Marvel movies, I think). I got pretty teary eyed multiple times throughout the film as well. It's another near masterpiece from Sheridan, in my opinion, and he proves himself as a very talented director here too.Watch an episode of our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/j_XDrmlMJNY",Wind River
22,thesar-2,Hawkeye Hunts Again,9,3 September 2018,"But the Witch ain't be witchin'.I typed in the simple search: Best Westerns on Netflix. Signs this list is corrupt, or gulp!, 45 is right about Google, recommendation #6 was Adam Sandler's atrocious The Ridiculous 6. But, mercifully, #7 was this movie and they were right with this one!When I was a kid, I *HATED* Westerns. In the 90s, as I grew, that changed, but only a hand-selected few, like Unforgiven and Dances With Wolves, two of my favorite Westerns and all-time movies. As I got much older, I really started to dig the genre and especially the subgenre: the neo-western, or modern western(?) like No Country for Old Men and Hell or High Water. Frankly, I like both versions equally and a lot: the ones set in the olden days and the modern westerns with all the tropes still in place today.This film, is the latter group, unbeknownst to me and it did NOT disappoint.Hunter Hawkeye, well, Veteran Hunter, Cory, returns to his ex-wife's reservation to find/kill lions. Instead, he's thrust into a conspiracy involving a rape, murders, hush people and a lone FBI agent way out of her league. This movie is beautiful, enormously well-acted, awesomely scripted and though slow at times, it kept me on the edge of my seat. This setting isn't too far from Fargo, but you'll get the same vibes at times.I've been a fan of Jeremy Renner for about two decades and when I saw he was in this, I worried he would be a distraction. Like I'd ONLY see ""Jeremy Renner"" and not Sheriff Joe or whomever he played. NOPE...he was wonderful in this and I totally bought him and the rest of the cast. Well, maybe not so much FBI Agent and fellow Avenger, Elizabeth Olsen. She was such a fish-outta-water, she never did it for me with the other perfectly casted actors.Don't get me wrong. This is a near-perfect film and I adored every minute of it. Helps, I love, again, Modern Westerns, and the snow - you'll feel every bit of the snow here. HIGHLY recommended and I can't wait to see this again.***Final thoughts: THAT ALL SAID...I'm beginning to think they have a database of cowboy/country/western/location names to choose from when creating a Western movie. This movie had almost zero to do with Wind, Rivers or the actual Wind River place I'm not even sure if we saw.",Wind River
23,FeastMode,my notes,6,24 July 2019,I give this an unsatisfied 6 star rating. this movie is very well made. it is also very slow and kind of a downer. the entertainment factor is very low. but great acting. reminds me a lot of prisoners (1 viewing),Wind River
24,Robert_duder,Would stand solidly behind the words ... and the Oscar Goes to ...,8,24 September 2017,"Best movie of 2017? Maybe. At least the second best in my opinion (see Wonder Woman review) and perhaps a bit of a surprise for me. I love catching an indie flick by chance and being blown away by it. A great crime drama is something of a masterpiece when done correctly. I can think of many over the years that have stayed with me because of the character driven, setting inspired, but real feeling stories and that's what drives home with Wind River. It is character driven, it is absolutely setting inspired and feels incredibly real. I saw Hell Or High Water and enjoyed it but it didn't have the same impact as Wind River. This film is disturbing, visceral, captivating and the characters are subtle but very easy to relate to. I haven't seen Sicario but I've heard good things. Wind River is slow burning but super powerful. It gives a back story that links the characters to the current situation and then builds a mystery and a climax. There are a few mis-steps in how the film unravels but I was still riveted by everything. A film like this relies on tension and atmosphere and the director puts you in the middle of both. It also easily builds back story so that you understand the characters without spending a lot of time dwelling on them. The cast does such a great job because the chemistry between them is so strong. I'm never sure whether or not I like Jeremy Renner but over time he's growing on me in the Marvel Universe. But I was really glad to see him sinking his teeth into something more gritty and real here. Granted he still is playing the lone sulking brooding type of character that Hawkeye is but he does it well and he cares the film like a star should. Elizabeth Olsen also returns to full form as the FBI Agent who is solely unprepared for the case. Olsen and Renner are good together and I like that it's not a sexual/romantic relationship but strictly a partnership. Olsen's character is tough and strong and I like that a lot. Graham Greene has a great role and good chemistry with Renner too but his character's progression and eventual climax is poor at best. They use him very well as a supporting character and then completely waste him in the end. Hugh Dillon, Kelsey Asbille, Ian Bohen, and Jon Bernthal all have strong supporting roles that really bring the story together and put you in the middle of this community reeling from personal problems and crime.This is definitely director Taylor Sheridan's best in my opinion. The style and direction is very good. It might even trump the cast's performance. If you look at the way the movie is filmed you can't help but be impressed. Considering the entire film is this bleak, white wasteland with not a lot to go on, he makes it come to life. Renner's employment as a hunter and knowing the wilderness and tracking predators. The close ups of certain character's faces and the wide-shots of the outdoors and what they're up against. The far shots as though you're often looking through a scope...these are things that would really catch a critic's eye. But regardless if you like a slow burning thriller, this one is great and it gets under your skin and stays with you which is why I think this is one of the best indie films of 2017 and I hope to see them pop up somewhere at the Oscars as unlikely as it is. 8.5/10",Wind River
25,wellthatswhatithinkanyway,Sadly undelivering thriller which fails to make the most of its potential,4,25 February 2018,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningA young woman is found dead in a snowy enclave in a Native American reservation. Completely isolated and cut off from the outside world, it falls to embittered local game tracker Cory Lambert (Jeremy Renner) and FBI agent Jane Banner (Elizabeth Olsen) to get to the bottom of the case. However, as professional tensions between the locals and the national agents, as well as the wall of silence that seems to build around the residents, intensifies, it proves to be more difficult than a standard hunt.A good several years after his feature length 2011 debut, Taylor Sheridan returns to the helm with this moody, atmospheric thriller, based around true events. Diving into the heart of the reclusive, insular Native American reservations, we enter a snow-covered, out of bounds netherworld, that in itself sets the scene for an effective backdrop on which to set a brooding, suspenseful thriller. What we end up with is a film that plays doggedly to conventions, although unfortunately in a fairly generic, standard way, that squanders its chance to make the most of its potential.Truth quite often tends to make for more compelling filmmaking than fiction, and so WR had even more chance to make the most of what it promised. Sadly, it just plays out like a connect the dots affair, obeying all the genre conventions despite having more opportunity than most to delve beyond these. It has the look and feel of your average TV movie, despite its A list Hollywood stars, and to about that level of quality. Somehow, no genuine air of suspense or tension is created in regards finding out what caused the dead girl's fate, and so the core of the film is unfortunately rotted.Performances wise, lead stars Renner and Olsen suit their roles, and fit into their skin better than any other performers who spring to mind. It's just a shame they didn't have more satisfying material to work with. **",Wind River
26,Pjtaylor-96-138044,"Much more emotional than expected; it's impressive, captivating and affecting work.",8,1 March 2018,"'Wind River (2017)' is a much more emotional experience than pictures of the kind usually are, with time taken to ensure we empathise both with the family of the victim and with the investigators themselves rather than get caught up with the nuts-and-bolts calculation of detective work. The feature takes great care to handle its central theme of loss with an honest maturity that feels at times genuinely poignant and almost objectively true. Though the mystery aspects of the piece often seem to come second, they come second only to the excellent atmospheric and tonal work and the brilliantly well-realised characters. These really compound a tangible sense of place, allowing the icy chill of the snowy mountains to almost creep into your bones, and develop fully formed individuals that never take a step outside of themselves. Even if the mystery itself doesn't quite reach these heights, it is still supplemented by phenomenal peripheral elements which elevate every aspect of the piece right up until its near perfect end. It's seriously impressive, captivating and affecting work that solidifies this up-and-coming writer-director as a true talent to watch out for. 8/10",Wind River
27,bowmanblue,Like wading through heavy snow,6,14 September 2020,"I know I probably shouldn't have just watched 'Wind River' on the basis that it's - sort of - 'Hawkeye' and 'Scarlett Witch' from the Marvel universe starring together and expect something along the lines of a full-scale alien invasion of New York. However, there was a gun on the front cover, so I did expect a bit more in the way of 'action.' I was wrong.A young Native American woman in murdered on a reservation and a local hunter (Jeremy Renner) teams up with an FBI agent (Elizabeth Olsen) to solve it. If - like me - you're expecting gun-play, car chases and a non-stop thrill-ride, then you're going to be sorely disappointed.What follows is effectively the cast trudging their way around the scenic, snow-covered locations, occasionally talking to people. I know the direction is good. The scenery definitely deserves a mention and you really do get the sense of isolation in the wilderness.However, you may be thinking that if it's not a fast-paced, action-packed movie, then it's going to be a 'cat and mouse' tale of a murderer trying to stay out of the clutches of the law. But it's not - really - that either. It - kind of - gets explained about three quarters of the way through where we get a jarring lump of backstory/flashback to tell us what we're now supposed to know.Personally, I was finding it quite a hard watch - until the final act. There was a majorly-tense scene near the end which was definitely well done and I just wish the rest of the film was like that.However, it's probably worth noting that I'm clearly in the minority here. I've checked out the rest of the reviews and everyone else seems to love this film. Pity. I guess it just wasn't for me, so I guess you should take the majority's word over mine?",Wind River
28,ThomasDrufke,What a Start For Taylor Sheridan,8,19 August 2017,"Crime dramas have always been one of my favorite genres of filmmaking, especially the ones that take themselves seriously and pose interesting questions about life. Wind River takes the genre up in the cold, snowy tundra of the Wind River Indian Reservation in Wyoming. Gritty, brutal, and well-timed action, Wind River builds a simply structured crime film into an important conversation about missing persons with a great storyteller and one great cast.Coming from writing the likes of Sicario and Hell or High Water, Taylor Sheridan is really making a career for himself. It's hard to imagine it's the same guy who made those short acting cameos in Veronica Mars back in the day, but Sheridan is separating himself from the pack in terms of his writing skills. I won't say that Wind River reaches the heights that either of his other two writing efforts did, but the sheer power of the subject matter of this film may take this film into Oscar season.Jeremy Renner stars as Corey Lambert, a man with a tragic past, teams with Jane Banner (an FBI agent played by Elizabeth Olsen) to solve a murder. It's easy to label Banner as the ""out of place woman who needs the help of a hardened man"", because it can appear that way at first glance. But I'll view it as two people who cross paths with each other and end up working together to better their current situations. It also doesn't hurt that both Renner and Olsen have pre- established chemistry from the Marvel films, and dynamite together on screen.However, I do believe that Sheridan could have done a slightly better job of directing the tone of Wind River. There were times where it seemed the actors were giving endearing performances and monologues, only to be sometimes interrupted by a subtle joke or a lighthearted comment. I think that just a minor change in direction of his actors would have changed those moments for the better. With that said, Sheridan's brutal touch of action when the film calls for it is impressive to say the least. It's those moments that helps put a realistic layer to Wind River.Overall, Wind River is a grounded but moving take on murder, rape, and missing persons cases. Solid performances, sharp script, and nuanced storytelling, Wind River is a fascinating crime drama.8.0/10",Wind River
29,cricketbat,An intense and thought-provoking crime drama,8,28 December 2018,"Wind River is an intense and thought-provoking crime drama. Jeremy Renner & Elizabeth Olsen prove that they're more than just Hawkeye & Scarlet Witch while showing off some actual acting chops. And while the plot is fairly simple, Taylor Sheridan does a great job of creating an atmosphere and building tension. I look forward to seeing more work from him as a writer and director.",Wind River
30,secondtake,The last third makes the first third completely worth it.,7,19 November 2018,"Wind River (2017)The setting here will suck you in immediately-remote Wyoming, high mountains and rough uncouth men and a handful of principled good people to keep it steady. The leading man, Jeremy Renner, is superb. He plays Cory, who is strong, thoughtful, but not over the top into cliche, a fish and wildlife mountain man, of sorts. His job is to kill predators like wolves and mountain lions that are intruding on civilization. (This alone sets a one that is filled with contradictions.)
But then a murder happens (of a human being) and things get intertwined with Indians on the Rez and with an FBI agent sent to deal with the conflicint authorities (fed land, local cops, Indian land, etc.). This will seem like a huge weak point because the FBI agent comes off as a terrible stereotype we should all scream against-the incompetent blonde woman over her head. Elizabeth Olsen, unfortunately, is not even quite good at projecting that stereotype.
It somehow survives this stumble, however, and if you get past that half hour of the agent and the hero coming to work together (without any sense of impending romance, by the way), the movie grows and gets more subtle. And as Renner gets more convincing and intense, so does Olsen, as she gets roughed up emotionally and isn't as green or arrogant as she first appears when rolling up her window in the car (you'll see).
Then, to my surprise, the movie turns into a great movie. The last half hour adds lots of nuance even as it gets violent and ugly. It becomes a moving tale of resolution, dreams, mourning, the passing of tradition, the debauchery of lonely men, and the strength within some of us. Yes, maybe I overstate, but it's all there, in pieces.
A warning, perhaps. There are two violent scenes near the end. One is with guns and is quite exciting, for that kind of good guy/bad guy stuff. The other is an assault (which is implied at the very beginning) that is painful and for me not quite necessary. I see why they included it, but it could have been implied instead, or deflected a little. But for people who might find this disturbing-it is.
Expect a well made movie that builds and justifies itself by the end.",Wind River

However, my instincts were right: I found the film dreary. Not that it wasn't interesting, but the pacing was just too slow. At times I could hardly hear what some of the actors were saying, especially Jeremy Renner. Kelsey Asbille (playing FBI agent Natalie) was the only fish out of water in the harsh territory the film is set in, and she was by far the most determined and strongest character.The film also made me realize how every moment can be your last.

36,tomgillespie2002,Cements Sheridan as a director to watch,7,13 November 2017,"If you weren't already aware going into Wind River of just who is the brains behind this tough, tense and distinctly masculine drama, then it won't take very long for you to guess that it is Taylor Sheridan, the so-hot-right-now scribe behind the likes of Sicario and Hell or High Water. Rounding off his trilogy based around the American frontier, Sheridan directs for the first time here, and proves to be as equally adept with bringing his work to life as he is with penning it. To dub him the new Cormac McCarthy may be slightly condescending to the talented writer, but the comparisons are certainly there to be made. This is the world of tough, lean men doing what they have to do in order to survive or get by in their increasingly dire economic surroundings, and it's certainly a setting Sheridan feels comfortable in, or at least wishes he was part of.While Sicario placed us in the terrifying, claustrophobic choke-hold of the Mexican drug cartels and Hell or High Water delivered outlaw hi-jinks with serious social and economic undertones, Wind River is a movie of quiet, simmering tension played out against the backdrop of the freezing, desolate mountains of Wyoming. Hard times have come to the titular Indian Reservation and the surrounding areas, but so little apparently occurs here that a police force of over 6 officers is trusted with covering an area the size of a large city. When a young Native American girl (Kelsey Asbille) is found barefoot and dead in the snow 5 miles from the nearest residence, the minuscule department find themselves clearly ill-equipped for the investigation. The girl died from suffocating on the blood in her lungs, brought on by the sub- zero temperature, but she has also been raped. The man who found her, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service agent Cory Lambert (Jeremy Renner), uses his knowledge and experience as a hunter to start making connections.Renner has spent so many years in superhero costumes or starring in forgettable, little-seen box-office under-performers that it's easy to forget just how he made the jump from supporting character actor to leading man material. In movies like The Hurt Locker and The Town, he demonstrated an uncanny skill at playing introverted characters emotionally scarred by past experiences. Yes, he was an outright psychopath in Ben Affleck's thrilling The Town, but it always felt like he was masking something deeper. Lambert is living with his own trauma. He pays visits to his Native American ex-wife to see his son, but their separation was clearly brought on by tragedy. In a moving monologue to the father of the murdered girl (a marvellous Gil Birmingham), he reveals through choked-back tears that his daughter had passed years earlier. It's quite possibly the best work he's ever done; utterly convincing as the strong, silent hunter who can spot a snowmobile track from a mile away, and as a potential romantic interest for FBI agent Jane Banner (Elizabeth Olsen).She is sent from her office in Las Vegas, and arrives completely ill-prepared for the brutal conditions of Wind River. When she quickly realises she's out of her depth, Banner leans on Lambert to help her navigate the perilous conditions and vast landscape. It's a character seen many times before - even in Sicario - and although Olsen is perfectly fine, her role seems somewhat diminutive and over-reliant on her male counterpart. It's an issue Sheridan should perhaps address in his next venture, but Wind River proves that he is more than capable of visualising his own work. He shoots the wilderness as a cold, unforgiving place, where only the toughest - humans or animals - can survive, turning them wilder and more primitive in the process. The score by Nick Cave and Warren Ellis also give the land a mystic ambiance, similar in many ways to their work on The Proposition. Although it does digress into Quentin Tarantino territory and the final pay-off seems over-eager to highlight good from bad, Wind River deserves some recognition come awards season, as does Sheridan as a director to watch.",Wind River
37,cruise01,A slow chiller crime thriller that builds its suspense with a grim direction.,7,18 August 2017,"Wind River is a suspenseful thriller from a writer Taylor Sheridan (who has done previous scripts like Hell or High Water or Sicario). The plot follows US wildlife service Cory (Jeremy Renner) who works in the Wind River Indian reservation in hunting for wolves or other predators that attack the livestock in peoples property. When he is out in the snowy landscapes. He discovers a dead girl, who must have been running from something and died from breathing in the below zero air. What was she running from? And why is she out in the middle of nowhere? It raises the questions that cause FBI Jane (Elizabeth Olsen) to travel to Wind River which is way out of her comfort zone as an environment. Jane is going to need a tracker and the help from Cory in hunting a predator that harassed and murdered a teenage girl. I will say I did find Wind River to have its suspenseful moments. It may not be as good like Sicario and Hell or High Water which they were thrilling and kept you on the edge of your seat. Wind River being the third script by Taylor Sheridan and also directing this film. He does a few things right for being his directorial debut. He added an isolation tone to the film. Which a few characters reference the feeling of living in the mountains of Wyoming and feeling distant from society. The feeling of loneliness and how some people commit crimes to go to prison for better comfort and care. This film also focusing on a Native American reservation setting and how people go missing every year in the frozen snowy mountains. The plot is simple for its crime drama about an FBI agent and a tracker trying to solve a murder by investigating the victims drug addict brother and trying to find her boyfriend that works as a security for a drilling company in the mountains. I say Jeremy Renner and Elizabeth Olsen were perfect with their performances. Even though, they already had on screen chemistry with the Avengers movie. Their duo chemistry worked well here. Renner playing a character that is struggling within himself from a tragic past and grief. And great as a tracker. Olsen playing a character that is not in her comfort zone with going to a snowy climate. When she arrives, she is underdressed for the cold weather with a small jacket and high heels. The film is slow moving and does take a while for it to set up the suspense. The cinematography work in capturing the Wyoming mountains and snowy wildness is chilling and visually stunning to look at. Nonetheless, the pace is slow and boring until the thrills build up in the climax leading to an intense standoff with the police and the driller's security. Overall, Wind River is a fairly done thriller that you would need patience for the slow moving script to build the suspense for a shoot out climax. Jeremy Renner and Elizabeth Olsen performance is worth looking at. Even the visual setting of the reservation mountain of Wind River is breathtaking. I will rate the film 3 and a half star out of 5.",Wind River
38,Floated2,Slow overlooked thriller,7,26 July 2018,"Wind River's director Taylor Sheridan follows up his acclaimed screenplays for of 2016 Hell or High Water and 2015 Denis Villeneuve's Sicario with his first directorial effort.. Wind River is another modern-day western, full of tense action and tough, taciturn characters trying to navigate life on the fringes of America. But if Sicario and especially Hell or High Water explored the damaging legacy of the frontier myth on a country that's rigged to favor the few, then Wind River makes the connection more forceful, set as it is on a Native American reservation that's been left to its own devices with none of the infrastructure necessary to let its inhabitants thrive. The film opens with the death of a young woman. Discovered miles from anywhere in the frozen wilds of Wyoming's Wind River reservation, she's found and identified by Jeremy Renner (Cory Lambert), a game tracker with the US Fish and Wildlife Service. He knows the girl, knows her family, knows that something horrifying must have forced this Native American teenager to run barefoot through the night until her lungs packed up. Wind River may be considered slow and boring for many as the film isn't the typical crime drama, though within the second half of the film, it picks up and becomes completely engaging.

39,eddie_baggins,2017's best thriller,9,11 December 2017,"Over the course of the last few years, actor turned screenwriter Taylor Sheridan has crafted out an incredibly consistent collection of films with his delivering of some of recent memories most layered and effective thrillers.Debuting with 2015's Sicario, then advancing to an Oscar nomination for his work on last year's Hell or High Water, the actor who was previously a well-known figure in front of the camera for his roles in TV shows like Veronica Mars and Sons of Anarchy, has quickly graduated to the writer and director of his own productions that has here culminated in one of 2017's most memorable films.Wind River feels cut from the same cloth as Sicario and Hell or High Water, the grittiness, humanity and carefully considered humour of those films is to be found here but Wind River feels like a wholly unique proposition in many ways, showcasing that Sheridan has an innate ability to craft out what could be seen as familiar scenarios, in totally different shades of light.A murder mystery that is so much more than your typical fare, Sheridan's film takes place entirely in and around the Wyoming Indian reservation of Wind River as Jeremy Renner's hunter Cory Lambert works alongside Elizabeth Olsen's out of her depth FBI agent Jane Banner to solve the murder of young reservation teenager Nathalie in the harsh surrounds of the wintery setting.Sheridan captures the harsh beauty of this natural landscape brilliantly that is enhanced by Ben Richardson's impressive DOP work, while the moody and atmospheric score by Nick Cave and Warren Ellis further encapsulates the isolation and harsh realities of this unforgiving landscape.The captivating time and place that Wind River takes place in works wonderfully alongside what could well be a career best performance from Renner, while Olsen continues to prove her abilities as one of the best young actresses working in the industry.Both Lambert and Banner give their actors layered and believable characters to portray, with Lambert's personal history and strong affiliation with the lands he is working to catch a predator on resonating in particular as Sheridan's impressive script work tells us all we need to know about this troubled soul's past.At the core of Sheridan's film is also the undeniably gripping mystery of what happened to Nathalie, who's to blame for this young girl's life being cut short? and while Wind River ends up being much more than just a simple ""whodunit"", Sheridan has again found a suspenseful narrative drive in his screenplay that will have many viewers glued to the screen from start to finish.Final Say – Featuring an awards worthy turn from Jeremey Renner and script work by Sheridan, Wind River is an absolute must-see. Full of intrigue, heart and a strong emotionally resonate payoff; Wind River is easily one of the year's most effective thrillers and one of the year's strongest films regardless of genre.4 ½ homemade bullets out of 5",Wind River
40,howard.schumann,"A strong, suspenseful film",8,27 August 2017,"Written and directed Taylor Sheridan, the Oscar-nominated screenwriter of ""Sicario"" and ""Hell or High Water,"" Wind River is a murder mystery about the assault and murder of a young Native American women. Part character study, part police procedural, and part political statement, it is nonetheless a deeply disturbing film and one that contains graphic violence including a brutal rape scene and a good deal of heartbreak. Though Sheridan has been criticized for not casting a Native American in the leading role, he said that, while he has lived on a reservation, he was still an outsider and did not feel qualified to write his main character as a Native American.Beautifully photographed by Cinematographer Ben Richardson (""Beasts of the Southern Wild"") and set in the snowy hills of the Wind River Indian Reservation in West Central Wyoming, the film begins with a young Native American woman running barefoot through the snow leaving a trail of blood. The scene then shifts to a man lying in the snow on his stomach. Rifle in hand, he picks off wolves that have been attacking sheep in the area. The hunter is Cory Lambert played by Jeremy Renner (""Arrival"") who delivers a strong performance as the tough, stoic, and taciturn man who works for the U.S Fish and Wildlife Service. When Cory discovers the frozen body of a young woman he recognizes as his daughter's friend Natalie (Kelsey Asbille, ""Full of Grace""), it brings back memories of his daughter, also a Native American, who died a few years ago under mysterious circumstances.Cory pays a visit to his estranged wife Wilma (Julia Jones, ""High School Lover"") and his son Casey (Teo Briones) to tell them about the tragedy but, once the film focuses on solving the mystery of Natalie's death, they are not heard from again and the thread is left hanging. Since Natalie's death occurred on tribal lands, Ben (Graham Greene, ""Out of the Darkness""), chief of the tribal police, becomes involved in the investigation. Like Jeff Bridges' Sheriff Marcus Anderson in ""Hell or High Water,"" Ben has a dry sense of humor but goes about his business in a focused and determined manner. The investigation, however, is run by rookie FBI agent Jane Banner (Elizabeth Olsen, ""Ingrid Goes West"") who was sent from the Las Vegas office incongruously dressed more for a Las Vegas show than for the unforgiving, bitter cold of Central Wyoming.Reminiscent of Emily Blunt in Denis Villeneuve's ""Sicario"" who loses her illusions about the nobility of her work against drug lords, but maintains an inner strength, Banner is beautiful, self-assured and expert, but she is vulnerable and seems somewhat out of place in this environment. She pleads with the coroner to report that it is necessary that Natalie's death be ruled a homicide in order for her to remain on the case, yet he is unable to do so at this point. Nonetheless, she remains and relies on Cory who has lived and worked in the area for years to help her find the perpetrator of what is now clearly a crime. Given to short pithy statements, on Jane requesting backup for his investigation, Cory tells her, ""This isn't the land of backup, Jane. This is the land of: You're on your own."" In another ""highlight"" remark, Cory tells Jane when she searches for snowmobile tracks in the mountains, ""You look for clues, but you need to look for signs."" The two are seeking information on Natalie's boyfriend Matt (Jon Bernthal,""Baby Driver"") but, when they come upon an oil drilling platform, the film erupts in a shootout between the tribal police with handguns, the drilling rig workers with automatic weapons, and the lone FBI agent equipped only with a pistol. The final resolution of the conflict follows a fairly predictable path since there just are not that many suspects working in the area or living on the reservation other than Natalie's grieving family, a gang of drug addicts, and members of the tribal police. In confronting what turns out to be Natalie's rape and murder, Cory must also come to terms with his daughter's death. In a sequence of moving immediacy, he tells Natalie's grieving father,Martin (Gil Birmingham, ""Hell or High Water"") that it is dangerous to avoid the pain of grieving because that is the only part of a loved one that remains after her death.Wind River is a strong, suspenseful film that holds our attention throughout. Not much is left to our imagination, however, and the mystery is revealed in a gory flashback that ends in over-the-top violence. While the film has its flaws, to its credit it reminds us that Native American women are much more vulnerable to sexual assault than women of other ethnic backgrounds and that their rapes and murders go largely unreported. In its avoidance of the economic, social, and cultural conditions on the reservation or the unique experiences of its residents, however, it surrenders what might have been a powerful and lasting experience.",Wind River
41,TheMovieDiorama,"Wind River is gritty, depressing and utterly thrilling.",9,27 February 2018,"Taylor Sheridan...I think I love you. Though this is not his directorial debut, it's the first film where he both directed and wrote the screenplay. A murder mystery set on the Wind River Indian Reservation in Wyoming where the incident might be more of a personal journey than first anticipated for our lead characters. And what a journey this is! It's dark, broody and full of tension around every corner. What Sheridan has done is intricately create not just a thrilling investigation but one that evokes pain and suffering. Through experiencing loss of life, a wildlife tracker who assists the FBI agent undertakes an opportunity to redeem himself. An absurdly visceral and poignant tale that is so emotionally raw that it filled my soul with melancholia. These characters are so hard hitting and complex that I found myself absorbed by these compelling individuals. The screenplay is infused with convincing dialogue that allows the characters to be natural, nothing ever felt forced. No line or word was out of place, not a single one. It was like poetry. Shakespeare even. I succumbed to the words as much as I did to the performances. Jeremy Renner, yet again, gives an understated performance and proves his is still an underrated actor. He was enigmatic. A multiple layered performance where I could see the internal suffering just from his eyes alone. Elizabeth Olsen holds her own in a more physically demanding role. The inclusion of Native American actors enhances the authenticity of the environment, and all performances felt real. Sheridan's directing style felt intuitional, admired how he filmed at a distance within the foliage to allow the landscape to fuel the tension. An extremely harsh environment, but captured beautifully. I only wished that the film was longer, the investigation itself was solved too quickly which did detract on the excitement factor. However, Wind River is a paradoxical thriller. A small convincing murder mystery but vast in scale. One of the best of the year.",Wind River
42,Tweetienator,Dances with the Wind,6,29 September 2017,"Jeremy Renner is cool as f***, but that's nothing new. Wind River got good acting and fantastic pictures of raw nature but what it lacks is imo a suspenseful and captivating story, so I wouldn't call Wind River a thriller or a crime/detective story but more kind of drama about loss and being lost spiced up with some hunting and shooting. Not bad, not exceptional, but okay, thanks to the good acting and the great supporting act called nature.",Wind River

44,Ed-Shullivan,A somber and stoic animal tracker still grieving is offered a chance for vengeance,8,10 March 2020,"Cory Lambert (Jeremy Renner) is a big game animal tracker in Wyoming who hunts down lions to eek out a living. After losing his young daughter through an unsolved murder a second young lady named Natalie (Kelsey Asbille) is found dead on the frozen Wyoming Native American reservation without any snow shoes on her feet and she was raped and murdered. Cory speaks to Natalie's grieving father and personal friend Martin (Gil Birmingham) with great empathy after losing his own daughter to an unsolved murder. Martin tells Cory if he chooses to assist the FBI in hunting down his daughter's killer(s) to spare no mercy to these savage killer(s).When a rookie FBI agent named Jane Banner (Elizabeth Olsen) is assigned to investigate this latest murder on the Native American reservation land she quickly realizes that she needs the assistance of the experienced tracker Cory Lambert to just survive on the harsh and frozen surrounding white hills.I always enjoy these type of crime/drama revenge films if they are done well without embellishment of how awesome the hero/heroine is by miraculously defeating more than two dozen faceless lackies 'a la Steven Seagal. No, this mystery/thriller is void of any long winded overblown fights of one man versus an army. Rather, it focuses on how our experienced tracker Cory Lambert not only wants to track the person/people responsible for raping and killing his friend Martin's daughter but utilizing this opportunity to free himself from continuing internalizing his own grief for the unsolved murder of his own daughter. So Cory gladly joins the inexperienced female FBI agent who has never prepared herself for the harshness of the frozen Wyoming wilderness and they set out to solve the crime.Jeremy Renner always dives deep into his roles and unlike many of the made-to-model pretty boys who usually get these starring roles Renner's performance is both somber and stoic and you can't help but root for him and you know he is going to get these S.O.B.'s. It's a classic good versus evil cat and mouse chase but with a twist, this man is also on a personal mission to help ease his own personal grief for failing to save his own daughter and not finding her killer(s). He won't fail this time. Mrs. Shullivan and I greatly enjoyed this particular hunt and are even bigger fans of Jeremy Renner after his stellar performance.An 8 out 10 rating well worth watching!!!",Wind River

As an avid fan of Taylor Sheridan, was looking forward to this without watching the trailer. It is a very beautifully shot, well acted and distressing crime drama. The vast landscape becomes more than a vivid backdrop, it becomes a character in the film.
Wind River is able to showcase Sheridans directing and storytelling strengths.
From the dark border area (Sicario), to the scorching plains of Texas (Hell or ...) and to the frozen mountains in Wyoming in Wind river, the writer/director managed to make the landscape a character in the film. Jeremy Renner potrayed the role of a broken man who is keen on hunting the predators very well n he deserves an Oscar for his performance. The less said about the plot is better because one has to see this film rather than read about its plot.
The film has a very strong social message.
The films conclusion with the message was very horrifying n distressing.",Wind River
46,matthewssilverhammer,"Good Direction, But the Script Needs Some Work",4,31 August 2017,"Director Sheridan wrote Sicario and Hell or High Water, two of the most thoughtfully intense films of the last couple years, but this is (essentially) his directing debut. However, somehow he seems to have focused so much on the beauty of the visuals (which truly are stunning) that the script took a backseat. With a lack of character or distinction, and an unexpected plethora of clichéd storytelling and on-the-nose dialogue, Wind River is little more than a beautiful but ham-fisted allegory of how Native Americans have been poorly treated. Renner and Olsen take a break from their Avengers duties to join up with a local sheriff (scene-stealer Greene) to solve a crime in the frozen tundra of a Wyoming Indian reservation. The mystery itself, a young woman found brutalized and frozen in the woods, is an absorbing one, thanks to the skill in the filmmaking details. A uniquely foreboding score, intensely authentic action, gorgeously gruesome dead bodies atop scenic snow, and a lead hero who displays an aptitude for cool vengeance that should make Liam Neeson proud, all help boost the engagement. Unfortunately, once the mystery is resolved and explained, it's less, ""Woah!"", and more ""Oh"". The appeal of the mystery begins to dissipate when the conclusion is unsatisfying, leaving us with more unintended questions than answers: Why is the camera so shaky during simple dialogue scenes? What's with the hackneyed one-liners? Are these performances nicely subtle, or just dry as a bone? Is this the best we can do to portray the suffering of Indian-Americans? Wind River might have some helpful thoughts on wrestling grief, but it's mostly just unnecessarily brooding and too uncomplicated in its anger.",Wind River
47,Movie_Muse_Reviews,"As chilling as you'd expect, as well as powerful and significant. Sheridan does it again.",9,8 November 2017,"Taylor Sheridan makes his case for being one of the best working screenwriters today with ""Wind River,"" his third script to make it to the screen in three years and the first of the three that he's directed.Like ""Sicario"" and ""Hell or High Water"" before it, ""Wind River"" is a crime thriller that draws heavily upon setting and environmental factors – and the political, economic and social consequences of these factors – to tell a story. In particular, Sheridan is fascinated by situations where lawlessness thrives and what happens when the systems believed to protect us make us vulnerable to desperate, dangerously motivated and often morally corrupted people.In ""Wind River,"" that context is the Wind River Indian Reservation in Wyoming. With complicated jurisdiction issues on top of its remote location, the effectiveness of law enforcement on Native American land has a limit, opening these regions up to violent crime that goes unpunished. Sheridan takes these circumstances and crafts such an effective genre story that its basis in truth is all the more appalling and soul-stirring.A straight-forward murder mystery, ""Wind River"" depicts the unfolding of events when a wild animal tracker (Jeremy Renner) discovers a young woman dead in the snow. When the FBI sends a young agent (Elizabeth Olsen) in from Las Vegas to investigate who obviously has no knowledge of the region, he offers to help, even though the case tugs at an unsolved crime in his personal past.Because no murder mystery could be straightforward in such a desolate and dangerous place, Sheridan equips this classic crime thriller story with numerous wrinkles and abrupt twists that directly result from the unusual circumstances of solving a crime on a Native American reservation filled with mountain lions in snowy Wyoming. But most of all, he fills out the script with character moments that speak to the emotional consequences of these unusual circumstances as well.Renner's character, Cory, for example, could have just been the cold and calculated tracker who propels the intrigue of the plot, but Cory was once married to a woman from the reservation and has deep personal ties to the people there. Olsen also could've been the classic naïve in-over-her-head officer, but much like the similar role Emily Blunt played in ""Sicario,"" she's constantly reckoning her own understanding of the world with the headaches and horrors of this case. Both actors do some of their absolute best work in this film, and it's definitely Renner's finest performance.Sheridan's script deserves a lot of that credit. The way he sees the world and articulates the ideas he pulls from his stories through dialogue borders on poetry. A scene in which Cory gives the father of the murdered woman (Gil Birmingham) advice on how to grieve is deeply moving and will feel frighteningly truthful to anyone who has ever lost someone. He gives his characters such powerful words to process the themes of the film that every key emotional scene feels like a discovery of some new rich meaning and perspective on life. At any moment his writing could become too much, and some might argue it does, but the rest of the film holds fast behind it.Although his greenness hardly impacts the film, Sheridan has room to grow as a director. The story had the potential to feel even moodier and more atmospheric and connect the viewer even deeper into the narrative through visuals, and Sheridan just never takes that extra step visually. Someone like ""Sicario"" director Denis Villeneuve would've absolutely nailed it; Sheridan is just a little too straightforward – he buries us up to our waists in snow and with a little more experience or the right director, we might have gone up to our necks. Still, the difference is negligible; maybe just between being a great film and being a Best Picture frontrunner.Above all else, ""Wind River"" has the trappings of an important film given its subject matter and the issues it raises. It's a movie that should be seen and talked about, especially because so many of the people it depicts are not.~Steven CThanks for reading! Visit Movie Muse Reviews for more",Wind River

49,paul-allaer,"""You are looking for clues, but you are missing all the signs""",8,19 August 2017,"""Wind River"" (2017 release; 107 min.) brings the story of Wildlife Officer Cory Lambert. As the movie opens, reminding us ""Inspired By Actual Events"", we briefly see a woman running for her life in the snow. We then are introduced to Lambert, who is hunting down wolves. Lambert visits his ex, where he picks up his young son for the day. Lambert then visits the parents of his ex, as their life stock has been attacked, possibly by a lion. In the course of starting his investigation, Lambert finds the frozen body of the woman we saw running for her life. Because it looks like a possible homicide, an FBI agent is called. At this point we're 10 min. into the movie, but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this movie marks the second directing stint of highly praised writer (and erstwhile actor) Taylor Sheridan, whose previous two movies, 2015's ""Sicario"" and last year's ""Hell or High Water"", were among the top movie of the year for me. ""Wind River"" is for me one of the most anticipated movies of the year, period. With ""Wind River"", Sheridan goes in a very different direction again as compared to ""Sicario"" and ""Hell or High Water"", digging into a murder mystery, set in an Indian reservation in snow-covered Wyoming. Jeremy Renner brings perhaps his finest performance of his career as the Wildlife hunter/tracer Cory Lambert, who himself carries a heavy secret. Elizabeth Olsen is Jane Banner, the wide-eyed inexperienced FBI agent who is in way over her head but is determined to do what is right. ""You are looking for clues but you are missing all the signs"", remarks Lambert early on, and she begs him to help her. And there are plenty of potential suspects--it's not a coincidence that this is set in a community that has more than its share of crime and misery. Sheridan leads with confidence as the tension in the movie rarely lets up. Bottom line: this is another nice movie from Tayalor Sheridan, who in just a matter of a few years has become one of Hollywood most accomplished writer-directors. Can't wait for his next movie, ""Soldado"", a sequel to ""Sicario"", to be released next year.""Wind River"" opened this weekend at my local art house theater here in Cincinnati on not one, but two screens, a rarity. The Saturday matinée screening where I saw this at was attended very nicely for a matinée. I imagine that ""Wind River"" will benefit from the strong word-of-mouth that this will surely generate.

""Wind River"" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",Wind River
50,jtindahouse,A captivating masterpiece,10,6 September 2017,"I'll start this review by admitting I wasn't the biggest fan of 'Sicario' or 'Hell or High Water'. I appreciated them for what they were and admired the quality with which they were made, but I certainly didn't fall in love with them like the general public seemed to. So my anticipation for 'Wind River' wasn't exactly sky high, but I saw that it had a very high rating on IMDb which left me mildly excited. Then for the first 10-15 minutes of the film I wasn't quite sure what to make of it. It seemed very similar to 'Hell or High Water' in the sense that the production of the film was terrific, yet the actual substance of the story seemed lacking. However I was very wrong. After about the 15 minute mark the film kicks into gear and from that point on it one of the most captivating film experiences I can remember.The dialogue in the film is exquisite. There are countless lines spoken that you actually have to stop for a second and appreciate how profound they are. Also the structuring of the story is quite brilliant. The transitions of the stages of the story are effortlessly simple in their explanation (whilst being effortlessly complex in nature) and make it so very easy for the audience to follow along and appreciate the things that truly matter.Of all the impeccable elements this film possesses though I have to say it may just be the performance of the cast that are the highlight. The whole cast are superb, however Jeremy Renner is next level (and Elizabeth Olsen isn't far behind him). I've always been a fan of Renner, but I would have to say this is his finest performance to date. He is enthralling to watch and creates a character for the ages. Olsen also thoroughly impressed me. She had a very different type of role, yet she still managed to absolutely nail it. She is a very underrated actress.'Wind River' is nothing short of a masterpiece and if you have even the slightest hesitation towards seeing it for whatever reason, please ignore that feeling and go see it.

The script deserved best picture and best screenplay at the Oscars. Wind River is not quite as good, but it is still an excellent movie. Jeremy Renner plays a wildlife agent whose main job is to keep coyotes from decimating herds of sheep. While on the prowl in search of a marauding mountain lion, he comes upon a dead eighteen year-old girl from the town. She is face down in the snow with blood coming out of her mouth. The FBI is summoned to the Wind River Indian Reservation to help the understaffed local police solve the crime. Elizabeth Olsen is the agent and she joins Renner in the search for the killer. Along the way, they encounter drug addicts and other colorful but depressing people. Renner's ex-wife is Indian and they have a boy together. It turns out that their high school aged daughter had a bad experience with a criminal element and this pretty much rounds out the story. The scenery of Wyoming and Utah are spectacular and the script is precise with some good, witty moments. So far for 2017, Get Out and Wind River are two best films.",Wind River

Jeremy was married to an Indian woman, had a daughter with her and then she too disappeared, under mysterious circumstances, years earlier. An F.B.I. agent, Elizabeth, is called in to run the investigation-she was the closest agent at the time-and does not have any experience with tracking in the snow, so she enlists Jeremy to assist her. Graham plays the reservation police chief and Jon is an oil worker that just might be a person of interest. It's not a bad movie. It's kind of like an extended version of a TV series with more violence. Just before the end credits start, a statement appears on screen saying something to the effect that the government does not keep statistics on girls that disappear from reservations so there is no way to know how many have actually disappeared.

55,st-shot,Snow job.,4,6 September 2017,"Jeremy Renner delivers a fine performance and the state of Wyoming looks magnificent in this hackneyed disappointment of a murder mystery that sulks from beginning to end. Sloppy and improbable it stumbles more than once as it injects statement, upending a rhythm that is near moribund to begin with a cast of characters snowbound in blues.Corey Lambert (Renner) is Wyoming game warden trying to balance the predator population in Wyoming when he comes across the body of 18 year Natalie Hanson, dead from hypothermia but while running from something in the process. With the death occurring on tribal land FBI agent Jane Banner (Liz Olsen) is assigned to sought things out but makes a less than impressive debut that she more than makes up for with some deadly shooting, take charge tough talk as well as withstand half a can of mace sprayed in her face without mussing hair or make-up. Eventually they get around to dropping by the prime suspects place. At this point the already sputtering story stalls momentarily to play with time and tenderness and in doing so obliterate the meager tension remaining before resuming the earlier aborted climax killing carnage that auteur Taylor Sheridan interrupts to jam a strong woman statement in. It rings hollow (much of the blame belonging to the limited and miscast Olsen) and drains the outcome of impact to go along with a busy Lambert in the film's final minutes sun setting with three different characters.

The premise sees a hunter and a rookie police officer try to work out how a girl died. Jeremy renner plays the lead in this film and it is probably the best I have ever seen him. He totally owns the role and gives a very subtle but powerful dramatic performance that really has you caring and rooting for his character through the whole film. Elizabeth olsen plays the rookie cop in this film and she was great too, she bought a lot of strength to the role that makes her stand out on her own and not be a damsel in distress. Everybody in this film does an excellent job in there roles that are all very believable and very real. The story is pretty simple but I really liked the way the investigation was presented and especially the links to renners character that made it an emotional journey. However, my only negative for this film is in its conclusion and the big reveal which I felt was pretty weak but it doesn't hurt the movie that much. The script is great with all the dramatic beats hitting and making you truly care about the situation. But also a few little bits of humour worked in this film as well. The style of the film is a slow pace but I was invested throughout the entire film and it always kept me engaged. Plus the icy setting really helps build the tension at times.

The bleak story is one of form, function and setting meld together.Sheridan is quite a gifted writer and he hits it out of the park again. This script, and especially the ending, functions as a murder mystery, a northern western and as an expose on a current issue. There is a bitter irony that this film was largely overlooked when it came out given its subject matter. The ending and climax is absolutely perfect.

Sadly those small movies get a marginal release with little to no promotional budget. They might make back the miniscule budget they began with but they don't take in big bucks. What makes this worse is that there are times, as with WIND RIVER, when the movie itself it much better than the teen oriented mega flick. It's hard to believe it was just 2-3 months ago this film was in theaters.Jeremy Renner stars as Cory Lambert, a Fish and Wildlife agent whose main job is to track down predators that are affecting the people in the area he works in. That area is in Wyoming, the Wind River Reservation in particular. The film opens with his tracking and killing a wolf targeting flocks of sheep. When he goes to collect the wolf he finds another set of tracks which lead him to the body of an Indian girl named Natalie (Kelsey Asbille). He calls in the tribal police and then moves on.Cory picks his son up from his ex-wife. Nothing in particular is mentioned but there is a tension between them that ties into their past. It's his weekend and she's off to apply for a new job elsewhere. Called in to help investigate the body he leaves his son on the reservation with his ex's parents.The FBI has been called in since the murder occurred on federal land and they send in Jane Banner (Elizabeth Olson). Fairly new and arriving from a gathering in Las Vegas she isn't prepared for the harshly cold weather of the area. Borrowing clothes they head to the body. She calls for a rape kit and Cory explains to her the painful way Natalie died. Twenty degree below weather, running full bore with no shoes or gloves her lungs would have crystalized causing her to choke on her own blood.The official autopsy can't actually call this a homicide as to the reason she died and all might end with no help here, something those on the reservation are used to. The discovery of a second body, that of a man, changes things around and Banner is allowed to stay and continue her investigation. With little to go on Banner continues to sift for clues while Cory tells her she's missing the big picture.As someone who tracks predators he tells her to not look for clues but to follow the paths that are left behind. Using this method is what led them to the second body. Now as they investigate deeper they confront a sense of apathy from those on the reservation, a place that offers little hope. And as the pair get to know one another, Cory reveals the secret he's kept to himself to Banner.The evidence begins to mount and the clues keep coming. They may be minor but they're enough to warrant talking to others who might be involved. With each piece they pick up in their search for the killer or killers their lives are placed in danger as well. By the end not everyone will walk away and no one will be left unscarred in one way or another.What makes this movie work above all else is the performance given by Renner in the lead role here. I've watched him act in a number of films but this performance seems so different from any I've seen him play. His character is believable and pained, but not to the point that it prevents him from accomplishing what he sets out to do. Instead he grabs on to that pain and it gets him through as well as allowing him to retain memories that some might lose.Olson does a fine job as well but her character is secondary to that of Renner. You're never quite sure if Jane is too wet behind the ears to understand the best way to handle things of if she's simply a fish out of water in this element, a wintery snow scape far removed from her Fort Lauderdale home base. And yet in some moments she seems to know completely what she is doing. Also great is Graham Greene as Ben, the Reservation law officer who gripes about the government never sending help while being grateful for the help he does receive.The heart of this film reads like an old mystery in that the mystery actually IS the centerpiece. Sure there are some character questions that surround it but the mystery itself is what matters. We're offered clues to solve what happened and some may guess before the film ends. The entertainment lies in trying to figure out what's going on and who did it. In the end it makes for a movie that offers brutal reality and a story that holds your interest from start to finish.",Wind River
59,lukem-52760,DARK & DISTURBING MURDER MYSTERY THRILLER WITH AN OUTSTANDING PERFORMANCE BY RENNER,9,8 November 2020,"Elizabeth Olsen is excellent as the F.B.I agent who turns up at the deep set wintery Wyoming Indian reservation camp after the local wild life officer (Jeremy Renner) finds a teenage girl dead in the snow in the middle of nowhere & the autopsy reveals she was raped. Wind River is a very dark & serious Murder Mystery Thriller & one that is very deeply emotional & full of despair & sadness surrounding this poor teen girls horrible death & rape & Elizabeth Olsen (Avengers: Infinity War, Avengers: End Game) gives an incredibly passionate performance as the Agent out of her depth in a place full of rugged, tough & secretive hard men & she stands her ground & delivers a strong minded, smart & kick-ass character performance with a big heart, i loved her here.
Jeremy Renner gives the performance of his Career here, truly an Oscar worthy performance as the rugged local Animal wildlife officer & expert hunter but with such an emotional & tragic back story & Renner is outstanding & shows what an incredible actor he truly is & gives it his all in his sensitive, smart, deeply hurt performance with eyes that have seen too much horror & a simmering rage that burns beneath his calm exterior & it's a performance that will stay with you long after the fantastic gripping ending!!! For me, Renner gives one of the best performances in Cinema history.
Jeremy Renner is truly one of the greatest actors working today & yet i still think he's way underrated in my opinion but he is a true ""Movie Star"" he has that quality to him, it's hard to explain but i see him & think MOVIE STAR, a real MOVIE STAR!!!
The story here is drenched in very scary realism & was based on an actual real life event so that grim darkness hangs over the movie & fills everything with a sense of dread & sadness.
What happened to the teenage girl is horrific & what happened to her boyfriend is horrific & that's all i can say as this is a Mystery movie with outstandingly raw & powerful performances.
The freezing cold & blizzard filled bleak Wilderness of the Wyoming landscape is so dangerous & creates suspense just from our two heroes going out to investigate, it's expertly Directed & beautifully photographed.
The music is raw & full of sadness.
Not a film i could watch alot though because of it's dark subject matter & some scenes (Rape) are horrible to watch but i love the Vigilante action that comes later on & i totally agree with it because sometimes the law isn't enough for the Evil that Men do!!!
Shocking, Suspenseful, Gripping, Scary & Powerful.",Wind River
60,kluseba,This summer blockbuster will make your blood freeze,9,3 November 2017,"Wind River is the blockbuster you didn't know you had to watch this summer or autumn. The movie is a gloomy mixture of a sinister drama with a set of authentic, flawed and haunted characters and a quite gruesome, mysterious and tense thriller. The fact that the movie was inspired by true events makes it even more haunting.Even if you're watching this movie in the summertime, it will definitely send cold shivers down your spine. The film takes place during a heavy snow storm in the isolated Wind River Indian Reservation in Wyoming. The story follows a quiet outcast and U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service agent who is divorced and has lost his daughter under mysterious circumstances and a female rookie F.B.I. special agent who must be resilient in unfamiliar territory to earn some respect from hostile Native Americans and closed-minded white drill workers alike. This unlikely duo, supported by local Native American police officers, must find out the truth about the mysterious death of a young woman.The movie's only weak spot might be the slightly predictable plot but the authentic, brutal and emotional ending still suits the movie perfectly. Among the most convincing elements, the superb acting performance by Jeremy Renner must be pointed out. I have always appreciated him as entertaining sidekick in several action thrillers but in this dramatic thriller, he shows his entire potential and really convinces as haunted outsider. Another strong element of the film is the fact that it authentically shows the problematic relationships between disillusioned Native Americans and arrogant White Americans and points out the difficult coexistence between traditional reservations and greedy companies. Finally, the bare but beautiful snow landscapes fit perfectly to a story between bitterness and hope. They aren't only stunning to watch but play an important role in the opening sequence as well as in the final scenes.If you like authentic dramas and thrillers with credible stories and outstanding acting performances, there is no way you can get around Wind River. I would suggest watching this film in the wintertime as you will find it even more immersive. Still, Wind River is easily the best movie I have watched last summer and I would recommend it to any family member or friend and surely buy a copy on DVD or BluRay to support the makers of this film.",Wind River
61,aharmas,Three Out of Three,9,13 September 2017,"""Wind River"" is Sheridan's third great movie in a row. He's a man who understand the dark side of nature and can give us both an inner and an outer tale of what the main characters are going through. This time, a dedicated man with a less than perfect life, is recruited to find out what happened to a young woman whose body has been found in the snow. With the supervision or assistance, depending on your point of view, the mystery is slowly resolved, and the findings are grim.It becomes apparent from early on that whatever happened to this young woman has the makings of some type of relationship going wrong; however, as we are told the story, we realize that the backgrounds of the participants in this drama have quite a bit of pain, and their society is slowly imploding because there is a strong likelihood failure or tragedy will strike somehow.We get to see the young woman's family's problem, and how the list of suspects become more intriguing, when we learn more about her brother and his friends. The thrills intensify as our pair of investigators keeps searching for the truth, and it reaches explosive levels when the possible culprits are found.None will ever accuse of this being an unoriginal or boring movie. We might have seen parts of the whole before, but the whole things moves slowly because of the richness of the details, the power of the technical elements who augment the drama. The actors are at their best and both Olsen and Renner can effectively show frustration, despair, and the incredulity of realizing that human nature has the potential of darkness.""Wind River"" is Taylor's best so far. It feels a bit more accomplished than his previous two; maybe it's the power of the narrative or the beauty of the setting. What is undeniable is that the whole in indeed a classic.",Wind River
62,valleyjohn,The best thing Renner has has done,8,20 January 2018,"Wind River is a film that seemed to pass everyone by when it got it's theatrical release back in September . I'm not sure if that's because it is a Weinstein film and Harvey had a little bit more on his plate than promoting it ?!
It's also won awards for the most overlooked film of 2017 so I fully expect it to be talked about more now it has been released for home viewing. 
It's the story of a ranger who discovers the frozen body of a young Native American woman in an Indian Reservation. She turns out to be the best friend of his teenage daughter, who died a few years earlier under mysterious circumstances. Although the tribal authorities get involved in the investigation, the FBI also sends in rookie agent to investigate.This is the second film in a row I have watched that involves Native Americans dealing with death and the grief that comes with it ( the other was Hostiles ). This is the better film of the two in my opinion.
It's very atmospheric and you really do feel the harshness of the environment these people have to deal with.
This is probably Jeremy Renner's best performance to date as the dad who is still dealing with the death of his daughter but I was not totally convinced that Elizabeth Olsen was the best choice for an FBI agent.
Overall I really liked this and I recommend it if you haven't seen it yet.",Wind River
63,TheOneThatYouWanted,This film has an old soul.,8,2 December 2017,"I love films like this - ones with an actual plot, story and character development. But the interesting this about this film is how all the background characters are more compelling than the two leads. What's her name, the girl who plays Scarlett Witch in the Marvel films is off her game in this movie. She plays off as a one note character when she is literally the one walking the steps of the hero in this hero's journey. She throw the whole film off by a few inches. You can not blame the director because everything else seems to be gelling. The strange thing is that she is usually a great actress. Whatever. This is a nice little film and original - which is an oddity nowadays.",Wind River
64,jadepietro,A Wintry Mix of Silence and Sorrow,8,19 August 2017,"(RATING: ☆☆☆☆ out of 5 ) GRADE: B THIS FILM IS RECOMMENDED.IN BRIEF: Taylor Sheridan's riveting murder mystery is a well written thriller that boasts a terrific performance by Mr. Renner.SYNOPSIS: On a remote Indian reservation, a FBI recruit and a local townsman team up to solve the murder.JIM'S REVIEW: The riveting opening scene in Taylor Sheridan's Wind River, immediately draws us into this thriller: At a Native American reservation, a bloodied young woman trudges through the sub-zero elements in central Wyoming, finally collapses, and dies. Barefoot and frightened, her wintry death sets up a murder mystery. Her frozen body is found by the town's wildlife officer / hunter, Corey Lambert (Jeremy Renner). Leading the investigation is FBI agent Jane Benner (Elizabeth Olsen). A newbie with the bureau, she wisely knows that in order to solve this case, she needs local help. So she enlists the aid of Corey, who knows the town and its people, although he is a bit of a loner with very little social skills and a tragic past. The duo set out to find their suspects and bring closure for their victim and her family.￼Screenwriter Mr. Sheridan (Hell or High Water, Sicario) once again tells his story with skill and style. He focuses on the murder investigation while subtly showing the socioeconomic hardships of the community and its toll on the citizenry. The town is filled with desperation and loss and its inhabitants are all prime suspects in search of redemption. This talented screenwriter, making his fine directorial debut, delivers an engrossing narrative and imbues his characters with insightful dialog that keeps his film riveting from start to finish. His film is atmospheric and moody and his characters have an authenticity that is usually lacking in this genre. ￼The one issue that I had with the film, which keeps it from being highly recommended, is the mystery itself. The story-line remains involving but it is just too simplistic, needing more intricate plot structure to completely satisfy. When we finally meet the perpetrators, everything appears far too obvious. That said, the screenplay still resonates with its complex characters and their impassioned monologues and eloquent conversations that create lovely moments about the human condition. The acting is uniformly strong. Graham Greene as Ben, a Native police officer, provides his customary able support and Gil Birmingham as the victim's father is quite moving. (The scenes between the two grieving fathers are very poignant and emphasize the personal drama most effectively.) Kelsey Asbille and Jon Bernthal make a lasting impression as the film's doomed lovers. Ms. Olsen is fine as the FBI agent, although her character's naivety and lack of training seems bewildering at times, which cuts into the logistic of the story. ￼However, Mr. Renner is a revelation. He underplays his character's angst and subtly shows his sense of mourning. He internalizes the man's melancholy and regret. His is a powerful performance and one wishes this gifted actor would be offered more complex roles than his typical shoot-em-up action fare and playing one-dimensional comic book superheroes.Wind River has its scenes of action and sudden violence in its storytelling that will please the action aficionados in the audience. Yet the film's greatest asset and driving force is not so much the mystery or its action sequences. It is the film's deeply personal human story that slowly unfolds. That, and Mr. Renner's memorable character and Mr. Sheridan's poetic words of wisdom make this movie-going experience quite special.",Wind River
65,Sherazade,Strong performances by all involved,9,18 September 2017,"An incredibly difficult subject to watch and I'm sure it was just as difficult to tackle for the cast and crew as well.

66,burlesonjesse5,VIEWS ON FILM review of Wind River,7,30 August 2017,"An FBI agent straight out of Las Vegas, hires a game tracker to help solve a rape and eventual murder. That's the essence of Wind River, my latest review. Elizabeth Olsen plays agent Jane Banner and Jeremy Renner plays Wildlife Service expert Cory Lambert. So OK, it has been over a month since I've given a favorable write-up. With ""River"", I figured I was due. Distributed by the Weinstein Company and released at Sundance via January of this year, Wind River is filmed in Utah but its setting is Wyoming. So yeah, we get it. It's darn cold in Wyoming. And despite a few images of beautiful, mountainous scenery, ""The Cowboy State"" is a pretty dour place to live in as well. A wrongdoer in ""River"" quips, ""there's nothing here but snow and silence!"" Later on, the protagonist preaches, ""you either survive or surrender"". Finally, that same protagonist exclaims, ""luck don't live out here"". Here's an idea, why don't these characters just get up and get the heck out of Wyoming. Jeez.Anyway, Wyoming is like a star in ""River"" and it's referenced to the point where obviousness becomes a dirty word. I mean, this isn't Devil's Tower Wyoming we're prattling about nor is it summertime Wyoming like in Brokeback Mountain. No I'm talking the Wind River Indian Reservation where blizzards come and go, temps drop to -20 degrees Fahrenheit, crime/drug use is a mainstay, and the police force is comprised of only six people. To quote humorist Dorothy Parker I say, ""what fresh hell is this?""Now as a movie clocking in at just under two hours, Wind River is like Fargo on downers, Cliffhanger minus the popcorn heroics, or The Grey without crashing 747's. In hindsight, it's a brutal motion picture, cloaked in vulnerability, violence, false mercy, loud bullet-ridden gunfire, and naked depression. Director Taylor Sheridan working from his own, figurative script (Sheridan penned 2015's Sicario), doesn't obsess with wide shots and cinematography that has the wilderness at his full disposal. He's more into his story which is well told even if the methodology is straightforward in the whodunit department. Taylor carefully inserts a devastating flashback toward ""River's"" conclusion while getting superb performances from his leads (Renner and Olsen). He does go a little overboard adding a souped- up Mexican standoff and a death sequence by which the main malefactor perishes from sub-zero, temperature inhalation (it didn't even look like it was that cold out). But hey, with all the blood and white flakes and symbolism (you could even throw in a haunting violin soundtrack as well), it's just way too difficult for me not to recommend Wind River. Rating: 3 stars.",Wind River
67,pc95,Very Good Crime-Drama,8,18 November 2017,"Directed deftly by Taylor Sheridan, ""Wind River"" is one of the better movies of 2017. It has a lean, stream-lined, story with great exterior shots of winter in Wyoming and dreary gray settings along with the oppressive spirit of the ""rez"" . The crime and mystery portrayed at hand are as provocative as the landscape. Sheridan has a good grasp of what's important to drive the story. And as simple and impressive as the story is wild, the acting and direction of all involved keeps the tone grounded. Jeremy Renner plays an anguished but stoic working man. Graham Greene brings a bit of humor and realism on occasion. The finale of the movie amps it up a full degree with violent energy reminiscent to a western showdown.",Wind River
68,Zbigniew_Krycsiwiki,"A good, but not great, follow up to Hell Or High Water",7,20 August 2017,"Slowly paced thriller, telling of the FBI's investigation into a girl's death, after she is found, frozen and barefoot, in a desolate region of Wyoming. A slow start had me, quite frankly, bored, for the first 15 or so minutes, but once we arrived at the coroner's office, and the debate and conflict about what is legally permitted to be listed on the autopsy report as her cause of death, the plot finally kicked in. This may be my favourite scene in the movie. This film has some of the same occasional sense of humour with the characters, giving them depth, and humanistic characteristics, but I found the pacing to be a bit uneven. Also, while Hell Or High Water had extremely relatable antiheros for its lead characters ( we knew what they were doing was wrong, but we still wanted to see them victorious ) , this film has violent, repulsive killers as its lead( ish ) characters. There is comment that some citizens would rather be in prison instead of living in this desolate, unforgiving, sprawling wasteland, effectively shown in many scenes, like writer/ director Taylor Sheridan did with west Texas, in his magnificent, Hell Or High Water, using the landscape as a character in its own right. Olsen does well as a seemingly inexperienced FBI agent ( watch as she wisely orders one man to show her his hands, before being sprayed with chemicals, in a particularly brutal scene, but later, doesn't know she is walking into an ambush, and ends up getting shot for her troubles ) Spoiler alert: the fact the villain's ultimate fate is taken exactly from Quantum Of Solace left me feeling a bit flat.",Wind River
69,bkrauser-81-311064,Effective and Devastating,8,21 August 2017,"By being a purposefully paced and uncompromisingly bleak crime story, Wind River ends the summer movie season with a sudden, astonishing thud. Knowing that the film is written by Taylor Sheridan, who also wrote Sicario (2015) and Hell or High Water (2016), may prepare you insofar as themes and setting. But nothing will prepare you for Wind River's effective use of tension building and its devastating sense of justice.Wind River refers to the Wind River Indian Reservation, the final resting place of 18-year-old Natalie Hanson whose body is found frozen beyond a remote mountain ridge. The FBI sends rookie agent Jane Banner (Olsen) to investigate. She quickly finds herself beyond her depth and immediately deputizes FWS agent Cory Lambert (Renner) who not only has a good relationship with the Tribal Police, but also knows the wilderness like the back of his hand.The movie isn't so much a mystery whereby we're supposed to follow the clues and narrow down a pretty scant list of suspects. The film instead leads you by the nose from place to remote place; letting the landscape shape your sense of dread. In the words of Agent Lambert ""You're looking for clues, but you're missing all the signs."" And those signs come in the shape of pounding blizzards, dangerous wildlife and a destructive sense of isolation which threatens to cover the tracks of a grizzly crime.Wind River marks the last of Sheridan's Frontier Trilogy and the first in which he directs. By juxtaposing the foreboding splendor of the Rockies with painterly scenes of human misery at the ""Res"", Sheridan showcases his eye for innately human storytelling. Unlike Sicario, this tale of retribution approaches its subject matter with a sense of poetic justice and clarity of mind. And unlike Hell or High Water, Wind River equalizes the power dynamics of hero and villain via its environment. This isn't a movie where the hero succeeds based on luck or righteousness but by prepared they are.Elizabeth Olsen and Jeremy Renner prove themselves intensely capable actors, aptly taking advantage of a script that requires characterization through action. Olsen especially provides a sympathetic and active lead. She along with Graham Greene provide the few moments of mirth in a movie that would otherwise come across as starkly depressing. Renner's role can and should have probably gone to a more grizzled actor. Lambert as written follows the ebbs and flows of the story with quiet sadness and hard won horse sense. He pulls it all off, but not to the level that the role requires. Perhaps it was the joint image of seeing both Hawkeye and Scarlet Witch in the same movie that made me think ""youthful"". The man is 46 so he can hardly be blamed for being too young.Much of Wind River's other faults are small and can be attributed to inexperience more than anything. There are a few moments of awkward blocking and inappropriate moments of hand-held that neuter some of the film's calmer moments. Taylor Sheridan also defuses many moments of quiet with a soundtrack that should sound haunting but comes across more like its droning. Then there's the framing of the story within a socio-economic context. Rather than letting the story speak for itself, Sheridan adds unnecessary overtures at the beginning and end, cheapening the film's resolve.All is forgiven. The morally complex beats of the story and the force with which it hits you is evidence of something very much beyond. Wind River can comfortably be called a western but its potency sets itself apart. It's moody, gritty, understated and unassailably bleak. In a moment of practical wisdom Agent Lambert says, ""There's no sense going where a wolf could be, I rather hunt by going where he's been."" Wind River follows that wisdom to its logical end.",Wind River

I thought that at the end of the movie i would be very electrified but it was not so hot. I mean the film offers the cat and mouse play with revenge but the story didn't offer enough suspense.

73,krocheav,Wind River - Offers More Bluster Than Thoughtfulness,4,2 July 2018,"This moody drama starts out well enough with long shots of a vast, foreboding snowbound wilderness and a young girl running towards an icy death - but, what follows by way of a wrap-up is basically an over the top stock n' trade-shoot 'em up - with tacked on moralising about Native American social issues. I support the comments about the shocking lack of demographics on missing Native American women and fail to comprehend why this shameful situation is allowed to exist - given our so-called 'equal opportunity' society. A solid documentary drawing attention to such an appalling lack of information could be far more beneficial than a commercial (for profit) 'entertainment' movie such as this. As interesting (and sensitive) as some of it certainly is, the poor sound, mumbling actors, cheap handheld camerawork and scant dialouge, are among other elements that don't offer the benefits they should.A somewhat unbelievable bunch of red-neck-white-eyes, who get thrown in as the kill happy villains - forms a rather messily written means-to-an-end that seems overly obvious. These heavy handed 'them and us' productions will do little to improve race relations - if sincerely out to make a quality statement, far more balance is needed - otherwise, it simply takes us back to history repeating itself without much contribution to a helpful resolve. This will entertain those who look, without particularly thinking too much about what they see and, maybe the title card 'Inspired by true events' could be a rather long bow to draw... apart from the sad demographic.",Wind River

75,arungeorge13,Taylor Sheridan makes a cracking directorial debut! [+70%],7,5 November 2017,"The man who penned the screenplays for 'Hell or High Water' and 'Sicario' - Taylor Sheridan, follows it up with a little gem titled 'Wind River', where he is also making his directorial debut in sensational fashion.The film is essentially about a rape and murder of a young native- American woman in the Wind River Indian Reservation in Wyoming, USA and how it brings together U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service agent Cory Lambert (Jeremy Renner) and FBI agent Jane Banner (Elizabeth Olsen) along with the town Sheriff, for the investigation. What's appreciable about 'Wind River' is how the writer/director allows the film to run its course in building the lead characters while maintaining a certain level of suspense. The weather is harshly cold, with blizzards coming in at the oddest of times, and environmental clues showing signs of obscurity unless decisions are taken quickly. Cory has a tragic past of his own that connects well with the proceedings in the present, making him half bad-ass hunter and half brooding dad. Olsen plays her part of the rookie agent well too, her expressions bang on target when she sees the victim's mom hurting herself and when she hears the sorrowful cries of the victim's dad. I liked how Sheridan made Cory speak out loud about his tragedy, allowing Jeremy Renner to showcase his solid acting skills, rather than spoonfeed the audience through lazily done flashback sequences. A late cameo from Jon Bernthal is a welcome change from his recent eccentric outings. The writing is as solid as it can get, and the narrative flow seamless. The 'cowboy' vibe is quite apparent, especially in the early scenes featuring Cory and his son. Plus, Cory deals with the baddies just like he's handling his quarry. Sheridan tries to raise a valid point with respect to the uncertainty in the 'missing-case statistics' of native Americans through extremely introspective story-telling. He voices his judgement against offenders in the most cinematically-satiating approach. Gil Birmingham, who plays the victim's father, gets to act out a few well-written scenes (especially the one at the very end). A few loose ends could have been sealed off better: there's a mention of a friend who dropped off the victim at the location where the crime took place - never to be seen or mentioned anywhere else. Also, the state of relationship between Cory and his wife was largely painted in shades of ambiguity. Nonetheless, these minuscule drawbacks should not deter you from giving 'Wind River' a watch as Sheridan is arguably one of the best yarn-spinners of our times.Verdict: Superb character-driven thriller!",Wind River

77,Troy_Campbell,"A slow burning, provocative gem.",9,11 August 2017,"There has been next to no fanfare for the release of this murder mystery. Which is surprising, considering the talent involved in front of the camera (Jeremy Renner, Elizabeth Olsen) and behind it (writer-director Taylor Sheridan). Fresh from joining the ranks of top-tiered screenwriters after the amazing one-two punch of Sicario and Hell or High Water, Sheridan continues his stellar run with a heart-wrenching study of loss and grief wrapped in a taut crime thriller narrative. Also having a crack at directing, Sheridan allows the snowy Wyoming setting to completely envelope the characters in a world that feels like it has no exits, both physically and emotionally. When this Native American community is hit with a homicide it feels like another tragedy in a long line of tragedies; their shock is replaced with deeper sorrow, their outrage is replaced with solemn defeat. Entering the scene like a fish out of water, Olsen's junior FBI agent Jane Banner must traverse the tricky cultural complexities if she's to understand the clues in front of her. Luckily she has Renner's local hunter Cory Lambert to assist, himself battling with a past family disaster. Renner and Olsen are both in terrific form, the former hiding his grief under a stoic veneer, the latter balancing big-city attitude with a genuine desire to find justice for the victim. Veteran character actor Gil Birmingham is also superb as a father unsure of how to deal with his earth-shattering loss. If this all sounds a bit heavy, well it is, but Sheridan's careful to inject a healthy dose of suspense and mild action to keep the drama gripping rather than overbearing; the finale in particular turns the movie on its head in an unpredictable but extremely effective manner. An intelligent, slow burning and provocative viewing that enthrals from start to finish, Wind River is an understated gem that deserves an audience.",Wind River

80,frankde-jong,The chemistry between the two cops is a little paternalistic,6,17 January 2020,"Taylor Sheridan likes to combine the Western genre with actual social engagement. In ""Hell or high water"" (2016, David Mackenzie), for which he wrote the scenario, the film is situated in Texas and its theme is the banking crises of 2008. ""Wind river"" (for which he wrote the scenario AND was the director) is situated in Wyoming and its theme is the difficult position of native Americans.Through the films of John Ford we identify Westerns with locations such as Monument valley. Personally I do like Westerns situated in the North of the United States very much. Think of films such as ""McCabe & Mrs Miller"" (1971, Robert Altman) and ""The revenant"" (2015, Alejandro Inarritu). ""Wind river"" is one of those films, and the landscape is really beautiful. Good work of cinematographer Ben Richardson, who also shot ""Beasts of the Southern wild"" (2012, Benh Zeitlin).The theme of the difficult possition of native Americans is illustrated by the case of the rape and murder of a young girl. The sheriff of the indian territory can only act as both the victim and the offender are native Americans. Against offenders from outside the territory he is powerless and needs the assistence of the FBI. Because of this a lot of crimes against native Americans remain unresolved.In ""Wind river"" the assistence of the FBI comes in the form of an inexperienced female agent Jane Banner (Elizabeth Olsen). Her cooperation with the experienced local guy Cory Lambert (jeremy Renner) is the weak point of the movie. In many detective movies the tension between the experienced (local) cop and the inexperienced (but often better educated) cop from outside is one of the driving forces. During the movie not only the crime is solved but there also grows a mutual understanding and appreciation (for example ""In the heat of the night"" (1967, Norman Jewison) and ""Mississippi burning"" (1988, Alan Parker)). In ""Wind river"" Jane Banner proves that she is brave, but she never really contributes to the solution of the crime. Combined with the fact that Jane is a woman, the film tends to a kind of paternalism.I already mentioned ""McCabe & Mrs Miller"" (1971, Robert Altman). Only after seeing ""Wind river"" one can value the utility of a brothel in such a lonely town in the North.",Wind River
81,ketgup83,Highly recommended,8,11 October 2017,"There will be time when you just need to some good movie that will keep you engaged till the end. Wind River is one such film. I felt good after watching this film which had everything going in its favor. Wind River tells the story of a FBI investigator (played by Elizabeth Olsen of The Avengers fame) who seeks help from a local huntsman to solve a cold-blooded murder of a 18 year girl in Wind River Indian Reservation in Wyoming, US.Directed by Taylor Sheridan, Wind River is a perfect crime thriller that has some wow moments. The film begins on a slow note which will eventually wrap you in its stunning visuals and interesting plot. The screenplay is crispy and will keep you hooked on to screen. The movie does have some shallow moments but it is compensated by electrifying climax and strong performance.The cinematography is eye-catching while background score gels with the mood of the film. Jeremy Renner is superb as agent Cory Lamber. The brilliant actor is ruthless when it comes to seek justice. Elizabeth Olsen proves that she is more than a eye-candy. She shows the sign of maturity and proves her credibility as an actor.Overall, I thoroughly watching Wind River and would highly recommend it. Excellent 4/5",Wind River
82,areatw,Solid and engrossing but a bit sluggish in parts,6,22 April 2019,"'Wind River' is a well-made film with some excellent acting performances and an engaging plot. It is also visually stunning with the rural setting providing some beautiful scenic shots and contributing to what is a very atmospheric film. The characters are well-developed and the plot is convincing enough to keep the audience invested in what happens, despite the fact the film goes through a few too many dull patches.The occasional slow patch is the only real weakness of the film, but it does affect the overall flow and ability of the film to sustain tension. These parts of the film don't really contribute to the development of the story and could have been trimmed or even cut from the film entirely. However, providing you have some patience to sit through some of the duller moments, there is plenty to admire about 'Wind River'.",Wind River

Neverless, the challenges presented can be overcome except when they involve criminal activities. Out there a person must rely on themselves and on the goodwill of others but at the same time you are at the mercy of both. Some do better than others we soon learn.

When the action does come it is hard-hitting and shockingly real.There is not much of a mystery here, don't expect too much of a breadcrumb chase through the woods.The film does take its time and isn't particularly complicated, and may leave some feeling a little underwhelmed.

87,educallejero,Good movie. Good ending. Good performances. Bad taste?,6,23 July 2019,"The story is ok, good. The scenes are often cliché, but some have interesting monologues about suffering and moving on from tragedies, etc. We get a crime and the difficulties to persecute it (geographic, weather, politics, resources, social dynamics) and a more or less slow but really well done process to unravel the truth. The acting is solid at least, with some great moments.What's the bad taste? After the movie ends, we see that a point of the movie is tell the story of the injustice that native American women suffer (and the fact that nobody is paying attention to it).
Why then the story is told by two white leads?
I get the FBI agent, totally, but why Renner then? The story is about Native Americans (and particularly women) suffering, but we experience it by Renner and Olsen, two whites, totally empathic towards these crimes. So, we kind of don't see much of that apathy towards the problem the movie is supposedly denouncing (there are a couple of lines about how the FBI won't care, but it's never clear that is more than typical bureaucracy and not something against the Native American). Also, we get the birth of a friendship/romance between them that gets in the way (more than anything because it is portrayed in the most cliché ways), and makes it lose the focus.
In the end, I still left the movie interested in the problem and subject, so the movie succeeds, even if I question some of the moves and decisions taken.",Wind River

90,rockman182,Wind River (2017),8,26 August 2017,"Taylor Sheridan really broke out with his script for Sicario. I'm not the biggest fan of the film although I admit its quite good. Then he wrote the script for Hell or High Water which felt like a country styled thriller that we'd see from the Coen Brothers. Here, he comes not only writing but this time directing Wind River. I didn't know much about the film before going into it. I have to say this is Sheridan's best work. Its so sharp, strong, thrilling, and horrific at the same time. I'm still in thought of what I've just seen. People really need to check this out.The film takes place in the Wind River reservation in Wyoming. In the freezing cold terrain a U.S. Fish and Wildlife Agent stumbles across the frozen dead body of an 18 year old Native American girl. Upon further investigation it is revealed that she had been sexually assaulted and died in the cold. With the help of an FBI special agent, the pair try to figure out what exactly occurred while trying to bring justice to all parties involved. The film is pretty much a modern but loose noir that becomes an intense barn burning thriller as it goes along.Jeremy Renner and Elizabeth Olsen work together (not for the first time), and both are quite excellent and very convincing in their roles. I LOVE Elizabeth Olsen and love that she took on a role where she gets to show off a bit of range. Wonderful in a role as a brace and committed agent who still can get distracted by her surroundings and let the harrowing details of the case get to her. Renner is just a badass, a great sharpshooter. One of the other highlights of the film is the locale setting of this. Absolutely heightens the experience.The film has disturbing moments (revelation of the case). Sheridan once again explores mystery by diving into the pure evil and the justice that comes with it. Tense shootouts, bloody moments, and a thrilling third act; Sheridan masters it all. Its really sharply written. I thought the film meandered a bit at the end but that's really the only thing I can pick out from an otherwise fun ride. This film didn't get a lot of buzz this year which is slightly outrageous.8/10",Wind River
91,jon.h.ochiai,What Makes Hero,10,20 August 2017,"""Wind River"" is absolutely powerful. So is Jeremy Renner. Elizabeth Olsen is sublime. Writer and Director Taylor Sheridan's ""Wind River"" tells the tale of karma, of justice. Renner plays Fish and Game hunter Cory Lambert on the Indian Reservation in Wyoming – Wind River. Cory is strong, sad, and lives by a code. Cory's marksman mastery hints of the military sniper past, although never disclosed. Olsen is the green, rather almost frozen FBI Agent Jane Banner, summoned from Las Vegas via her hometown in Florida, to investigate the heinous murder of a young woman in the sub-zero Wind River. Cinematographer Ben Richardson captures Nature's austere and unforgiving power. Conversely, Sheridan explores the power of forgiveness in people in ""Wind River"". Cory is estranged from his distant wife Wilma, played by strong Julia Jones, who is American Indian. They share custody of their 10 year- old son Casey, played by radiant Teo Briones. Both Cory and Wilma still grieve for their 16 year-old daughter Emily, who was tragically murdered 3 years ago. ""Wind River"" opens on the frozen night as the beautiful young woman Natalie, played by bright Kelsey Asbille, runs bare foot and bloody across the snow pack. She would not survive. Cory discovers her body, doing his job as animal predator hunter. His painful visage is of recognition. Natalie's father Martin, played by compassionate Gil Birmingham, hugs and cries when Cory comes to the house. Cory weeps in silence as well. I cried. Later Cory tells Martin the amazing story. When Cory was healing over the death of Emily, he took a seminar. He said that what the seminar leader said always stayed with him. The seminar leader said, ""There is good news, and there is bad news"" The bad news: Cory's life will never be the same, his daughter was gone. Then he got this. He tells his friend Martin, ""Take the pain"" That is a way to keep the memory of his daughter in his heart, alive. Wow. ""Wind River"" is about the lightness and darkness of humanity. Cory and Martin embody the best. However, life can be the paradox of great beauty and ugly. The ugly is the senseless and heartless murder of a 19 year-old woman. Along the darker path Olsen's fierce idealist FBI Agent Jane finds her partner in Cory to bring Natalie's murderers to justice. Although, Natalie was brutally beaten and raped, she died of the severe cold— the frozen air in her lungs killed her. The local coroner tells Jane of this finding. This is an outrage to Jane, because this jeopardizes the murder investigation. The costs are too high. It's just not right. Renner and Olsen are amazing in their focused partnership. In the poignant scene Cory tells Jane about the murder of his daughter. Renner is fearlessly vulnerable and authentic courage. Olsen is naked in her humanity and compassion as she weeps staring into the bathroom mirror. There is the touching scene toward the end as Jane suffers envisioning what it was like for beaten Natalie to run 6 miles in the snow. Renner's Cory eloquently acknowledged Natalie, ""That's a warrior."" Cory and Jane are the true warriors as captured by Renner and Olsen. Cory and Jane seek justice in the darker side of humanity, the side that is cruel and dismisses human life. In the end is it about justice or karma? T.S. Eliot wrote in ""The Hollow Men"": ""This is the way the world ends—Not with a bang with whimper."" Even if it does it is all very sad. Renner's Cory knows this sadness, and is uncompromising in fighting for what is right, what is good. ""Wind River"" is my favorite movie of the year, because it acknowledges both the beauty and ugliness of the world, and also believes in its heroes. Our heroes always inspire us to be greater than. Now that is a world worth living in.",Wind River

93,cultfilmfan,Wind River,9,9 September 2017,"Wind River, is a film that certainly packs an emotional wallop and punch to the gut and will be sure to linger with you quite awhile after you have seen it. This is accomplished not just simply because this is a film and filmmaker in total control of their craft and just filling the project with emotionally rich and well developed characters, a haunting yet beautiful musical score and also a sense of tension as well as dealing with the grief and the hurdles that these characters have to go through as well as incorporating a message that because of it's resonance and truth now more than ever is sure to connect with many people who look at the news on a daily basis and know just generally about the true subject matter of this film. By divulging this I am not giving any spoilers away for this film, but it is indeed based on true events about a murder and rape outside of a Native American community to a young Native American woman. The film takes place and I assumed that actual events also took place in Wyoming, but as a Canadian who has never been to Wyoming, I can certainly tell you that missing and murdered Aboriginal women is nothing new in Canada and has dominated and been a big part of the news over the years and sadly decades even. The last federal election we had here in Canada, this was an issue that was brought up by the opposition parties against then prime minister Stephen Harper, who with his Conservative party seemed a little chilly if not downright cold on the matter where there was little to no follow up, or investigations to these murders and missing girls across our country. While, I generally do not consider myself to be a member, or fan of the Liberal party which is currently in power under Justin Trudeau, I do hope however that they follow up with their initial persistence during rounds of parliamentary question periods and look into these deaths and murders with not only more resources, but also funding and the proper authorities to follow through with it. Are these a case of outright racism against these girls, or are there more underlying problems that may have to do with it? Here in Canada as well as depicted in the state of Wyoming, here in this film, it shows the true and yet sad state of how society in many ways has failed it's Native population. I am not sure how publicized it was at the time, but these days you can find much information about the residential schools that these young Natives were sent to several decades ago and how these schools affected them severely psychologically and perhaps in many other damaging ways as well. I know that within the Aboriginal communities alcohol and drug abuse can be a major problem and I say this because as depicted with some of the characters in this film, I think a lot of these individuals have not only been discriminated against within their own communities, but also by the governments who have sworn to protect them and this unfortunately has led to communities and areas that are supposed to be well funded and taken care of, but instead there has been cases of corrupt leaders who are stealing money away from their own people not to benefit others, but instead to lavish themselves with yearly bonuses and fancy living. The homes were these people are living are often run down and dilapidated and are in no means safe to call proper homes, or should even pass the health bill for safe living. I feel that these individuals often feel like there is no hope for them and often society has shunned against them which has caused them to turn to suicide and other means of abuse to one's self including high volumes of not only suicide, but also of alcohol, drug use and in many cases it is no wonder that these poor people can not survive on anything less than their monthly welfare checks. Hopefully soon the governments both here in Canada and over in America, will realize what a national problem will be and already is and I hope they will be swift to act and actually accomplish something to greatly benefit these people. The film also deals with the subject of grief and loss which is something that I think any audience member who sees this film can agree with. It shows that time may go by, but these wounds are internal and we may come around eventually to accepting certain things, but we will always have that deep loss and void that perhaps only true healing can fix. This is a powerful film fuelled by a passionate and yet moving screenplay and anchored by terrific performances and direction. This is certainly a film to see and also talk about after and perhaps get involved, maybe even within your own community because this is a problem that needs to be addressed and ignoring it any longer will just escalate things to an even greater tipping point.",Wind River
94,carbuff,"Conventional, predictable, but excellent cinematography and solid.",5,7 September 2018,"Overall, nothing really new in ""Wind River"", although the outstanding scenery all by itself makes it arguably worth the watch. The entire story is well-trod ground with minimal originality; however, all of the acting is much better than workmanlike, and, again, it's mostly filmed out in nature at it's finest. The dialogue is quite heavy-handed, unsubtle, and melodramatic, which, aside from the lack of fundamental originality, is my biggest problem with this film. I don't necessarily expect a murder mystery to be light and witty, but this script was too much nonstop preaching from beginning to end. In the end, if you're looking for a solid, conventional murder mystery with very high production values, ""Wind River"" might not be a bad choice. On the other hand, this film will never be a classic, because it doesn't bring anything significantly new to the table at all (and it's not like I missed the Native American element either, as if that were even somehow possible given that it's hammered into your head in a such a blunt fashion).",Wind River

96,bankofmarquis,"Thoughtful, moody - AND GOOD - murder Mystery",8,1 September 2017,"The back 1/2 of August has traditionally been a dumping ground for bad motion pictures.  One exception to this was last year when the deserved Oscar nominated film HELL OR HIGH WATER was released (if you still haven't caught up with this, I highly recommend you do).  So when I saw that the writer of HHW, Taylor Sheridan, was coming out with another modern sheriff murder mystery, I was intrigued to say the least.And, I am happy to report, that this film did not disappoint.  While it is not at the level of HHW, it certainly is a thoughtful, provocative murder mystery that is a refreshing change from the normal SuperHero, GGI-fests that festoon the cineplex throughout the course of the summer months.Written and Directed by Sheridan (the screenwriter of HHW and SICARIO), WIND RIVER tells the tale of a murder on the Wind River Indian Reservation in Wyoming.  Coming in to investigate is young, city girl, Florida native, Elizabeth Olsen who teams up with aTribal Police Captain (Graham Greene) and a veteran tracker (Jeremy Renner) to find out what happened.This could have been a by-the-book murder mystery with the naive, ""fish-out-of-water"" Olsen learning to love and understand the world she is thrust into, but in the hands (and pen) of Sheridan, it is much, much more.  Sheridan creates a mood throughout this film, one of slow, lingering dread and hopelessness - and how he accomplishes this was intriguing to me.  He uses the setting of the Indian Reservation to show the ""smallness"" of the people living there, juxtaposing scenes of vast, wild, cold wilderness with scenes of squalor in the settlement of Native American people living there.The acting is solid - Olsen is turning into a very good actress and her performance sets the right tone.  Greene is, as always, a steady hand on the screen with a pragmatic approach to the inhabitants of the Reservation, but it is Jeremy Renner as the quiet, taciturn tracker who has a loss of his own that parallels the murder investigation, that shines.  I've always liked Renner and was high on his potential after his breakout performance in THE HURT LOCKER in 2008.  While his performances in the blockbusters that followed have been solid, but not spectacular - you saw glimpses of it in films like THE TOWN - but I've felt that he never quite lived up to that potential - until now.  This is a very strong performance (falling just short of Oscar material) but one that anchors this film and mirrors the mood that Sheridan sets up through the location of WIND RIVER.Not the fastest moving of films, but a thoughtful, intelligent mystery that left me grateful for a film with some meat on the bone after a summer of ""Cotton Candy"" action flicksLetter Grade:  B+8 (out of 10) stars and you can take that to the Bank (ofMarquis)",Wind River

103,msbreviews,Rating: A-,8,28 November 2017,"I will start with Jeremy Renner because he undoubtedly steals the show. He is able to transform himself into an entirely different person, consequently delivering his career-best performance. Renner proves that he is more than just a mere superhero, he is a highly capable actor who brings out an astonishingly emotional display.Cory Lambert's script helps a lot Renner's performance since Taylor Sheridan's writing is, as usual, brilliant. Cory has an extremely disturbing and tragic past which the audience only understands near the beginning of the third act, hence elevating the character's backstory into something much more intriguing.The screenplay is wonderfully written. Sheridan is effective in avoiding forced exposition scenes with sharp dialogues, every conversation feels genuine. Additionally, some fantastic character development scenes support a truly captivating story that never has a dull moment due to its pretty well-controlled pacing and tone.If the writing is not enough for you to appreciate Sheridan's talent, then his work as the director will surely convince you. The action-heavy third act is amazingly filmed, it is packed with some unbelievable shootout and chasing scenes, including some flawless editing that helps the film's overall flow.The cinematography (Ben Richardson) feels as real as it could be, the setting is just beautiful and its colors brighten up the movie. Finally, the soundtrack really captures the environment of the snow mountains with some memorable tracks accompanying the narrative.This is one of the best films of this year, but I still have some issues with it. My main problem with the screenplay is based on the mystery itself, ""who killed the girl""? Even though this is a character-driven movie, its build-up surrounding the murder loses some of its impact when the moment of truth is finally revealed. The characters related to the killing feel a bit cliché and too superficial, so I do feel somewhat disappointed.You are probably wondering why I didn't write about Elizabeth Olsen yet. Well, that is because I have a nit-picky thing with her character. Olsen is great, she truly is! She gives a very compelling and passionate performance that will definitely offer her more opportunities for bigger projects in the near future.However, I think her character could have been given a more solid backstory to help the audience connect better with her. Jane Banner is far from the ""damsel in distress"" cliché, in fact, she is able to stand her own against her attackers, but I find her essence very shallow.All in all, Wind River is one of my favorite movies of 2017! Jeremy Renner has his best performance yet and Elizabeth Olsen amazingly supports him, despite her character's simple background. Taylor Sheridan elevates everyone and everything with his marvelous writing and skillful direction. Stunning cinematography, an extraordinary score, a great protagonist and an extremely captivating story that never fails to entertain its viewers.MSB Reviews - If you enjoy this review, please follow my blog :)",Wind River

105,maccas-56367,Powerful,9,21 January 2019,"I unexpectedly loved this. Easily Jeremy Renner's best performance. The landscape was as much a character as anyone else in the film too. The snow and isolation added a real sense of dread and atmosphere to the movie.Excellent pace and plot. Elizabeth Olsen definitely has some good acting chops also and shares great onscreen chemistry with Renner. Is it the happiest movie? No. It's pretty dark and has many confronting themes, even for a movie of its kind. But it was satisfying. The final act was jaw on the floor type stuff - I definitely let out an audible ""wow"" during the last 20 minutes.And then to top it all off, it's inspired by actual events and highlighted the plight of the many missing Native American women whom no statistics are recorded for.Powerful. Emotional. The best film I've seen this year.. so far.",Wind River
106,Andres-Camara,Consigue rehacerse. Get re-done,6,16 June 2018,"¿A qué me refiero? Pues a que al principio, la película se entretiene demasiado con planos que no cuentan nada. Ha rodado mucho y necesita meter planos por aquello de creer que el ritmo se consigue por meter más planos, no se dan cuenta que el ritmo se consigue interiormente.Luego la película coge fuerza, no te das cuenta y ha pasado otra hora y llega el final. Un final que por cierto, me parece muy bueno. Aunque sea políticamente incorrecto decirlo, pero se lo ha ganado.Los actores están todos estupendos. Te crees a los malos y a los buenos. No creerte a los malos habría sido muy malo, pero si lo consiguen.La iluminación con lo complicado que es iluminar la nieve y que no te queme la vista, está muy bien. Debería ser más fría de lo que es. Es demasiado lejana no fríaToda la película es demasiado lejana. Eso es por no tener claro dónde poner la cámara. No te deja que te metas en la película. Cuando estas entrando mete un plano lejano y te saca y eso es constante. Por lo menos el director, sabe corregirse y levantar la película. Bueno al menos deja buen sabor de boca.
What do I mean? Well, at the beginning, the film is entertained too much with plans that do not count at all. He has shot a lot and needs to put plans because of believing that the rhythm is achieved by putting more shots, they do not realize that the rhythm is achieved internally.Then the film takes force, you do not realize and another hour has passed and the end comes. An end that by the way, it seems very good. Although it is politically incorrect to say it, but he has earned it.The actors are all great. You believe the bad and the good. Not believing the bad guys would have been very bad, but if they succeed.Lighting with how complicated it is to illuminate the snow and not to burn your eyes, is very good. It should be colder than it is. It's too far, not coldThe whole movie is too far away. That's because it's not clear where to put the camera. It does not let you get into the movie. When you are entering a distant plane and takes you out and that is constant. At least the director knows how to correct himself and lift the film.Well at least it leaves a good taste in the mouth",Wind River

108,Alexander_Blanchett,Jeremy Renner's best performance,8,8 October 2017,"Why does nobody speak about Jeremy Renner's tremendous performance in this? That should have gotten enormous early buzz as he hardly has been any better during his career. Its a great crime mystery with an original setting. Its shocking that this is actually based on a true story. Taylor Sheridan chose the right screenplay for his directional debut and it turns out he is just as skilled as a director as he is as a writer. He chose his cast wisely. Jeremy Renner is absolutely outstanding as the troubled hunter. Elisabeth Olsen delivers a good performance however her character was a bit underwritten and she was not constantly believable. Still its a charismatic enough performance. Graham Greene gave another beautiful and humble performance as the police chief. The atmosphere works perfectly. I liked Nick Cave's score a lot which added a lot to the film. The screenplay is excellently written and its great how Sheridan builds up tense and fits in the right twists at the right moment. Definitely a little gem. Surely not flawless but effective, especially if you like thriller and mysteries.",Wind River

Sheridan's films follow people and lives of people that are forgotten by the whole world. Even though we are not used to this kind of life the compelling characters feels so real that the negligence of the world over these lives hit you real hard.

Taylor Sheridan just knows how to write a really solid movie, and the acting performances and cinematography are very good. While it is categorically a mystery and has a particularly thrilling final act, at its core Wind River is a story of loss, family, the West, and Native Americans. It delivers emotional blows genuinely through Renner and the family he speaks to. The movie considered the traditional Western survival story in an intelligent new manner, by combining the difficulty of Native American life and rights with the perspective of family and specifically parents. Nothing groundbreaking, just a very intelligent and well-made movie that is very worth a watch.",Wind River
113,ridi-arahan,"Fit survives and weak falls, that's the law of the land",8,21 March 2021,"What worked:
You know there are movies that are more like alive than the others, not because they are closer to reality but also because they are captured in the real form possible. It's one of those movies. The strongest aspects of the movie has to be the screenplay and I am quiet impressed by the writing which is repeatedly excelled in movies like Sicario and Hellor high water. He deserves another appreciation for the direction making it a very fruitful experience. Jeremy Renner is one of those underrated actors that has been phenomenal in this movie, an acting treat. The movie is visually appealing and very well executed, edited as well. Overall, a movie that deserves multiple viewing, and I found it equally enjoyable in my multiple viewing because of the fine narrative and acting.What did not work:
Probably, the makers could have filled out the dots and blanks to make it more lively and reveal the mystery. It's understandable that the movie demands us to read between the lines and that's fine, but giving us the illustrations as well would have still been an equally fine decision
Final verdict: highly recommended",Wind River

The plot was difficult to figure out and the characters less compelling than I had hoped. The acting, for what the material gave them, was good. Jeremy Rinner was okay as the sad hero figure, Graham Greene is always great and Elizabeth Olsen as the out of place FBI agent was probably the most well-drawn character in the movie. I just didn't think it was enough for high cinema and for the reviews I had seen. The scenery was nice if you like a lot of snow and people flying around on snow mobiles.

119,romanorum1,"Murder on an Indian Reservation Where ""You're On Your Own""",8,7 January 2020,"On the Wind River Indian Reservation in Wyoming, a teenage girl, Natalie Hanson (Kelsey Asbille Chow) runs without winter clothing and barefoot in the snow. A shot rings out, and she falls to the ground. But she gets up and tries to run. It is obvious that her time is over.In the next scene, we are introduced to Cory Lambert (Jeremy Renner) as he shoots one of the wolves preying upon a small herd of sheep. Employed by the US Fish and Wildlife Service, he is an expert tracker and hunter. Cory has a young son, and is divorced from his Indian wife, Wilma (Julia Jones). When we next see him, Cory is tracking a mountain lion that killed a steer. After that he comes upon the body of the dead girl, six miles from the nearest dwelling. Three years earlier Cory had lost his 16 year-old daughter, Emily, after a party. She too was found dead in the snow by a sheep herder. The circumstances of Emily's death are not known, but Natalie and Emily were best friends.Cory summons the tribal police, including Ben Shoyo (Graham Greene). Since the FBI has jurisdiction over homicides on Indian reservations, the nearest agent to the area is summoned: young Jane Banner (Elizabeth Olsen). Although well-meaning, she is totally unprepared for the ordeal; she has neither appropriate winter clothing nor knowledge of American indian culture. She hires Cory to track down Matt Rayburn (Jon Bernthal), Natalie's boyfriend.Past the half-way part, we see in flashback Natalie with Matt together. The two were obviously in love, and Matt had plans to marry the pretty Indian girl. While tracking to find the whereabouts of Matt, Cory learns that the only folks in the area are the drill site security guards, located in trailers a few miles away. Cory wants to go to the trailers where Matt lives. After separating from the tribal police group, Cory discovers Matt's body in the snow. Meanwhile there is tension between the tribal police and drill site security guards. And like a gunfight in the old West, bullets will settle affairs.This modern western (or neo-western) was directed by Taylor Sheridan. Sheridan's film is the third of his trilogy: Sicario (2015), Hell or High water (2016), and Wind River (2017). According to Sheridan, ""Wind River"" was made to highlight the sexual assaults and disappearances of Native American women on Indian reservation lands. Although the Wind River Indian reservation lands are beautiful and scenic, the film conveys the harsh realities of those who reside there. The acting is admirable all-around. Cory adequately conveys his stoicism and his hidden pain, but remains a strong man one should not mess with. He works within his code of honor all the way. But the blueprint of the film is the bleak and relentless winter landscape that dominates the actions of all of the characters. See it.",Wind River

121,CineMuseFilms,"a standard vengeance thriller with solid storytelling, exciting visuals, and well-crafted acting",7,17 August 2017,"The vengeance thriller genre has always been popular because its core emotion is universal and forgiveness has human limits. There are many ways to translate this theme to film and most involve 'eye for an eye' violence which is the narrative heart of Wind River (2017). The stand out feature of this film lies in the way it deploys stunning cinematography to tell a reality-based story with rising tension and emotional depth.While protecting livestock from wolves in the snow-covered Wyoming mountains, wildlife hunter Cory Lambert (Jeremy Renner) discovers the frozen body of a barefoot 18-year old girl. The crime scene is on Indian Reservation land and beyond local jurisdiction so rookie FBI agent Jane Banner (Elizabeth Olsen) is sent to investigate. Her inexperience is quickly obvious and she calls on Lambert's hunting skills and knowledge of the Mountain ranges. The investigation unfolds amidst deep distrust that locals have for outsiders and Lambert's grief over the recent loss of his own daughter. His connection with the Indian parents of the missing girl adds a culturally sensitive and emotional layer to what would otherwise be just an action-based thriller.There is little in this story that would earn praise for originality. Its pace is unhurried and the central characters are stereotypes that we have seen before. But it is outstanding in the way the majestic mountain-scapes are integrated into the storytelling through breathtaking panoramic aerial photography. Treacherous weather and the effects of sub-zero temperatures on the human body add to the hidden dangers and the impoverishment of life on native American Reservations. Lambert and Olsen are well-cast as two conflicted loners, giving character performances that drive the film without grandstanding. Dialogue is minimalist as you might expect in an isolated mountain community and a female FBI agent is not going to change that. While shootouts are obligatory in this genre, the violence is swift and essential to the narrative. The film's suspense curve maintains audience engagement until justice and vengeance are served.While this film comes with little fanfare, it has solid storytelling, exciting visuals, and well-crafted acting. It also has a subdued political theme not fully evident until the sobering on-screen message that, even today, no data is collected on the number of American Indian women reported missing. This disturbing insight into the status of today's native American population is balanced by the positive feminist message that is portrayed in a young female heroine using her wits without the hyper-violence seen in so many recent releases.",Wind River
122,skay_baltimore,Could have been a LOT better,4,14 January 2018,"This movie is actually two movies. One without the FBI agent, and one with the FBI agent. The movie prior to the introduction of the FBI agent had some good moments, and appeared to be heading in the right direction. After that, it went downhill. Quickly. To say that she just doesn't fit is an understatement. It seems as if the makers of this film intentionally played upon that fact, but in doing so they failed. Miserably. They chose to make her out to be some sort of heroine, but in reality she is the reason that several really good characters ended up dying. Needlessly. A chain is only as strong as its weakest link, and she is, without a doubt, the weakest link. Consequently, the film breaks down and falls apart, rather than building upon the power generated prior to her arrival. If ever a film needed an alternative ending (and middle), Wind River is it. Maybe some day a good director will do a remake, and allow this movie to be what it could have been but wasn't. The message of this film is fine; the medium through which the message was delivered was tragically flawed.",Wind River
123,stevenrotherforth,"""Wolves don't kill unlucky deer. They kill the weak ones!""",9,6 July 2018,"Wind RiverThe title of this review is a line lifted straight from the movie.
A line that really hit home as it sums up the characters who inhabit Wind River.
A place where people have been forgotten by their own government and left to fend for themselves.
In this mesmerising movie written and directed by Taylor Sheridan, Jeremy Renner plays a hunter who helps FBI agent Jane Banner solve the murder of a local Native American girl who's body is found in the frozen wilderness.
Banner played by Elisabeth Olsen is the fish out of water who struggles to connect with the towns folk.
Cory Lambert (Renner) comes to her aid when he finds that the girls death reflects events from his own past.Wind River is a truly captivating movie that is fuelled by superb dialogue and heart felt performances by an excellent cast.
Renner has never been better.
Olsen proves she is far more capable than playing just a Marvel superheroine.
Whilst both leads could easily make their living just being an Avenger it is great that they've had the chance to stretch those acting legs.
Supporting cast are also strong and it is perhaps Gil Birmingham's performance as grieving father Martin that steals the show.
A brief cameo performance from Jon Bernthal was a welcome surprise but all involved can be commended for making this a completely immersive piece of entertainment.
Wind River is a wonderful movie on the eye. Cinematography is breathtaking with some stunning shots of the surrounding landscapes.
The weather is fully realised on screen helping drive the harsh environment into the minds of the audience. We can almost feel the cold.
Sound is also very good.
Dialogue is often muffled, giving the impression those on screen have lost their way.
They're broken people where only the strongest remain alive. 
Surround sound effects help create a true feeling of the elements. Wind and snow envelops the listener as does the sound of wildlife.
When the action set pieces do eventually arrive it is jarring as loud gunshots are a contrast from the slow burn drama.Wind River has a truly satisfying finale which never really presents itself until the very end.
The ""who done it?"" factor is not present in this movie. There's no guessing the killer twenty minutes into the move here!

Forewarned would have been forearmed. (For those with perseverance, there is some brief explosive action about 25 minutes from the end.)There's an absolute lack of dramatic tension here. Someone points a camera and someone presumably says ""Action"", but it feels like the director is a passive observer who is willing to let things develop at a snail's pace.

126,Mike_Devine,This 'River' will chill you to the bone,9,4 September 2017,"While a good script is usually needed for a film to be considered ""good,"" a great script can make a film memorable. Taylor Sheridan's 'Wind River' benefits from this, just as his previous screenplays have ('Hell or High Water,' 'Sicario'). The film is set in the windswept, springtime snow peaks of Wyoming, as a Native American reservation deals with a horrific crime involving the murder of a teenage girl.On its surface, 'River' is a suspenseful, somewhat procedural murder mystery thriller. At its core, 'River' is dark drama that looks at the struggles faced by Native Americans - particularly women - as they fight for survival in the desolate wilderness of the American west. Specifically, we follow the story of U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service agent Cory Lambert (Jeremy Renner) as he is pulled into a case that is all too familiar to him. Then, enter Vegas-based FBI agent Jane Banner (Elizabeth Olsen), who is tasked with the case, given the fact that the crime was committed on federal land, and it quickly becomes clear that she is out of her comfort zone - figuratively and literally - and must rely on Lambert to make progress.'River' is filmed beautifully, as the harsh environment inserts itself at every moment possible. The landscape and weather sets apart what could otherwise be a semi-straightforward thriller, and Renner's and Olsen's characters are visibly the mercy of the elements, which heightens the sense of excitement and danger. While the first half of 'River' is a bit slow, this build is necessary so that the climactic act has that much more of an impact, even though some of the plot that unfolds can be seen from a ways away.Aside from the obvious parts of the film that make it what it is, there are core themes that are present throughout 'River.' From dealing with loss to seeking retribution, understanding cultural differences and allowing karma to take hold, these themes are central to the film. There's also a fair amount of symbolism, with the mountain lion being somewhat of a barometer for how Renner's character evolves throughout the film. Renner and Olsen do an amazing job conveying pain and passion through their performances, and while they are the most prominent actors here, strong supporting roles including Apesanahkwat as tribal patriarch Dan Crowheart and what amounts to basically a cameo from Jon Bernthal are also important to the storyline.'Wind River' is a quiet, understated powerhouse thriller that is slowly but surely finding an audience, and it certainly deserves a number of nods come awards season, including ""Best Picture.""",Wind River

128,coreyjdenford,Hawkeye hits the spot.,8,7 September 2017,"This review of Wind River is spoiler free**** (4/5)TAYLOR SHERIDAN HAS two sides, one is the well praised Oscar nominated writer of Sicario and Hell or High Water, two highly successful crime capers which succeeded in presenting grim images of an America that doesn't exist anymore, if it ever did just from his words. Which were then transferred on screen by Denis Villeneuve and David Mackenzie. The second is a director which leads us to his 'proper' debut - shiftily erasing 2011s torture porn feature Vile from his CV. Wind River. A brutal story of a murder that happens on the Wind River Reservation Park in the mountainous regions of Wyoming. With it he proves that he is one of the best storytellers of our time...The opening is striking: Cory Lambert (Jeremy Renner) a veteran game tracker at the reservation stumbles across the body of a dead girl, he teams up with Jane Banner (Elizabeth Olsen) an FBI agent who's not used to cold weather who helps him solve the case. Here Sheridan switches the tone to a whodunit thriller, the duo go around town to ask questions, who could be the suspect? Why this girl? What happened to her? The mysteries pile up, and Sheridan deals with each of them one step at a time picking a route to go with and gradually adding up clues. Sheridan's main focus is on the Native American community of the town - that's not a negative, if anything it's a positive, throughout he brutally enforces the message that anyone can be the target for murder. He gives it the human approach, his script deals with depression, there's a moment of a mother cutting herself while flooded in tears, and an upset father who wants this case solved quickly. Cory's story is a powerful one too, in the field he essentially strikes you as a Sherlock in the snow. On the inside he's just suffered a divorce from his ex-wife so he has to look after his young son, but there is a larger hole in his heart, a powerful message which Renner's emotional performance helps to convey. A performance that's evenly matched by Olsen, her's is a flawed yet powerful character, as the only major authority figure out there she must get used to the snowy setting if she wants to understand the clues in front of her, but as the evidence piles up she goes in for the kill.Meanwhile, like Sicario and Hell or High Water he succeeds in making a use of the beautiful wide open sprawls of the snowy forests and the haunting quiet of the wild. Keeping the triple threat of the brutality, the bleakness and the darkness. Sadly, Wind River is not without its flaws, it suffers from American despair, it's less inner city, more inner wilderness and sometimes the film suffers from that. Despite that, this is a wildly enchanting, heartfelt and confident debut which keeps the thrills tight and thoroughly engaging. VERDICT Sheridan's debut is a heartfelt, moving and compelling crime thriller which erupts right from the opening reel, filled with excellent performances and non-stop thrills.",Wind River
129,eagandersongil,A work on mourning,8,17 February 2018,"A small movie within his universe, but extremely powerful, sharp, well directed and well acted. ""A hit man in the snow"" would be an extremely common way of defining what is ""wilderness,"" the script tells the story of an attempted rape that ultimately results in death against a Native American native, the movie script looks simple, but it is because he bets on the human factor. ""Wild land"" in its first plan, it is a film that talks about losses, and especially about mourning, for those who are passing or has passed, the film becomes very powerful, since the wild land is not only in the icy surroundings of the USA, it spreads throughout the world, because we never know when it will be taken from us what we love, the film also deals with the neglect with the government towards the Indians. ""Wild Earth"" holds a beautiful, blue-toned photograph, it explores the vastness of the icy desert, causing a feeling of even more solitude, plus great action scenes, with quick cuts and cameras in hand, and a good soundtrack, plus a nice set up. Jeremy Renner is spectacular, even if his acting is not phenomenal, the actor combines too much with the role, and makes the viewer put all their hopes on him and at the same time feel his pain, while Elizabeth Olsen, despite being a great actress, seems very out of place in her role. ""Wild land"" has problems, such as the complete lack of depth of the character of Elizabeth, or the plot of revelation, because what matters in the film, deep down, is not who killed, but the consequences of it, but even so , ""Wild Earth"" is a very good film that unfortunately was forgotten in the awards, even being one of the best films of the year.",Wind River

There's something about his thrillers that are just so cunning and sharp and profound, like a great American classic, even novelist Dennis Lehane probably couldn't come up with materials that are as skillfully played as this. And with ""Wind River"" Sheridan's personal artistry mission to do some effort to right the wrongs that the system has committed against the Native Americans, continues.The story is about a rookie FBI agent (Elizabeth Olsen) who teams up with a tracker/hunter (Jeremy Renner) with a tragic past in order to investigate the murder of a local girl on a remote Native American Reservation.Sheridan has tackled themes surrounding the Native Americans before but with this latest one, it's not so much that he's preaching about it but he ties it into this entire fabric of community where you sense the clash between outsiders and locals, between whites and natives, so there's a level of frustration about that arises from this murder investigation that brings up all kinds of cultural suspicions, on top of which there's also a game of jurisdictions. It's a complex yet cleverly woven thriller that starts out as a whodunit and evolves into a thirst for retribution. And the fact that it's set in a very cold harsh environment just adds to the film's chilling effect.In many ways, Elizabeth Olsen performs here like Jodie Foster's Clarice Starling where at some points you kinda know that Olsen's character may be out of her elements, but at the same time that factor actually gives her a good vantage point. Jeremy Renner plays his character like an old timer western hero who knows the ins and outs of everything, a man of few words but gets tough when needed. Their dynamic is not some kind of odd couple cop duo, this is more like each of them trying to prove themselves while bringing justice to the family of the unfortunate girl. And the way Sheridan crafts the mystery from a small radius to a much larger scheme is one that will have you hooked. ""Wind River"" is highly suspenseful, it's a perfect thriller.-- Rama's Screen --",Wind River
132,DeBBss,A Cinematic Masterpiece...,9,9 December 2017,"Although Wind River has a very slow start, but once the action kicks in, it get's bloody and intense. If Wind River had that great action throughout the movie, then Wind River could have got a perfect score. With only the action being at the end of the movie, Wind River gets really boring, and that's the only issue with the movie.Story: 9/10The story is about a death of a Native girl found deep in the woods. A young FBI agent, with the help of Cory Lambert, played by Jeremy Renner, the two characters have to figure out the cause of a young Native American. I love the whole idea of the mystery, but Wind River doesn't feel like a mystery. I'm never wondering how this happened, I'm more focused on the characters and the cinematography. Wind River does have one problem, and that's the pacing, it takes too long for something to go down. By the end of the movie, we see that she wasn't murdered, but how she got so far, and why she got so far into the woods.Characters: 10/10Corey Lambert: The whole idea that Corey hunts predators, and that at the end he's hunting another predator (that's the villain), and that's clever to me. I think that Wind River is Jeremy Renner's best performance so far, he did a great job in this movie. He definitely stole the show with his acting. Jane Banner: I like how they added that Jane is new to the environment, and that she doesn't know anyone at Wind River. If Jane was the sheriff of Wind river, then it would be boring to the plot. Also Elizabeth Olsen did almost as good as a job as Jeremy Renner.Action: 9/10The action has a realistic feel to it, which makes the movie even more better. Wind River is a very realistic movie, you are not going to get the same action from a superhero movie, and that to me is important to a movie like this. To me, the action is perfect, but the only draw back is how long it takes to get to the final battle. The cinematography is also on the same level as ""The Revenant"". I love seeing the snowy landscape, and Taylor Sheridan did such a great job directing the movie. Overall Wind River has great realistic action, amazing cinematography, and clever characters, but terrible pacing. Wind River is one of the best thriller movies in 2017 so far.",Wind River
133,Intermissionman_,Cold as Heck,8,21 April 2018,"A Very well acted production but hauntingly violent and morbid storyline. Jeremy Renner stars as a US Forest and Wildlife Investigator and Tracker who is assigned a Murder Case on a Wyoming Indian Reservation.

134,gavinp9,Really well-made murder mystery,8,2 January 2018,"'Wind River' is from the writer of 'Sicario' & 'Hell or High Water', but is only Sheridan's second directorial effort, which makes it all the more impressive. It's a really simple plot - a Native American teenager is found dead, by Lambert (Renner) in the Wind River reservation and Banner (Olsen) is the FBI agent assigned to solve the case. Lambert is a tracker and hunter ad knows the terrain, so helps local cop Ben (Greene) and Banner in the snowy mountains.Nick Cave & Warren Ellis bring their sparse, 'Skeleton Tree'-like sounds to the score and soundtrack, and it definitely helps set the mood and highlight the sparseness of the northern Winter (or Spring, technically). The film moves along quite rapidly, with the investigation never boring, but still time to build plenty of backstory for Lambert and the reservation.The final 20min or so is handled really well, with a few surprises thrown in. Similar to the Australian-set 'Goldstone' in some ways. It all looks beautiful (odd that it was filmed in Utah, not in the real-life reservation in Wyoming), with plenty of nice scenic and animal shots, but also plenty of sadness. Renner and Olsen carry the film with nuanced performances, and there's thankfully no romantic distractions. It's just a great, straightforward crime-solving scenario, done right.",Wind River

Even actors that normally give very strong performances come off as extremely cliché and phony. By the time we got to the final scene by the trailer, I was lost.

All the characters were great with the exception of the lead female FBI agent - she was incredibly annoying, shrill, and I didn't see any chemistry with her or Renner. But the scenery was beautiful.

138,ginocox-206-336968,Interesting but incomplete,7,2 October 2017,"""Wind River"" has a strong sense of authenticity. The performances are uniformly strong. Set primarily on the Wind River Indian Reservation in Wyoming during winter, the background and characters are interesting. Dialogue is strong. And yet, the movie seems incomplete and somewhat dissatisfying, particularly compared with the writer's previous ""Sicario."" Part of the problem stems from a muddled dramatic perspective. The film begins with a shot of the victim fleeing some unidentified threat with a voice-over reading a poem, which we assume she wrote. But later, we learn the poem was actually written by somebody else entirely, who may have been a victim of a similar fate. Later, we abandon the story's linear timeline for a flashback of the crime from an omniscient observer's perspective, which undermines the whole detective story angle by giving the audience superior information in the middle of the movie. To further complicate matters, most of the potential witnesses are abruptly killed in a shootout that doesn't make a whole lot of sense in terms of character motivations. Fortunately, our intrepid amateur sleuth can figure out what happened from tracks in the snow, despite the fact that it's been snowing intermittently for days since the crime. Further detracting from the story is the over-reliance on jiggly-cam shots. Somehow, I imagine a skinny eleven-year-old kid struggling to hold a twenty-kilo camera steady. The shots aren't quite as unsteady as the cellphone videos posted on Facebook, but it looks as if the camera operator used a self-balancing skateboard instead of a Steadicam rig. The movie leaves several loose ends untied. Solving the crime should give the protagonist some sort of closure regarding the death of his daughter which should have some positive impact on his relationship with his son, but it's left open. The romance angle is left dangling. Perhaps I missed something, but it's not clear if there was some relationship between the victim and the protagonist's daughter or the poem. We're not quite certain what happened to the lions. It's an unpleasant bit of business that would make the protagonist seem less sympathetic, but it drifts into Chekhov's gun territory. ""Wind River"" is an interesting film and worth viewing for its positive elements, but could be better. Somebody should set up a crowdfunding site to buy Sheridan a tripod.",Wind River
139,kaptenvideo-89875,Bleak and depressing but ultimately satisfying stuff,8,14 August 2017,"They say living well's the best revenge but there's also something very satisfying about good ol' bloody revenge itself, at least in the movies. Wind River"" takes us back in the tough working-class Americana in the middle of nowhere that often makes for an exciting drama and/or action. The people are tough and bitter, nobody plays around, the punches are thrown hard, and even the strongest characters edge at the brink of darkness. A game tracker (Jeremy Renner) teams with FBI agent (Elisaberth Olsen) to investigate a murder that occurred on a Native American reservation. There's a bunch of smaller characters around but it's very much about them two, or rather the tracker guy alone. If you have seen (among others) Winter's Bone"", A Single Shot"", Justified"" or any other story of this type, you can already guess what you're in for. I would compare Wind River"" mostly to 2013's A Single Shot"" starring Sam Rockwell, this being mostly about one unlikely male hero who has to take matters into his own hands, with a little exciting violence in the end. And both are also about mental and physical isolation, and solving stuff alone. Having written that, an early Nolan work Insomnia"" also sprung to mind for comparison, which was my favorite Nolan until the mighty Dunkirk"" arrived. The movie's mostly about building – characters, their state of mind, sense of place, mood, suspense. The aim is not to dispense fast pleasures or easily digestible entertainment, and there's no need for that, because once you are able to invest yourself in the story, you'll probably agree that screenwriter and debuting director Taylor Sheridan is very able to pull it all off. Everybody's not gonna be happy about how they have built up the explosive finale, but I liked it. No problems with that kind of approach, at least in this case. Acting is very good all around, with delicate, nuanceful, and well measured performances from everybody from the central hero to the smallest characters on-screen. Wind River"" is a cool directorial debut from Taylor Sheridan, who has previously acted in TV but also written screenplays for Sicario"" and Hell or High Water"", both unfortunately unwatched by me (and most others) so far. But both have received encouraging word of mouth, and Wind River"" makes me want to see these even more. It's a good TV series quality drama, which is highest honor an American movie can receive in 2017. Bleak and depressing but ultimately satisfying stuff.",Wind River
140,PipAndSqueak,Flawed yet chilling tale,7,9 September 2017,"There is an important message in this film...made explicit at the end for those of us who don't reside in that 'supposed' land of the free, the USA.

Trouble is, this is in the middle of nowhere-land. There is no close FBI agent so a diminutive, fresh faced city type from Las Vegas is sent....the authorities clearly have no intention of 'solving' anything. Step in local wildlife ranger, Renner, and the hard bitten local sheriff ...now the story really gets going and it turns out to be a rocky ride. The story and Renner are compelling which is fortunate as this film has some major failings. Cinematography is particularly badly directed with some hand held shakiness introduced at the wrong moments. Dialogue and diction is often incoherent or muffled. Script is not matched by actor action...or is not adequately captured in filming. Knocks the shine off what should have been a top class production. Instead it is so so.",Wind River

142,williampsamuel,"A Suspensil, Somber, and Unflinching Mystery Thriller",8,5 May 2020,"Writer-Director Taylor Sheridan has gone three for three. After delivering the brilliant screenplays for Sicario and Hell or High Water, he's shown that he has the chops to direct as well with this tightly wound, darkly atmospheric mystery suspense thriller.The setup is simple enough. A native woman is found dead on frozen on a reservation, with clear indications that she was victim of foul play. Local Fish and Wildlife tracker Cory Lambert teams with newly arrived FBI agent Jane Banner and the reservation police to solve the case. It's not the most complicated of stories. But it's the depth and complexity with which the story is told that make it something special.The acting and characterization are brilliant. Jeremy Renner delivers what may be his best performance since The Hurt Locker as Lambert. We can instantly tell that he's a master hunter and tracker, deadly as the predators he hunts. Cory is a man who knows the land so well and is so good at what he does that the local Indians practically consider him one of their own. Yet he never lapses into the cliché of the emotionless, near superhuman action hero, or the ""White Indian"" archetype. He carries the weight of years, experience, and deep loss with him, but Renner plays him a likeable, almost ordinary guy.As agent Banner Olsen is tough, plucky, determined, and more than a bit out of her element. When we first meet her, she's lost, completely unprepared for the cold, and manages to offend the first person she interviews. The other characters' first response- and ours- is to question what the FBI was thinking when it sent her. But it's soon apparent that even as a fish out of water she has good instincts and is relentless when pursuing a case. And when the shooting starts she is a total badass.Wind River is driven by suspense as much as its characters, and it delivers here as well. The pacing is classic slow burn; deliberately slow but tense, punctuated with moments of heart pounding action. As Agents Lambert and Banner follow each lead there's a growing sense of looming danger. No sooner is one mystery solved than another takes its place. And when the tension finally breaks the action is absolutely stunning in its intensity.As with Sheridan's previous works, this film also has a powerful sense of authenticity: that the filmmakers have an intimate knowledge of the setting and show it as it is. And the picture they paint of life on the reservation is disquietingly bleak. In every direction there's nothing but inhospitable frozen wastes. A palpable sense of poverty and desperation hang in the air. Add the fact that there are only a handful of officers with virtually no resources to police an area the size of Rhode Island and it's not surprising that some people don't put much faith in, or have much respect for the law.Wind River is also notable for the emphasis it places on the grieving process. At every stage of the investigation, Cory is haunted by the memory of his own loss. The grief is always there, just below the surface when it's not welling up into the open. The rawer, overwhelming anguish of the victim's parents is also front and center. Yet for all the focus on sadness it never feels forced or mopey. The impression is one of real people dealing with real loss. And rather than the usual platitudes about healing with time and learning to live again, Wind River offers starkly honest admissions that the pain will never go away, and what matters is how you deal with it.Wind River isn't quiet the masterpiece that Hell or High Water was, nor is it as action packed as Sicario. But it's still a tightly wound, exceptionally deep mystery thriller that boasts strong central characters and compelling performances. Definitely worth checking out for fans of the genre.",Wind River
143,austin0731,A very compelling thriller that discusses the theme of survival and oppression,9,30 September 2017,"Wind river was a very compelling murder mystery that had a slow burn build up to a very brutal reveal. Over the years Jeremey Renner has proved to be a very capable action hero but in Wind River he shows a more dramatic side to him and I think it was great. Elizabeth Olsen has steadily been climbing to be one of my favourite actresses too and I very much look forward to her future works. Wind River tells the story of the missing demographic, Native American women. It told audiences of the horrors an unjust that has gone to them and the way that the government seems to swipe away this important statistic. This is a very important message that Wind River presents but it does so in a fabulous way.This is a brilliant story of the cold harsh snow and the struggle for survival. Jeremy Renner as Cory Lambert puts it best in this film, he talks about how luck doesn't live out here and it takes heart, strength and the will to survive to survive out in these harsh environments. The film paints a picture of isolation and having to help from various means that was done so very well to present this idea.At the same time while we don't necessarily sympathize with the perpetrators it is presented in a way that is very reasonable. The harsh and bitter environment turns people insane sometimes and drives them to do things that they wouldn't do. In fact Wind River does this other subtle thing where lots of the characters, you can tell have a sense of angst and a sense of pushing down something. This sense of internal conflict where they constrain and oppress their emotions can really be seen. I believe there is a message here, perhaps that 'we should get over these sad moments in life not by pushing the emotions out but by letting them out'. Something that Lambert does in fact talk about in this film. It seems that it is this sense of oppression looming over everyone that drives the murderer to do the things that he has done in this film. I really enjoyed Wind River but if there is one issue I had it is with the reveal of the murder, the way in which they did it just seems rather odd to me and I don't like the way that the truth is understood by audiences but not by the characters in this film. There is no sense of unravelling the mystery through subtle clues but a literal projection on the screen. In my opinion it would've been a lot better to tell the story from Olsen, Jane Banner's eyes. To me this really takes away from the brilliant build Wind River had up till this point.",Wind River

Each and every actor (until the last 10-15 minutes) is extremely good in this film. It is a movie with a lot of character actors and no real leading person - which turned out to work very well.The story is predictable and very drawn out. For a movie that logs in at less than two hours, it feels a lot longer. The final act of the movie is just plain bad - it felt lazy and cheap - with a flashback scene to explain everything - which felt like someone could not find a way to write it well enough to have the facts found through detective work.The final minutes hurt this movie. I won't divulge what happens, but it is not a plausible solution to the crime.A better last act would have propelled this to a 9 - the script and last act could have put this at a 5-6, but the acting gives it a mean average of 7.",Wind River

In fact, I think that my only issue with the movie is in one scene at the middle of the film, where two characters are talking, and for no reason at all, the camera just shakes through the entire scene. I don't if was a attempt to pass some message using the camera or something (because in some other parts in the movie, we see some different use of camera too, but there, makes sense).

151,Lewis_Heather787,A brutal film with a clever use of weather,8,29 September 2017,"The trailer for this film was what got me personally interested in seeing the film, and this film did not disappoint. Firstly big praise has to go to Taylor Sheridan who has done a fantastic job in not only directing the film put producing a really interesting screenplay with brilliant dialogue. Firstly the directing is brilliant in the film there is a great mix of ""shaky cam"" and fixed wide panning shots which work in contrast really well. The ""shaky cam"" camera work creates and heightens tension in the film perfectly, it really adds to the scenes where it is used. The flip side to this is the more conventional panning shots that are elegantly choreographed and styled nicely. The screenplay of the film is also extremely good, for the reason that it touches every area that it needs to in terms of emotion and character arc. There are multiple undertones to the film, the relationship between the place and the outside world or the relationship between the members of the community. There is a lot of back story to the characters in the film that we don't know in the beginning but are told as the film goes on and is handle brilliantly in the film without shoving a lot of information in our faces at once, just to get the audience up to speed. All of these and many more are woven in brilliantly into an overall interesting and heart breaking story, which is executed perfectly. Next positive is the cinematography of the film which is simply stunning, however it does help to have a breath taking location to film at. Every single shot in the film is stunning and perfectly shot in such a harsh and dangerous place, the film looks beautiful from start to finish and certainly caught my eye early on in the ""wow"" factors of the film. Ben Richardson has definitely executed his job perfectly the cinematography is seamless throughout, fantastic. Jeremy Renner is an actor that has been in the supporting role for a long time now, yes there have been a few attempts to make him the star however they weren't very successful. This is film that his true potential as a top class actor has come through, he is brilliant in this film and it is his best performance of his career to date. He is the emotional heart beat of the film and carries us throughout the journey of the investigation with Elizabeth Olsen's character. He is simply fantastic in the film and it definitely deserves recognition. The rest of the cast including Olsen are all really good, it is a small cast and that works to the films advantage to many faces could have started to overcrowd the film. The score of the film is haunting it is excellent at creating tension and is woven/melded together with the wind/weather of the location. Sheridan has obviously wanted the score and the sound of the wind to become a character of its own, well if he didn't he has done it by mistake. The sounds of the film are a character of their own, they add something to every scene. From increases of tension to more sombre moments of the film the score and the wind/weather are used to brilliant effect. It doesn't take a lot to make a harsh environment like this become a being itself in the film, but however it could have been overplayed and overused. The weather and environment is used perfectly because it is left to its on devices it has not been interfered with, the film makers are suggesting to us that location is brutal enough and they are right. Overall this film is very good, the directing and screenplay are at the top of their game. This is Jeremy Renner's best performance to date, the cinematography is something to look in ore at whilst the score and weather become characters themselves. 85% out of 100 this film is very good and executed perfectly, this is small indie film that needs everyone's attention and time!",Wind River
152,j-lacerra,Excellent,10,9 November 2018,"While Wind River is on its surface a murder mystery/police procedural, it transcends these things due to an excellent tight script, first-rate performances, starkly beautiful visuals, and an approach that does not given in to worn out Hollywood tropes. Jeremy Renner is so believable as Cory as to make one forget there is any acting going on and to believe the character is the real deal. Elizabeth Olsen never once plays the vulnerable female card, and manages the tough cop role without falling into silly heroics or unrealistic butchdom. Of course, Graham Greene is the consummate pro. The story remains adult, and never falls prey to the super-imposed romance one might expect. All in all, an excellent motion picture by director Taylor Sheridan.",Wind River
153,cordenw,The second amendment where it's needed,7,14 September 2017,"Out in the wilderness of Wyoming you need a gun to keep you safe from predators, in the city you need a gun to help you rob banks,shoot cops, shoot co-workers and shoot innocent schoolkids. In both environments lots of people end up dead because of the hair trigger mentality of American Culture. The major scene in this movie validates that mentality. Jeremy Renner is a perfect fit for his role as the Fish and Wildlife officer, he has to carry a gun to deal with those predators I mentioned. All of the others carry weapons to deal with the human predators that tend to inhabit remote, cold,snowy places. And so the story of murder and mayhem unfolds in front of a glorious backdrop of white snow and black mountains , a metaphor for the good and the bad in the world. It's not a particularly gripping story but it's fleshed out with depictions of the harsh life of Indian Reserves and the total hopelessness of the reserve system. Violence booze, drugs, the three main food groups for trouble are present in everyone's lives in sparsely populated communities it seems, moreso than the big city. Gil Birmingham is the Indian given the task of trying to absorb, explain and deal with these hardships but in the end it is the fish and wildlife guy who helps him manage the journey.It's a movie that's got me thinking and that's a good way to assess it. The scenery is, of course, glorious and the cast is up to the job but they don't have a knockout punch. Like somebody else mentioned, I had trouble with the sound quality, I first thought it was because of my declining faculties but having someone else mention it has cancelled my appointment with the hearing specialist.

He blurs the lines between ""good guys"" and ""bad guys,"" instead framing the status of the selected region as the truest villain. What's right and wrong, considering all the unique variables of each story, is not always clear. At least, that was case in Sicario and Hell or High Water. In Wind River, the region is still presented with all the strain that is causes on the lives of its residents, but a much more obvious villain is revealed before the movie is over. Hell of High Water frames the crumbling economy of a certain Texas region as the real source of evil, rather than any characters. Whereas in Wind River the source of evil is definitely the rapist. I mean, the rapist attempts to blame the cold and silence, but his actions were clearly much worse than bad weather. Sheridan's previous films also left doubt about who were the heroes, who the audience should be rooting for. This time it was much less ambiguous—they were the people searching for the rapist.An emerging theme in Sheridan's movies appears to be Tarantinoesque eruptions of violence, sometimes near the conclusion. They don't always reach the levels of the Django Unchained shootout, but Sheridan clearly isn't shy about showcasing the unforgiving damage that can be inflicted by firearms. Complaints, I have a few. On more than one occasion, I legitimately could not understand what a character had said, so I was left wondering if I missed something important. I'm not sure if this manner of speaking was a choice made by the actors or if this was a decision made by Sheridan to establish a certain tone. Either way, I could have used less mumbling. The other complaint that I have, and this is more serious, the middle third of the movie felt like it contained a lot of empty moments. This may or may not have been related to the times that I couldn't understand what a character said. Still, the movie could have used a bit of its fat trimmed. It wasn't as crisp and clean as Hell or High Water and Sicario. And I know I keep comparing this movie to Sheridan's others, but that's bound to happen when a writer sets the bar so high with two gems.On the whole, I consider this a success for Sheridan in his directorial debut. I'd happily watch another story of his about justice and an overlooked culture.",Wind River

It is grim, violent, brutally depressing at times but if I can sum it up in one word it would be honest. It just felt like a stand up honest movie. A frighteningly realistic plot with some amazing performances. Renner in particular, this really is his best performance to date. What I also kept seeing throughout the movie was the image of Renner's cowboy interacting with the native americans and having true love and friendship. Showing that people from all different backgrounds can be friends, share emotions and grief and help each other. It's one of those movies that will stick with you for a while, it has done for me. Make sure you are in the right frame of mind to watch it. Be warned, when I watched this I thought it was going to be a Murder mystery, crime, hunting a serial killer type movie.

162,ccorral419,"""Wind River"" should be recognition for its diversity in casting.",10,17 August 2017,"Director, Writer (""Sicario"") and Actor (""Hell and High Water"") Taylor Sheridan presents a chilling film (shot in the winter of Utah, but set in Wyoming on the Wind River Reservation) that provides insight to the rough environmental and society obstacles the Wyoming Indian reservation face. Cory (Jeremy Renner ""Hurt Locker"") is a local wildlife hunter recruited by FBI Agent Elisabeth Olsen (""Godzilla""), who is called in to help solve a reservation death. Along with reluctant local official Ben (Graham Greene ""The Green Mile"") all three must fight the elements and secrecy that surrounds the death. With Sheridan as director and writer, he is in complete control of the storyline, slowly introducing various entities/personalities that could aid in and/or confusion the solving of the murder. Helping to establish the overall feel of the film is the outstanding reservation, mountain and winter cinematography by Ben Richardson (""The Fault in our Stars""). Driven by terrific reserved performances by Renner, Olsen and Green, the film is filled with outstanding secondary actor capabilities including those of Julie Jones (""Longmire"" TV), (Kelsey Asbillie (""Teen Wolf"" TV), Gil Birmingham (""House of Cards""), Martin Sensmeier (""The Magnificent Seven""), Matthew Del Negro (""Scandal"" TV Series), Tyler Laracca (proving there are no small roles) and all the rig personal and officers (too many to name here).

165,Semisonic,Makes you feel ashamed for not feeling much,6,19 February 2018,"Do you know these cases when you get to learn something which you know is important somehow, but you can't still quite touch the topic on the emotional level? It doesn't even mean that there are no emotions to touch, maybe it's just you being a heartless piece of wood. But you just can't help but stare, unable to make a link from what your mind perceives to your heart.Wind River is exactly this type of story. It's not that the story is not touching, nor is it not important. But you can't shake off the thought that you've seen it all a thousand times already: a depressed place, a bunch of sad and tired people who have nothing good coming at them in this life, some people still have goodness within, some have chosen not to care too much because it's easier that way. And somewhere along the way, one unlucky event follows the other, and something evil ensues.I can't decide whether it's my fault for not being able to take such matters to heart simply because they are not sensational, or it has something to do with the writing being kinda thin and the directing being kinda slow and sloppy at times. Not something major, just the little details which only rub it into your eyes yet another time that it's one of those ""sad, but sadly nothing new"" kind of stories, something you wish you could've done something about to fix it once and for good, but you know at the same time that you simply don't have the power to.We humans suck in general.

166,adrian-43767,Atmospheric,7,23 August 2017,"I guess shooting an entire film in the snow and cold helps render it very consistent in terms of atmosphere, and atmosphere is indeed WIND RIVER's strong suit. The acting is competent, even from Renner, who has a difficult part because in the midst of his silences he keeps distributing pearls of wisdom about losing one's children, how to live, and other existential predicaments. Still, he comes very effectively across as a terrific shot and the man you need around in times of trouble. Graham Greene is outstanding as the experienced and attentive head of the police force in the reservation. He does not appear much, but promptly commands attention. Kelsey Asbille I did not find convincing. The motley crew that rape the Indian girl all sound convincingly depraved, and certainly there is an eerie sensation that there is no law and it is sheer survival out there.Direction is sound and assured, but far from exceptional.The screenplay opens in media res, is credible and with many punchlines, but at times dips into some annoying moralism. Also, suddenly it veers into a flashback which explains what happened at the beginning, that caused the Indian girl's murder. I found it a cliché- ish form of storytelling that detracted from the film's modern look and even technology.Those minor reservations aside, WIND RIVER is an above average film well worth watching.",Wind River

168,repojack,A fantastic tragic murder mystery,9,10 December 2020,"""You can't steer from the pain. If you do, you'll rob yourself."" - see below for full quote.Wind River is a fantastic, gripping and tragic murder mystery set on a frigid Wyoming Native American reservation.The writer/director Taylor Sheridan hits his stride with this one. He channels the pain of those that have lost children and the harsh realities of life on the reservation.He also choreographed several scenes that are some of the most intense action scenes in any movie, period.Jeremy Renner and Elizabeth Olsen literally disappear into their roles as the game warden and FBI agent respectively. That is no small task given the notoriety they've gained with their roles in The AvengersThis is one of those movies you can watch multiple times and still enjoy every moment. I can't wait to see his next endeavor.

""I'd like to tell you it gets easier. it doesn't. If there's any... comfort, it's... getting used to the pain, I suppose. Went to a grief seminar in Casper. Did you know that? I don't know why. Just wanted the bad to go away. Wanted answers... to questions that couldn't be answered. The counselor come up to me after the seminar and sat down next to me. And he said something that stuck with me. I don't know if it's what he said, or how he said it. He says, ""I got some good news, and I got some bad news. Bad news is you're never gonna be the same. You're never gonna be whole, not ever again. You lost your daughter. Nothing's ever going to replace that. Now the good news is, as soon as you accept that, and you let yourself suffer... you allow yourself to visit her in your mind, and you'll remember all the love she gave you, all the joy she knew."" Point is, Martin, you can't steer from the pain. If you do, you'll rob yourself... You'll rob yourself of every memory of her. Every last one. From her first step to her last smile. Kill 'em all.

171,gcsman,Flawless execution,9,7 September 2017,"Giving this film a numerical rating seems almost beside the point (though I've done it anyway), because it's so close to reality. The disclaimer ""based on actual events"" is familiar enough for movies these days but in this case the underlying themes ring very, very true beyond just the facts of the story line. In this case my rating reflects just how well it delivers its material, which is austere, beautifully paced, and absorbing.It's simple enough in outline -- FBI agent Jane Banner (Elizabeth Olson) has been sent to a Wyoming Native American reservation to investigate the murder of 18-year-old Natalie (whom we see in flashbacks). Soon, the body of her boyfriend is uncovered too and the case becomes a double murder. Banner joins with local wildlife officer Cory Lambert (Jeremy Renner) to pursue the evidence. Familiar and excellent Native American actors like Graham Greene, Gil Birmingham, and Tantoo Cardinal have a strong presence throughout. But the real, uncredited star of this film is the mountain and prairie landscape. It's built from the powerfully simple elements of 'snow and silence' -- the only things, as Lambert says to another character toward the end, that we haven't taken away from the native people. In every scene, it's just quietly THERE as the backdrop, and sometimes completely determines what the characters can even do. My wife and I went into the theater to see it on a bright, sunny summer afternoon, but when we came out 2 hours later, the feel of the landscape had seeped in so inexorably that we instinctively expected that it ought to be cold and snowy outside!The actors are all great across the board. No false notes. Olson plays the agent who's been thrown into an unfamiliar environment but is able to learn quickly, lead, yet has the sense to take all the help and advice available. For me though the real centerpiece was Renner's character, a man of subtleties that are uncovered bit by bit. We learn that his own teenage daughter was killed some time ago (and therefore he's the only one who can truly talk to Birmingham's character Martin, the murdered girl's father). He's already been through the abyss and come out the other side. In a sense he's the reverse of the stereotypical tough-guy-with-a-soft-center. He's laconic, matter-of-fact, a loyal father to his remaining child (a young son) and as an expert tracker, hunter, and shooter he has credibility with the locals both on and off the reservation. He's a sympathetic, intrinsically good man. But we gradually see that he's built a rock-hard core into his soul that does not forgive willfully bad choices (such as by the son of his friend Martin) and most of all he doesn't forgive evil. Eventually (SPOILER!) he treats the handful of violent, dull, selfish young men who are finally uncovered as the murderers the same way he would a mountain lion attacking cattle -- and with no greater effect on his conscience. But it's not Terminator-style cartoon vengeance at all. It's quietly done and all the more effective for its realism. The final events pack a real wallop.Afterwards I thought a bit about how this movie would have worked if filmed in Canada. Most of it would carry over with no serious change: same kind of landscape (probably southwestern Alberta would work instead of Wyoming), the same backstory of native peoples held down in depressed surroundings and lack of opportunity, and the same horrible history of their missing and murdered girls. The one thing that would have played out differently was the shocking firefight with handguns near the end: no guns, so no firefight.The only reason I don't give this 10/10 is that it's hard to make out some of the dialog. Many of the actors don't enunciate clearly. Why is mumbling such a common 'style' now?",Wind River
172,DimitrisPassas-TapTheLine,Stunning cinematography makes the difference.,7,3 July 2019,"This film is set on a Wyoming Native American reservation and the director, Taylor Sheridan (""Sicario"", ""Yellowstone""), does a remarkable job in capturing the wild, harsh landscape which acts as the main protagonist in this murder mystery. The story itself is not that original, it revolves around the murder of a young Indian girl whose body is found by a local predator hunter (Jeremy Renner) under a pile of snow. The girl is barefoot and that is the first indication that this is a homicide and not some kind of tragic accident. Later the post-mortem examination concludes that the girl was raped, so the FBI is called to investigate the homicide. Agent Jane Banner (Elizabeth Olsen) will have to overcome the extreme climate condition and the hostile behavior by the local Indian community in order to solve the mystery and find the culprit.""Wind River"" is a movie counting on its magnificent photography rather than a complex plotline and the result is a beautiful flick worthy of your time and attention. I liked both J. Renner's and E. Olsen's performances while I was voluptuously surprised by the acting skills of the Indian members of the cast like Apesanahkwat (""Ray Donovan"") and Graham Greene (""The Green Mile"", ""Dances With Wolves""). The movie won the Cannes Award for Best Director (2017) and also got the prize for Best Director (Taylor Sheridan) and Best Actor (Graham Greene) in the American Indian Film Festival. ""Wind River"" will appeal to those who are fond of slow-burning mysteries and if you expect another generic Hollywood crime/thriller you will be utterly disappointed. To be more precise, my rating is closer to 7,5/10.",Wind River
173,PotassiumMan,"Grim, slow-burn crime thriller marks Sheridan's directorial debut",7,4 August 2017,"Taylor Sheridan's achievement in this film lies in his success in crafting an old school crime drama that doesn't try to re-invent the wheel but instead relies on good old-fashioned storytelling. Jeremy Renner and Elizabeth Olsen are both exceptional as a dissimilar pair who out of sheer happenstance form an alliance to solve the mystery of a young woman's brutal death on an Indian reservation. Renner is a U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service tracker. Olsen is an FBI agent sent on an assignment very much alone.The narrative remains low-key but gradually builds toward its gripping conclusion. We come to learn quite a lot about Renner's character through his backstory. He's quite understated and effective in this role. Olsen enters the picture as an outsider to the bleak region of despair that the American wilderness is portrayed as here. She must learn quickly in order to do her job or leave a possible crime completely unsolved.Because this film deals with life on an Indian reservation, much of the social and economic woes might seem unfamiliar at first, but the film does a good job of providing a snapshot of the hardship that pervades in this part of the country and the difficulty that law enforcement has in conducting even a workmanlike investigation. Sheridan depicts a world that is sympathetic and troubled at the same time, masking its tears with courage and doggedness. Recommended to everyone.",Wind River

Cory finds Natalie dead in the snow as she appeared to have been running from something. The Coroner won't list her as a homicide because the cause of death was lungs bursting in the very cold although he believes it is a homicide. Jane needs it to be a homicide in order to bring in other FBI agents, but now she has to work things out herself and enlists Cory's help.The photography is simply outstanding as is the cinematography. The acting all around is very good, but sometimes the sound is a little muddled and it is difficult to hear character dialogues and one must listen carefully. You would think that Cory and FBI Jane would gather clues to determine who killed Natalie, but this is not the case in its entirety. You'll see. Well, they do so up to a point but the resolution will kind of shock you, maybe. Even though Cory is a Hunter as he calls himself, we wondered who he worked for and on the side of his pick-up we see the words: Wild Life Officer. So he works for the State of Wyoming. Mystery solved. Hey, we had to know. Notables: Graham Greene as Ben, the Tribal Chief of Police; Gil Birmingham as Martin, Natalie's father.

176,AnishMisra,Wind River Review,9,14 October 2017,"Wind River is a film written and directed by Taylor Sheridan. I remember watching his previously written ventures Sicario and Hell and High Water, but those two didn't give a blow to me. This film does and in the most realistic way possible. I saw the film with not much expectations but I after watching it I have a certain respect for this film.Plot: Jane and Cory try to find out the killer of a Native American teenager whose body is found on ice.Story and direction: The film starts off with a very good poem about meadows. Although I thought that this was just done to get the groove of the film going on, it's somewhat later that I realized the reason for that poem. As the film progresses and we are introduced to our characters and the main crux of the story, we see the inner pain some characters have gone through. The backstory given to these characters is quite emotional. I could resonate with the kind of sadness they are facing. And then we get to see government regulations that restrict people to certain extent. That thing was quite beautifully shown. That wasn't forced as done in normal films. As for faults, I did find the final act to be quiet rushed and left quite open ended. But that's just me being a bit nit picky.Performances: Jeremy Renner was the show-stealer in this film for me. As his character Cory enters the film, you could see the anguish and guilt on his face. Elizabeth Olsen was also good which I didn't expect from her. Her character of being introduced to some new things in her society was great. And she emoted the character to the T. The rest of the supporting characters were great too.Favorite Scene: It would be the scene where Cory tries to comfort Martin about his daughter's loss as Cory had also lost her own daughter too. And the thing that he said about the good news and bad news were actually the ones that affected me a lot. Also immediately after Martin tells Cory to find the person who did this to her daughter. There you can see a father's anguish and pain.Verdict: Beware, that this film is not for the faint hearted. This film has some very disturbing things that his you very hard. The film is extremely dark. Hats off to Taylor and team for pulling off a gutsy subject like this.I am going to go with a 9/10.",Wind River
177,bastille-852-731547,"Dark, Finely Crafted Crime Drama",7,13 August 2017,"The screenwriter behind ""Hell or High Water"" and ""Sicario"" brings us this unique, independent crime drama about an investigation of a homicide of a young woman on a Native American reservation. Set in the bare, remote landscapes of snowy Wyoming, ""Wind River"" is nicely shot and staged. The film contains expertly filmed cinematography of the desolate landscape, matched with strong performances across the board. Jeremy Renner's performance as a Fish and Wildlife Service Agent who found the victim's body is strong and leads the way, but just as noteworthy is Elizabeth Olsen's role as an FBI agent called in to investigate the murder.The film's style of narrative pacing is slow-burn, which works well given the plot and the context of the film's narrative exposition. The tone is dark and highly tense throughout, which also is quite effective given the grim nature of the story (and its violence.) What doesn't quite work, however, is some abrupt tonal shifts and plot devices that arise regarding some action-style scenes (shootouts, primarily) that detract from the film's otherwise slow and lurking tone. Because of that, ""Wind River"" isn't quite a masterpiece--but it is most certainly a good film that is worth seeing. 7.5/10",Wind River

Well, since reviewers chose to go down that road I must say that I had no trouble with the story. The whole point of this movie is to comment on how native american women go missing more than others and how jurisdiction on and off reservations make life unsafe for them. The whole point is that someone can commit a crime on indian territory and get away with it. I totally accept how the hunter here let's justice prevail, and you would think that a right wing person would appreciate the eye for an eye morals here. It's not as if the indian drug addicts are presented as good people, either. One of them is killed by the FBI woman and it's clear that the indian sheriff has little regard for him. Some comments also focus on how the FBI woman is totally mal placed. I think she is tough and she has a steep learning curve and in the end I think she is both tough and good hearted.
By the way, I also buy the premise of the native american woman having a stronger will to live than the rapist trash.

182,Condemned-Soul,"An atmospheric, snow-covered murder mystery that uncoils into a classic",9,8 July 2018,"'Wind River' dispatches the audience into a chilly location and into the heart of a missing person's investigation. From the outset it is clear the real star is the setting, a place equally bleak, atmospheric and stunning. As the setting gradually ensnares you into its murder mystery, Taylor Sheridan's skill as a writer and director begins to take hold, and 'Wind River's deliberate pace makes the unfolding events, well-written drama, and atmospheric violence all the more rewarding and powerful. Best described as a snow-covered western, 'Wind River' escalates towards a satisfying conclusion, and the quality on display from the acting and writing suggest big things to come for Taylor Sheridan, in what is arguably an instant classic of woven genres. 9/10",Wind River
183,cdjh-81125,Taylor Sheridan is Here To Stay,9,14 September 2017,"As much as I like Sicario, I like it more for the direction and performances rather than the script, Hell or High Water on the other hand was so good mainly because of the screenplay so I was understandably very excited for Wind River and I was blown away by my second favourite movie of the year so far (falling only close behind Dunkirk) and I could not be more curious to see what Taylor Sheridan does next. Sheridan wrote and directed this movie wonderfully, at first it seems like an ordinary murder mystery but it quickly turns into a character based drama with something real tragedy behind it with some very good social commentary in regards to the way the law works in the poorer areas of America and the treatment of Native Americans which makes this film more intelligent and fascinating than it could have been. Sheridan also took to the directing of this film really well, it made you feel the atmosphere of the film as well as giving some true realism, an Oscar nomination for the writing or the directing would be well deserved. Sheridans script also happen to be very performances centric and this film is no different. Jeremy Renner gives the best performance of his career in this film, he's so subtle yet brilliant in his delivery, you get the sense that the character has been through some real turmoil and is in a lot of pain, it let you sympathise with his character more and he stole this movie for me. Elizabeth Olsen is also fantastic in this movie, real strong willed, professional yet quite inexperienced, she was really convincing as this character. I'm glad to see her get out of the marvel universe and give a more grounded performance like this. The location played a big part in this movie, it was almost a central character, like Sicario and Hell or High Water before it Wind River really makes you feel like it's main location is a grimy place, not one you would want to visit. It gave this film a real grit to it, nothing felt like a movie but about as close to real life as this film could be. Sheridan did a good job of making you feel cold while watching this movie, you hear the wind in the air and see the thick snow on screen, it makes you feel like you are there and that's one of the best praises I can give a movie. Despite all the social commentary this film is still a murder mystery at its heart and that mystery is very intriguing, it's a good guessing game like any solid mystery should be but the pay-off was fairly unsatisfactory. The film just kind of tells you the answer and was done in a fairly lazy way. Wind River is amazing, it's got a brilliant script with a good directing style to match, fantastic, career best performances from Jeremy Renner and Elizabeth Olsen, a very good atmospheric location as well as a solid central mystery. Even if the answer to that mystery is given in a fairly lazy way I was far too impressed with everything that came before for that to bother me to much. I'm very excited to see what Taylor Sheridan does next and I truly think he's becoming a real talent to watch out for. 9.5/10: A (Phenomenal)",Wind River
184,danielharden,This is the land of you're on your own,8,1 September 2017,"Taylor Sheridan has made quite the impact in the last two years as a writer. Having predominantly been an actor, most recognised for his role as Chief Hale in Sons of Anarchy, it seems Sheridan has found his true calling. Sheridan's first script, Sicario, introduced us to Sheridan as a writer, as well as introducing the world to leading director, Denis Villeneuve. Sheridan's next script, Hell or Highwater, would then gain Sheridan an Oscar nomination and received the Oscar push Sicario didn't quite achieve. Now, Sheridan both writes and directs his next film, ending what has been an unofficial American setting trilogy. Sheridan's third script and second directorial effort come in the form of Wind River, the true story of veteran game tracker, Corey Lambert and his assistance with the FBI on the homicide of a Native American girl. A writer stepping up to direct is often risky, but with Wind River, Sheridan simply adds another string to his bow.The settings of Sheridan's films are almost characters in their own right. The settings can determine people's states of mind, character motivation as well as highlighting specific social or political conflicts/ problems. Sheridan has thus far used the America Mexico border and Texas in such a way, and now he swaps the warm for the cold. Wind River takes its name from the ice cold Indian reservation in Wyoming, and this setting perhaps the most important and significant one Sheridan has written about. The film is rich with Native American culture, but not in the stereotypical sense that everyone would think. Wind River highlights just how disenfranchised Native Americans are in their own country without getting overly political or racially charged. The film feels authentic and highlights its issues in a heartbreaking and frankly factual way. Wind River is the mystery of a Native American girls murder but is most notably a statement about Native American homicides, as well as, a character study of Jeremy Renner's character, Corey Lambert.Jeremy Renner's performance as Corey Lambert is phenomenal, with great performances in such films as The Hurt Locker and The Town, Renner's performance in Wind River is yet again Oscar worthy. Renner brilliantly portrays a man struggling with the loss of his daughter, by attempting to claim some form of justice, not only for the family of the girl murdered but also for himself. Wind River is a character piece and Renner rises to the occasion as the character of focus. The film reunites Renner and Elizabeth Olsen from the Marvel universe, acknowledging they have a platonic relationship already established and thus utilising what the two have already displayed to great effect. These two actors work well together and the casting directors knew this well. The film also has great performances from Graham Greene as well as a surprise appearance from Jon Bernthal who is always great to see.Sheridan directs this film similarly to how Denis Villeneuve and David Mackenzie directed his last two scripts. Sheridan has clearly taken note from these two as he establishes a slow pace which absorbs as much of the setting as possible, while also having punchy action that exhilarates. It could be viewed by many that Sheridan simply pads the film's run time with shots of vehicles moving in the snow, and to an extent, they are right but knowing of Sheridan's significance of setting, these shots have within them, an element of dread and isolation to which these shots capture so vividly. Sheridan's slow pace in the first two acts of the film makes for an intriguing thriller with great character depth, but unfortunately, the films third act fails to impress from a mystery thriller standpoint.The reveal of the murderer and the crime in the third act felt far too abrupt and took away from the build to it. On reflection, the mystery story was very simple and didn't feature any developments of much interest. Instead, we slowly build to what feels like midway through the investigation and then have everything revealed at once via flashback. I know Hitchcock has done this famously with Vertigo, unveiling the reveal earlier than audiences expected, but with Wind River, I feel it just takes away from the intense and brooding build up of the first two acts. Also the killer is a character we first meet within the flashback, and thus yet another genre convention subversion that didn't sit right with me. However, after reflecting on this, I acknowledge the fact this is a true story and that Wind River is predominantly a character piece and statement of social injustice in America. Nonetheless, the film promises more than it delivers from a genre perspective and features an extremely simple mystery which is hard to not be disappointed by.Wind River is a fascinating character piece with a strong social statement about Native American missing persons. Excellently acted by Jeremy Renner and sophisticatedly written and directed by Taylor Sheridan, Wind River may not have hit the right notes as a genre film, but has more than excelled in every other way. Wind River is a very human story of vengeance, justice and how the two can be one and the same. The title card at the end speaks volumes about the world we live in and how true equality doesn't exist, but as this film also expresses, this needs to change.",Wind River
185,nikitalinivenko,They call it Wind River because it blows and it left me cold,2,2 July 2019,"Taylor Sheridan, like so many who start out on the page, makes a better screenwriter than a director; even then, this is his weakest script, on top of the standard direction. There's a reason why nobody talked about about this, there's nothing to talk about. Hawkeye takes a break from all his Avenging and lands a rugged job at an Indian reservation, where he goes all Dances-with-Wolves with the natives. When he finds a body in the snow, a female F.B.I. agent is brought in, at which point I was heavily reminded of 'Insomnia'. And then they crack the case (and in typical movie fashion, the events of the crime are revealed in one long awkwardly placed flashback). Hooray. This just felt like watching a two-hour long cop show season finale on HBO.",Wind River

Everything about this film is on point from the writing to the casting and the setting to the acting.My heart broke more than once while watching this film. It especially broke when the mother was harming herself and the father burst into tears.This is a spectacular film. The realism is what gets you. The tragedies are what move you.,Wind River
188,joshbarton15,Hits with such a silent yet powerful punch,10,7 September 2017,"Taylor Sheridan's Wind River opens with a young woman running across the vast, cold landscape of a Native American reservation in Wyoming. Showing signs of a struggle and her eyes filled with fear of both what she's fleeing and the harsh conditions of her surroundings, it's an opening that grabs your attention within seconds. The final film in Sheridan's American frontier trilogy, having previously written Sicario and Hell or High Water, Wind River is only his second directorial effort and it's certainly one of the best films I've seen this year.After discovering the body of a young woman on a Native American reservation, hunter Cory Lambert (Jeremy Renner) teams up with FBI agent Jane Banner (Elizabeth Olsen) to track down whoever was responsible. What I've found to be such an impressive feature of Sheridan's work on this trilogy, concluding with Wind River, is that he lays out such a simple narrative with such powerful results. The coldness of the characters reflecting the coldness of the setting, making this quite a different film from Sheridan's other material in terms of backdrop. Not so different is the fact that Wind River is a film wonderfully driven by the writing of both its characters and narrative, the uncompromising brutality of the narrative and the film's subject making for a film you just don't want to stop watching. The atmosphere Sheridan creates through the often sparse dialogue combined with Ben Richardson's cinematography of such a vast snowy landscape leads to quite a haunting experience.Coming to the performances, Wind River, much like Sheridan's other material, doesn't feature any showy performances because it doesn't need to. Elizabeth Olsen and Jeremy Renner are both very good here, Olsen bringing an out of depth feel to Banner, similar to Emily Blunt's Kate Macer in Sicario, while Renner shines with an understatedly powerful turn as Lambert, a man who feels personally driven to help with such a case.Wind River is one of those films that hits with such a silent yet powerful punch, the final title card making this film feel much more than just a random murder mystery, truly shocking me as I read it for myself. Having concluded his American frontier trilogy with such a film as Wind River, I'm looking forward to whatever Taylor Sheridan delivers next.",Wind River
189,douglasmcbroom,Luck Don't Live Out Here,8,2 September 2021,"This is an outstanding film by writer/director Taylor Sheridan. He also wrote 'Sicario', which I did not like, primarily due to Emily Blunt and her character, and 'Hell Or High Water' which I thought was much better than the Oscar Winner for Best Picture, 'Moonlight,' and which garnered Sheridan a Best Original Screenplay nomination. This film is Sheridan's directorial debut, but it most definitely will not be his last. The film beautifully captures remote, hostile, beautiful, mountainous terrain and unforgiving weather extremes. It also captures the cultural differences between people who are drawn to this type of environment and those who are repelled by it. Most importantly, it's a character study of inner strength and grace in the face of tremendous adversity, and coming to grips with loss, loneliness and despair, as well as, learning to celebrate life in spite of same.Jeremy Renner gives perhaps his finest performance, in a very nuanced roll, demonstrating great personal strength gained from loss, and displaying tremendous presence and natural command without ever once raising his voice. Elizabeth Olsen is quality as an FBI Agent who is out her her depth and knowledge, but without that usual FBI arrogant BS of trying to impress and intimidate everyone and insisting on following that horsepucky 'book.' She knows instantly that she needs help and she adapts and overcomes accordingly. She's got spunk! Graham Greene is the local Chief of the Indian Reservation Police and plays it with low-key wit, cynicism and wisdom. Gil Birmingham, who was also in 'Hell Or High Water' and is one of the characters in 'Yellowstone' is also excellent in a small, but memorable, role.",Wind River
190,paulijcalderon,Cuddle up with a warm blanket and listen to the cold wind,8,17 September 2017,"We are getting to that time of the year when the leaves fall of the trees and the days slowly get darker. This means that we're in the perfect mood for some thrillers to accompany you during these rainy days. ""Wind River"" is about a murder investigation and it finds a way to naturally blend the crime aspect with a slightly more dramatic and character centered story. What instantly helped immerse me into this movie was the showcase of the environment. We get to see snow- clad landscapes with mountains in the distance. Seeing the setting alone makes you wanna cuddle up in a blanket while you listen to the sound of the wind and look at Jeremy Renner wandering the woods with a rifle. The entire thing takes place in a small town during this cold winter. There aren't many people working for the police, so Elizabeth Olsen's FBI agent is sent to help figure out the case.I thought it unfolded in a perfectly decent way. Once you kind of hit the midpoint it gets even more interesting. And that's mostly because of the dialogue and occasional monologues which all felt so realistic that it was hard to believe it was scripted. I enjoyed the nice natural flow to them. Some might think it drags or gets away from the thriller aspect. But I began to care a lot more for this dramatic character side-plot. The fear is for things to go over-dramatic and I saw signs of things that could have gone way out of hand. But the movie stayed with its feet on the ground and that was good. Although there's one character who was on the borderline of being too overacted because it contrasted the naturalistic/realistic tone that was established earlier. It bothered me a little bit because he kind of felt like a one-dimensional villain figure. The final act gets some suspense and tension across, so it culminates in a way where you will be invested. Graham Greene always delivers with a nice subtle performance. Olsen and Renner both may have done their best acting in this movie. The word I'm gonna repeat again is realistic. Because that's exactly how it feels. My favorite parts were whenever it took place in the woods. The silence and the look of the white snow on the trees added so much intrigue. A simple mysterious mood piece like that can sometimes be just exactly what you need to prepare yourself for a thriller. It's a good one! Check it out during a misty evening when you don't dare to go out.",Wind River
191,themovieparadise,"Strong Start and Finish, But Weak Middle",7,4 September 2017,"This is the directorial debut of Sicario and Hell or High Water writer Taylor Sheridan, and you can certainly tell it was done by the same guy who did those movies. It has the same visceral, gritty feel as the aforementioned films. It's a gorgeous looking movie, with beautiful cinematography that fully realizes its luscious wilderness backdrop. One of the movie's strongest aspects is its atmosphere. For a first time director, Sheridan does a great job at building the world around the film, and it probably comes from his well written screenplay. I wouldn't say it's as well written as Sicario or Hell or High Water, but it is really a solid screenplay. Stemming from that screenplay, and realized through the direction, is the tension. Wind River does an excellent job with escalating tension, and making it feel palpable. I won't go into details, as not to spoil the film, but there are certain scenes where the tension continuously builds and builds, and you're on the edge of your seat the entire time! But, where this movie loses me is with the second act. It felt like Sheridan knew where he wanted the story to begin and where he wanted it to end, but he didn't know what to do in the meantime. Had this movie been only an hour long, I think it would have been a lot more effective.",Wind River
192,svhot,Must go in historical records as one of the best whodunit thrillers,9,19 September 2017,"""Wind River"" is a very cleverly woven murder mystery thriller that will keep you engrossed and entertained from start-to-finish. This is definitely more than enough evidence to justify the fact that Taylor Sheridan is one of the best storytellers ever in the history of cinema. I know that I may sound like a lawyer after writing this line, but don't worry, I am not a lawyer or even a law student. I am one of those rare people who appreciates a great story and an intelligent storyteller.The basic plot of ""Wind River"" is about a tracker/hunter (Jeremy Renner) and an agent (Olsen) who team up to investigate the murder of a Native American girl on a remote Native American reservation. Jeremy Renner is excellent in his portrayal of a tracker/hunter with a tragic past. An actor depends a lot on his/her eyes and expressions to convince viewers about the genuine nature of their performance/role in a movie. Jeremy Renner is simply outstanding with the feelings of guilt,anger,depression and frustration that he portrays through his eyes and expressions.Viewers can actually feel the pain in his eyes. Olsen has also given a decent performance in her role. She tries to prove herself in her own unique ways.Taylor Sheridan,the writer of ""Sicario"", has made a creative whodunit thriller movie that definitely should go down in the historical records as one of the best and most unique murder mystery movies ever made. He begins the story in a small environment that develops and leads onto a bigger scheme as the movie progresses.He has attempted to show the type of misunderstandings that can arise when people from different cultures meet each other.I would love to become a story-screenplay writer for movie-makers.

193,rusoviet,A truly incredibly crafted American film and that needs to be emphasized...,10,6 July 2018,"Director Taylor Sheridan reached deep into his mind to hold onto what makes us unique. A nation of such disparate backgrounds and yet when Cory Lambert (Jeremey Renner) comes upon the corpse of the raped girl he viscerally understands the monster that did this crime is indifferent towards any blowback. This is WY in 2017 and on a 'Federal Indian Reservation' to boot i.e. what could possibly happen to a perp in such an isolated place? 
Sheridan adapted Cormac McCarthy's novel 'No Country For Old Men' into a credible script for a 2+ hour film and did it masterfully. He also wrote both Sicario and Sicario 2. This I feel is his finest work because both 'Sicarios...esp. the 2nd one'...are rife with 2018 agenda driven politics. Wind River has none of that and even more it didn't have a 'romance' between 'Lambert' and Jane Banner (Elisabeth Olsen)...Sheridan understood what the fall out is per 'casual sex' as compared to a commitment.
See this film. It is a great film not because there are 'surprises' rather there is a revelation of reality that has nothing to do with some agenda driven script save respect and justice.
Lastly - there were no 'de rigeur' 'breetish actors/actresses...it was all Americans for this deep foray into what our nation is rather than a cast that, in their hearts, has np real connection to what makes us uniquely American.",Wind River
194,rabbitmoon,Its good - but VERY clichéd under its veil of self-importance,6,21 August 2017,"Wind River almost suffocates under the weight of its self-importance - characters mumbling, most lines being a little over-cooked in their meaning, characters seeming a bit too contrived and self- conscious, a context that keeps throwing its metaphor at you. But once you cut through all that, you'll find a very clichéd, often sexist genre film complete with a moody, understated male hero, a rookie female FBI agent who basically looks pretty and needs rescuing, a couple of action scenes that feel a bit like random missions from GTAV (with plenty of characters that you have only just met getting arbitrarily killed). The main flaw of the film for me is the presence of a flash-back which ultimately shouldn't be necessary, but seems completely relied upon for audience satisfaction when it comes to a villain's denouement. The villains here have no depth or causality, they exist simply as villains to further the story, but perhaps that's where the unfair treatment of native Americans comes in again. Its good - worth seeing even - but if you've seen The Grey (Neeson's character specifically), Insomnia and The Valley of Elah, your recognition neurons will be fairly active.",Wind River

198,Equalizer16,Heat to the Cold Sheridan's fantastic crime thrillers work beyond change in weather,9,9 September 2017,"After the southern heat of Hell or High Water, Taylor Sheridan gives us the cold wintery thriller Wind River.In the frosty Wind River Indian Reservation of Wyoming, the body an 18 year old Native American girl is discovered by Wildlife service agent Cory Lambett (Jeremy Renner). Lambett with his knowledge of the mountain assists foreign FBI agent Jane Banner (Elizabeth Olson) to track down the killer, but also his own personal reasons wants to find the killer in an attempt to wrestle his own demons.Inspired by true cases of missing native American girls, Wind River has cold hearted passion in its story-telling. A very melancholy murder mystery drama exploring grief and vengeance but also the neglect of the Native Americans in the mountain regions in the USA.During a time this week while I was pondering the significance of different crime thrillers, with also the approach of the The Snowman in November, Wind River is real important stand out. The film itself although is about a murder is more centred on the atmosphere and location. Repetitive vibes of a hellish land resonate throughout the film. This mostly breathed life by the chilly aerial shots of the cold mountain land, identifying misery through the snow breeze and wind (an atmospheric format that was similar expressed in Hell or High Water). The most haunting aspect is the character brought to Wind River by Nick Cave and Warren Elis eerie soundtrack, echoing the dark past of the freezing land.What leads us into the desolate mystery of Wind River is Jeremey Renner superb performance as the experienced hunter possessed by the past but also enriched with perception of his home land and its welcome. Renner very much appears as himself, however is a perfect casting choice with his neutral expression hiding his deeper emotions. Opposite is Elizabeth Olson, the most convincing FBI agent I've seen on screen for a while. But her city slicker style does not prepare her for the divergent law enforcement experience in the isolated Wyoming. These two leads are the perfect casting, with a enigmatic presence that makes you completely believe in them.While Wind River has deeper meaning at its centre, Sheridan knows how to thrill his audience in quiet sensational but violent sequences. Loud sound effects of the gun shots bring light to the silent landscape that the characters dwell, and present a sense of realism to the experience.Sheridan's third feature in his trilogy of modern American law enforcement, following, Sicario, Hell or High Water, has shown his strength in creating masterful crime thrillers with much to reflect about the real world. This capacity has also lead stronger confidence his potential prospects in directing a Bond film. 9.2/10",Wind River

200,RMurray847,"Grim and sad, but WELL worth watching.",7,8 January 2021,"I was excited to see this film, because writer/director Sheridan did one of my favorites from last year, HELL OR HIGH WATER. That film featured a great script, tight direction, a well-cast team doing some of their best work, great cinematograpy and a tone that kept things serious, but somehow still full of lightness and energy.WIND RIVER does many of the same things, but the sense of lightness to cut through the darkness is missing almost completely. It's a grim and sad story, with only a few moments of humor. It's still a very good movie and I recommend it...but lightning didn't strike twice either. It's a bit more SICARIO (which was also Sheridan...a tight, well-crafted film that didn't move my heart) than HELL OR...Set in some of the bleakest, coldest reservation land in Wyoming, WIND RIVER tells of the story of the seeming murder of a young woman from the reservation, who froze to death in the middle of nowhere while clearly on the run from something. Jeremy Renner, who works for the Wildlife Department as a hunter, finds the body. He knows the young lady, who was best friends with his daughter, who has been dead 3 years herself. Thus Renner, who is our main protagonist, is a man full of sadness...and thus the film is infused with sadness. The FBI sends in its nearest agent to just take a look around and see if there's anything there for them to work on, and of course, it's ""rookie"" Elizabeth Olsen, who is eager to work the case but doesn't have a great sense of the society and the land she's ended up in. Most of the chuckles in the film come from her ""fish out of water"" character...the jokes are often a bit obvious, although well played.Secrets and more secrets are uncovered....but when we get to the truth of the matter, it's a far more ugly, unattractive and sad truth than we might have imagined. The final scenes of the movie are crazy, with horrible explosions of violence and a startling flashback that lays the truth bare.The plot of the film isn't actually too complex. What gives the film heft and seriousness is more the characters, the society and the land. The snowcovered landscape is very well captured and the sense of cold really permeates the film. Most of the characters are good, solid but flawed people...just trying to do the right thing and to live up to what they think their responsibilities to the world and each other are. But there are enough bad folks around who either by design or by character do everything they can to make the lives of ""decent"" people depressing and dangerous.It's a pretty gripping film, and while grim, it's not as bluntly cynical as SICARIO was. There are glimmers of hope for the characters...even when it's clear that the place they live will never allow them to truly blossom. Renner gives a good, solid performance...perhaps not quite Oscar caliber, but convincingly done. The always welcome Graham Greene is on hand as a local law enforcement official, and I have always loved his line delivery. Just the right mixture of dryness and humanity. Gil Birmingham, who was SO good as Jeff Bridges's partner in HELL OR..., excels in a smaller role. And Elizabeth Olsen does all she can with a somewhat cliched and predictable role. We've seen this character (the inexperienced, FEMALE law officer) many times before...but she gives it her all and manages to find some nuances we haven't quite seen before. She's always been an engaging actor.So WIND RIVER, while not an ""enjoyable"" entertainment, is more than worth your time. Taylor Sheridan is CLEARLY a major talent to be reckoned with...a great, AMERICAN voice, with the kind of attention to detail and the land and to characters as Jeff Nichols (MUD).",Wind River
201,thespeos,Love and the Agony of Losing a Child,8,19 April 2021,"Synopsis: Man works as a hunter for a federal wildlife agency, but discovers a young girl's body frozen in the cold Wyoming snow. What ensues is largely about his relationships with the people: most he already knows, some are new. Central to this touching film are the joys and sufferings that parents go through, raising, and sometimes losing children. Having people who understand, or just listen is sometimes all there is to ease the pain.Story: The story is actually quite simple: murder, American Indians, love, the snow and cold, lust, and boredom. Yes, the plot and development are simple and straightforward, but ... the unwinding of people, their struggles, and relationships were complex (enough) to keep the story nicely evocative and heart rending.Tension: There are diverse tensions ... FBI and American Indians, city folk and dead winter in Wyoming, parents struggling with anger and pain, nature vs man. It's well managed overall, but there were some scenes toward the latter part that added little value. In fact, I thought these scenes were gratuitous and took away from the film's quality.Movement: Excellent tempo, especially considering it's fact-based and emotionally moving.Like Movies: Gone Baby Gone (superb)Better Movies: NoneActors: Casting was excellent overall, believable characters. I loved the film ""Arrival,"" which Jeremy Renner starred in (along side Amy Adams). He has an honest quality about him I value.Director / Writer: Only after watching did I discover he wrote both Sicario films, each of which is superb.Climax: The ""climax"" with regards to the crime was inconsistent with the whole tenor of the film, so I was disappointed with that. However, the film ends very, very well.PS: It is difficult to decide, do we review just after watching (while the emotions and thoughts are fresh) or do we wait awhile (let the stew simmer)? I don't know. Normally my sense is to wait, let things settle out. For this review, however, it's fresh off the burner : )",Wind River

Director Taylor Sheridan. Stars Jeremy Renner and Elizabeth Olsen as the FBI agent. Viewed at Cannes, 2017, where it won the Best director award in the Un Certain Regard sector.Rape and murder on the reservation with Jeremy Renner really coming into his own as a not particularly handsome leading man. Very strong as the predator hunter with high powered rifle on high speed snowmobile. The picture opens with a long sequence of a woman running barefoot across a vast nighttime snowscape until she finally drops dead. Eventually we will find out that she was brutally gang raped and was fleeing for her life. Reservation great white hunter, Renner, starts an informal investigation on his own. An FBI agent, (Olsen) is called in to assist with the investigation. A junior woman agent is all the FBI cares to spare for this case, obviously regarded as unimportant because who. cares about Indians! But, since only the FBI has police authority on Indian reservation territory they have to make at least a token contribution to the investigationAt the end of this snowy subzero nail biter, Renner having tracked down the main rapist subjects the now wounded and fleeing central SOB to a most satisfying form of vigilante justice -- making him crawl on his belly bloodied and barefoot in the snow to a hideous painfully slow death -- the same kind of death the multiple rape victim at the beginning had to endure. The fetching female FBI agent called in on the case (Elizabeth Olsen) provides a slightly romantic angle to an otherwise edgy all male Indian reservation thriller. Beautiful snowy mountain photography throughout is more than noteworthy. Overall one of the best films of the Cannes week.Kudos to director Taylor Sheridan and all others involved in this remarkable outdoor production. This Weinstein brothers prod was filmed in Utah although the setting is supposedly Wyoming on the Wind River Reservation. An added reality perk, real Indians, not Hollywood palefaces, portray the Native American characters. And do it so well!The Wind River Indian Reservation is an Indian reservation for the Eastern Shoshone and Northern Arapaho tribes of Native Americans in the central western portion of the U.S. state of Wyoming. The entrance to the Wind River Reservation is the small town of Lander, Wyo. which is actually seen in one brief scene, but the magnificent mountain snowscapes we see are all in Utah.

Wind River is beautifully shot, great writing and the two leads played by Jeremy Renner and Elizabeth Olson are really top notch.When March 2018 comes around and its ""Oscar time"", don't be surprised at all to see this movie nominated in at least one category. Fantastic.",Wind River
207,vsks,Powerful story that avoids the trap of cliché,9,25 August 2017,"I know a lot of people who would not like this remarkable movie, written and directed by Taylor Sheridan. If you don't like violence, you might as well stop reading now. If you oppose hunting, you can stop. If thoughts of a child being lost are too troubling, stop. But if you want to see a powerful tale about achieving retribution despite the forces aligned against that possibility, you may appreciate Wind River. So many easy mistakes this movie could have made, but didn't. There was no unconvincing romance, despite the respect and understated chemistry between the main characters. There were no long quasi-editorials about the plight of reservation Indians. The filmmakers show you that. There was no pretending that people simply get over soul-wounds by the next scene. These characters carry their pain with them and it helps shape who they are and what they will do. What the filmmakers do give you is beautiful, treacherous mountain scenery (the Wind River Indian Reservation is in Wyoming, though the film was shot in Utah), where blizzards are blinding and it's so cold that breathing can burst a person's lungs. They give you snowmobiles racing across the fields, forests whose sounds could be branches breaking or a family of stalking cougars. Best of all, they give you several profound cinematic moments, achieved not when the characters say a lot, but when they say almost nothing. ""At times, Sheridan has his characters spell out a little too clearly what they're thinking and feeling . . . but the words are so beautiful and come from such a place of deep truth, it's hard not to be moved,"" says Christy Lemire in her review for RogerEbert.com. I don't want to say too much about the actual story, so as not to take away from your experiencing it fresh. Suffice it to say it's about the investigation of a murder; it's about gun culture and drug culture and their inevitable consequences; and it's about survival. And it's about loving and safeguarding your children. Once you have them, a father says, ""You can't blink. Not once. Not ever."" Put everything else aside and concentrate on the fine acting. Jeremy Renner plays the protagonist, fish & wildlife employee Cory Lambert (""I hunt predators"") who has many reasons for trying to solve this killing; Elizabeth Olsen is the FBI agent who learns more in a week in the snow than in her FBI Academy training, that's for sure; Graham Greene is the laconic, seen-it-all tribal police chief; and Gil Birmingham is the father of the murdered girl.",Wind River
208,El-Ak,"Well, haleluya ! What a movie!",8,22 June 2018,Wind River is no doubt one of the very intense crime movies to see. Taylor Sheridan did a great job in directing the movie which a lot of directors found it difficult when they are the writers too. He really could present the movie in a very simple style so that you can understand it easily even when Renner was riding the jet going up the snow and made all the details very clear. The music of the movie is very creative and gave the scenes a lot of greatness. The screenplay was good and both Renner and Olsen did a great job especially Renner. The movie is very unfair to be neglected by awards and audience but still happy that it made triple it's budget and is one of 2017's best movies.,Wind River

It's not subtle, it's rubbed in your face and makes heavy use of 'reverse racism' where it seems perfectly fine to call white people 'crackers' and 'you people'.At some point mid-movie there's a fairly shocking scene where a Native Indian woman commits self harm and we're supposed to feel that bringing her help would 'go against the tradition' or something of the sort.

213,texshelters,Wind River Misses the Mark but Tries real Hard,6,1 September 2017,"Wind River: Misses the Mark but Tries real HardWhen Wind River doesn't try to be more than a nice mystery featuring clashing white and Native cultures, grief and meditations while staring at wide open spaces, it works. When it turns into a hyper tense drama of shock and violence, it plays as false. There is a rape scene that was unnecessary and drawn out in the film. It did nothing to add to the mystery or the plot of the film. In fact, it ruined was little mystery the story had. It was a reveal that was unnecessary. Then there is the unrealistic shoot out. It is highly unlikely it would have happen at all, except perhaps for one hot headed character. If they had limited the action to him, the plot would have made more sense. However unrealistic this gunfight was, it was well filmed. Was Jeremy Renner's character, Cory Lambert, a white savior in Wind River? Partially. He wasn't a white knight in the classic sense. He didn't save the day, he didn't rescue all the people, but he did save some. The character, a white hunter from Fish and Wildlife, is not out of place in Wyoming. However, it could have easily been a Native American actor and all the hemming and hawing about belonging on the reservation as a white guy would have been avoided. Renner does a good job with the material, regardless. And Elizabeth Olsen does a fine job as Agent Banner from Las Vegas. There is one scene where she is reminiscent of Agent Starling from ""Silence of the Lambs"", but the characters are different. Starling presented a preppy image, Agent Banner is more earthly and less cerebral. And the cases are different. Some critics call ""Wind River"" slow paced. That's only true if you expected the pacing of Fast and Furious or Super hero film. The pacing matched the setting and plot and some people will find it slow. Others call the sound track dismal. It was quiet and minimalist. I guess they wanted an overwrought John Williams or Hans Zimmer sound track. The music works well for the film, except the times I heard the chanted words. The vocals distracted from the viewing. There are many out of character actions by characters in the film. The actions by Lambert at the end of the film didn't make sense. Why did he go to save some people and make sure they were okay and not check on some of his closest friends? Why would private security draw on the police and Marshalls when they could have just asked for a warrant? The film looks good and has some decent acting, but the plot doesn't hold enough mystery and that was spoiled in the end of the second act by an unnecessary, some might call exploitative, flashback.

214,Pistol219,As perfect as can be,10,16 November 2020,"To start off. Many reviews are claiming reverse racism and propaganda in the sense its about bashing Americans.
Al it is doing is showing the lifestyle and what Natives are still going through. I for one am sick of all the Black Lives movement and all the movies going on that road when we as ""Americans"" forget the natives. I for one have 2 different Native American blood lines in my blood, however I do not know enough about either side to claim such honor. We care more about endangered animals then we do endangered Cultures. This movie is based on the love of two fathers whose daughters were friends and both died at different times tragically.It also is to shed light on how Native women go missing all the time and none are accounted for.

218,naveensankaran18,"Wind River - a gripping tale of shallowness, metamorphosis and eventual redemption",8,10 April 2021,"Directed by Taylor Sheridan, this Jeremy Renner and Elizabeth Olsen starrer offers us a journey which is unbelievably sulking in nature.There are few instances where one might feel connected to a movie on a meta-level, understanding its metaphorical references, and diving towards its inner soul where it hits you right in the heart. Wind River is one such rarity that engulfs you within its sea of shallowness and provides you with a chance to cleanse yourself, only if you let it.The narration starts with a girl running off on a full moon night, along the snowy hills of the Wind River Indian Reservation in Wyoming, barefooted.! With a poetic recital in the background, the title appears as the girl runs through the wide (yet, still) frame (pardon my Cinematographic glossary!), with just the moon showing any glimpse of light that is left in her path of life.This sequence sets the tone for the rest of the movie to follow; this feature is not the one where you wish to pass the time, it is not for those who don't wish to endure strength amidst a cold storm. This is for those who wish to undergo the journey of redemption, much like the lead characters in the movie - one becomes a relatively matured human while the other cleanses off the guilt (of the past). A lot of questions pop up in one's mind - Why is she running? What is she running from? Will she survive? Why does a beautiful yet trembling voice recite an unpopular poem? But as the movie progresses, one might discover answers to these queries...one at a time.As a renowned hunter of wild animals and an expert tracker, Cory Lambert, played exceedingly well by Jeremy Renner, holds the key to the complete investigation process. Driven by the ""hunter"" instincts and tracing abilities, he dissects the ""how"" part of any incident quite clearly...the ""why"" part, however, is not up to his hands. But what if something comes up, something special that he eventually falls into the ""why"" as well? Coupled with his feelings towards the deceased, the guilt from the past plays a major role in taking up the investigation, irrespective of the help he gets. The people in that reservation, including the police chief Ben Shoyo (Graham Greene) are so used to having no help at all that they do not depend on the government to do the job for them. It is quite evident through the various references placed in the feature. They do receive something, which can be barely called as help - a naive FBI officer who is completely dark of the topology she is going to deal with.During one of her investigative processes, the father of the deceased girl considers her barely an adult, let alone an FBI agent. He did not mention it sarcastically; there is some intensity in his voice that might be taken in the wrong sense but he is damn serious about it. Well, in my opinion, he is not completely wrong. The officer might be physically aged but she has not aware of her surroundings and the experience she lacks by mountains that surrounds her! But she never shies away from admitting her naiveness and explicitly asks for help, which she is in dire need of. Although she is sort of ""pushed"" into this situation, she never backs out; she holds her ground and undergoes this journey, which I can only say as a metamorphosis. ""We"" (audience) are she, I would rather say!The friendship that Cory shares with Martin Hanson (Gil Birmingham), caught me right in the eye. Their bond transcends boundaries, sharing emotions on much higher ground. You don't need courtesy, you don't need parties but just a man to sit with you, to comfort you as if he doesn't have anything else to do! This feature, to me, is something like that...It just sits beside me, grows inside me, comforts me without uttering a word.With a strong motive behind making this feature, Taylor Sheridan conveys the message loud and clear. The amount of breathing space that he gave in writing the screenplay is just the right amount that the script demanded. Thus, it allows us to embark on this journey, rather than witnessing the events as they unfold. The frames from Ben Richardson along with the score from Nick Caven and Warren Ellis, creates an environment where you can feel lonely yet comforting, shallow yet contempt, scared yet strong, naive yet courage! They comforted the viewing experience like a heavy quilt on a cold night. I highly rate this movie purely for the way it was told. Just brilliant!",Wind River
219,nlytnd_1,Unoriginal Movie that becomes so silly it would make Rambo III cringe.,4,10 March 2018,"The movie initially tricks us into thinking that it has a creative logical solution to it's premise, but as the movie unfolds we realize that we've been bamboozled. It's as if they had the premise for the movie, then they handed the baton to Tommy Wiseau to finish writing the script.There are so many amateurish aspects to this movie I couldn't begin to bullet point them all, but below are a few that come to mind.Did you know that in really cold temperatures you can have a prolonged conversation, but if you run for approx 50 meters your lungs will explode? Now I'm willing to suspend my disbelief and pretend that it's much colder than it obviously was.... but it wasn't cold enough for Corey to cover his face and hands when he rode his snow mobile. My money would have easily been on the guy running 6 miles in the snow to safety. I guess I've seen one too many episodes of I shouldn't be alive. People achieve that with broken arms/legs and feet. I can't believe something so nonsensical made it past the cutting room floor. Shows how little respect the writer/director has for their audience.And I just love the scene where nearly everyone was just shot dead and Corey finds the FBI chick under the house and smiles at her and asks if she's ok, as if he came from another set where a bunch of people hadn't just been shot to death (some of whom were his friends).
Also, when the movie reveals what led to the victims demise, it's such a silly circumstance. Whoever wrote it was very uncreative and out of touch in the realm of human observation.I picked up on a decent amount of symbolism throughout the movie and had the movie been half way decent this would have been worth looking into... however it's a bit delusional to think this movie was worthy of such a thing.",Wind River
220,stebird,"It always ends with the truth, no matter how hard the truth may be to find",9,15 November 2017,"The sparsely populated state of Wyoming is vast, and hidden away in this wonderful state lies a Native American Reservation..., rookie FBI agent Jane Banner (Elizabeth Olsen) is going to witness how rugged this place really is when she is sent to uncover the truth behind the mysterious death of a young girl. ""Wind River"" is a powerfully evocative film that masterfully exploits the sense of isolation the characters have to endure each day, it's enough to send you mad, and maybe this has already happened to some of its patrons. Elizabeth Olsen, still a young and novice actress plays her role perfectly, utterly convincing in her quest to make people believe that her character is truly a rookie and that she is deeply out of her comfort zone..., at certain points in the film, she even manages to upend her co-star, the older, more experienced Jeremy Renner, who himself performs like a true master of the screen.Renner's character, the Wildlife Service Agent, Cory Lambert shows that he isn't just another tough guy, that he in fact possesses emotions and isn't afraid to let those emotions show at certain times, adding a great deal of depth to the character, fleshing him out and making him so much more believable and relatable.The supporting cast did a grand job, helping to prop the film up and give that extra sense of realism, what I particularly liked was the use of genuine Native American actors playing the Native American characters, Apesanahkwat (a bit of a mouthful yes) is a little known actor more than likely held down by film studios for his ethnicity, but here in ""Wind River"" he is given his big chance to shine and he does more than a reasonable job playing the Native American, Dan Crowheart.Visually the film is ace! Clever camera tricks bring about the aforementioned sense of isolation, you could really be anywhere in the world, but alas you are only in Wyoming..., it took me a fair while to actually work out the location when watching the film ha. Overall the mystery, the main crooks of the film was A-grade stuff, it held back and held back and continuously made you think, giving nothing away other than what it wanted to give away, holding you in suspense all the way to the end of the film, keeping you invested throughout, therefore achieving the main aim of any film..., getting you and keeping you hooked.

224,makleen2,"Wind River is gritty, dark, and depressing, but that does not make it great",6,2 October 2017,"A U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service tracker and an FBI agent team up to solve a double homicide on the Wind River Indian Reservation in Wyoming in Wind River (2017). On a mission to hunt down mountain lions killing local cattle, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service agent Cory Lambert (Jeremy Renner) discovers the body of 18-year-old Natalie Hanson (Kelsey Asbille). The FBI sends Jane Banner (Elizabeth Olsen), a Nevada field agent, to determine whether a crime has been committed. They later find another body, deepening the mystery.Wind River is writer-director Taylor Sheridan's latest offering. Sheridan is known for writing Hell or High Water (2016) and Sicario (2015) and acting in a number of TV dramas. Wind River takes place in Wyoming in early spring and has a very Western feel, despite its snow-swept mountains. Stunning cinematography was not enough to make up for extremely slow pacing and lack of compelling story.Some critics argue it is genre defying and highly original; I say it suffers from an identity crisis. Wind River is labeled a ""murder mystery thriller film,"" but isn't either of those things. There's no mystery because a flashback explains exactly what happened halfway through and the authorities never actually solve the crime or bring anyone to justice. It's not a thriller because there's no sense of suspense or urgency. Unlike a typical crime thriller, there's no sense that one crime must be solved to prevent another from occurring.Unforgiven (1992) was genre defying and highly original. It had a compelling story and memorable characters with discernible personalities, it intermixed moments of humor and tenderness with shocking violence, and it shattered the mythos of the Old West while reigniting interest in the Western genre. In comparison, Wind River struggles to find direction. Its protagonists are cold and impenetrable and its interchangeable villains are uninteresting. Brooding, monotone delivery is mistaken for depth. Everyone is seriously depressed.Wind River's first act sets up an interesting premise. A Fish and Wildlife Service tracker with a tragic past must help a clueless FBI agent track down a human predator. Along the way, he finds love again and comes to accept the death of his own teenage daughter. That would have been a great movie.Unfortunately, that wasn't how this one played out. It turns out the double murder was incidental–a crime of passion. Everyone dies (including most of the police) before anyone can solve the crime, Cory Lambert doesn't end up with Jane Banner, and the final message seems to be ""life is really shitty in Wyoming."" Nothing changes except the number of headstones at the local cemetery.I did appreciate the characters' authenticity. The American Indians were actually played by actors and actresses of that ethnicity (mostly). Graham Greene, a Canadian Oneida Indian known for Dances with Wolves (1990) and Die Hard with a Vengeance (1995), was great as Tribal Police Chief Ben. The settings were gritty and realistic, although one mobile home seemed to have an unrealistically cavernous interior.In the end, Wind River is gritty, dark, and depressing, but that does not make it great. Its promotional material boldly states: ""One of the best films of the year,"" which while perhaps true, doesn't say much in comparison to the other films released in 2017.",Wind River

226,jay-techie2007,Great Direction and Amazing Performances by the Lead Cast,8,27 August 2017,"This movie, invariably, reminded me of The Prisoners. Even though it is a different plot but the overall experience of the movie is very much the same. It is a little depressing, so if you are in a mood to have some fun, this movie shouldn't be the choice. Having said that, in terms of cinema, it is a very good watch. Story (8/10): A body of a very young girl, just adult, is found in the icy mountainous region of Wind River Reservation area of Wyoming. The FBI agent, Jane, teams up with a local hunter, Cory, to solve the mystery behind the killing that is not exactly a standard killing since the girl is found to have died because of pulmonary hemorrhage while running barefoot on the ice. While Jane has been summoned from a far away from Nevada for the case, she still has to adjust to the cultural aspect of the area and the demons in the unforgiving terrain. Luckily, she has Cory by her side to help her see the subtle clues. As they solve the case, Jane also discovers a chapter from Cory's personal life that makes him want to help her in the case. The story is very well written and the relevance of each character, besides Cory and Jane, has also been explained quite nicely which makes the entire story complete. The conceptualization of the opening scene, some of the connection of the main story with Cory's past and the climax scene is amazing and couldn't be more fitting to the entire story. Acting (8/10): The lead cast, Jeremy Renner and Elizabeth Olsen, are amazing to watch. Jeremy Renner was a near perfect choice for the role and he did justice to the character by avoiding being dramatic or aggressive. Elizabeth was amazing to watch as a dedicated, empathetic, honest but a slightly under-confident officer who knows her limitations in the unfamiliar land. Her chemistry with Jeremy Renner is quite subtle. A large part of the movie has only these two characters in the scenes. The rest of the cast, however, has done just good enough to maintain the standard of the movie. Direction (9/10): Taylor Sheridan did a stellar job in directing this movie to near perfection. The opening scene was very well picturized and laid down the set up quite well. Some of the scenes and locations used to convey the brutality of the terrain added a lot more implicit drama to the movie. The climax scene couldn't have been more fitting to close the movie. The references and conversations explaining how differently things work in that region compared to the rest of the US brought a lot more authenticity to the story as well as the importance of the central character's involvement in solving the murder mystery. The pacing and the length of the movie are just right enough to keep you glued to the screen. Overall (8/10): Overall, it's a great movie to watch, especially for some amazing performances by Jeremy Renner and Elizabeth Olsen, and great direction.",Wind River

It was so good - so layered with subtleties that I rewatched many scenes to fully grasp them. This is a brilliantly grim glimpse at an under reported reality but it doesn't convey anything that doesn't grab you in the process. It doesn't preach. It just is.

Also, had I written the script, I would hint that a woman was raped, rather than clearly displaying a rape scene for a troubling length of time (I closed my eyes at the start). After 40 years, I still recall clearly the rape scene in the 1975 movie, The Hiding Place. If you want porn burned into your mind, this movie will do it. Then, there is the overuse of F words (most during a scene where a dozen officers point guns at each other). Finally, whether true or not, it promotes a very bad lesson of revenge and bad behavior: a hunter believes he is judge, jury, and executioner, without repercussions. I'm sorry I watched it.",Wind River
236,MplusA92,The movie with no single smile.,6,20 November 2017,"In some hot days, we need such cold movies to let us forget some of the torment of the sun. The movie highlights the situation of people living in such conditions like the difficulties of transportation, the marginalization of native Americans, and the issue of missing women in that demographic.The rhythm of the movie is really slow, it starts with a scene of running woman in the snow then everything will be explained in a good sequence. The cast was really good specially the beautiful performance of ""Jeremy Renner"", he fits really well in the role and you will see him in some dark dramatic scenes that he mastered.However, i have a problem with ""Elizabeth Olsen's"" baby face, she is a great actress but not for a role of FBI agent. The officer ""Ben"" and all other short period showing characters were good.The white costume of ""Jeremy Renner"" resembles a lot the costume in snow scene in ""Inception"" movie. Finally, it's a drama/crime movie that you will not be happy after watching it, it's really dark and cold, you can see that on the faces of the characters which i think they never smiled through the movie.",Wind River
237,wlee08,Murder mystery thriller set in the winter wilderness of Wyoming,6,12 March 2018,"This is a pretty standard crime thriller, with Jeremy Renner playing the role of a Native American hunter/tracker helping out a newbie FBI agent in the remote winter wilderness of Wyoming. What makes it unique is perhaps the emotional grieving experienced by the families involved as well as having a main character who is a tracker. The acting here is very strong, perhaps less so by Elizabeth Olsen, but she is stuck in the unlikely role of a new FBI agent who seems to have been given the job without any credentials or knowledge of how to solve a crime. She depends almost entirely on Jeremy Renner, even showing up without a proper coat for the weather. Everything is wrapped up more or less as expected but I was hoping for an extra twist or two to make it interesting.",Wind River

Wind River has a linear story with one-dimensional characters who don't go through any transformation or progression. The characters in the movie lack substance, however, they are interesting enough because of the actors who play them.

I'm not all that familiar with the director but I feel he did a wonderful job. The shots were done well, and the scenery was remarkable. You could feel the cold.

243,soundoflight,"Good film, but flawed",7,25 November 2017,"Overall, I enjoyed this film. I liked the story, the interesting wilderness settings, the Native American angle, and the themes. They did a great job of portraying a bleak and hostile land. And Jeremy Renner puts in a solid performance in a kind of role he's accustomed to, but also quite effective in. He pretty much carries this film.The moment things first started to slip for me was with the appearance of Elizabeth Olsen. My first thought was ""oh no, not that silly Avengers girl."" I think I get why Olsen was put into this role - she's supposed to be a ""fish out of water."" But completely miscasting someone is not quite the same thing as having a good actor portray being out of their element. It's kind of like a short cut to the end and it doesn't work. I didn't find her performance believable (or good). I see this is a Weinstein produced film and will just leave it at that... The other main thing that bothered me about the film was the inconsistency with the winter shots. While film production in winter is extremely difficult, I felt that some of the issues were preventable. It doesn't actually go from complete overcast and a blizzard to blue sky, calm and sunny in 10 minutes anywhere that I know of on earth. And when it's actually cold out, you can see people's breath. See ""Fargo"" as an example of a film that pulls off winter production well.Despite these things, this remains one of the better films I've seen this year.",Wind River

Pure fancy by people who have obviously zero experience living actively in a subzero environment. People who obviously just want to dupe audiences as an excuse to show medically imaginary, melodramatic, violent death scenes. As someone who lives in it, and regularly runs, sprints and engages in all manners of breathing subzero air that I can imagine I can confirm that your lungs don't bleed for an reason related to inhaling cold air via natural aspiration unless you have some other serious underlying medical condition causing them to do so. If this was at all remotely possible are you truly daft enough to believe hundreds of thousands of people would risk living daily in a subzero environment? How stupid and uneducated are filmgoing audiences and filmmakers getting, and how is it even possible with the wealth of knowledge available a few clicks away? Utter failure, especially following ""inspired by actual events"". Suspension of disbelief aside, the rest of the film was ok. Entertaining (if even for its medical fantasy). Well-acted. Great cinematography. Mediocre plot and dialogue. Abysmal sound editing and mixing. Glamourized by one of the hottest native american women you will ever see in Julia Jones, however, I don't even have to be native american to be insulted by American filmmakers' penchants for employing beautiful half-asian women to depict native american women, per the actress playing the rapee, Kelsey CHOW. Really?...You REALLY couldn't find 1 more actual native american girl who could use a job acting?...Or do you simply assume your audience is that daft?Extra points for going far enough with the rape scene, all too rare amidst prevalent disproportionate hypersensitivities of the day.

251,lhunt-9,Jeremy Renner Excels as a Craftsman in the Lead Role --- including allowing the other actors to stand out on their own....,8,7 December 2017,"It is hard to criticize this movie, with one caveat. We are still in that place where movies about First Nation people have to have white people in them as a principle focus. That said, the film is ""inspired"" by actual events, so this may very likely be the way it went down. The film explores the theme of missing and murdered indigenous women, and makes a direct comment about that still-neglected subject at the end. Jeremy Renner plays a fascinating character with huge emotional depth, awareness, respect and sensitivity. Renner's character's skillset is fully developed, and is critical to the film. The fact that he is alert and knowledgeable makes everything else work. I thought Elizabeth Olsen did fine, and the First Nation actors were outstanding --- and could very easily have been more developed than they were. While this film didn't really have to work so hard at building a white character in a First Nation setting, my esteem for Jeremy Renner has nonetheless bumped up a couple more notches. He is really deep and versatile, and in this case, he did not intrude on the space, despite being the film's leading actor. In fact, he had a knack for backing off, and allowing the other actors to shine in their respective roles --- a mark of a very fine craftsman. I'm not sure who else could have played the role if Renner had not been there. One more aspect --- there was no point at which suspension of belief was difficult. I was roped in from the very first minute, and the emphasis on Renner's role as a wildlife tracker was allegorically so much on the mark. That is, the film was about tracking both figuratively and literally, and the themes were intertwined almost perfectly, in my opinion. Kudos to all involved.",Wind River

Wyoming whispers poetry of fallen daughters; the wind its cruel messenger. Fathers fire at ghosts, and mothers claw at embedded demons. The cold is the ultimate captor. A force unobtainable and innocent. Temperature lands the final blow to the lost, but the slaughter begins in human hands.Cory has crafted his instincts into a profession. His hunger for detail hidden in the entropy of the wilderness leads him to fashion his own ammunition. The delicate game of measurement arrests his mind from the visions of the gunpowder's target. He is a hunter of murderers. Beasts that kill private property, livestock that mean survival to their owners.A lethal shepherd gliding on snow banks, Cory tracks another mountain lion who has ate the wrong meal. This job will slant his trajectory backwards to the site of his own nightmare. The hunt will provide second chances dripping in remorseful redemption. An outside hunter joins the raid. Her heels scuffle in the snow slurry as she all but apologizes for her arrival. Yet her presence equates to federal aid, aid that will bring an army to fight injustice. Jane does not belong here, but she will. Trained and sturdy, she understands depravity, but not the desolation of the Reservation. Wind River is a purgatory between heritage and imperialism. A white blanket of inactivity pounds the wills of the Natives to the ground. They breath polluted air that encourages one to settle. Opportunities are present, but only if you want to go to another planet. A funnel of appropriation surrounds the territory and the young are high off the fumes.A pair of grief-stricken fathers stand on a porch. Tragedy is the wall gradually erected between them and their wives. They speak in cautious spurts. Their eyes do not communicate. Their heads face into an envied oblivion. Comfort is delivered by stubborn chiseling, and compassion requires tangible force. Every soul appears widowed by the layers of jackets concealing brittle physiques.",Wind River
254,kckidjoseph-1,An Engrossing Murder Mystery That Respects Its Subject _ and Audience,8,16 September 2017,"""Wind River"" is a gripping murder mystery-thriller written and directed by Taylor Sheridan (Best Original Screenplay Oscar nominee for ""Hell or High Water"") starring Jeremy Renner, Elizabeth Olsen and Graham Greene, featuring an unusually strong supporting cast that includes many fine Native American actors. Renner and Olsen play a U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service tracker and an FBI agent, respectively, attempting to solve the murder of a young woman whose body is discovered by Renner under mysterious circumstances as he patrols the Wind River Indian Reservation in Wyoming.The film scrupulously avoids clichés and is tightly edited with nary a wasted moment, yet never feels rushed or artificial in performance or plot. Everyone and everything is there for a reason, and best of all, the audience is given credit for being able to keep up and connect the dots.The violence, which is absolutely necessary, is kept at a bare minimum as a narrative device, explaining and clarifying rather than assaulting the senses.Every character, even the most heinous, is portrayed as a fully developed human being rather than as stereotype. We learn how the Native American culture is victimized in a way that takes us inside their world and their souls, but the journey is skillfully handled and never heavy handed.The photography is perfectly rendered, celebrating the icy Wyoming scenery in a muted style consistent with the mood of the story.Renner, Olsen and Greene are excellent and believable, but in no small way this is an ensemble piece whose potency and effectiveness derive from the palpable passion and belief of everyone in front of and behind the camera.This is an engrossing story well worth your time and money, and kudos to everyone involved for having faith that a discerning audience will find and appreciate it.",Wind River

Bernthal has a very small part. Graham Green and Gil Birmingham are perfect mixes of stoicism and Indian humor. The Utah (made to look like Wyoming) weather has a major role as well, although I never knew if it was following direction or doing it improv. The story is an intense drama with action to match, based on actual events on the Wind River Indian Reservation which has a per-capita crime rate that makes Chicago look like Mayberry. The climax was set up so suddenly it actually added an element of lethal humor to it. It definitely has a similar flavor to ""Hell or High Water"" in which Sheridan acted, only better. I noted the absence of any disclaimer about any animals being harmed. I don't know if that's still routinely being put in the credits or not, but I don't think it would apply here, though it was about an animal being hunted, Renner's character's job.",Wind River

260,cschultz-2,Elegant In Its Poignance,10,5 September 2017,"""Lyrical"" is an accurate term to describe the superb drama ""Wind River."" ""Poetic"" and ""haunting"" are other appropriate terms for this genuinely moving little picture, which seemingly came out of nowhere to score heavily among critics and has been developing a strong word-of-mouth following since its quiet release in early August.In ""Wind River,"" a veteran officer with the Wyoming Fish and Wildlife Service while tracking a rogue mountain lion discovers in a remote wilderness location the body of a young woman who appears to have been sexually assaulted and murdered. That the young woman was a Native American from the local Shoshone Reservation eventually complicates and even hinders the identification and apprehension of the killer.The FBI assigns to lead the investigation an inexperienced young agent, and she solicits the assistance of the Wildlife officer. He guides the rookie agent with his expertise while using the case as a means of seeking personal redemption for an act of irresponsibility which led to the unsolved murder of his own teenaged daughter a few years earlier.The critically-acclaimed ""Wind River"" benefits enormously from a quietly authoritative performance from Jeremy Renner as the veteran Fish and Wildlife officer. This is a role which is quintessentially American—at one time the part would've been performed by Steve McQueen, or by Gary Cooper thirty years before McQueen, or by silent screen star William S. Hart thirty years before Cooper. Renner and his performance are easily comparable with the legendary stars of motion picture history.Also starring in ""Wind River"" are Elizabeth Olsen as the rookie FBI agent, and the wonderful Graham Greene as the Native American tribal police chief nominally in charge of the local part of the investigation. The younger sister of the once enormously-popular Olsen Twins acting and singing team from the 1990s, Elizabeth Olsen has matured into a legitimately persuasive and talented performer on her own.In ""Wind River,"" Olsen benefits greatly from performing a role with similarities to her own novice career as an actress—possibly somewhat insecure among the veterans, but canny and practical enough to request and rely upon the guidance of the seasoned pros. Olsen's performance is persuasive, and uniquely effective. Olsen can genuinely act, literally among the best of them. And veteran actor Greene, effective earlier this year in a small but pivotal role in the popular ""The Shack"" but known as well for his signature role in the classic 1990 western ""Dances with Wolves,"" again uses his sleepy eyes and relaxed, almost excessively informal demeanor to disguise a wise and wily character—sharp and experienced, despite a lazy and vaguely incompetent demeanor. In this way, Greene has matured into a sort of modern-day Robert Mitchum. When during a dangerous confrontation Olsen's FBI agent requests backup reinforcement, Greene patiently explains to her, ""This isn't the land of back up—this is the land of you're on your own."" His manner is quiet and firm, but kindly, and gentle.Written and directed by the talented Taylor Sheridan, also the writer of the critically-acclaimed ""Sicario"" from 2015 and last year's ""Hell or High Water,"" ""Wind River"" doesn't miss a trick or leave a plot thread undeveloped. Already known as an enormously talented writer, Sheridan with ""Wind River"" becomes a director to keep an eye on in the future.But ""Wind River"" belongs primarily to Jeremy Renner, in his affecting performance as a decent, solitary man trying to do his best against opposition, apathy, and sometimes overwhelming odds. Despite the actor's strong showings in 2010's ""The Town,"" for which her received an Academy Award nomination, and in 2009's Academy Award-winning Best Picture ""The Hurt Locker,"" this is Renner's career-best performance, at least so far.Filmed, beautifully, on breathtaking Utah locations, ""Wind River"" was financed in part by the Tunica-Biloxi Native American tribe. A closing title notes that missing person reports are tracked for every United States demographic except Native Americans. But far from being a diatribe on Native American human rights or the undeniable and unconscionable slights against their heritage, ""Wind River"" is simply a classic American drama about strong and morally conscientious individuals banding together and trying to work through their responsibilities with a sense of honor, dignity, and integrity.Forget the awards, the critical acclaim, or the likely recognition during awards season—""Wind River"" is a motion picture which will belong in the DVD library of every fan of classic motion pictures, alongside ""Shane,"" ""High Noon,"" ""The Gunfighter,"" and, yes, ""Dances with Wolves."" The final scene especially is almost elegant in its poignant beauty, and relevance. ""Wind River"" is recommended, highly and strongly.",Wind River

That's really all I thought it was going in, but it's so much more than your average whodunit.As it turns out Mary Kate & Ashley's lil' sister can act. I've only seen her in supporting roles, and while she hasn't been bad, I didn't really see 'leading lady' potential there. Here she takes full advantage of the opportunities she's given with this role, putting to bed any notion that she isn't ready for top billing.Jeremy Renner is strong as well, actually delivering what I consider to be his best performance since The Town in 2010. He comes off like he's already lived two lifetimes, neither of which were easy. Stoic and stolid, but still vulnerable and empathetic, he pulled me in right away.The movie goes along at a calm and steady pace, but all at once it shifts to an uncomfortable and intense climax. Having that stark contrast in the final scenes, and forgoing the gradual increase in urgency, was an impressive choice by this first-time director.There is a scene where a character is giving an emotional backstory, but I couldn't concentrate on what they were saying due to the way it was shot. The character is indoors, standing still, but you'd think they were on the deck of a ship with how the camera was moving. It felt like the guy behind the lens was doing the sign of the cross with the camera the entire time, trying to exercise some unseen demons. Unfortunately it took away from an otherwise powerful moment.My only other complaint, and don't quote me on this, but I think they used digital snow in one of the early scenes. It just looks overly affected, and doesn't seem to accumulate on anyone or anything. Again, I could be wrong, but it felt markedly different than the snowfall in other scenes.It's a smaller film, but I'm hoping those Sundance leaves on the poster can push it into the awards conversation. It feels like a movie that will either get completely passed over, or rake in the nominations. And while you can guess I won't be calling for Best Cinematography or Best Visual Effects, I'd be hard pressed to bet against it in any other category. 8.5/10",Wind River
269,benntune,This impacted me,9,24 November 2020,I normally watch movies for entertainment. Not very often does one come along that has a resounding impact on me. I wish I had the words to explain why. The dark subject matter was one thing...the way it was written and the score was perfect. I have now gone back and watched it several times and the result is the same. Sadness and anger and I'm not ashamed to say I really enjoyed the final scene where the guy got what he deserved. One final note... I'm not a firearms person at all. Never shot a rifle in my life. But the way the movie depicted a specially modified high velocity bullet and the raw intensity and carnage of it is something I'll never forget. The fact the targets where people I was happy to see on the receiving end of said bullets is one thing... but the fact these even exist amazes me. I know they are for big game hunting etc... but still. Just awe inspiring.,Wind River
270,paulmcuomo,A hatrick for Taylor Sheridan's official trilogy,10,1 February 2018,"Whilst it's not exact to refer to this, Sicario and Hell or High Water as a trilogy in setting or character, it certainly is through themes as said by Sheridan himself. In all of his films so far, there is a principle character who is a father who is trying to make amends for previous shortcomings as a parent. In Sicario, that was Benicio Del Toro's Alejandro, in Hell or High Water it was Chris Pine's Toby, and in this we have Jeremy Renner's Cory Lambert, a wildlife reserve hunter who despite his profession as a protector and hunter is haunted by the murder of his daughter Emily three years prior to the events of this movie.Sheridan, as an actor, is expert with giving his actors, even the minor players, a lot to play with. Now, with him moving behind the lense with this film, he shows that he can also give his actors excellent direction to go with this. In particular, the standout of this movie is Jeremy Renner in his role as Cory. Cory is noteworthy in this film, since he lives and works in the Wyoming Wind River Native American reverse, of being one of the few white American men who work on the land, and is ironically the outsider here. Renner plays the character with a steel similar to Del Toro's portrayal of Alejandro, but is far more empathetic, and is certainly the standout of the film's amazing cast.Elsewhere, Elizabeth Olsen is in the film playing FBI Agent Jane Banner. She's newly qualified, completely unprepared for the conditions, and completely under resourced. This character could've easily been a useless bimbo type of girl, but fortunately in the hands of Olsen, this part gifted by one of the most exciting new writers of our time is given something new: Jane is smart enough to recognise that she's out of her depth and needs help, is humble enough to empathise with Ben, the police chief, and is realistically capable in gunfight situations.The film's plot is simple, but intriguing: the body of a Native American woman, Natalie, is found raped, barefoot, 6 miles from the nearest civilisation in extreme snow. Jane arrives, and teams up with the Police and Cory to find the truth. The simplicity of the plot doesn't affect the pacing, which is certainly contemplative for the first 20 minutes, but then the rest of the film grows in action and interest - should be noted that this film is very short by modern film standards, at 110 minutes. It certainly is visually interesting, with lots of fantastic poetic imagery with Cory hunting the wolves to protect the Native's flock, the snowstorm setting looking great on screen, and strong correlation of soundtrack and imagery and the way the two don't trample on the other.The supporting cast is amazing, with actors such as Graham Greene, James Jordan, Julia Jones and Eric Lange providing memorable roles.But the true standouts among the supporting cast are Gil Birmingham, who plays Natalie's father, a big, warm presence in the film consisting of the cold, Kelsey Chow playing Natalie herself, and Jon Bernthal playing Natalie's similarly ill-fated boyfriend Matt. Bernthal and Chow only have one scene in the movie, and it's a scene that needs to work otherwise both the investment of the audience and the realism of the situation would fail, and the vibe they give off - that of a relationship that is genuine, affectionate, funny and caring - is one that makes the events of that scene so much more tragic.This movie is brilliant. Admittedly, I've only watched it the once, but it's certainly got the feeling of rewatchability like Hell or High Water especially has. If you haven't seen it yet, buy the DVD and support it.",Wind River
271,andrewfleming-57891,Just okay,7,13 August 2018,"This film is enjoyable, beautiful to look at and well acted. However, the script is very flawed. The murderer is revealed at the end but is given no actual development which makes him quite a forgettable villain. The other characters are also very uninteresting. The film is quite violent at times. It also has too many characters to keep track of. The weakest part of the film was the ending. The villain dies fifteen minutes from the end and we end up being given too much time with Jeremy Renner. I wanted the final scene to be shared between Renner and the FBI agent. Instead it chooses to end with a minor character, one of the local Indians. This scene is confusing and unnesseccary. However, most of the film is pretty good. The best scene is when the police go to the caravan and there is a big shootout. Its original in many ways and could be seen as a completely serious version of Fargo. 7/10",Wind River

273,iamjacksmoviechannel,This Sheridan guy may be one of our best writer/directors yet,8,22 August 2017,"""Wind River"" is the second film from writer/director Taylor Sheridan, who also gave us ""Hell or High Water"" last year, as well as wrote ""Sicario"". It's been called the ""American Frontier Trilogy"", cause let's face it everything sounds better in threes. Elizabeth Olsen plays an FBI agent green to the ways of the snowy wilderness of the Wind River Indian Reservation and Jeremy Renner is an accomplished hunter for the Fish and Wildlife service. Together these two Avenger-cicles are put on to the case of a raped teenage girl found barefoot in the snow. And the way the mystery unfolds is a slow-mover, in fact this movie feels much slower than ""HOHW"" even, so be prepared for that. But it is broken up by scenes of high intensity shoot-outs as well as a chance to just take in this land that becomes the main character.We're seeing a place that is more than just blisteringly cold, It's coldness that can kill a person. It's an area that is desolate, that has been picked apart, and it's inhabitants people who are there because they have no other place to go and now must just survive. I mentioned the place is being picked apart- we see a lot of the factors leading to an even greater decline and one of the most shocking is that this fairly big area has a police force which is about the size of half a starting football team. The cast does nice work here too though, Renner chief among them. As a character who has experienced his own loss, this is his most affecting work since ""The Hurt Locker"". Olsen is a little more understated but still good while Jon Bernthal has a small but key scene here as well. But I think the best performance comes from Gil Birmingham, who plays the dead girls father. You'll remember him from ""HOHW"" and the guy just keeps giving great performances and more people need to cast this man. I love that Sheridan does know how to use him, which makes it hard for me to say but I feel it bares mentioning that I wish he did incorporate a Native American main character into the script other than having two white leads.That said, I feel this may be the weakest of the ""American Frontier Trilogy"", but I still think Sheridan's heart and focus is in the right place and this is another occasionally suspenseful and no less eye-opening piece of work that actually does remind me of a 2 hour episode of the TV show ""Longmire"". That's a good thing. If you liked this, please check out Craig James Review on Youtube for more.",Wind River
274,LoupGarouTFTs,"Wonderful, sad, hopeful",9,4 March 2018,"I don't like snowy scenes. I don't like noble Native American movies. I don't like token hard-bitten female FBI agent movies. I loved this movie. I did not feel warm the entire time this movie was on the air. I loved that every person from the reservation had both virtues and flaws, just like the white FBI agent. I loved that the FBI agent was not one cape short of a superhero and did her best to play the hand she was dealt. I know, I know, there are a couple of plot holes in terms of procedure, but I tend to suspend disbelief a bit because without these issues in procedure, there's no movie. The cinematography was outstanding. The script, while not perfect, was spare and dramatic that sounded ""real"" when spoken. The emotions were close to pitch-perfect. My biggest complaint, I think, was that events toward the end fell into place a little too neatly, making for a slightly weak ending. I would definitely watch this movie again, which is a big deal for me with most movies made after 1985 or so. Most modern movies don't make my ""rewatch"" list at all.",Wind River

I speak from experience. There isn't any of the ""people standing around telling you what is happening or what just happened."" You are there. You don't get all the answers. There is none of that closure BS. With 15 minutes to go you will know what is about to happen and it is terrifying. All you don't know is how it will exactly end.

278,mike_brunton,Really nice simple thriller,10,1 October 2017,"Wind River is one of those low budget movies like Hell or High Water that are a pleasure to watch. I am amazed it was the same writer and first time director Sheridan. I am also amazed with the cast including Renner's excellent depiction of the father out to get his revenge for his daughter. The movie never got boring for me, there were some excellent scenes in it, including the crime itself which was harrowing. The movie ended with a nice sense of closure and I'm sure everyone would be pleased with the main evil character's death. If Sheridan can continue to write with such superb words all his movies will be highly praised. I sort of hope he doesn't sell his soul to Hollywood and end up becoming an A list writer or director. By the end up the movie the sheer feat of this young girl running 5 miles barefoot through minus 20 degree weather really comes through to you, and you really feel for the parents and hope their lost son, comes back to them.",Wind River

What a masterpiece, and btw who says there aren't any good movies this summer?? I liked how the movie spoon fed you little tidbits, and let the suspense build. Jeremy Renner knocks it out of the park as Fish and Wildlife agent Cody Lambert. He plays the agent with heartfelt emotions as you feel like he is on a mission to make amends for his own daughters untimely death. Not only lots of action, suspense, and mystery, but it is packed with a lot of emotions. Gives you the dark side of how our Native American's feel despair. Also the FBI agent played by Elizabeth Olsen packs a lot of punch, as you get this impression like she is in over her head. I have to say I went to this movie with expectations and it ended up being all met, as I had a feeling I could have been in for a let down with all the hype, as that has happened in the past. Not in this case as this movie was a gem! Hats off to all including the director Taylor Sheridan. This is one I could go see again and still enjoy....huge thumbs up!!",Wind River
280,doxxman5,too real and powerful for the Oscars,10,27 July 2018,"There are some movies that are too real and powerful for the Oscars, containing subjects that are taboo. Last year it was Nocturnal Animals, and this year the honor goes to Wind River, which is a drama that never lets up. It is about the persecution of Native American people, in particular the abuse and rape of the women in their culture. Sure the men can't escape and often get imprisoned, but the women mainly end up dead. As Jeremy Renner and Elisabeth Olsen's character's try to navigate the landscape, they are constantly reminded that they will always be outsiders, no matter how much they try to help. Evening the scales and helping drive out the oppressors is a nice idea, but it is far too late as the Native American people are all but extinct.

285,theresamgill,"Overall, pretty good",7,12 June 2018,"""We have to drive 50 miles to go 5. Welcome to Wyoming."" Not only is this a cool line of dialogue, but I believe it perfectly captures how much the land and the environment affect the story, pacing, and tone of Wind River. The movie starts with a girl running panicked through the wintery woods before collapsing in the night. She is then discovered frozen by Jeremy Renner, a trained tracker who knows his ways around these parts and with these people-even if he is a white outsider. It's obvious he has some sort of troubled past that hunches on his back despite his efforts to push forward. This mysterious past motivates him to help the young FBI agent Elizabeth Olsen with the case; and coming straight from Las Vegas, it's obvious that she needs the help of a local. The movie has ominous undertones of the dark side of humanity sprinkled within the glistening snow of the beautiful landscape. The serious, almost straight-forward approach to the simplistic story kept reminding me of Sicario, and I didn't realize until afterward that it's the same writer. This writer Taylor Sheridan, who previously was lauded for both Sicario and Hell or High Water, both writes and directs for this film. He's definitely imitating aspects from Denis Villeneuve, and if there's a director to imitate, he's one of the best choices. With that said, I think the production, editing, score, and cinematography are all ultimately better than the decent directing. On the surface the film is about a murder investigation on an Indian reservation with an FBI agent receiving help from a skilled tracker/hunter. And except a nice turn from Jon Bernthal, there's nothing really surprising here. Some shocking moments, but nothing surprising. But that's rightfully not the focus of the film. And neither are the decently developed characters. Wyoming takes the starring role here. There's enough snow in sight to freeze a polar bear, and despite how little that analogy may make sense, it's true. And it's used to full effect with blistering wide shots mixed with shivering closeups of the characters. The setting is an obstacle, a visual splendor, a kickstarter for the right moments in the plot, and an underlying motivation. Without Wyoming, this movie is nowhere near the same. As much as I praise the setting for this film, you do still have to knock the film a bit for the story. The unflinching storytelling-almost reminiscent of Prisoners-will work for some, and may be a slight turnoff for others looking for a more upbeat movie. That's not really the issue. Olsen and Renner run into new characters, potential suspects even, and it's pretty easy to tell from the get-go how all these encounters are going to go. To keep with the Prisoners comparison, there's no Jake Gyllenhaal to do detective work here. And to Taylor Sheridan's credit, he plays up the mood, setting, and characters to focus on them because he can't rely on a plot twist filled story to keep the audience engaged. This film really does try to replicate a lot of the successful tension built in Sicario. It works to some degree, and the filmmakers do an admirable job trying to coverup any other shortcomings this film has. It's not the best film, and it certainly isn't a joyous film, but if you're trying to think of something to watch, this is a better choice than plenty of other movies. Heck, it definitely won't put you in a merry spirit, but it's got plenty of snow to be a movie to watch over the break.

290,Robosharp,Would have preferred if it was just a wildlife documentary.,5,3 December 2017,"Wind River is one of those films that many will really like and many won't like at all. Im in the latter.A very quick summary of the plot revolves around the discovered body of a murdered native young woman/girl in an Indian reservation. Out of towner female FBI agent Elizabeth Olsen turns up to solve the case with the help of the native law enforcement and also local tracker/ mad max-vigilante, Jeremy Renner.It starts off very promising and straight away we get a dose of Wyoming's beautiful snow capped land scales and feral wildlife - a real visual treat, but then unfortunately the so called murder investigation/plot starts.The main reason reason I didn't like this is because there was no murder investigation. Renner, who mumbles his way through the film, and Olsen kinda just move from one location to the next causing more harm than good. Olsen's character is supposed to be this rabbit in in the headlights turned tough cookie Clarice Starling alike and feminist alarm bells start ringing when she clashes with local authority and the natives over the murder and her ability to get it resolved. To be honest that doesn't bother me to much, but want did bother me was the morality side of the two lead characters.Both seem deeply troubled throughout by the death of the native girl who was found frozen and molested in the snow and walked 6 miles before falling to her death. Sure of course that is awful, but her death is the only one that counts, the numerous men that are killed in the process of their 'investigation' is of no importance at all. The scene that cements this the most is where Olsen's FBI agent knocks at the door of a potential suspect, he runs she chases they have a short stand off where she blasts him to death with a flurry of bullets from her gun. He did have a gun in his hand so could be perceived as self defence, but that isn't the major issue. The major issue is that it turns out he had nothing to do with the murder investigation, but its very much swept under the carpet. The very next scene Olsen is Jovially chatting with Renner on their next move, there is absolutely no signs from her that she just shot an individual to death, no emotions or anything, as though it did happen, what does she do this every day? Didn't sit well with that, seeing as this film is not a tongue in cheek actioner like Kick Ass.The silly shoot outs don't stop there as there a climatic one where 10 or so law enforcement agents are killed in a stand off where everybody dies except Olsen's tough brave and extremely lucky FBI agent who happened to be bang smack in the middle of it. She is helped by Renner who is sniping some of these bad guy cops from a distance. Thats right Renner who through most of the film is an ordinary local tracker has now turned into a psychopathic killer and vigilante, who dishes out mad max style justice on one one of the girls murderers when he catches him.OK I think you can tell i wasn't keen on there films plot and moral grounds, I also thought it lacked any drama as there was no real investigating, it was more action.I must say though the film is shot beautifully and has a compelling score. The best bits for me was the stunning scenery and interaction with wildlife in this remote part of the USA. Its a real pity the characters turned up!",Wind River
291,jeffyoung1,Shoutout to Elizabeth Olsen,8,13 March 2018,"This movie, WIND RIVER, is definitely worth watching. The cast is excellent and one of the main actors, Game and Fishing official Cory Lambert played by actor Jeremy Renner is superb.
But my hat goes off to Elizabeth Olsen as FBI agent, Jane Banner.
One of the reasons I held off on watching Wind River was my original concern that Elizabeth Olsen was going to be unrealistically portrayed as some kind of FBI superheroine agent who kicks 6-feet tall bad guys around. First, I was wrong thinking Olsen is 5'3"". I was surprised to learn that she's actually 5'6"" although in the movie she did look very short to me. I really loved Olsen's FBI Jane Banner because she WASN'T a phony superheroine with super strength and martial arts master skills and a crack shot. Her FBI character was completely believable and likeable. I'll tell you why.
1) FBI agent Jane Banner is a desk-bound, FBI agent based out of Las Vegas. Banner is well-trained, professional, but young and inexperienced.
2) Jane Banner is obviously no Wonder Woman and she clearly understands her own limitations and lack of field experience. Yet she doesn't make excuses and puts in the required time and effort and we see that she does her best given the mere perfunctory response the FBI lends to a ho-hum homicide on a little-known Indian Reservation out in the boondocks vastness of Wyoming.
3) Jane Banner is a likeable person. She has no overt personality flaws and no ego hang-ups. She is polite, courteous, and tactful and doesn't bulldoze her way onto the reservation murder investigation. Yet she skillfully deploys her federal (FBI) authority to defuse a dangerous confrontation between the oil rig security guards and the local sheriffs.
4) Jane's FBI training shows when she immediately realizes the danger of a suspicious, drugged-up Indian suspect starting to reach inside his own clothing which is justified when the tweaker pulls out a spray canister of pepper spray.
5) Jane's youthful inexperience shows when she knocks on the front door of the murder victim's boyfriend's quarters. At the time they suspected the boyfriend as the murderer and didn't know the boyfriend was also a murder victim himself. But not knowing that, Jane should have kept to the side of the door when knocking on it. The real killer shot Jane through the door. Luckily Jane, following her FBI training, did not neglect to wear her bulletproof vest.
6) Jane Banner does not turn out to be a superheroine and she doesn't save the day but she gets her licks in and helps bring down a few of the bad guys. It's Cory (Renner) who is the main hero who saves the day and saves Jane. But Jane's FBI character is still central to the storyline. She is the character who ties in together the other main characters, the reservation sheriff and Game and Fishing official hunter tracker, Cory, as the official investigative team's de facto leader, being the federal authority.
7) A flashback shows the actual crimes. It was a sick tragedy that was orchestrated by one, obnoxious, intoxicated (alcohol always seems to be part of it) security guard team member. Had he not been there to incite his fellow security guard teammates, the rape and murder would never have occurred.",Wind River
292,patboldt,2017's Underrated Thriller that Deserves Love,8,22 February 2018,"Wind River is a cruelly underrated movie from 2017. Since 2017 has been one of those amazing years for cinema, this isn't surprising but it hurts when something like Three Billboards gets all the praise when this amazing crime drama get's nothing at all from the Academy Awards. It has phenomonal acting and a really good story, one which is not often told. First off, this is the best performance I have seen from Jeremy Renner. He plays a devastated father who seeks to redeem his life and you wanna cheer for him since he's a figure who deserves redemption. Yes, one who DESERVES redemption! I am so sick of the failed father figure cliche and movies and I hate it when it's done lazily. Why does every father in movies have to be Adam Sandler? Can't we have a movie with a stable working relationship. Of course not! It's hard to write those movies and it's a lot easier to have the generic divorced family get's back together at the end plotline which I am just sick of! That being said, Jeremy Renner's character Cory is a failed father but it doesn't focus on him getting back with his wife it's about him coming to terms with his mistakes as a father. That's way more interesting than just him being a father who fails comedically and a father who lacks awareness. Then, in the story, Cory goes out of his way to track down a murderer who killed an innocent women and the case has some emotional impact on him since his daughter suffered a similar fate. This allows us to feel sympathetic towards Cory and want him to succeed. It's genius! Then we have Elizabeth Olson and she plays a really good really compelling FBI agent. She's not some generic female lead who's just great at everything, she just knows how to do her job. Her character, Jane, joins Cory and asks for his help because he knows the land and how to hunt in the frozen wilderness while she knows how to be a good cop who can handle herself in a fight. If this was a Marvel movie she would be doing Karate and be completely unstoppable and that's not realistic. Showing her struggle in the Wyoming Wilderness is may more compelling and gives her a reason to ask for Cory's help. Every second they spend together demonstrates good chemistry and I can really appreciate how both characters sort of bond with each other. But the number one thing this movie does is tell a story that deserves to be told. Let me explain. I've seen lots of crime dramas, but most of them happen in cities with generic cops vs criminals. How often do you see a crime drama in which it's not black people vs white people but native American locals vs White American outsiders/ Not many I bet. What's even better is that neither side is shown to be pure good or pure evil, both have their own problems which hurt their communities. I won't delve too deep into the plot but let me say that it really gives an accurate portrayal of the deep tensions that impact these two communities, tension which only fuels the suspense as the hunter and FBI agent team up to take down a criminal. This movie is a wild ride that is suspenseful and compelling. The social commentary is in the background and you can make your own conclusions without having to be told what to think. If you want a good crime drama that actually ""feels"" suspenseful rather than looks suspenseful give this a watch. 8/10 pretty good flick.",Wind River

Grief is also a visible theme. The movie contains suitably action scenes and wilderness culture. Indian traditions are trying to maintain like hunting and connection to nature.

His screenplays for ""Sicario"" and ""Hell or High Water"" both encompass lots of the themes and settings of westerns and sets it to modern times, and this film is not so different. It is centered around a white tracker/hunter, played by Jeremy Renner, who is living on the titular Indian Reserve in Wyoming. Early on we learn that he is still recovering from the unexpected death of his daughter from three years prior, so when he finds a body of a dead girl he immediately is interested. Luckily for him, the new wet-behind-the-ears FBI agent, played by Elizabeth Olsen. who shows up to take the case is in need of someone to help her navigate the unforgiving physical and social terrain of the reservation. This film does not play out like a buddy cop movie though, The characters and inhabitants of Wind River are all in pain in some way or another. I think this film is compelling due to its characters, setting, and story (I'm a sucker for a good police procedural thriller), but is let down in the way of direction and some acting. This film is bleak and character driven. It isn't until around 20 minutes into the movie that Jeremy Renner's character, Cory, finds the body and sets the events of the film into motion. The time up until then is spent developing his character and the pain he is going through of losing his daughter. Here some of the dialogue is kind of weak and too on the nose, like ""is that how sissy died"", but overall it's still a welcome change of pace to movies that immediately drop you in on the action. Unfortunately what holds this film back the most is the directing. It's so f**king bland it's incredible. There's so much unnecessary hand-held, and so many weak cuts where scenes jump from one to another prematurely it is honestly quite frustrating. Yet by the time the tension filled third act of this film starts really heating up all my complaints for the film go right out the window. It's exciting, tense, and well shot. There's a style to be found in the action sequences that is just missing throughout the rest of this movie, which is a real shame as this could have been a 9/10 for me if the direction was just up to par. But that and some of Jeremy Renner's acting are the only things that really hold this film back at me. Yes there are some nit picks I have with it as well: like how nobody ever breathes out cold air even though it's supposed to be below freezing, and how sometimes the score ruins some of the tension (although for the most part I would have to say the score for this movie is pretty great) but these are minor issues and slight inconveniences at most. Overall this is an excellent film that explores a part of Modern America that is too often forgotten about or brushed aside.",Wind River

Great New Western!",Wind River
298,Humphreywashere,"The best film of 2017. Extraordinary, spellbinding.",10,22 August 2017,"I was smitten from the first 5 mins. I didn't expect to be. All I knew of this film was that a man named Taylor Sheridan had written the screenplay, and he had done the same for Sicario. Sheridan also directed Wind River. Well, what a talent! Given that Sicario was foreboding, with a tension that didn't let up, and unforgettable, I thought Wind River might also satisfy. I was right. Wind River grips your heart from start to finish. The magnitude of the tension generated is bewildering it is so masterfully created that it emerges as if it is merely a by- product. The acting is astonishing, extremely well cast, with a script that is plain speaking, intensely intimate, efficient and integral - ""you didn't see it, did you?"". The snow and the cold is truly thrilling being set in the mountainous Wind River Native American settlement in Wyoming where the temperature can drop to -20 degrees C. This is a story about many things. Yes, it is a crime thriller and sensational for that reason alone. But this movie is much, much more than that. There is a great heart to this movie, a little reminiscent of Revenant, but Wind River is very contemporary, very real, very important.",Wind River
299,tenyearreunion,I expected quality and pretty much received it,8,12 November 2017,"Being a fan of Taylor Sheridan's Sicario and Hell or High Water, I expected the same level of suspense, drama, believable characters and cinematography. By and large I received this. He is setting a high bar for himself.A big positive is a great cast, from the smaller roles to the two main leads. Jeremy Renner at his most comfortable, almost downplaying his character to accommodate Elizabeth Olsen who, yet again, absolutely compounds my belief she has a great career ahead of her. She needs more leading roles with a decent script and complex characters, without a doubt. She is wasted in the blockbuster movies such as the Avengers and Godzilla (but I guess they pay the bills!). I will be seeking her out in Kodachrome with haste. People may say she was given a meek, 'rabbit caught in the headlights' role here. I feel this isn't really the point, just simply the opportunity to tell a story of a character becoming stronger, not a super hero, just stronger. Wind River sets the tone for a bleak, dare I say, boring, setting of a reservation with a 'wild west like' lawless nature. It then plays out a well paced whodunnit thriller. I rarely say this but I actually feel it could have benefited from 10-15 mins added to the runn time to flesh out the plot line further. Or maybe I feel that way simply because I was enjoying it so much?The script was concise and I can't think of a scene I thought was superfluous to the plot. No mean feat in a modern film. A sign of a good editor.Sadly, it is by no means perfect. I feel more could have been made of the injustices taken place on the reservation and the poor treatment of Native Americans. Also, there were a couple of scenes with a shaky cam which I cannot believe was purposeful, if so, it was unnecessary and distracting.The film left me damning myself for not making the time to see this in the cinema, I know for a fact I would have enjoyed it more.This is everything the recent 'The Snowman' should have been.",Wind River

I personally enjoyed Killing of a Sacred Deer a bit more, but that is an indie movie that was designed for the art house niche crowd.

303,gimili3979,An American Indian murder mystery,7,7 April 2018,"Wind River is a movie about a Fish and Game hunter who helps an FBI agent try to solve a mysterious murder on the Wind River Indian Reservation. This film explores the other side of living on an American Indian reservation. This journey in the film, while important for discussing the culture of American Indian society, often makes the film feel slow at times. A lot of dialogue about pain, hope, despair, and lost opportunity are intertwined within this murder mystery.The film is very similar in style to the 1992 movie, Thunderheart. As a movie, I thought Thunderheart was a much better overall story/murder mystery mainly because while it showed American Indian life/culture, the story remained focused on the mystery. In this movie, Wind River, the murder mystery tends to get lost at times within the long dialogue scenes about Wind River society and culture. Then it gets back to the murder mystery. As a film, I recommend seeing it. It has a good story and great ending. However, because of the film's pace, I think many viewers will probably only watch it one time.",Wind River

Small town. No one is helping. We've got a mystery.Every time I looked up, yet another alumni from The Twilight Saga showed up in this flick.
At least three of them.
I think when a call goes out for actors that look Indian, you'll see The Twilight alums show up.
Kinda strange seeing them altogether though. There were wolves in this movie and I keep waiting for them to shift back to human.Anyways, if you like this type of mystery and have no problem with stories that move incredibly slow, then you'll probably like this.I really didn't. While I don't mind a good drama, this just moved at a snails pace. The main actor who plays the wildlife guy, is very hard to understand when he speaks. He's a mumbler.

311,NormanCroucher,Allegorical mystery thriller makes for a haunting experience,8,1 November 2017,"Screenwriter Taylor Sheridan's directorial debut is a rather bleak affair that mixes murder mystery with the modern day western, set in a frozen landscape where cowboys and indians still roam, only now as long-forgotten ghosts. And the war between them still rages on.Jeremy Renner and Elizabeth Olsen enjoy a naturalistic and believable dynamic together, perhaps thanks to their previous working collaborations, and the usual mismatched partners at odds clichés are immediately done away with by establishing both characters as professional, capable and cooperative. While this is a refreshing spin on a familiar trope, their relationship does lack a degree of conflict and drama. Renner's tracker has a sad backstory so he's all good for character depth, but Olsen's FBI agent is pretty much a mystery. We never learn much about her as a person or her past, which is a shame because she is utterly compelling in the role, projecting equal parts vulnerability and intensity. The whole cast feels authentic and natural and helps to really sell this world of an Indian reservation buried in ice and blood. Perhaps more time could have been spent exploring these people in greater depth. I would have gladly watched an extra 10-15 minutes of this story, just to get to know everyone better and feel more invested in them.What is most commendable about Sheridan's muscular plotting is that it feels like a genuine investigation unfolding. There is nothing staged or contrived about it, even when we get a sharp stab of action. He also engineers a very slick third act reveal and transition to help us better understand events in context without the need for someone to monologue out some exposition of the hows, whys and whos. Once we finally get a clearer (and highly disturbing) picture of what happened, the metaphor that Sheridan's narrative is trying to embody becomes apparent and that the young woman's death at the start is analogous to the rape and murder of an entire culture, left to drown in its own blood in the middle of nowhere. With films about the Native American experience (and modern America's historical guilt complex), the solution to the case was perhaps an obvious and inevitable revelation, but still effective as allegory. For me, it is a message that would have been rendered far more powerful had Renner's character been written to be an actual Native American, something I suspect that Sheridan may have originally intended.'Wind River' matches the unforgiving weather it portrays, much in the same way the atmospherics in Denis Villeneuve's tonally similar 'Prisoners' reflected the mindset of its characters and themes of its story. The beautiful snowy landscapes and crisp cinematography really help to sell this desolate frontier feeling, while the haunting score evokes an air of foreboding as well as a sense of loss. There are some minor gripes here but this is strong and solid storytelling that marks a promising debut for Sheridan in the director's chair.",Wind River
312,maruugaa,This is the best movie I've seen this decade,10,18 April 2018,"My eyes were glued to the screen for the whole 1.75 hours of this movie. The majority of movies this decade are remakes, or continous superhero movies, political dramas that try too hard and just end up being boring, or action movies that is zero story with a lot of CGI and stuff blowing up.This movie had an in-depth, complex, twisting plot. You become emotionally connected with all the characters in the movie, feel their rage and their sadness. And it also looks at a very real issue going on in USA and Canada right now that seems to be overlooked.I was actually enraged that the Oscar for best picture went to The Shape of Water and not this one.

320,tlrg-legend,"Wind River is a powerful examination of the human soul, while also containing scenes that'll take your breath away, as it shocks and awes the audience in waves.",7,2 November 2017,"Wind River is a powerful examination of the human soul, while also containing scenes that'll take your breath away, as it shocks and awes the audience in waves.Taylor Sheridan is a writer/director who has been making a bit of noise in Hollywood over the past couple of years. With scripts like Sicario and Hell or High Water, the man is another talented individual that's brought the hard edge of film noir and the world-weary melancholy of the Western, and meshed them into darkly brilliant contemporary works. His latest film, Wind River, marks his first time directing one of his own scripts, and it's a film that certainly doesn't disappoint, as it tells a tale of vengeance and investigation that fits right at home with his previous works.Cory Lambert (Jeremy Renner) and Jane Banner (Elizabeth Olsen) are trying to solve a mystery on the Wind River Indian Reservation. After an abused young woman is found frozen to death in a clearing, the circumstances leading to her death are unknown. Their list of suspects is limited, but time is not on their side, as every step closer to the truth puts them further in harm's way.Much like Taylor Sheridan's Hell or High Water, Wind River straddles the line between the more desperate parts of human nature, and the more nurturing aspects as well. It works just as well in this film as it did in the previous, as Sheridan's command of dialogue and characters draws the audience into the world of the Wind River reservation. You believe the world that's being presented on screen, and the people that inhabit it, which leads to the film's bleak atmosphere permeating every frame of the film.Though Wind River does manage to wear its forlorn heart on its sleeve to maximum effect, the writer/director's trademark humor does find its way into the film's narrative, while not disrupting the more dramatic moments. It's because of this effective world building that both Jeremy Renner and Elizabeth Olsen's central performances are all the more effective, as both characters are living breathing people rather than caricatures. Renner's Cory is a frontiersman bad ass, but he's still got a sadness about him that drives him to solve this mystery, while Olsen's Jane is an investigator trying to figure out both the case. With both of these characters acting as serious anchors to the film's story, a character like Graham Greene's Ben is surely appreciated, as he helps lighten the mood when the moment calls for it.While Wind River's story is as compelling as it is believable, the only weak link is the mystery central to the film's plot. It's adequate enough to push the film along, but it's a fairly simple case to crack after a certain point of the film's running time. However, the advantage to that aspect is how Taylor Sheridan's story is left to delve more into the human components of revenge, loss, and justice that drive our characters. So while this may not be as much of a procedural as audiences will be expecting, the film left turns into some heavier material that is normally absent from a film that would pay more attention to the former. This in turn amplifies the film's limited instances of violence when they do occur, as sudden and explosive bursts of action punctuate the methodical story being spun throughout.It's early in the year to lock anything down, but Wind River could be Taylor Sheridan's next Oscar nomination for Best Original Screenplay. That said, don't be surprised if he rides his dark horse into the awards fray again, this time with a Best Director nod in tow. Sheridan's command of not only his actors, but the words and images of his own story, exudes such confidence in his craft, to the point where it feels like he's a talent that's just getting warmed up. The western noir genre suits him well, and Wind River is a powerful examination of the human soul, while also containing scenes that'll take your breath away, as it shocks and awes the audience in waves.",Wind River

The movie sets up a mystery early on with some girl we don't know or care about and the pay off after an hour of boring, drawn out nonsense is that the whole thing (spoiler alert) was done by some guys who were evil for no reason. They brutally murder their friend and rape his girlfriend for no reason at all, they just do it because they are meanie heads.

There are a lot of reasons, but the script is high on the list. It's not action packed and there's a lot of character building, but that wasn't an issue for me. It's deep, emotional and tough. Jeremy Renner is ridiculous in this movie. He is intense, tough, calm along with wise. Renner must have experienced some sort of pain in his life to be able to act the way he did. It's really a performance you can't miss. The rest of the cast are also great. Special shout out to Graham Greene for being able to add a bit of humour to a very deep and dark movie.The movie is about a young Native American who dies from freezing to death because she was running away from something. It's hard to watch what actually happened, which makes an already intense movie harder to watch. That doesn't mean you shouldn't. If you can't handle some hard scenes, do a 10 second skip. In my mind, if you cant watch you are already emotionally invested. You will also want to see the outcome of the movie. The last 40 minutes are intense.It's a must see!",Wind River
324,hakrames,Taylor Sheridan Knocks out Another Masterpiece,10,30 December 2017,"""Wind River"" Written and Directed by Taylor Sheridan, Starring Elizabeth Olsen, Jeremy Renner, and Graham Greene. About a rookie FBI agent and big game hunter uncovering the mystery of a young woman who was raped and murdered and left in the snow. The synopsis of the movie may sound like it's another 'murder mystery' type movie but this isn't the case with in depth characters and an intriguing yet simple storyline with some twists that no one can even expect to happen makes this movie worth the viewing. Sheridan taking his first steps on becoming one of the greats with writing has come out and done his first directing job and nailed it perfectly. With some of the lingering shots on objects and scenes to the intense fight scenes that break out randomly to the monologues that are given throughout make chills go down just about anybody's spines. Acting wise it was flawless all around. Renner is unrecognizable as Cory with his chilling past and his ice cold straight face he keeps throughout is mesmerizing. Olsen as Banner is also amazing with them both working on Avengers and Civil War together to this, their on screen chemistry pours out with these A list actors. Even minor roles like Jon Bernthal and Kelsey Chow were great and even Gil Birmingham as the father of the murdered girl is incredible with his straight face in some scenes and others of him breaking down to nothing from the incident that has happened. The pacing of this story is amazing with a balance of strong, interesting drama to some brutal scenes of action that end unexpectedly in twists of huge proportions. My favorite had to be the scenes between Renner and Olsen, and Olsen and Greene when they shared them because they were powerful, sometimes comical in the right points, and all around just moving with morals and differences with their different viewpoints and drives they have for this film. With the minor special effects used in it. It shocks you when it does with it seamlessly being brought into these brutal action scenes that were so satisfying on the first viewing of it. With a flawless and simple story powered by great actors and a head strong director with great action and scene building. There isn't a flaw to this film at all.",Wind River
325,FallonTimberlake2016,Jeremy Renner shines in this murder mystery that shines a light on the life of modern Native Americans.,9,27 November 2017,"Wind River is the debut film from the writer of Hell or High Water and Sicario, and stars Jeremy Renner as a hunter in snowy Wyoming who comes across the body of a girl miles from the nearest civilization. He is joined by an inexperienced FBI agent, played by Elizabeth Olsen, and the film explores the personal relationships of Renner's character and the injustices of being on an American Indian reservation.This film is an emotional masterpiece that has a surprising amount of depth, and never goes quite in the direction you expect it to go. Renner shines in the best performance that he has given since The Hurt Locker, and should even be considered for an Oscar nomination (even though we all know he won't be.) He controls the movie, and shows a lot of emotion with just small gestures and actions.Wind River is also a beautifully shot film. It captures the landscape of the Wind River Indian Reservation with ease, and makes you feel as if you are there.The cold comes through the screen and transports you to a different location.Without giving anything away, I will also say that the ending is also very satisfying. It manages to wrap up the main storyline while giving some closure to some side characters. The solution to the murder mystery feels real, and doesn't play as though it is in a Hollywood movie.Wind River is dramatic movie-making at its finest, and showcases Jeremy Renner's range that is not seen in his roles in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. It also delivers a truly suspenseful adventure that, near the end, gives you a twisted feeling deep down in your stomach, but in a good way.I give Wind River an A.",Wind River
326,knersisman,Wind River,8,10 December 2018,"This is a crime thriller with its fundamentals rooted in the old Western style of narration. It has the typical Western style narration where the main character is portrayed as a kind of a loner who is doing his job and not bothering anybody. Then a crisis develops and the main character is directly pulled into the events and tries his best to be of assistance. The existential struggles of individuals are very well portrayed, which contributes directly to a very strong psychological component of the movie. The social issues that are typical of a deserted place like Alaska are also very well portrayed - drug abuse, murder and rape.Overall it is a cold and brutal movie that might upset people, but not in the sense that it tries to be sensational.

331,imdb-936-837144,In Deep Water,8,5 September 2017,"The opening titles declare ""Wind River"" to be ""inspired by actual events."" The opening scene is a protracted one of an Indian girl—barely an adult—running then crawling across an open expanse of snow, trying to make the tree line as she recites in her mind a poem of hers: ""A Meadow in My Perfect World."" The poem has the view­point of up in a tree. It's almost as if she is longing for higher ground. It could conceivably be an arche­type of a widespread flood.Next is a scene of a wolf worrying some Wyoming sheep. Wild­life official Cory Lambert (Jeremy Renner) takes care of it. Now we start thinking in terms of Noah who shepherded a passel of animals into an ark. Noah according to the book of Enoch was an albino, and Cory is dressed in camouflage white.Next stop is the town of Lander where Cory picks up his eight-year-old boy. Of course, after the ark landed, Noah himself would be a *lander*, the name of the town. Here's where it gets positively weird. There's a globe on the shelf next to Cory as he warns his ex-wife Roma about the oncoming blizzard. Of course, Noah had preached about a coming world­wide flood.It's more of the same from here on. Noah's wife was evidently too old to bear children after the flood—she didn't have any more—and likely not able to shortly before it either. Their youngest Ham was conceivably the off­spring of a maid­servant, per the custom of the time. The servant girl did not make the cut for the ark ride, but Noah had custody of Ham when they took it. Like­wise, Cory has custody of his kid this day, and his ex- has a job inter­view, her location being defined by her work.Next we get to a scene where Cory teaches his kid how to dominate their riding horse. After the ark landed, God renewed man's dominance of the animals (Gen 9: 2), ""And the fear of you shall be upon every beast of the earth."" Then comes Cory's wildlife patrol where he discovers some cat tracks next to a slaughtered steer (""It's a lion, all right."") Multiple tracks (""Mama's teaching her kids to hunt."") Once that happens she has doomed her whole family. Here in Oregon we'll put down a rogue wolf that kills live­stock. Here it seems to be a matter of their family business, not individual character but the pattern of their paw prints. Oh, well.Now comes the gist of the story proper. Seems the body of the introductory scene Natalie is discovered frozen having succumbed to weather as a proximate cause, from evident foul play earlier. Cory is drafted by local law enforcement to simply drive around a green FBI agent Jane Banner (Elizabeth Olsen), and then his tracking expertise kicks in. His own daughter had been brutalized three years ago, so he is self-motivated to seek justice for this new death. It's similar to the way the antediluvian world was full of violence causing God to flood it out. There­fore Noah didn't want to see violence introduced into the cleaned-up world. Gen. 9:19-27 relates an incident that cast's Noah's youngest son Ham in a bad light for having looked upon his father's nakedness. According to *The Interpreter's Bible*, Vol. I, p. 556, ""In the primary, popular form of the story there probably occurred here—as shown by the reference in vs. 24 to 'what his younger son had done to him'—an account of an indecent attack by ((Ham)) on his father."" In the film some stir-crazy drunken boys living in this isolated region wanted to practice voyeurism on Natalie (""All I want is a little peep""), which escalated into some­thing far worse. We are spared much of the details, just as the Bible story spares us.There's an accounting to be had by the tracker who will search out all the miscreants. Noah pronounced a life of servitude on Ham's offspring. The Tracker like­wise will give his targets a chance rather than kill them out­right if he can avoid it.For the record, Noah's other two sons (righteous Shem and Japheth) can have their off­spring represented by the whites (""crackers"") and the native Americans in this film, traveling the rocky road to some kind of integration, (Gen. 9:27) ""God shall enlarge Japheth, and he shall dwell in the tents of Shem."" Integration of blacks is not dealt with in this movie, and does not follow the same formula in the archetype. Ham's oldest son Cush—Hebrew for black—settled in Africa where real lions dwell. How­ever, it can be projected that Cory is a negrophile on account of the women's magazine article he reads about the ten ways to tell he's into you, which includes him looking in your eyes during conversation. Cory does look into the mountain lion's eyes in its den where it is pitch black.This is, like, one strange whodunit, ""not in the land of backup, but the land of you're on your own."" There is minimal police procedure—just some jurisdictional wrangling—but justice proceeds more on atavistic grounds, as, say in the days of Noah where they were not surrounded by the safe­guards of civilization, although God seemed to trust Noah in his judgment. Noah's travails seem to be the best paradigm to relate this movie to, although there is lots of human and wilderness appeal without considering any of that. It just impressed itself on my mind that way, and it's not an unheard-of story, so I put it in my review.I quite enjoyed the show going along at a slow pace, punctuated at the right time with flared-up violence. Unless you're set in some more traditional formula, I find it worthy of my recommendation.",Wind River
332,breheneyjames,A well crafted modern crime/noir story,8,17 September 2017,"Given Taylor Sheridan's previous works as the writer of ""Sicario"" and ""Hell or High Water"", I was rather excited to see what he would do when also taking the helm. This feature ""Wind River"", as Sheridan has said himself, completes his unofficial trilogy of stories exploring the American frontier and it does so on a high note. The film is captivating from beginning to end due to well paced writing, directing and editing and raw performances particularly from Jeremy Renner, Elizabeth Olsen and Gil Birmingham.Renner plays a Fish and Wildlife officer/tracker named Cory Lambert who patrols the Wind River Indian reservation in Wyoming which gives the film it's name. Olsen plays an FBI agent named Jane Banner who is called in to investigate the death of a Native American woman found at the reservation. She represents an outsider looking in perspective of this culture as Renner represents the opposite of someone who lives within in it and understands the landscapes due to his occupation.When the autopsy of the body reveals it was a homicide, Jane asks Cory to help with the case due to his expertise and he agrees so they set out to investigate. It is revealed later on that Cory's daughter was murdered too and he feels responsible for it so he is using this case as a chance for redemption and closure.The film's slow but deliberate pace and crisp cinematography makes you almost feel the biting cold of the environment and the harshness that this culture deals with on a day to day basis. The film highlights some unfortunate truths like the fact that even though the medical examiner believes the case is a homicide he can't report it as one due to a technicality. Also, it is revealed just before the credits in the form of text on the screen that there is no record keeping of missing Native Americans therefore nobody knows how many are truly missing.It is clear that Sheridan likes to explore uncomfortable subject matter such as the Mexican drug cartel in ""Sicario"", disenfranchised Middle America in ""Hell or High Water"" and now the mistreatment of Native Americans in ""Wind River"". It is also clear that he is very good at it as each of these films are filled with palpable passion and care.The only thing I had a problem with in ""Wind River"" was editing in the third act. I felt the way the flashback is utilized is disorienting and a little clumsy which makes the whole final act somewhat disjointed.However, other than that, ""Wind River"" is a well crafted crime drama/noir thriller which sheds light on issues seldom talked about.",Wind River

334,FilmsFillMyHoles,It's True Detective season 2 all over again...,6,20 September 2017,"Hearing the raving reviews about Wind River caught my attention but only after finding out that it was written and directed by Taylor Sheridan, the writer of last years Hell or High Water, which I absolutely love, did I decide that I'd definitely check it out in the theatres. I have to admit I left kinda disappointed.During Wind River all I could think about was the resemblance to True Detective, season 2 that is:Both were written by someone who previously created something amazing and kind of special (True Detective season 1 and Hell or High Water), but ultimately failing to recreate that same magic, that lightning in a bottle with their following work - Pizzolato's TD season 2 and now Sheridan's Wind River.Other than the circumstances of making them, they share the same problems in writing, directing and production and weirdly enough I found this to be true in their positive attributes as well. Wind River has impressive cinematography and an incredible sense of chilling atmosphere, which actually made me feel cold and shaky at times, creating a gloomy and depressed mood, which was complimented by the incredible and fittingly melancholic soundtrack, again just like TD season 2. This being said I did think that the story was quite basic, bit too simple and slightly unengaging, lacking layered well-written or at least unique characters. That being said the actors did a solid job with what they had, in TD- S2 it was Collin Farrel, Vince Vaughn and Rachel McAddams and here Jeremy Renner and Elizabeth Olsen (along with Graham Greene who was probably my favourite) who elevated their underdeveloped characters with their performances. Some of the dialogue while having some well-thought out interesting ideas and touching moments felt a bit forced, unrealistic. Finally, the director! True Detective had Cary Fukunaga and Hell or High Water had David Mackenzie, the directors and writers complimented each other perfectly, but TD without Fukunaga and Sheridan directing feels like its missing something. All in all, both Wind River and season 2 of True Detective, while having some pacing issues, are well above the average crime thrillers we get nowadays (e.g.: Sleepless), that have personality and are worth seeing for sure (if only for their climax which is extremely satisfying and touching in both cases).",Wind River
335,dsohn7,Great film. Simple yet effective.,8,12 April 2021,My one issue was in the casting. Lizzie Olsen makes sense because her character is a fish out of water but Jeremy Renner was a misstep; his role should have gone to a Native actor because now this otherwise great movie about a Native American community is centered around white characters.

Parts of it seemed really unrealistic to me, but that was just a gut feeling more than actually knowing for sure. This film also made me want to donate to predator protection programs in the US. There are other ways to work with predators vis-a-vis ranching, IMO. No need to vilify predators more than they already are.

It's a little dark, suspenseful and interesting right through the reveal at the end. The story, whilst nothing shocking in of itself, is realistic and believable. The reveal towards the end is satisfyingly on the money, and it tugs at the emotional strings to see very believable and well acted grief on the part of the family that suffered the loss.

345,Reznik_T,Why does every line of dialogue need to be a social commentary?,5,5 November 2017,"Sure, this movie has some stuff going for it. The scenery is beautiful, cinematography is fine, Jeremy Renner is a likable guy, Elizabeth Olsen is pretty, and the local cop/sheriff (played by Graham Greene) is a believable character who acts like an actual human being. Too bad he's the only one. Wind River - even more so than Hell or High Water (written by the same guy) - is filled with dialogue where people talk in metaphors, where there's always a deeper meaning to what they say, in other words, it doesn't sound like normal, everyday people talking to each other. If they only did that in certain key moments, it would be fine, it could work if that's what the story demands. But when that's all you hear throughout the whole film, it becomes pretentious and irritating. Also, I'm tired of the notion that certain movies feel the need to hit you over the head with their social commentary. When the young female FBI agent arrives, everybody is surprised, obviously because they don't think a woman is fit for the job (aka sexism). When they arrive at the home of the native American family, the father asks the FBI agent: ""Why is it that whenever you people want to help us, you always insult us first?"" (Because that's what white people always do, I guess.) When the Indian boy, who sells drugs, gets caught and confronted by Jeremy Renner, the conversation is about him fighting against the whole world, and how Jeremy Renner shouldn't say ""we"", because the only native American thing about him is his wife. And if that's not enough lecturing for you, then wait for Elizabeth Olsen thanking Jeremy Renner for saving her life, and Renner replying by saying, ""you're a tough woman, you saved your own life"". Obviously the problem is not the idea of ""strong women"", but the fact that instead of making it a natural part of the story and the characters, the director decides to shove it down our throats through such clumsy, heavy- handed dialogue.There's a shoot-out scene towards the end of the movie, that I thought, was written and executed pretty poorly. First of all, at one point I couldn't even tell who's on whose side, and who gets shot by who. It felt like they tried to recreate the amazing border shoot-out scene from Sicario (also written by the same guy), only this time in the snow. The problem is that we don't know anything about most of the people who are in this scene, as they were just introduced two minutes earlier, but all of a sudden we're supposed care whether they live or die. Anyway, if you're a huge Jeremy Renner or Elizabeth Olsen fan, you might as well go and check it out, but be prepared, it's not a very good one.",Wind River

348,wentos,"good acting, suspence and scenery",8,13 December 2020,"There are some problems with the movie and some controversy whether the main first dramatic point in the movie is even possible - it appears it is, in certain conditions which clearly occurred - you can indeed injure your lungs with a long intensive exercise in cold and dry conditions to the point they start to bleed.
So this is one thing. The other there are some problems with reasoning the visiting agent presented. This is not how it works. I also have problems with the fight scenes but I guess the long winter and substance abuse makes people do silly things.
Other than that a very well acted movie especially from main male character. For a woke times this is certainly not common. Of course overshadowed by villains but still very well done. As for woke - it does not hit you in the head till the very last moments when the stats appear. The main female character is overdoing things - I would not expect such flood of emotions from an agent but maybe I am too atistic a male to know better. It was not too much in my view, I could live with it.
I enjoy the movie even if I do not like thrillers. Maybe it is so because it was well made one or maybe because of the scenery I did not consider it to be one. I did not regret the time spent.
So cut 2 stars for the small mistakes and inconsistencies here and there but gave solid 8 for very good acting, very good scenery and almost as good story.

I would go as far as to say I left with frost bite of the soul. I have heard it said from critics that the desolate portrayal of this story was perhaps daring and effective but as an audience member I felt stretched to my limits without moments of relief. The beautiful wide shots of snowy Wyoming where reminding me that I'd rather be watching an arctic episode of Planet Earth, at least our David Attenborough actually enunciates. One big issue I found with this film was that I couldn't understand what the characters where saying! The audio quality just wasn't sharp enough but even when I was understanding I found the conversations about grief too over-laboured. I think in order to establish real poignancy in these more emotional scenes there needs to be some light and shade in the films presentation. I think if the film had established some contrasting scenes with moments of comedy or warmth then I would have felt more emotionally invested in the film during the tragic moments.

The crime story is poorly developed where there is a clash of cultures who don't understand each other and as usual under the lines the Indians are the loosing part because in contrast to the whites they are emotional, erratic, vicious and full of strange believes. And even though there are a lot of potential criminals, the one that did it, you guessed right, it's the Indian! And women are portrayed also in a bad light, the female FBI investigator is naive, slow and clumsy, the two other ladies in the film are completely hopeless, both are self- destructive and the third just disappears from the film in an apparent accidental way. The hunter and hero of the film, kills wolves which obviously must be very old because instead of chasing wild animals as it's natural, they chase lams eating snow.

Instead, the movie was doubling down about how poor the victim girl was.I know this is a propaganda piece about the injustice to Native American, but C'mon, they were good cops dying in the line of duty and no gratitudes for them?

Make no mistake: this is a dark film that deals with very haunting subject matter, so there is quite a bit of weight to it, but Sheridan treats this story with the highest level of respect by allowing his very well written script to drive it while still shooting it beautifully. To see such beautiful landscaping (actually shot in Utah) take my breath away while still understanding the danger of what the elements bring from the wildlife to the weather and even the inhabitants add a great layer to the story, but what takes it to the next level is the score from Nick Cave and Warren Ellis (not THAT Warren Ellis) that frames each and every scene perfectly without giving what is coming up ahead.From a performance standpoint, I really dug the way that both Renner and Olsen dialed it WAY back within their characters with Renner keeping Lambert simple and focused on the task at hand and Olsen showing how Banner is just trying to do the right thing while attempting to understand the situation she in AND asserting the authority she has representing the Bureau. Greene gives great balance and levity to their dynamic while keeping his character involved as a reminder of the heightened sensitivity of their situation.The Weinsteins' eye for film strikes again here, and I am also looking forward to where Sheridan's career behind the camera goes as well. For this being the second time he has helmed a film, this is incredibly impressive and should at least be on your ""need to check out"" list if not all the way to ""must see"".",Wind River
367,florian_florica,"At the same time, a sad and wonderful world and story, this film by Taylor Sheridan",10,21 October 2017,"This film comes with something that it seemed to me that it got lost in the last years of all these American films.First of all, I was impressed to see all of those landscapes and shooting angles that the filming crew used, with a quiet and soft soundtrack on the background. Combined with the characters' short lines and the story-line that is very thrilling, it is a recipe for perfection, in my opinion, at least.I am now completely confident that Jeremy Renner is an actor to be remembered in the years to come for his role in this one. His character is the movie hero we all need to see in this kind of films.Honestly, the plot twist, which presents at the end what really happened in the first place, made me to decide it is a 10, not a 9.

Aggressions, rapes, revenge, violence and an ending that is always happy and puts things in their rightful place. In the case of this film, the novelty is in the serious reflections on the dramatic loss of loved people and how to continue living in a balanced state of mind, the perseverance that overcomes the inexperience of woman official sent by the FBI and the bravery and determination of the protagonist.

The story has a predictable outcome that I could see coming from the beginning. The writer did nothing to try and even lead us in a different direction. In the first ten minutes the vicitims family leads us to a boyfriend no ones ever met. Obviously they're going to try and find him, once they do we're hand delivered the entire story. There was no work for the audience to do and zero surprise. I kind of like being lead down a few different paths that can be misleading before letting us know what really happened and who the killer is. I found the characters to be predictable from The tracker/hunter male that's good at everything And always figures it out before the young female law enforcement character that's in over her head. Throw in the local cop that's a bit slow and blasé about his job. It's been done a 100 + times and I think it's been done better. I'm actually starting to wonder whose reviewing movies. I'm sorry but 8/10 on IMDb when there's many many more movies that score 6/10 that have better story, writing and acting. Was this movie awful?

375,mistramicizia,"""This is the land of you're on your own...""",10,29 June 2018,"One of my 2017 favorites and probably one of the most underrated movies that year. Our generations should never get tired of stories like these, where the truth is being exposed through brilliant storytelling without euphemisms or implications. Wind River definitely shows the dark side of life in the U.S.A. where the circumstances under which natives live seem to be rather aggravating and don't seem to be having promising outcomes, which is quite surely very bitter and something to think about. This movie also has elements of action, but it is not an average action thriller, but something much more. Consisting of memorable quotes and scenes, Wind River is worth watching every second. I was actually surprised this didn't receive any Oscar or at least Golden Globe nominations, which it definitely should have, because it is a realistic story showing how things are, without polishing. If you are into fast-paced films that have a good story, this is the right thing. However, anyone should give this movie a try, or at least, anyone who is unaware of situations like these in the United States, but also anywhere else.DISCLAIMER : Everything stated in this review is entirely matter of personal opinion and doesn't have to coincide with the opinions of other reviewers.",Wind River
376,stevenclayalcander,"Evil doesn't exist, people just created them !",7,1 October 2017,"I'm really satisfied after watching this movie, this thriller crime movie is really impressed me. The movie scene starts with the woman running barefoot on icy ground and she seems terrified & chased by someone. Then she fell and the scene change to Jeremy Renner who is hunting the wolf. Jeremy Renner plays as a hunter who has some dark past tragedy, and Elizabeth Olsen as newbie FBI agent. They come across because the murder investigation on that woman in the first scene. The storytelling is so mysterious, and we cant predict of the murderer. Taylor Sheridan just really great with his work and he just did it again. Many people are connected or involved each other and it seems anybody can be a suspect. At some point, this movie tells you people have some good and bad side. They have both sides and sometimes people can change one to another side because of the tragedy or just a circumstances. It seems like evil itself doesn't exist, evil exist because of people created them. And another good point is this movie gives you many great scenery and amazing panorama. It reminds me of The Revenant movies with extra thriller experience. However, i just feel a little bored with the first 15 minutes because it has so many daily conversation that is pointless and not really important. I understand at some point this is needed with good storytelling and systemathic, but in my opinion it just too much.

He a natch in this role so much that it elevated my respect for his acting, and that's after a hats-off to him in Hurt Locker. He's underrated.There was more genuine, believable acting on everyone's part than there was anything that you could criticize as cliche or formulaic. Elizabeth Olsen's role as a naive, almost bumbling FBI agent was a nice touch to the serious tone of the movie. Some important archetypal plot nuances kept me very captivated as the story unfolded.

Although it (just) passed the Bechdel test there was a needless shot of bare flesh as titillation yet the background story is supposedly focused on the injustice towards native american women. Indeed it states this misleadingly in the ending credits whereas the film is actually told from the point of view of the hunter played by Jeremy Renner. 
Also it seemed that the FBI agent, played by Elizabeth Olsen, was inserted as the female interest in much the same way that the director used Emily Blunt in Sicario. 
So even though we felt the film misrepresented itself, the central story was still very interesting and compelling to watch.",Wind River

384,edinadental,Another big hit for Taylor Sheridan,9,31 December 2017,"U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service agent Cory Lambert (Jeremy Renner) discovers the dead body of a young female on the Wind River Indian Reservation in Wyoming. The victim is barefoot and dressed in light clothing that would not provide adequate protection from the extreme cold weather. The question: What happened? Why would a young female with no shoes or socks, and very light clothing be 5 miles from any shelter?Rookie FBI special agent Jane Banner (Elizabeth Olsen) is nearby attending a conference, and she is reassigned to the case. Agent Banner is wholly unprepared, having only dress clothing and no cold weather gear, and little training outside her usual urban assignments. She is realistic and knows that the investigation is significantly compromised by her inexperience in a rural area and hostile weather, a community composed of uncooperative citizens, and Federal regulations limiting jurisdiction. Jane enlists Cory to aid in her investigation of which she believes is a homicide. The two enter a partnership to solve the mystery. The duo's search is hampered by family and race relationships as they enter dangerous territory.Taylor Sheridan is having a great run as an actor (many roles where he is always exceptional), a successful screenplay writer (Sicario, Hell or High Water, and Wind River), and a director (Wind River). Wind River is his best work to date. He is the movie's writer and the director, and is exceptional in both roles.",Wind River

387,Lolly12,Good performances,7,6 December 2018,"Jeremy Renner is very good in this movie, I think the role suited him well. The dialogue was very exposition laden which is a big no-no for me regardless of what style of movie it is.The problem for me was, and I like slow burners, is that it seemed to be finished before it actually started. So at the end, it felt fairly unsatisfying and I also found the thing at the end that Renner does quite unbelievable. Olsen in her own way was unbelievable but she did what she could with a very much underwritten role. It could have done without showing so graphicallly the violent sex scene. I mean, really? There are few female roles in this and one of them has to enact that. But I did enjoy it, found the cinemtography lovely and the supporting roles were well cast. And for a US movie it was trying to do more than the average flick which is a plus, even if it felt quite clunky in parts.",Wind River
388,erinkay641,Snowy Suspense,9,5 September 2017,"I thoroughly enjoyed this film for the most part. It takes place on the Wind River Reservation in Wyoming. The movie opens by introducing us to Cory's (Jeremy Renner) profession as a hunter/tracker and his somewhat fractured home life. It isn't too long until he discovers the body of a teenage girl out in the snow. The harsh, vast, snowy wilderness perfectly conveys the eerie and menacing undertones of the tragic death (homicide) of the young woman, who happened to be best friends with Cory's daughter, who also died under mysterious circumstances a few years prior. He is understandably driven to find the perpetrators and exact justice seeing as he never received answers about his daughter. Jane Banner (Elizabeth Olsen), an FBI agent clearly unprepared for the cold and unfamiliar with the Native way of life, shows up to help investigate the case. Throughout the investigation, the movie portrays the many problems Native Americans face without being disrespectful to their culture or portraying them as one dimensional stereotypes. The movie delves into alcoholism and addiction, poverty, and violence on reservations - all topics that need far more attention than they receive. The good: The acting is fantastic. None of it seems disingenuous or over the top, a trap many action movies fall into. The characters are believable and you really find yourself swept up in the story as it unfolds and rooting for justice for young Natalie (the homicide victim). The cinematography is flawless. Nature can be as dangerous as it is beautiful, and this film embraces that concept to add to the tone of the movie. You are edge of your seat for most of the film because it has good pacing and doesn't give things away too early or treat the audience like a child and explain every tiny aspect outright. It isn't riddled with flashbacks, which makes the one or two it does feature far more effective. The ending is supremely satisfying.The bad: My main problem with this movie is the rape scene. It's not just this movie, it's an epidemic. There is no need to film a brutal rape scene for rape to be a part of the plot. I'm pretty sure everyone understands the concept of rape and it doesn't need to be shown on screen for the audience to understand how horrific it is. I really wish directors would move past this fixation because it doesn't really add anything to the impact the film has and is almost always shown just to emphasize how deranged/powerful/sadistic a character is (which can be shown in so many other ways). That being said, my only other issue with this movie is that they treat Jane as though she is clueless, but she is a very intelligent and dedicated agent. Yes, she is not well versed on tribal issues and she flew in from Vegas so she wasn't dressed for snow, but the constant undertone of ""well that's not how we do it here"" gets a little obnoxious.Overall, this is a powerful film and tells a very important story. The visceral emotion and the strong storyline in this film really leaves a deep impact on the viewer.",Wind River

Background noise being brought to the foreground seems to be a trend in the last few years, but nearly all of the 2018 movies that my wife and I have seen suffer this malady.
Wind River takes place in snowy mountain wilderness where the silence is broken only by things like the far away cry of an eagle, but in this movie we are constantly bombarded with what sounds like busy traffic on a gravel road. And for the record, you never hear thunder in a snowstorm! Added to that is a constant attempt at eerie music consisting of high and low tones generated by a synthesizer, with the occasional banging on a piano. Trying to hear an actor speaking behind all this is all but impossible, especially since so many of today's actors are required to speak in whispering tones with voices that don't carry well. Wind River's bedroom scene was the first and only one where the background noise ceased, and what a relief it was. The rest of the time, we were straining to hear everyone except the female FBI agent. Other than the soundtrack, the story was suspenseful and beautifully filmed.",Wind River
393,imdb-21226,Mostly good. It has some big flaws.,6,3 November 2017,This movie should have been great.. It had potential to really be a great film. The Jeremy Renner character was great.. He really pulled it off nicely.. The Elizabeth Olsen character wasn't nearly as believable.. but OK. I don't see how it got the high marks it did. But I only have one opinion. There were some really stupid executions in the story telling.. I rolled my eyes a few times at some of the scenes.. Ridiculous stuff. And then there was the lazy film-making style of going hand-held with the camera. There are scenes in this film that are almost unwatchable because of the hand-held camera jitter. I understand at times it adds to excitement - ala the street scenes of The French Connection.. But this film wasn't using hand-held to add to action. Clearly most of the hand-held was done to make the film easier to make. There were even jittery hand-held scenes of two people having a conversation in a living room.. Un-necessary and really takes away from the film. I am glad I only paid a couple of bucks to see the movie.. if I had paid full price I probably would not have felt like it was worth it..,Wind River

410,BigZ_7337,A Superb Directorial Debut from Sheridan,10,29 August 2017,"I had high expectations for Wind River, and when it finally hit a theater near me, it exceeded those expectations. To be upfront, Wind River is not an easy watch, as it's dealing with heavy dark subject matter, and it's delivered in a brutal realistic way. There's a strong chance that you will leave the theater more depressed than you entered it. However, the film is absolutely worth the potential emotional drain, as it is a superbly crafted film. The movie opens with a young Native American woman running away from something in her bare feet in the snowy Wyoming wilderness. Then after introducing the main character Jeremy Renner, a hunter/wildlife official, he finds the dead woman in the snow while searching for mountain lions that killed some livestock. At this point the investigation begins, and Elizabeth Olsen as a fish out of water FBI agent comes to solve the murder with Renner's help.For most of Wind River, it is a slow burn dramatic mystery thriller, but as the the investigation moves forward, there are moments of incredible tension that eventually burst into realistic violence. These moments are filmed very differently from action films, but they are very satisfying and brutal. The director uses a lot of interesting tactics to build the tension leading up to these moments, and it really gets your heart beating as the viewer. One of the most surprising and effective is in the middle of an already tense scene, where the film flashes back to show exactly what happened the night of the girl's death.The acting from everyone in Wind River is excellent, and the film is filled with small powerful moments between two characters. Jeremy Renner is the standout performance, where he's playing a character with a deeply ingrained tragic past. His moments with Elizabeth Olsen and especially with his good friend and father of the raped/murdered girl, Gil Birmingham, are packed with emotion. The dialogue in these scenes is outstanding and heart breaking. I really think that this film deserves multiple nominations when the award season comes along, particularly for Best Actor (Renner), Best Supporting Actor (Birmingham) and Best Director/Original Screenplay (Sheridan).I'd highly recommend this film, it's one of my favorite movies of 2017, and definitely the most powerful film I've seen since Arrival.

411,the_blueeyes,Slow and cold with amazing performances.,9,26 September 2019,"This movie took me quite by surprise. On paper the story seems thin, but it will surprise you how things turn out in this film.
We have seen Jeremy Renner does great performances before, but here he is absolutely fantastic playing a wise but broken and still standing hunter who teams up with a young fresh-out-of-training FBI Agent (Olsen), to nest up and solve a murder of a young girl. Olsen also gives a highly convincing portrayal of a city-girl lost in the cold woods of the Wyoming mountains, and both Renner and Olson shows a sparkling chemistry together. Olsen being curious, Renner with a torn past. It works so well.
Writing is brilliant and directing by Sheridan is also rock solid. This movie was quite a hidden gem with little publicity around it and should be one of those you should see someday.",Wind River
412,BobNoOneHundred,Wiseass,5,1 June 2018,"There can be a thin line between being wise and being a wiseass. People who have a rule of thumb for every situation in life and who like to share it, in every situation in life, are wiseasses, and having one of those as the main character in a movie makes it a little anoying to watch",Wind River
413,LilyWai,"Brilliant crime mystery, showing man at his best...and worst",8,16 July 2018,"Understated and engaging film that centers on a skilled game tracker Cory (brilliantly played by Jeremy Renner), the Wyoming Native American reserve he and his extended family call home and his role in helping solve a crime. When a young, talented but somewhat insensitive FBI agent Jane Banner (Elizabeth Olsen) is called in to help run a murder investigation it becomes clear she is not going to be able to do it alone. Teaming up with the local police and utilising Cory's knowledge of tracking in the remote and unforgiving environment becomes her only option in finding how a young Native American girl ended up dead in the snow.
Renner really knocks it out of the park on this one, his portrayal of a father dealing with the aftermath of his own loss while assiting on an investigation that sits a little too close to home is a standout. He shows that strong performances can come from an intensity that simmers below the surface and his understated performance fits nicely when teamed with Olsen's at times pushy character. Layered within this starring duo are the Native American families, the ongoing issues they face as a community and as victims of this horrible crime.
The cinematography is breathtaking, the performances to a high standard and the plot keeps you engaged right up to the final scenes. Taylor Sheridan is clearly a writer and director with an exciting future ahead, I for one will be keeping an eye out for his future projects on the back of seeing Wind River.",Wind River

415,Supes909,Excellent crime thriller,10,15 December 2017,"There are times when A listers simply want to go and do something that is away from their mega blockbusters. Like ""Come hell or high water"" Wind River provides that vehicle for Jeremy Renner and Elizabeth Olsen of the Avengers fame to do just that.The movie is set in a bleak (although scenery wise beautiful to look at) and somewhat depressing part of America where hope and opportunities have long departed leaving only hardened survivors. It is an excellent crime thriller that starts with a victim and then winds its way to the perps. There is no great mystery to it and the characters are not overly complex and fit into story line seamlessly. Both Renner and Olsen bring their 'A' list game to this movie to compliment an excellent supporting cast.Thoroughly enjoyed the movie that has a Tarantino touch to it towards the end.",Wind River

422,akinchris84,Would have been better if....,4,9 November 2017,"... they didn't portray Lander/Wind River so poorly.I used to live out on the Wind River Res, I was out in Lander for a few years. The place is not a frozen tundra that is as desolate as Siberia...For the love of God, there is a casino there. I know, I lived less than an acre away from it. Lander is a town of 6,500+ people and growing, 30 minutes away you have Riverton, even larger than Lander. There are places people hang out all day and night regardless of the -20 degree temps outside. (My mom came to visit once and it was -27 and she was in shock because someone was walking into Safeway wearing slippers and a robe) Yes, the town is big enough for a safeway and in riverton you have a walmart.So when the guy at the end was saying ""There aren't any women here!"" I about lost it. Yes, Wind River has a high murder rate, yes there is a high drop out rate in schools, yes people get sexually assaulted there. But if you are going to make a movie about what happens out there, let's be realistic, people bail on school, refuse to work, and there is a higher than average murder rate because so many people receive per- cap and know they don't have to do anything with the rest of their lives but sit around and drink until their next monthly check comes in.This movie would have been better as a stand alone, not trying to poorly portray what Lander really is like.",Wind River

424,Icarus_prime,A terrifically cool Jeremy Renner performance makes this a riveting humane crime drama,7,13 November 2017,Jeremy Renner in this movie plays a role similar of Morgan Freeman in Se7en; both have a apathetic sense of understanding of what and where they inhabit that is unpleasant and undesirable.There are a few human interaction scenes throughout the movie with his character that illustrate this with some excellent dialogue alongside a isolated snowy backdrop. The latter makes this feeling more apparent thanks to its striking cinematography and the movie rewards viewers to look at the movie through this lense. The world-building and atmosphere are almost the main characters itself.I personally felt the actual crime and mystery was less than compelling and hits all the similar plot beats for its genre that you see in most other movies.,Wind River

All the actors were more than perfect all the cast even the police chief who didn't have so many scenes in the movie but his performance was excellent and really felt so real All the places and the movie events were so real , the fact that the place was very cold and far away from everything and that the police station is small and have a few police force , the ambulance takes time to reach , .. etc everything felt so real the environment was so beautiful with these snow covering every where of the village with all these beautiful trees , I felt the beauty of the nature there that I wanted to go visit this place in real and do some Skiing there everything about the movie was perfect including the final scene , the way they took revenge was really good and enough The music was perfect and makes you feel every minute of the movie and added a lot to the enjoyment while watching the movieIt's a story that highlights the violence against women everywhere and how people should react towards all those criminals who use their power to rape or insult women any where These criminals everywhere should get always the maximum punishment , should be an example to every one else eventually , if you're looking for good drama , good story full of emotions definitely I encourage you to watch the movie I expect that this should be nominated for quite good number of awards in this year Oscar",Wind River

we tried here but there weren't any
Cons:
Plot holes you could drive a semi into
character development non-existent
anti women 
ridiculous dialogue that stops any story telling rather than furthers it
demeaning female characters that cry for help and do stupid things that get them hurt, raped or killed and it's hard to feel pity when you are acting like an absolute idiot without the common sense of a squirrel
Lead male role tries to force nuggets of wisdom, that sound like he's quoting from the inside of a snapple cap
FBI does not know the first thing about law enforcement or the law itself.
Lead female role spent all her money training to be an FBI agent, graduating from Quantico and could be out performed by a strip mall rent a cop.
So to recap: characters are ridiculous, plot is without merit, dialogue is tedious and monosyllabic, and the only question remaining is why?? Why? why? why? and how do I get the two hours of my life back???",Wind River

how can she's there, in the middle of nowhere, far away from her home?Sheridan did it again!!
Good writing, good directing, excellent thriller.
although the movie circled around solving a mystery case, Wind River is not a conventional mystery when it gives more attention to the victims and the beloved figure left behind. Sheridan does not let the script overload in thrill portions. smart dialogues, clear motivation from each main characters, to the precision how he leads the audience to a questionnaire scene and the answering moment. all without putting any exaggerations things in it.

I find it difficult to describe this film except,as my husband said (with a catch in his throat) ""it's as though you're watching real what is actually happening"". It is a thriller but so much more than that. It presents you with the reality of life on a Native American reservation - there is a comic/tragic moment near the end where the victim's father (a Native American) is painted in a 'death face' which is like a bad football fan's face painting and he says there is no one left to show him how to do it. But is also about loss, hardship, strength, survival and more. I can't possibly do it justice but it's association with Harvey Weinstein must be the only reason it was snubbed by the oscars in 2018 because otherwise it would have cleaned up!",Wind River

The movie ended up coming in second at the festival, right behind behind The Big Sick.I enjoyed it as much as, if not more than, Hell or High Water. Definitely more than Sicario.The scenery, the score, the dialogue and the acting were all on point. Some of Jeremy Renner's best work.

443,adnarish,Not as clever as it thinks it is.,6,3 May 2018,"Taylor Sheridan writes and directs a visually appealing, but fairly mundane story that doesn't transcend the basic premise of the plot. Sheridan uses his experiences of working with director Denis Villeneuve (Sicario) to good effect, albeit it without quite matching the latter's work, and the acting is solid across the board, but the subtleties and conflicting motivations bubbling beneath the surface, present in Sheridan's earlier work, are largely missing. Some more details, and spoilers, below.The film ends with a sombre note that no missing person records are kept for people living on Indian reservations. After spending what little time we had with the public officials of said areas being focussed on disputes about authority and their rights to be, or not be, somewhere - this kind of absolutist statements feels like it's missing a lot of context. Who isn't keeping records, the FBI? The local police? Can't they? Won't they? There's a lot missing here, and this goes back to the rest of the film: it's not as profound and clever as it - seemingly - thinks it is.At the moment main character Cory Lambert (Jeremy Renner) finds the body of Natalie (Kelsey Asbille) that sets off the chain of events that is the film's plot, he is seen in his job as a hunter. He is portrayed as such, says he is, and again emphasises he is later - and his quips are all about hunting, too. It is also quickly revealed that his own daughter was lost in the wilds and found killed, and that he still suffers from this - almost to the exclusion of other motivations. Are we as an audience supposed to have any doubt as to what this man's motivations are going into this story?Renner does a fine job portraying Lambert as he is written, that's not the issue. But I'm struggling to find out what Sheridan wanted his audiences to feel. Are we supposed to cheer on his subsequent killing(s)? Are we supposed to feel as though Lambert is crossing some sort of line? And what line would that be, when the other characters in the story - from Natalie's father to FBI agent Banner - are all cheering him on to do what he ultimately ends up doing; making what is by then the only surviving man who assaulted Natalie suffer the same fate she did.Speaking of which, when the police goes to confront the security workers at a drill site any remaining subtleties go flying out the window when the security engages in a wild shoot-out with police and FBI. Eh... why? What did they think was going to happen, that nobody was going to check on the place where they had just lost half a dozen law enforcement colleagues - and that they were going to get away with their crimes? Not likely! Sheridan then doubles down by introducing a lengthy flashback scene of the moment when Natalie and her boyfriend were attacked by said workers. The point of this is unclear. There is no need to know Natalie wanted to move to California with her boyfriend to appreciate that the assault was horrific, and her death a tragedy.Furthermore, it further reduces the villains to caricatures. Fitting, for it allows Lambert to see them as stand-ins for the men- never outright stated, but hinted at - who were probably responsible for his own daughter's death, too. Contrast this to Sang-il Lee's Akunin ('Villain'), where the young man who kills a young woman ends up becoming the main character of the story. I get that Sheridan wasn't going for that, but he went way over to the other side, robbing us viewers of any ambiguity about what was the right thing for the protagonists to do. Moreover, it makes the confrontation with the villains one of self-defence, except for that last guy, and not a case of - perhaps questionable - revenge.Quick note on the other actors: Julia Jones is fine as Lambert's ex-wife Wilma, Kelsey Asbille did a good job as Natalie with the little screen time she had in what can't have been easy scenes to film, Graham Greene makes for a very believable local police officer, Gil Birmingham and his character Martin go a long way towards making the setting in the Indian reservation meaningful (why wasn't the Lambert character part of the local police?!), and ... oh, Elizabeth Olsen as FBI agent Jane Banner! I like Olsen, she makes the 'big city FBI agent' work, but I am just unclear as to what her purpose in this story is. She is of no help in the investigations, she can't actually be there because of jurisdiction issues - until she somehow can, she is attacked twice, rescued twice, and she in no way limits Lambert's all-too-obvious quest but instead encourages him to go his own way. Sheridan perhaps didn't want to retrace the steps he took in Sicario, where he also presented a female FBI agent as a moral compass of sorts (Emily Blunt) - but I'm sure he could have done better here.Ultimately then, a decent film - but it takes more to make it great than adding landscape shots of Wyoming and a few run-down trailers of people named Littlefeather.",Wind River

447,jessicacgill,Poor dialogue constrained great actors and beautiful cinematography,5,1 December 2017,"This film really tries hard to give you the feels but truly terrible dialogue gives its talented cast nowhere to go in most of the scenes. Even an actor as fine as Jeremy Renner gets bogged down trying to wade through this insufferable writing, having to resort to an excessive amount of jaw clenching and grizzled, yet wistful, staring at the horizon. It's OK Jeremy! We know it's not your fault, it's not possible to really drop into a scene when your line sounds like something out of a soap opera. Then for good measure on the festival circuit they had to throw in a super realistic rape scene (always prize-worthy!). Whoa! Never seen that before! Except for like every ""lost up its own ass"" indie crime movie ever. On the plus side, the portrayal of modern life on a Native reservation was vaguely interesting. I have no idea if it was accurate or fair, but from the outside looking in the characters felt credible, as did the portrayal of the reservation itself. The film is also beautifully located and shot. It's too bad the dialogue and plot were so predictable and silly. Whilst watching this film you'll constantly have the feeling that they might throw in a wendingo, or a shot of a hawk flying while a flute made of reeds plays. Luckily there's no wendingo (spoiler alert! no wendingo!) but the awkward dialogue found many other opportunities to turn what could have been a great little movie into a totally corny rape romp through Alaska, but oh wait it's not Alaska it's Wyoming.

456,thefilmnotebook,"A deeply disturbing, solid thriller",8,30 October 2017,"Having written brilliant scripts for Sicario and Hell or High Water, Taylor Sheridan tries his hand at directing with Wind River, of which he also wrote. It is clear now that Sheridan has a unique talent for creating harsh and isolating landscapes (both somatically and mentally), and for writing engaging narratives based on such settings. Wind River is the setting for the film's story. An American Indian Reservation in Wyoing, this is where wildlife hunter officer Cory Lambert (Jeremy Renner) discovers the body of a young Native American woman Natalie Hanson (Kelsey Asbille). She is found barefoot and hardly with any warm winter clothes on. Upon much examination, Cory deduces that she died as a result of a condition called pulmonary haemorrhage. In less scientific terms, that is bleeding from the lungs, caused here by breathing in too much cold air too soon. Cory is joined by young FBI agent Jane Banner (Elizabeth Olsen), who is sent to Wind River to investigate Natalie's death. She is ill- equipped and clueless about surviving the harsh conditions of Wind River but she is determined to solve the crime. Cory and Jane make an effective team together, as both can relate to Natalie's death in their own way. Cory lost his daughter a few years ago and her body was also discovered in the snow. Jane is perceived as young and vulnerable, much like Natalie. They found a clue that Natalie's boyfriend Matt (Jon Bernthal), who works as a security guard at an oil drilling site may have some information. The film is effective at slowly building up curiosity and Sheridan finds the impeccable balance between character development and storytelling. For most of the film, it carries a pervasive sinister tranquility, which is later interrupted by sudden outbursts of violence. Despite the uncensored brutality of the violence, for us, the chilling factor lies in the profound psychological impact. As we found out what happened to Natalie through a cleverly placed flashback, it is absolutely terrifying. Having been introduced and acquainted to the unforgiving nature of the winter landscape, we wonder what could push Natalie so far that she would flee outside, barefoot. Although it is anticipated something dreadful is going to happen, I still couldn't help but feeling sick to the stomach. Wind River is portrayed as a land with vast open spaces. Normally, this would usually signify freedom and free will, but we feel trapped and very claustrophobic. Sheridan also adds another emotional layer where he deals with themes of loss and despair. It doesn't feel entirely hopeless, as he injects some degree of warmth and sensitivity into the story. Natalie's father Martin (Gil Birmingham) is a friend of Cory's, and together they navigate through the tremendous grief of losing their daughters. Both men have been hardened by the external environment they reside in, but within, they are gentle and deeply lost. They are men who are not afraid to express their grief, and are desperately trying to scavenge enough hope to live through the next day. What I realised in this film is that everything that happens is consequential. The unrelentingly cruel environment imposes disturbing effects on the human psyche, which in turn transforms man into unleashing terror. Tragedy strikes, and the overwhelming grief then leads man into unpredictable acts. Who here is the true evil? Is it the scathing coldness of the landscape around us or does it merely reflect our true nature? The film doesn't really answer these questions, but it is definitely some food for thought.",Wind River

459,dihelson,Filmed by a drunk cameraman,3,9 December 2017,"On the last 5 years, we have been invaded by a class of movies filmed by drunk cameraman, or better saying, using kind of a shaking camera, just when engineers took a century to discover how to really stabilize images the right way ( Steadycam ). It's a pity that a good story like this was shot like amateurs cameramen, which makes you sick as if you were on a boat. They make this error on purpose, to give more ""emotion"", but it's a mistake. Even if you ask to a child hold a camera, it can't be so damn bad like that. Now I believe that EVERYONE can make a movie at home, even if doesn't know how to hold a camera !The movie is slow as hell. Fortunately, I had much time to spend on it, and it's very coherent, decent story, very depressive sometimes...the actors are outstanding, the photography is incredible ( would be perfect without the shaking ). Good angles, planes, scenes...action scenes are amazing, and this main actor is really perfect for the role.So, it's not a bad movie, nor outstanding...it's in the mid point. If you have nothing better to watch, and have a good time to spend on a thriller, watch it. Otherwise, if you don't like snow on almost all scenes, cold, you'd better pick something else to watch.",Wind River

461,GideonPope,"Did not like this movie at all - slow, predictable, and unlikely",3,7 September 2017,"3 is as generous as I can get on this review.I think most people, like me, wanted to like this movie because it involves A) violence against women, and B) a depiction of Native American hardship. By liking the movie, you indirectly show your support for the causes, as it were.The movie was just not good. It started well enough, and I was not dissuaded by the slow pace.Wheels fell off when - SPOILERS AFTER HERE - Jane shoots the young man in the trailer. Totally unnecessary scene, and totally unrealistic. Ask yourself this - what are the odds that a cop investigating a murder ends up in a trailer with a guy who has done nothing wrong, but yet opens fire on the cop and ends up getting shot? How about close to zero? So now with the wheels off a fire breaks out to burn the remaining structure down when there is a Mexican stand off (no slight intended - I don't believe that's pejorative) among 10 different people - Jane, the Tribal cop, two Star-Trek-Orange-Suit guys they bring along, and 5 or 6 of the drilling crew guys, all of whom are armed to the teeth. Everybody's got a gun drawn, and everybody's yelling to calm down and back off. Finally, Jane, in a terrible alpha dog voice, claims rank with her FBI status and tells everybody to put weapons away. But then a guy with what appears to be an auto open fire from inside where the guy who actually raped the girl is, and all hell breaks loose, with bullets flying everywhere, Star-Trek guys and Tribal cop get killed, but Jane survives, aided by Hurt Locker/Hawkeye, who then exacts your desired blood lust revenge by making bad guy run in snow until he dies, which ends up being a hundred feet and well short of the dead girl's six mile run in the snow, which, I think, is supposed to show us how tough she was? Ug. Awful, awful stuff. Had a chance to be very good, then made the critical mistake of going to what they probably believed were tried-and-true tropes, which did not fit the story at all.Also, a bunch of guys beating their friend to death because he wouldn't let them molest his girl seems very far fetched.Just not good.EDITED TO ADD - sound track may have been the worst sound track I've every experienced as a movie goer.

468,ian_calders,Film ruined by poor rediculous ending,3,29 January 2018,"The first 3/4 of this film were really quite good (sure there was a few moments of eye rolling social commentary but nothing too bad). The dynamic of the of the out of town FBI agent and the local Hunter worked particularly well, the setting was also spectacular and set the scene for an interesting and unusual crime mystery.
Note: major spoilers ahead. Unfortunately all this setup was ruined by a rediculous final chapter. The film seems to want to be taken seriously but then turns into a comic book western at the end. In a turn of events that surprises precisely nobody the villains of the film turn out to be crass working class straight white men... who are so unable to control their lust that they beat their colleague to death and gang rape his girlfriend. Is this what the writer really thinks men are like! If that wasn't bad enough enough they are then prepared to have a shot out with law enforcement, when they arrive, as if they could get away with their crimes if they kill a load of police!!!! What makes all this more intellectually insulting is that at the beginning of the film we have a the line suggesting this is based on real events. However, none of the events depicted happened and this claim seems to be based purely on the fact that an unknown number of native American women go missing every year. The writers conclusion is that they must be getting raped and murdered by white men... rather than something less likely such as they have run away!!!",Wind River
469,zoricaristevska,Native Americans victims of administrative knot,9,8 April 2018,"Sheridan is a great filmmaker. He just feels so personal to me, and has this quiet way of storytelling, leaving subtle clues to the viewers. As with the other films of his, this one is accompanied with picturesque scenery which paints the mood faithfully. The cold weather resembles the movie's atmosphere and the characters, with exception of the FBI agent played by one of the Olsen twins, (which I must admit surprises positively here), are all down to Earth people, very natural and carry themselves with great authenticity.
To be honest, the plot line is excellent, but the way it is given, does it for me. Because there are other much more dynamic narratives, but all in all, worse interpreted. 
The most thought provoking thing to take with me after the ending, is the really absurd law system that applies to the Native Americans reservations, that is, which considers crimes done or involving non-Natives. Look it up, it is really absurd, as it doesn't make any sense and really affects Native Americans'lives. 
What makes a movie great, it's not just the acting, the story etc., and is what Sheridan's films have all in common, is that as well with Sicario and Hell or High Water, Wind River is very much based on actual events, but most of all, it gives the viewer something to think about, long after the movie has ended. The stories are real, they are not happening in the distant future, they are here, now, affecting somebody.",Wind River
470,mdmvrockford,Great slow burning drama-mystery,8,6 January 2018,"Overall a great movie. If you liked ""Sicario"" and ""Hell or High Water"" then you will likely enjoy this drama-mystery. I certainly did. ""Wind River"" and these other two movies by same writer(Taylor Sheridan). There is a fair amount of violence (see CONS). PROS:
* Tight, good story with slow burn) 
* By far, Jeremy Renner's acting in this movie. IMO by far his best acting role. Hopefully his Hawkeye (Clint Barton ) roles will afford him the income to do more movies like ""Wind River.""
* Elizabeth Olson (another Avengers alum) acting 
* Native American cast (e.g. Graham Greene and Gil Birmingham)
* Utah (though movie states Wyoming) winter environment is well represented showing it is is friend and foe at timesCONS:
* Is showing the rape at end of movie really necessary? Already established twice she was brutally raped (1st Elizabeth Olson's FBI character stating so upon finding body and 2nd the Medical Examiner describing victim). To me it was gratuitious much like showing Jodie Foster character's rape in ""The Accused.""
* Elizabeth Olson's FBI character does some real boneheaded decisions. E.g. Despite still very affected by pepper spray, she still enters drug-hole home to clear it. E.g. At end of movie she was being flanked by the workers but able to stand down. Then minutes later, she does not take proper precautions knocking on closed door (e.g. should have had on weapon and not stand directly in front of door). These boneheaded decisions given to her by the writer knocks off one star for me. 
* Needing better closure for death of Graham Greene's Ben sheriff character and the other police officers. There was no mention by Renner nor Olson's character of the death of at least three police officers. Just simple <10 second mention is all that is needed.",Wind River

472,shea765,Winding dribble,4,25 December 2017,"Writers don't necessarily make directors, which is never more obvious than this film. Sheridan produced a competent if ultimately unsatisfying script for Sicario, which led me to Wind River. But he's a fish out of water here at the helm of a novice effort that achieves little visually but to capture a few stills of the majestic Wyoming snow-scape.Poor casting choices are mitigated by Jeremy Renner's strong performance. Without his brooding backwoods character, along with Graham Greene as the token ""real"" Native American, the film would look like an episode of ""Survivor"" - a bunch of urbanites dropped into difficult country without a clue how to act. The movie doubles down on this casting strategy by choosing Elizabeth Olsen as the dumbfounded out-of-towner FBI agent (female, or course), whose emotions are meant to enhance the audience's own wonderment at this Wild West wilderness. Never mind that hardly any of the other characters in the film belong any more than Olsen or the audience.Sheridan wraps his movie in the cloak of advocacy for Native Americans. Yet, he simultaneously blames his Native American characters for most of their plight - the drug epidemic is the result of individual choice, the young men could have joined the army or gone to college, and so on. At a time when the American dialogue is more than ever trained on social vs. individual responsibility, Sheridan could have explored these issues in more depth if advocacy was really a goal.As for plot continuity, Sheridan's script produces and drops characters and story lines like so many snow flakes melting on impact: Cory's wife and son are forgotten after the opening act, and the action barely stops to acknowledge the sheriff's demise. The cause of Natalie's death, which the coroner stubbornly refuses to acknowledge as a homicide and is supposedly problematic for the FBI's investigative jurisdiction, thereafter never impacts the FBI's actual investigation. Cory's tracking ability, which serves law-enforcement as a potent investigative tactic in the first half of the film, is disregarded in favor of rather drawn-out and questionable violent scenes to conclude the movie. If this wasn't an ""indie"" film (whatever that means these days), I would suppose the studio heads demanded a rewrite to include typical Hollywood bloodshed.The only reason to watch ""Wind River"" is if you're a big fan of Jeremy Renner, who delivers a characteristically good performance. Without his dominating presence, you'd basically be watching a ""B"" movie.",Wind River

He took the crime thriller and added some weight to it by asking questions about the blurring of lines between right and wrong in the pursuit of justice.What first drew me to this movie were the stars, but when I found out who wrote it I knew I would try to see it. Now given the timing of its release, I expected it would be limited at best so I when saw it being shown at my local theater I jumped at the chance and I was not disappointed.Like in ""Sicario""--I didn't see ""Hell or High Water"", but it is on my watch list--this film takes the traditional crime thriller and puts some meat on its bones. The film is not so much a mystery as it is a meditation on how people deal with pain. Some rise to it, others don't, and in this film's setting that response goes a long way in determining whether you live to see the next day.With these three films--and this one being his directorial debut-- Mr. Sheridan has shown he is someone whose star is on the rise, and I look forward to his next project.

Here and there the dialogue is a little pat, and is obviously written to evoke a desired emotion from us, the viewers. There are other problems; for example, did I miss something, or was there really a reason for her to try to run through miles of bone-chilling cold? I mean, all those drunken dudes came crashing in on her and her boyfriend. Um, did they walk there? Took the bus? In other words, surely they would've left a couple of trucks or ATVs or something outside, and considering their hazy condition and the remote location, I'd bet big bucks the keys were in at least one vehicle... while they were involved inside couldn't she... well, you get it.

495,Eckleburg,It's cold here,8,24 March 2018,"Wind River is a visceral experience. The outer shell of the movie is that of a murder mystery set in the cold & desolate landscapes of Wyoming. The deeper implications turn a light on some of the harsh realities of native communities, the pain & grief of loss as well as taking a dark, sobering look at humanity. The setting here plays a vital role in conveying the message that the movie wants to push forward as well as providing a suiting environment for the tragedy that succumbs the reserve of Wind River. The mood is set right from the beginning with its vast, snow barren wildlands; there's certainly nowhere to run to as the opening scene makes so glaringly obvious. Jeremy Renner's role as Cory Lambert, the wildlife service agent of the area, commands a strong presence on screen. The supporting cast deserves a nod as well (particularly Gil Birmingham), but Renner is really the one that conjures the strong emotions that Sheridan wants to bring to the forefront of his work here. A great performance that is as convincing as it is moving. The murder mystery itself is thin with little build up albeit the end result being heart wrenching. Yet the aim of Wind River is not to keep viewers guessing on who might have done it. It's much more a story centered on loss & grief and the struggles of life on a reserve. In that respect, the movie succeeds quite well.",Wind River

Perfectly executed, poignant, very adult, amazing production, excellent acting (big line up of well known names... and... everyone in this carried off their role to award winning levels - sort of thing the Coen brothers were known for).

In Jeremy Renner's Cory Lambert we get the hint of an answer. A tough cowboy and 'hunter of predators', Renner encapsulates both the straight-down-the-middle 'good guy' western hero and the complex pathos-driven study in masculinity that emerged in post-John Wayne cinema. Not that Renner's could be described as soft, indeed the pathos and tragedy that motivates him is potent and the means through which he channels this pain creates a 'new' cowboy who is the perfect combination of traditional and contemporary sensibilities.Elizabeth Olsen's Jane Banner provides the chink of light shining from the modern outside world into this Western microcosm which straddles both the 'Wild West' frontier and a Trump-ruled America in its savagery and desperation. Her hero is our doorway into the frozen landscapes of Wyoming and it is through her eyes and her compassion that the viewer can begin to process the tragedy and sadness that permeates Wind River.

500,tonybedford,"Good, but too much mumbling",7,9 July 2018,"This was a good film, spoilt somewhat by sound issues. I was not sure what the problem was - were the actors just mumbling? It almost felt like the sound guy was standing too far away - the music and sound effects were fine, but even with the sound turned up to 75/100 I had a hard time hearing what the characters said - that was very hard going. I don't think I got more than a couple of words of the Native American policeman said. Much of the (important?) dialog appeared to be mumbled. Perhaps because I'm English I was not completely ""dialled in"" to the accents - but I can't remember having an issue with American accents before. I think because I missed quite a bit of the dialog there were a few loose ends left hanging for me. For example, the snow mobile trail that led up to Matt. Did he try to escape, or was he taken there by the ""baddies""? If taken there by the baddies, why was the trail only in one direction? And where did they go after? I'm sure there's a reasonable explanation, but it was perhaps missed in the poor sound quality of the dialog.Having said all that it was an interesting movie and very well done otherwise.",Wind River
501,pilotvulcan,A modern rendition of a sadly true story,9,7 November 2019,"With names Like Elizabeth Olsen and Jeremy Renner you expect something sharp, girtty and intense! No disappointments here then, with superb strong performances from both actors.
Renner plays a wildlife officer, Cory Lambert who discovers the body of a young Native American girl on a reservation. The autopsy reveals that she was raped and the FBI send investigator, Jane Banner, who has a no nonsense approach to the sad discovery.
She teams up with Lambert who has in depth extensive local knowledge of his home and surroundings. The pair then pursue the trail of evidence, leading them closer and closer to them both becoming targets of the perpetrators.
This is a true edge of the seat thriller based on regular crimes that happen in the Wind River area and are never investigated. This wild ride will have your heart in your mouth as things develop into a spine tingling and chilling climax. It sympathetically tells the story that many of us, myself included, never would have known actually happen in real life.
It will make you sit up, and take notice - something that the subject the movie covers, so well. Outstanding performances from Renner and Olsen who should BOTH have received Oscars for their roles.",Wind River
502,zaira123,Modern History Lesson,8,20 January 2020,"First of all: good acting, amazing scenery, sometimes hard to understand dialogue, but you'll get through that.However, what I think makes this movie worth watching is the story it represents. Natives are up until today the forgotten people of the United States that live in harsh conditions. Even though the story is only inspired by true events, it represents signs of current discrimination against Natives that continues to exist. One example is when Martin said to Jane that 'your people' always approached Natives with accusations (in this case, accusing Martin for being an inappropriate father, perhaps because of his background and living conditions). Another is when Cory accuses Natalie's brother for deliberately being a dropout. Unfortunately, reservations cope with high rates of alcoholism, suicide, and drug abuse, which is hard to escape from when most of your relatives are involved.The final meeting between Martin and Cory brings us however to the most important message from Wind River. Even though we all have different backgrounds, understanding the other, and helping each other, is the most necessary thing to do in order to elevate all.",Wind River

A truly powerful story that manages to convey the helplessness and hopelessness of the Native American people without sounding preachy or arrogant. Renner, Olsen, Bernthal and especially Green deliver the most spectacular performances. These are damaged people struggling with life and trying to keep moving forward after heartbreaking losses.

509,adamduhaf,"Heavy picture, but worth every minute!",10,10 September 2017,"I knew it would be a strong title going in, since I loved Prisoners and Sicario as well, but honestly haven't expected it to be this good.It was kind of like being punched in the stomach. A heavy topic and a depressing feeling to the whole movie, but I'm glad I've watched it.It really shows that Denis Villeneuve and Taylor Sheridan have worked together for some time now. The whole movie gives you that same familiar feeling you get when watching Prisoners or Sicario, but I have to say, Wind River turned out to be a stronger picture than the latter,as strong as Prisoners with the direction of Villeneuve, and Jeremy Renner's acting was easily as convincing as Jackman's desperate father role, not to mention basically the whole cast. Great actors and performances.No need to stretch it out any more, although it'd be easy to write a lot more about this one. This is a picture you should just watch. Be warned though, it's pretty thought provoking and may not let go of you for a while. Congratulations to Mr. Sheridan for writing/direction and to all the cast for this film.

515,theboredmen,Very emotional,8,7 August 2017,"WIND RIVER (2017) MOVIE REVIEWWind River is a movie about hard life in the mountains. Actually it is a detective. You don't feel a lot of tension in the movie, but you will feel a lot of feelings. From compassion to hate.Because this film deals with life on an Indian reservation, much of the social and economic woes might seem unfamiliar at first, but the film does a good job of providing a snapshot of the hardship. Sheridan depicts a world that is sympathetic and troubled at the same time, masking its tears with courage and doggedness. This film is all about emotions and that makes it great.Having said that, I enjoyed the soul of the film and some of the characters were interesting even if they didn't have much time to explain themselves.Final rating: 7.5/10",Wind River
516,Koala_99,Certainly One of the Best Films of the Year,9,5 October 2017,"I simply don't know what words can I use to describe how amazing this film is. It's everything what I wanted it to be: A neo-western crime thriller that contains mysterious and dramatic story, amazingly well directing and writing, powerful acting performances, intense original score and beautiful cinematography. Furthermore, it also has some interesting allegories and symbolism (for instance with snow, blizzard, landscapes, etc.) that I recognised throughout the film.Here are the elements that I really liked in this film:1) The story is so interesting, mysterious, intense, dark and heartbreaking. Also at the beginning of the film it says that it is based on true events, which after you see it, you'll get more shocking and terrifying feeling. The story follows the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service hunter and tracker, Cory Lambert, who discovers the frozen corpse of a young Native American woman. Later on, we get introduced by newcomer FBI agent Jane Banner who tries to determine if this was the act of homicide. To solve the case, she asks the tracker if he could help her and he accepts, because of his personal reasons. 2) The actors and the whole cast did a incredible job to portray the characters as realistic as possible, especially Jeremy Renner and Elizabeth Olsen. Jeremy Renner portrays a good, kind, charitable and sometimes cold blooded tracker who is willing to help and solve the case, to seek justice, because the similar situation had happened to his daughter long time ago. Elizabeth Olsen plays a newcomer FBI agent, who wants to find the truth and also to bring the justice. She's also emotional, brave and in one scene, where she's trying to calm down and order police officers to put their guns away, she's really tough and powerful. 3) If you enjoyed 'Sicario' and 'Hell or High Water', especially in the terms of writing, then you will certainly love this one, because the dialogue and the screenplay are just fantastic.4) The cinematography is beautiful. There are so many beautiful aerial and establishing shots of snowy and winterish landscapes.5) The tone and atmosphere is mysterious, terrifying and intense. The extraordinary original score and music sets this intense atmosphere and follows throughout the film.6) Last but not least, there are many allegories, meanings and symbolism used in the film. It starts with a narration of a young woman who is dreaming about a beautiful and bright land with a pond, trees and green grass and then it cuts to a young barefoot woman who runs through snowy, cold and winterish field and then falls down. This is important, because later on the film, we see blizzard, which we can relate to the opening narration, that blizzard symbolises dream. They want to escape from this place, this cruel reality, because everything they have left are winter, snow and silence. Snowy woods represents silence. Traces on the snow represents unheard voices of people who were gone. It shows us that people need help and that someone will come as the hero to save them. Through that allegory and symbolism we can understand how much the Native Americans, as the indigenous people, had suffered due to the occupation of their land, using their resources and destroying the nature. Speaking of nature, it also shows us the climate change awareness, that's why so many beautiful aerial and establishing shots of snowy landscapes are recognizable in the film. Also we see dirty muddy road, trucks and in the far distance, many gray rocky spots on mountains where there is no snow, which all of that combine can approve that awareness. The main character, the tracker Cory Lambert represents hope, someone who will save the people and will bring the justice.But there are some moments in the film that I didn't quite enjoy. There are some scenes with some unnecessary and useless shots. Sometimes, especially during the dialogue, editing falls off the track and at times changes its tempo. Also, there's only one scene, where Cory Lambert is having conversation with FBI agent Jane Banner about his daughter, and watching that scene I had feeling that camera was too shaky. I understand that in many movies, when cameraman is holding a camera it can't be strongly static, but in this scene it was extravagantly too much. But still, those are just few little mistakes and flaws that could be easily forgiven.To sum up, I encourage you to go and see this film. You'll enjoy it. I have a feeling that this film is going to be nominated for the Academy Awards, in the categories of Best Picture, Best Director, Best Original Screenplay, Best Actor, Best Supporting Actress, etc. and probably even win in some of those categories.9/10",Wind River
517,uqbarino,A hard and emotional film... recommended,9,4 October 2017,"It is first and foremost a drama, framed in circumstances of a police character; life in Lander is difficult, not anyone can adapt, and the possibility of losing sanity is as vast as the landscape. Everyone seems to be on their own, especially the few women; all this constitutes a dangerous territory where to survive is everything; solving a crime there is a long and tortuous process, youth seems lost, the middle-aged burden with painful memories and the elderly are already resigned. Different authorities and their jurisdictions are another problem; when there is nothing left but to go to the FBI, a young and inexperienced agent arrives to find realities that she does not even imagine .. she will be helped by a local hunter who carries with his own pains; together they will go on an adventure that will involve more than solving a crime . Neither will be the same when everything ends. Highly recommended film, with good performances and a relentless atmosphere like Lander's weather .",Wind River

However, people who are not from here are blatantly unaware that even though reservations in these parts are fully funded by the US government, the US government has no jurisdiction on the reservation.The tribes have their own government and police forces, funded by the US government, but not adhering to US or state laws. There are vast amount of crimes committed by Natives off the reservation, who then return to the reservation to avoid prosecution by US and state laws.Buildings and homes erected for the Native population are routinely neglected and destroyed by Native population. Go to the reservation dump and you will find sacks with suffocated puppies, or discarded cats and dogs that literally are tossed out of cars because they are no longer wanted.It's easy to type about what happens or what you ""think"" happens on a computer from a thousand miles away.

It juxtaposes the beauty and brutality of life in the West and depicts what is taken by the unforgiving landscape and by desperate, broken men. It was raw and heartbreaking. Olsen delivered a very realistic performance as the strong yet naive outsider, ignorant to the code and culture of the West. Brenner was an empathetic character and a silent hero. Part of what makes this movie so gut wrenching is that it captures the reality of many Native communities.",Wind River

526,Day_ImFivebyFive,True to life,8,2 October 2017,"Note: This review is slightly satirical. Please do not take it too seriously.In this movie you have the hateful ex-wife. You can see exactly why he divorced her in just one conversation. That's how you know the dialogue is good. It's exposition without being obvious about being exposition: the dialogue reveals their character traits and their history in one fell swoop. Excellent writing.Then you have the over-emotional, flying off the handle female who goes off on the drop of a hat. :DAnother woman is ready to commit suicide when she loses her daughter (can't say I blame her, though, but her husband is much more calm).Whereas men are portrayed as much more calm and level headed. Just like in real life!Then you have the racist minority characters who refer to the white characters as ""cracker"" or maybe ""white boy"". Just like in real life, it's the minorities who are usually racist, not white people. White racism is mostly made up in order to control the white population (and the minorities when you really think about it).Very true to life film. Then you have the white savior character who at one point yells ""they were forced to live here!"" (referring to the fact that the native Americans were forced to live on the reservation). I'm not sure how true that is, and at one point the same character tells a native American character that ""You could've gone to college or into the military. You had a choice"". Perhaps he means their ancestors were forced to live on the reservation? Not sure how true that is either, but I will have to research it. But either way, this screams white savior and ""look at me sticking up for the minority!"" Just like the virtue-signaling liberals like it! :DAt the end, when the woman FBI agent says ""You saved me"" to the main character, he responds by saying ""You saved yourself. You were strong"" clearly pushing the feminist agenda. :DSo, this movie is SJW and feminist and yet also very true to life and non-politically correct. All in all, it was a good movie.8/10 would watch again.Also, all the politics aside I have to mention a couple more flaws. 1: when the rape scene came on, the other characters in the trailer didn't seem like they had rape *in them*. One of the characters was built up as a drunk piece of sh*t who wouldn't take no for an answer but it didn't seem like the other guys would be as evil. They didn't seem drunk either. It seemed like as the scene went on at least one of them would've said ""Hey, hey! Enough is enough!"" and broken the fight up but they didn't. They just kinda went along with the rape and let their ""friend"" rape the girl. Huh?Also the main character had a mission to hunt the three mountain lions killing local livestock. He finds the three cougars near the end, but he doesn't kill them. What? We heard him say ""End of the line for you"" (referring to the lions), but he doesn't actually kill them or do anything with them. He just walks up the hill past the lions. Not sure if we missed something or not, but both my mom and I were both very confused by that.",Wind River
527,tena_v,A heartbreaking story,8,18 November 2017,"Wow, just wow. This movie was heartbreaking.In the first minutes of the movie we see a young woman running and trying to escape in the snow. She is clearly scared and is running away from something or someone chasing her. Just after that we see a Wild Life ranger who is portrayed by Jeremy Renner while he is hunting and killing a wolf. Later he picks up his son from his ex wife's house and travels to an Native American Reservation because he has to find a lion who killed cattle on the land of his ex father in law. While looking for the lion he finds the body of the young woman from the beginning of the movie, and upon recognizing her, calls authorities with a heavy heart. After that the plot starts to thicken when a young and inexperienced FBI agent (portrayed by Elizabeth Olsen) arrives to lead the investigation I love movies which are ""inspired by actual events"". In the beginning I thought it was a little slow, and I couldn't focus on the plot, but when the story started to unravel I was amazed.For a long time I haven't sympathized with a character of any movie, but God, I felt so sorry for Natalie and her fate, and I was so proud of her, 6 miles running in the snow, with no shoes..Oh God I could cry right now. Such a strong character and beautifully written.The details around Natalies death and molestation that happened before it are gruesome. And the culprits deserved everything they got in the end. An eye for an eye.",Wind River
528,chrismuniz13,Renner for the Oscar,9,19 January 2018,"Absolutely loved the film. Jeremy Renner is a stud. His performance as ""the hunter"" is his best to date. The character was focused and precise. That being said I have not seen many of his movies. ""The Town"" was probably the best movie he has been in till ""Wind River"". This movie was emotional, intense, and full of surprises. I jumped so high off the couch during the climax. Elizabeth Olsen was delightful as well. Her endurance as the FBI agent was portrayed with prominent detail. At some moments you felt as if you were going through them with her. Her passion for justice drove her to persevere through the cold, unfamiliar environment. What makes the film so hauntingly beautiful is that it is based off real events. It educates the audiences about the treacherous mountain ranges and the plight of drugs and crime in the Wyoming native people. The ending was so satisfyingly complete. I love a film with great closure.""Wolves don't kill unlucky deer, they kill the weak ones."" The quote truly sat with me. If you are willing to fight and claw and do whatever it takes to survive and succeed, you can create your own luck.",Wind River
529,rwilsond,Potential Turns to Cheap Rubbish,1,26 December 2017,"We chose this movie based on the glowing online reviews. The first real sign of trouble with this movie came when the pathetic excuse of an FBI agent (played by Elisabeth Olsen) opens the door on a grieving Mother in the act of committing suicide. And what is the FBI agent's reaction upon seeing the attempt? She shuts the door and walks away - making no attempt whatsoever to stop the suicide attempt, or to inform the others present, so they could stop it. So, think about it - the FBI agent and other cops are there to investigate a case where someone has already died, and in the process they have an opportunity to save the life of the grieving Mother, but choose not to intervene so they could continue trying to solve the underlying case. Then, the scene where the FBI agent fills some trailer-park trash guy full of holes, after he attacks them for no apparent reason - other than to add some excitement to an otherwise dreadfully boring movie. Nevertheless, we stayed fairly interested in this disaster of a movie to the point where the dozen or so opposing cops all drew their guns at the oil drilling site. That was one of the stupidest and most over played nonsensical scenes I've ever seen. How could an intelligent person take this movie seriously after that? Anyone who stuck with the movie after that ridiculous scene, at least got to witness all these morons needlessly shooting each other to death as the villain ran off. I can't believe I paid to see this rubbish. After it was over, the only ones we cared about were the three starving mountain lions that had somehow escaped slaughter by all the gun-happy imbeciles. With all the dead bodies left in the snow, they hopefully kept fed for the remainder of the winter.",Wind River

532,duderomski,Truly a fantastic movie.,9,4 March 2018,"I don't usually write reviews unless a movie ticks me off. I had to make an exception for this. I watched Wind River a few nights ago for the first time, then again this evening with my dad. He mentioned how he thought it was a bit slow in some parts, but that may have been because of how programmed hollywood has us with the constant action and cutscenes. I disagreed. There were no slow scenes, just great dialogue and realistic moments of pause. That's the only way to truly build the emotion the characters are feeling. It's rare to find a movie that focuses on great dialogue and not all of the fancy visual effects and action. It reminded me of a Quentin Tarantino movie with how well and unique some of the lines were. The acting was great all around, especially from Jeremy Renner and Elizabeth Olsen. They had a realistic chemistry and fit their parts almost perfect. I credit the Casting Director and Director with a lot of that. Jeremy Renner had a calm and respectable way about him, much as I would expect from the character he was portraying, and Elizabeth Olsen played the out-of-her-element FBI agent with precision. The cinematography was also beautifully shot. As to why my rating isn't perfect, I would have rated it a 10, I just don't agree with including nudity in movies, albeit if any movie should include it, this would be the movie because it remains in context. I understand why the director did so. It built on the realism and intensity, as well as the emotional anger involved in a part I won't spoil.Do yourself a favor and watch this movie.",Wind River

545,jonahcybarra-29010,Justice Best Served Cold,9,16 February 2019,"LOSS. GRIEF. HEALING.Wind River is screenwriter Taylor Sheridan's directorial debut, one that earned him an eight minute standing ovation at the Cannes Film Festival. Wind River tells the story of a young woman's death and those looking to bring her justice. Like other works written by Sheridan, there are only a few main characters the plot focuses on while the cast of secondary characters is meant to either develop our main characters more or help to drive the plot forward. This type of writing can be problematic if the story being told is one on a larger scale, however for the focused writing found in this film and others bearing Sheridan's name, it works to allow for the audience to form a real relationship with each of the main characters. Jeremy Renner and Elizabeth Olsen act as our main driving forces in the film, backed by a solid performance from veteran actor Graham Greene to round out the story's main characters. The movie gets its title from the location the film takes place in, the Wind River Reservation, Wyoming. Large panning shots help to transport audiences to the desolate landscape that is the state of Wyoming, the least populated state in the Union. Quiet, haunting music, scored by the talented duo of Nick Cave and Warren Ellis, the same men who oversaw the score for Hell or High Water, slides throughout the film, constantly reminding the audience of just how alone all of the characters on screen are through the use of sound. When a young woman's body is discovered by Fish and Game Officer Cory Lambert (Jeremy Renner) and he recognizes her as his deceased daughter's best friend Natalie, he calls the Wind River Police Chief Ben Shoal (Graham Greene) to begin an investigation into her cause of death. When it is discovered that she had been raped shortly before dying, Chief Shoal calls the FBI and they send their closest agent, Agent Jane Banner (Elizabeth Olsen), from Las Vegas to investigate. Banner is immediately thrust into the harshness that is the Wyoming wilderness, dealing with suspicion and the general mistrust of government authority from those living on and around the reservation. The plot takes many twists and turns as more circumstances of Natalie's death are uncovered. One of these twists is that the audience learns that the reason why Lambert and his wife are divorced is because their daughter was kidnapped and killed and their marriage crumbled due to their grief and guilt over her death. One of Sheridan's best qualities as a screenwriter is that everything that takes place throughout the plot happens for a specific reason and one is able to see that in his directing style also. Every shot is necessary to moving the film forward and nothing is wasted or feels frivolous. When the rapists and killers are found, the gunfight is not only gory and brutal, it happens in such a way that it feels like a gunfight that has taken place in real life, injuries and casualties hitting both sides of the conflict, Chief Shoal meeting his end and Banner catching buckshot in the chest although she is mostly protected due to her bulletproof vest. After the dust settles and the shooting stops, we find Lambert on top of the tallest peak in Wyoming with the man responsible for not only for Natalie's rape but her subsequent death as well as her boyfriend's murder, a security guard for one of the local drill sites named Pete Mickens. Giving Pete an opportunity to confess his crimes, the man does so and Lambert then frees him. When Pete asks him what he should do, Lambert tells him that Natalie ran six miles barefoot in the snow before succumbing to the elements and that is the chance he is giving the man responsible for her murder. Pete refuses to move until Lambert shoves the barrel of his gun into the man's face, forcing him to dash away into the snow. The murdering rapist makes it maybe 600 feet before he dies, drowning in his own blood just as Natalie died days previous. This film takes on the difficult emotion of not only loss and the grief that follows, but the different ways one can heal after the fact. When Lambert is comforting Martin (Gil Birmingham), Natalie's father and his good friend, he shares with him something a grief counselor told him after his own daughter had been killed. The quote is this, ""I got some good news, and I got some bad news. Bad news is you're never gonna be the same. You're never gonna be whole, not ever again. You lost your daughter. Nothing's ever going to replace that. Now the good news is, as soon as you accept that, and you let yourself suffer... you allow yourself to visit her in your mind, and you'll remember all the love she gave you, all the joy she knew."" This statement is extremely powerful and it speaks to the struggles Lambert himself has had to face in the wake of his daughter's murder, one that was never solved. Taylor Sheridan isn't afraid to tackle this challenging topic, and he takes it one step further. The ending shot of the movie is a silent shot of Lambert and Martin mourning their lost daughters together as text appears on the screen highlighting the fact that there are no statistics kept on Native American women who disappear and that there are thousands of cases that remain unsolved. Wind River is a stark look at not only life in Wyoming or on an Indian Reservation, it tackles the intertwined topics of not just loss and grief but the healing that has to take place afterwards and the different ways one can heal after the loss of a loved one.",Wind River

What is tougher then growing in Wyoming is growing up in Indian Reservation. Yes, they have their own laws and own land, but what kinda land is that? What if they don't have people to carry out the law? They're left on their own, no one thinks about them, no one cares about them and no one wants to help them.

556,killamator,"Worthwhile and thought provoking, both in what it gets right and what could have been",7,26 April 2019,"I loved Sicario and Hell or High Water and I overall am glad I finally watched this film as well. It has a compelling story and also relays an important message about the very real national problem of the disappearances of Native American women. The film uses its central mystery to draw us into a broader reflection of the beauty of the reservation, both in the culture and natural beauty within, which are inseparable from each other. But it is also a tragedy, both in the crime against the life of a woman and the historic crime that my country committed against her people, taking their land and so much of their culture. So I appreciate this film and its sensitivity. I would like to see more media exploring these themes.Jeremy Renner does a great job playing the wise hunter, grieving his own daughter's death under unresolved circumstances. Some of his monologues are a bit forced feeling, but there is a real poetry to his words which is a hallmark of Taylor Sheridan's style.However, throughout the film I couldn't help thinking of how whites are always in the foreground. In a film about Native Americans, I felt myself continuously wanting to see how the Natives themselves were reacting themselves to the events. If there were an equivalent of the Bechdel test for Native American characters, this film would fail in the sense that there are no scenes not portrayed outside of the view of white actors. Again, as I said, I appreciated the sensitivity of Renner's performance, and the film shows brief flashes of consciousness of the inherent irony of a white man being the protagonist of a film about crimes against Native women.Still, I feel this film squandered a chance to use a Native lead. It tries to sidestep it by having him as the father of Native children, but I just couldn't help cringing as he explained to the bereaved father about how to grieve his daughter, and to the drug-addled brother about how to clean himself up and pick himself up by his bootstraps.As a white man, I am accustomed to films where someone who looks like me is the savior, from Dances with Wolves and Last of the Mohicans to The Last Samurai and even Avatar. These themes have already been explored at length. This film does a good job at highlighting the historic crimes that my people committed (and continue to commit) against Native Americans, but I would like to see more celebrating the survival of Natives and seeking answers from their culture, rather than merely offering advice.This film is powerful and worthwhile as a reflection on the beauty and sadness of the West, but it would have been a true classic for me if it had taken more risk in its storytelling, getting viewers like me out of our comfortable bubble of white lead actors. Because it seeks to profile a current problem, the disappearance of Native American women, as a continuation of the historic crime against their people, they should be able to be more active participants in the narrative rather than supporting actors.",Wind River

558,super-monsters,Dark thrilling drama with elements of suspense and foreboding.,10,25 September 2017,"As far as mystery thrillers go, there are too many out there that even the common laymen could name you at least 3 top films. That being said, this movie doesn't pretend to be anything that it isn't. It is an exceptionally foul toned movie and will continue to show that even debuting directors can be incredibly fanatical about gritty details, Such as blood, Sexual encounters and death. This movie sets the scene early on with gore that you would usually find in 80's action flicks, but appropriately honours the horror but all too true reality of hunters, both for animals and humans. Jeremy Renner plays our lead and already becomes a hero in the viewers eyes early on. It is very typical to find that in these sorts of movies, the anti-hero tends to sway away from the police needing assistance only to appear later to save the day, However, We get a fresh new look at a character who wants to help and with a backstory as dark as can be, give's us a reason to love Jeremy Renners every day man persona. you want him to succeed, you want him to say yes, you want him to shoot that SOAB. Elizabeth Olsen is certainly a fresh enough face around cinemas these days but she has a strong screen presence in most of her works and this film is no exception. She portrays an FBI agent that we already grow to appreciate and as the movie kicks off with varying action sequences, we are on the edges of our seats, constantly wanting the hero to win and that is how you know characters are written well, you care.Very little to be said about this movie other than it is an excellent thriller, a must see.",Wind River

Yet again, in the end, no one talks about the heroic deaths of the local police force and the Native American sheriff; and it is just all about one white boy consoling and pampering the white girl about how awesome she is. Of course white dude is the hero who hunted down all the bad guys, and the white city girl is the only person who has the ""strength and spirit"" to survive.So American.

565,alexandra-19084,Great film; disturbing after-thoughts,8,23 September 2021,"I loved the acting; nothing in the movie was obvious. Only after it is over do you go back in your mind and recall conversations and details that only make sense after you have seen the ending. I love any film that examines a part of society or culture we don't see represented very often.THAT SAID, I was very upset about the speciesism in this film. The main character is a hunter of predators. This is a very sick and dangerous concept. We don't have enough predators in the environment; destruction of coyotes and mountain lions and wolves throws a wrench into the lynchpin of how ecosystems work. This ""hunter"" is trying to protect livestock - sheep and cows - that again, humans are only planning to kill, and that, again, are terrible for the environment. Raising livestock is the number one destroyer of forests and native species. No human - not even native americans on reservations - need to breed, confine and slaughter animals for survival. It's the least healthy diet and most destructive to our climate.So on one hand we see this tragedy -- two young human women being killed -- and we are supposed to be outraged and overcome with grief at the senseless loss of their lives. But we are not supposed to bat an eye at wolves, coyotes and mountain lions being killed (notably, the film points out that these animals are MOTHERS, with cubs, so very parallel to the human family units in the film) or the fact that these wild animals are being killed to protect cows and sheep..... who will also be killed!!

567,baldasgetout-26409,A fine updating of the western genre with some social conscience,8,25 September 2017,"This film is a deconstruction of the American dream, the civilizing mission and the taming of 'the west'. There's a lone lawman ( woman actually), a shoot out at the Corral (close enough), the horses take a rest while snow-mobiles ( due to snow it's basically a black and white movie) do the cross-country stuff; there's old hands (improbably old in view of the ambient mortality) and greenhorns, and, to the Europe-side viewer, too many guns in the hands of people who haven't received enough vetting. There's also hurting people ( hurting animals too), personal motivations, tragedies to live with, hesitant conversations, some psychological closeness, and on occasions, just being there. I was moved. There may have been some romance ( I blinked for a moment). I loved that Indian Martin says some obscure things while the busy highway traffic races past his isolated homestead. Even if your official position is to support the rule of law, the denouement is satisfying. An actual grown-up western. Bravo",Wind River

Especially because so few people outside of the Native community know about this horrid reality I find this film to be of utmost importance.Nevertheless the acting, the dialogue and the directing are all of superb quality which created a dramatic film of intense sincerity and that is emotionally touching.

587,ahsampson,Plot flows like a river... Wind River that is,7,13 October 2017,"Wind River is a prime example of a murder mystery/ thriller film done right. Directed by Taylor Sheridan, and set on the Wind River Native Reservation in Wyoming, USA, the story follows the duo of a wild life officer (Jeremy Renner) and an FBI agent (Elizabeth Olsen) as they track down the murderer of a teenage girl. The plot that unfolds will blow ones mind.One must praise Taylor Sheridan for his screen writing/directing abilities. Wind River exemplifies the definition of a true thriller as he builds suspense gradually throughout the film. The first twenty minutes of the film seem uneventful as it is used to introduce the characters and the situation, but after that one is left biting their nails for the remainder of the film, as they are left in suspense.Jeremy Renner's portrayal of US Fish and Wildlife Service agent Cory Lambert is one to be noted. Renner stays cool and collected for most of the film, but he exhibits sign of true anger at the right times. Elizabeth Olsen's depiction, however, is not as favorable as Renner's. Olsen's overacts her character as expresses her voice and emotions too much. She creates a character that seems like a whiny school girl.Overall the film can be given a ranking of 3/4. Sheridan's skillful screen writing and directorial skills are are shown throughout the film, as the suspense of the film builds to a highly climactic ending. Renner is great. Olsen is not as great with her portrayal. This, however, does not overshadow the plot. If this film does not get an Oscar nod for best adapted screenplay it will surprising. Watch this film. It is definitely worth the watch.",Wind River

Renner is a cool dude, though I am starting to doubt his acting range. Seems he's pigeonholed as the (action) man of few words.I agree with the criticism that the movie seems to says that it takes white people to solve the problems the natives have.",Wind River
590,jordanheineman3214,Taylor Sheridan's best film to date,10,10 October 2017,"With Elizabeth Olsen being my favorite actress and Jeremy Renner being cast in it, I was kinda afraid that Renner wouldn't do that good. Wind River is directed and written by Taylor Sheridan, who may be my favorite crime writer by far. He's made two amazing films in Sicario and Hell or High Water, however Wind River is my favorite of his. I'm a sucker for mystery films, and this was a mystery film. Not only was it a film. It's a realistic ideal of what would happen in real life if this was to occur, which I'm pretty sure it has. Sheridan knows how to make people feel like you're in the film and I felt that way. Two amazing performances from Elizabeth Olsen and Jeremy Renner, who is my favorite actor of the year so far. Gil Birmingham is another one who has a very underrated performance and so is Jon Bernthal. The best movie of the year, guys. Check it out, definitely going to be added in my Blu-ray collection.

592,johannesemil,Not as good as it's rating - still good,7,10 October 2017,"NO SPOILERS IN THIS REVIEW! Honest opinionThis is the first time I've ever reviewed on IMDb, but this movies rating is very in just. When the movie started, the first vibe went straight to Fargo, another great movie. As it progresses, slowly steady you get as sense of what's going on. The storytelling is solid, and the acting is only as good as the script and the plot allows it to be, and if you have those in mind the acting was on point. The reason for the title and this review is that the plot is, and I have to emphasize it, VERY MEDIOCRE.I get the intentions of the movie, but I think for it to bear as little plot, and as slow moving plot as it does, the characters need to be written stronger, which they were not. I especially felt that Jeremy Renners character and backstory could have been more impact full if the script had given Jeremy a chance to explore the character some more. I never say this ever, but maybe if they had added 15minutes of run time for character exploration, it might had been a 9/10 from me. I didn't come for action driven movie, I actually like character heavy movies, but the script was just very mediocre.Anyways, if you're into a slow moving, well directed, acted and perfectly scored movie you should go watch this movie.",Wind River
593,vance9281,A good ending was missed,7,29 July 2018,"One review noted how bad the sound was. I could not hear much of anything in the first ten minutes. I kept turning the sound up and then a gun would go off and hurt my ears. This was such a hassle that I turned on the subtitles & left the sound alone. This was a serious technical flaw that is surprising today. I thought it was a very good movie until the standoff at the drilling site. The gun fight made almost no sense and it seemed pointless to kill so many people. The scene could have involved fewer people and been menacing and very tight. The big opportunity missed was when Renner's character tracked down the killer, Pete, and got him to confess. When he let him go to walk barefoot in the snow, the ending would have been a lot more satisfactory if Pete had collapsed and the last thing he saw was the mountain lion and her cubs fixing to have dinner.I gave this seven stars because the critical moment was too lame, too Hollywood, and not effective. The sound track was terrible and there is no excuse for that.If sound had been better and that scene at the oil rig had been tightened up and more realistic I might have been given this eight stars. If the lions had gotten to feed on Pete, it would earn nine.",Wind River

I had lost hope in Jeremy Renner's films after his long streak of horrible script choices. The Town was excellent, and now Wind River, which is even better. Not all the credit goes to Renner, it was an amazing film all around. It's been awhile since a film had me walking out if the theater thinking to myself ""WOW, that was amazing, I wish it didn't have to end"". I won't talk about any details, but this true story will have you on the edge of your seat in suspense the entire time, while you enjoy great acting, writing, and directing.

597,emirlukac,Another good story by Taylor Sheridan.,8,7 November 2017,"Taylor Sheridan wrote 3 really good stories in last three years(Sicario, Hell or High water), but this time he was also a director. His direction gave us something special in terms of making actors to do their best and show them where to give importance to specific scene or parts of dialogue. Jeremy Renner gave us a great performance, he really showed us his pain and ways to confront it. Chemistry between him and Elizabeth Olsen was pretty good. I was a little bit suspicious when i saw Gil Birmingham and Graham Greene duo from Twilight *hahah* but they were good in this movie especially Gils character Martin who had similar destiny as Jeremy character Cory and they have created a special bond and that parable was through the whole movie.Taylor realistically present us harsh life of people living in the north and all negative things that could happen to that people out there. Comparasion and rivalry between Native Americans and the settlers is one of the main object in this movie and showed that they must live and fight together if they want to survive.I liked this movie and i advice Taylor to direct his own stories because he knows best what is important in the movie and he can show actors how he imagine all the characters.",Wind River

Drama, action, suspense? There is certainly enough of all in this film. Being an avid movie buff and a fan of most big action stars, I've never been able to make up my mind about Jeremy Renner, but I can now say with no doubt this guy is awesome. Maybe it's the roll itself,but I think it is how he portrays it that's just gold. GIVE this actor some BIG ASS contracts. He deserves more than Avengers!! As for Elizabeth Olsen, she is the only one in that Family who can claim the occupation of actress in my opinion.(I'm sure it was real hard to play cute as little babies in a sitcom). All that being said, much credit deserved to the Native American whoops I mean first real American actors in this film, but how come it's always Greene, and Birmingham?Lol!! We need to see more of these actors since we already know the two I named already are both GREAT,GREAT actors. All in all a super entertaining ""Eye for an eye suspense thriller"" I'll make up my own genre for it. As for the closing on screen paragraph, all I can say is this,"" To all the politicians,certain Law enforcement officers,and all the racist assholes out there,"" WHAT FUCKIN' YEAR IS IT ??
Maybe it's the year that mankind will GROW UP and realize that all of us are unique people,and while we might disagree on beliefs or religion etc., We can all definitely feel happiness, sadness, love, and loss.

No doubt Sheridan has writing chops(Sicario, Hell or High Water) and has directed once before(vile), but in Wind River we see for the first time a complete vision from the up-and-comer. Wind River strait up works from the beautiful cinematography and technical accomplishments to the tight, suspenseful story and convincing performances. Renner in particular gives a masterful performance as Cory Lambert, a professional hunter enlisted by FBI agent Jane Banner, portrayed by Elisabeth Olsen, to help her solve a homicide in Wyoming. The pallet perfectly matches the tone of the film that takes on themes of grief, bureaucracy, and of course the plight of the American Native.

605,lee_leeth,A story having something to say,9,20 June 2018,"""Wind River"" is a mystery thriller directed by Taylor Sheridan. The cast of the film are remarkably known actors such as Jeremy Renner and Elizabeth Olsen.
The film is an engrossing story of a murder happening in Wyoming, Indian reservation. The beginning is quite attention grabbing and there is nary a cliché. The movie starts with important statements which the director repeats several times throughout the film to make logical sequences and emphasize the importance of those words. A girl, after running barefoot in a severe cold, falls and drops dead. During his patrol, a wildlife tracker discovers the heinous death of the girl. An FBI agent is being sent to the city to investigate the case, who later teams up with the wildlife tracker. 
After finding out that the girl was a victim of a gang rape, the team heads to find the real participants of the crime. Having tracked down the culprit, they leave him to a vigilante justice, barefoot and in sobs in the mountain. 
The film is really gripping, the plot is developed well and all the characters are given time, importance and full revelation by scrupulously avoiding stereotypes. The violence is proper for the scenario and kept at a bare minimum not to cause a negative repulsion. The photography is very pretty and consistent with the scenes of the city. The director was very potent in portraying the ""ignored"" reality of American Indians and the acting of the cast conveyed the palpable sadness of the situation behind the cameras. 
The director and the crew did a good job and put a lot effort and faith for the appreciation by the discerning audience, and that same fact is more than noteworthy.",Wind River

608,Dmitry_Plastun,Detective and personal tragedy an interesting combination,8,2 October 2017,"A story about the tragedy of a person and the pain that everyone is experiencing. What is special about this film is the beauty of the winter landscapes and mountains. but do not forget that this detective and the atmosphere of uncertainty, entanglement runs through the entire film until the very end. The main character is a huntsman, who found the corpse of a girl in the snow and is sent to the aid of a young FBI agent to search for the causes of death. The plot of the film reveals the details of the huntsman's family and you already look at him as a person who alone copes with the pain that is inside him and seeks answers to the main question. In general, the film is made in the traditions of the detective genre, the atmosphere is transmitted, although it is not ordinary, but it is chosen well.

618,n-12011,Plausible for its Scorching Truth: Wind River,10,22 January 2020,"The crime-drama thriller Wind River has so many impressive aspects to the film other than its fine acting and director (Taylor Sheridan). Taylor Sheridan is also well known for his directory of Hell or High Water. I certainly feel as if this film is underlooked and underrated. It is truly engaging, and I never found myself looking for my next snack during it. Key themes in the film include unemployment, sexual abuse, and drugs abuse, within this Native American population. This film is extremely unpredictable and has an emotional set of events with a strong message being portrayed. A very well done film left me with my jaw dropping in the first five minutes and held the feeling until the credits displayed.
The film opens up with a Native American girl sprinting away from an incident (we later find out what) in the snowy Wyoming mountains on a Reservation. You can see her struggle, with a vast amount of fear in her eyes which add to the barbarous surroundings she's trudging through (barefoot). Soon, Cory Lambert (Jeremy Renner), a hunter, comes across the dead girl in the snow while hunting down some mountain lions that preyed on livestock. Lambert, however, is driven to find the cause of death of the girl he finds by his own daughter's rape and murder on the reservation. Throughout the movie they give several hints of him being a sniper, but is never actually confirmed which just leads to more heavy ending with what his character does. Jane Banner (Elizabeth Olsen) steps in as a rookie FBI agent, to help solve the mystery murder of the Native American girl. While doing so, they have to overcome many series of realistic violent events, like being involved in multiple shootouts and having many dangerous encounters. Like with bear spray in a crackhouse. Enough said.
Something I'd say the film didn't do extremely well on was the sound. Often times it was extremely loud like the gunshots but other times I felt like was always messing with the volume. Sometimes, it sounded a bit muffled and unclear (specifically Renner) but it's not particularly his fault that he sounded that way it's the audio editors. Another thing I found a little cliche was the fact that the FBI agent was a woman. It seemed like the only reason for having a woman play the role of the FBI was to enhance the emotions of the audience, by her own emotions of the murder investigation.The screenplay was so wonderfully put together, there was no excess dialogue or time wasted during it. There is much depth within the characters and storyline. The cast do an outstanding job and are so entertaining to watch. The scenes were so unique and clever.. For example, when Renner was in a snow ghillie suit and pops out of the snow filling his character as sniper in a shootout. However, it is not an easy film to watch. Often times, it is extremely dark and the message it is portraying is delivered in a harsh, realistic way. The setting of the film is absolutely phenomenal, and goes so well with the film considering the sun doesn't shine much, which I thought was actually quite depressing but fits purpose. The outfits and costumes were extremely adequate considering this film is taking place in the present.
The film ends with the following text on screen:""While missing person statistics are compiled for every other demographic, none exist for Native American women. No one knows how many are missing.""
This is essentially the main theme, and they offered a great course of action showing the brutality the women go through, and how horrific some of the events they encounter truly are. Overall Wind River is a great movie, and is very engaging and dark. It contain lots of action that you won't want to miss. It is also a big eye opener to those unaware of the conditions of the women on reservations.",Wind River

As someone who lived right off the Wind River Reservation and whose husband worked for the Northern Arapaho tribe (one of three non-native employees) I can say that without a doubt this is what happens too many times on the res there. The natives often live in deplorable conditions but it's not all the other guy's fault either. However, the treatment of women and the disappearance of women, and yes men too, is horrific. There is often no closure. Things are so confusing and convoluted and corrupt that it's no surprise these things happen. We've since moved away but some of the experiences and events will never be gone. I wish that the people there, on and off the res, can find some resolution to the atrocities. It's a beautiful area and everyone should visit the Wind River mountains. It's on most people's way to the Grand Tetons and Yellowstone. Stop at Brooks lake and see the beginning of the Wind River.

644,ilushh,"""Wind River"" will blow you away.",8,6 November 2017,"At a deep and icy level, Wind River is about power. That dynamic cuts in multiple directions, across race and gender and class. But genre awareness can give us more than the dynamics baked into a movie's plot. Genre is a comparative idea—you have to see across movies in order to get a hold on a genre, which inevitably means that some details get flattened out. What movies do with our anxieties (why do cops kill?) changes from work to work, and from year to year. But if we are to learn anything new about our own hopes and fears for law enforcement, we have to find a new point of entry for movie-making: not cautionary pornography, or love letters to white feelings. There's something else going on here, and white masculinity is at its heart. The movie that can wring catharsis out of that will be a long time coming.",Wind River

I was like what? Wyoming? Isn't that with all the other states in the US? So I looked it up, and check out the average temperature over there. So average low in winter are something like -7 Celsius (18-20 F). On some very chilly winter day in Montreal, we can get some -30 Celsius (-22 F) and nobody dies from exploding lungs. What the hell is that? The day they were on the mountain and the bad guy died, felt like a spring day for a Montrealer. Big sun in the sky.

I love Jeremy Renner and Elizabeth Olsen as actors but to see them together in something that wasn't an ""Avengers"" was an interesting feeling for me in the beginning but after watching ""Wind River"" they totally changed my perspective because they portrayed their roles beautifully.

659,info4ruth,Visually beautiful but heartbreaking tale,8,16 September 2018,"Wind River shines a spotlight on the dangers of too much silence and isolation plus alcohol Is a deadly combination. Visually stunning film by a first time cinematographer, Led by a talented director who lays bare the pain, fear and disappointments along with the dangers of the brutally cold landscape for those who live and work in the region. The conversation between the two grieving fathers of murdered daughters contains a message about grief that is so well written and then performed by Jeremy Renner. Watching it at home you may feel tempted to pause and rewind it so that you could unpack everything he says. The incredible standoff scene is filled with such tension until the violence erupts. It is powerful yet not wrapped up in special effects. In fact to be filmed in snow surrounded by white buildings it's ink credibly understated with the blood. Throughout the film when you see the blood it is not introduced to shock you but rather you learn about the dangers of the environment they live in. I put this movie on to basically be background noise while I was working but it is an incredible movie they will not allow you to ignore it.And then if the story itself has not moved you the facts shared at the end will disturb you. A message shown before the credits indicate that the only women in America whose disappearance is not statistically captured are native American women. Racism did not start and will not end with the current administration and this is just another stark reminder.Wind River is currently available on Netflix.",Wind River

Jeremy Renner and Elizabeth Olsen are both exceptional as a dissimilar pair who out of sheer happenstance form an alliance to solve the mystery of a young woman's brutal death on an Indian reservation.

670,kitsuneswolf,Great Characters,7,12 March 2018,"I was very cautious of this movie simply because of Renner's white male lead and it taking place on a native reservation. However, I really ended up liking his character. He is a supportive ex-husband, and a supportive friend. He went to therapy. His relationship with his ex-wife is believable and carried out quite naturally. I really liked the actress who played his ex. She pulled off her characters emotions very well.We get to see the harsh reality our native population are going through from both the inside (all native characters, and sort of Renner - I found it well insinuated that he is a welcomed ally, but still white to the community) and outside perspective (FBI agent who knows and admits that she is lost, but wants to help because it's the right thing and hates the legislation just as much as the local PD), which I find refreshing.Another review stated that Greene's character was a 'cop who is blase about his job', which...I don't know. I don't feel like that's really accurate. He's a Res cop whose hands are tied by litigation, and I think if that red tape was cut, he would have successfully finished the investigation without the agent or even Renner's character. I think the antagonists fate would have still been the same. The litigation doesn't really let him do more than what he did.Overall I enjoyed the movie much more than I thought I would.",Wind River

673,sarazarrichardson,Unanswered Questions,7,5 September 2017,"I enjoyed so much about this movie, but I'm really annoyed with what appear to be some pretty major mistakes in the story line. Am I missing something? The biggest one being the snow mobile tracks leading from the drug house to Matt's body. This makes absolutely no sense. Nobody at the drug house had anything to do with the murders. The murders happened at the oil rig place. Also, as they pointed out, the tracks leave the drug house, but never return. Why? The other mistake, was when they originally find Natalie's body and he says the nearest structure is the drug house, which is 3 miles away. The second nearest is the oil rig that is 5 miles away. Then at the end, they say she made it 6 miles. Why say five and then later change it to 6? When watching a murder mystery like this one, you are trying to pay attention to these details in order to solve the mystery. It's really annoying when there are major mistakes like this. Are they there to throw you off? That only works if they make actual sense. There is no reason for snow mobile tracks to leave the drug house and not come back, let alone lead to one of the murder victims bodies. Somebody, please explain this to me.",Wind River

I saw aggressive enforcement – knock down the doors with gun in hand - lead to a deadly shootout with an FBI agent. Turns out though that the dead guy had nothing to do with the crime under investigation. His only clear antisocial act was that he looked sleazy.Plus I saw an armed 'friend of the police' carry out his own violent death sentence on a suspect.

As someone who has spent a lifetime in law enforcement, I had to suspend belief but could not totally avoid these rather obvious problems with the narrative: Why an FBI agent from Vegas, WY in Denver Field Div and there are agents in Wyoming. Was it just to have someone without warm clothes? The very thin justification for lone SA being assigned completely collapses after she kills someone, she would be writing reports and dozens of FBI SAs and bosses would have been on scene. First shooting makes no sense and is not really relevant to the plot. What oil company pays for an army of guards to protect a remote drilling site? Actions of the suspects makes no sense, clean up scene and play dumb. Discovery of second body entirely too convenient. Efforts to portray film as addressing problems of sexual assault are a bit transparent, writers felt the need to portray perpetrators as outsiders, hardly the most likely scenario.",Wind River

680,sashaiancu-07796,Beautifully & hauntingly shot!,9,29 September 2017,"This might be one of my favourite films to come out in 2017. It's so beautifully filmed, Taylor Sheridan did an amazing job. The cast is perfect all around & all the scenery shots are so stark & haunting, it really fits in well with the plot. This whole movie made my heart ache since I've known few kids that have lived on reservations & the families & children that grow up there do not have water or electricity in most cases. It breaks my heart because of the way they live, a lot of the youth resort to drugs & drinking to get away from their reality. This movie accurately depicts what every day life is like for Natives. This movie just proves that white man is always out there destroying someone else's life. We are to blame for a lot of the injustices & horrors that have happened in the world & are still happening. This film broke me in more ways than I can count & it was done so well. The soundtrack was perfect, everything about it. Also I've read a few reviews on here where people were complaining that a lot of the actors mumble in this & they were wondering if that's something the director planned on purpose. As someone who's met a few Natives, I can tell you it was not done purposefully. That's just the way Natives talk when they do talk. They have low voices and very seldom are super chatty so they're usually quiet and tend to sound low & quiet. It's as simple as that. If you can't hear or can't understand, get subtitles or turn up your TV. Simple. Overall I loved this film and would recommend to everyone to watch, but I do warn you it will break your heart to see what these people have to live like & what goes on in their world. I also want to say I'm relieved with how respectful this film is towards the Native community, and overall what a great job Taylor Sheridan did to tell this story with grace. 9/10",Wind River

693,kristianwashburn,Great Movie,10,7 May 2018,"Recently my boyfriend tricked me into watching the movie Wind River. I say tricked because I had seen a movie by the same writer/director, Taylor Sheridan, called Hell or High Water, and thoroughly hated it. I found Hell or High Water to be, plot wise, slow moving. Despite liking the actors none of the characters appealed to me or even really made me care about their story line. The end of the movie left me feeling ungratified and upset that I wasted two hours of my time. Hence my boyfriend having to bamboozle me. I am very glad he did though, because I ended up loving Wind River. Unlike Hell or High Water, I found Wind River's characters and plot to be captivating. Even though I have nothing in common with the characters I still found them relatable. Sheridan did an amazing job of making you feel connected to the characters almost immediately, and because of this I genuinely cared about these characters well-being. This care makes your heart pound, your palms sweat and has you siting on the edge of your seat for practically the entire movie. I don't think I relaxed once throughout the hour and fifty-one minutes of the movie. I was constantly jumping up and down in my seat and screaming at the television. In my opinion these are signs of a truly fantastic movie, it fully engages you and has you wrapped up in the experience. There is nothing worse than watching a movie and looking around the room to see that everyone on their phone. No one dared pick up their phone in Wind River, you didn't want to miss a single detail. 
 Sheridan was able to create this intense murder mystery even though the suspect pool was incredibly shallow. To add this, out of the two possible groups of people that could have committed this murder, he eliminates one of them very early in the film. So, for almost the entirety of the film you know deep down who did it. Sheridan does such an amazing job in the way he edits, the order in which he choices to tell this story that you almost don't even notice. You are enjoyably confused up until the climax of the film. 
 I told my Dad to watch this movie, and as much as he enjoyed it he found it very depressing. I agree the topic and central plot of this movie is incredibly sad, but I don't believe it defines the film. In my opinion the ending of a film is the most important part. The ending of a film is what people remember, it leaves a certain taste in people's mouths. There is nothing more disappointing then watching a brilliant film with a fantastic plot then having it end poorly. By end poorly I don't mean the ending was sad, I mean the ending had you walking away ungratified or even confused. If a film had a bad ending I don't only feel like I wasted my time but I feel like a good plot has been wasted. I found the ending of the Wind River to be so poetic and gratifying. It was so beautifully played out that I felt okay with the overall depressing theme of the film. I felt like there was a means to an end. That justice and good prevailed in the end. This is a personal feeling though, like I mentioned my Dad did not find the end nearly as gratifying thus leading him to define the film was overwhelmingly sad. 
 Overall Wind River had everything I personally love in a film and almost nothing I didn't. This film is very dark but its balanced beautifully. I think some true markers of a great film are if you would watch it again and would you recommend it to a friend? and to both these questions I would give Wind River a strong yes.",Wind River

A neo-western is a western style film which takes place in a contemporary setting. Wind River takes a look at how the law has failed the desolate society of those living on the Wind River Native American Reservation. Wind River follows Jane Banner, an FBI agent way out of her element in the harsh and unforgiving lands of Wyoming, and Cory Lambert, a local game tracker with a moral code rooted in the law of nature, on their hunt to investigate the murder of a girl on a Native American Reservation. Cory's character has lost his daughter in one of the worst ways possible. She simply vanished and never came back. The pain that Cory went through with the loss of his daughter is what cements his belief in the raw and cruel law of nature and is what drives him to help Jane and the family of the murdered girl find their own closure. Jane, however, comes from a world in which the law has worked for her and she trusts in its system. In order for Jane to survive in this new world, Jane has to let go of her old trust in the system, which she sees has failed those on the reservation, and eventually accept Cory's sense of justice. 
In Wind River, the reservation is far from any metropolitan influences which are a common locale in most Hollywood films; the audience instead looks at America through the lens of those forgotten by the safety and security of the government's law and how people have become influenced by the law of nature. The lawlessness of Wind River reflects the raw heart of old western's which Taylor Sheridan draws his inspiration from, but by putting it into a modern setting and focusing on the individual characters, their actions, and decisions; he makes it a much more real and convincing film. The audience starts off relating to the drive that Jane has to bring justice to the girl, but as the film progresses, it becomes clear that Jane's law cannot exist in this cold and uncaring world. Taylor Sheridan's adds transitional shots of the vast, cold, and sharp landscape of Wyoming to emphasize how small and outnumbered the people on the reservation are against the enormity of Mother Nature. 
 After the brutal shootout between the Wind River law enforcement and the private security guards, Cory tells Jane that he's going after Pete and that he doesn't plan on bringing him back. At this point, Jane accepts the way of law in this land and instead of trying to uphold her past view of justice she lets Cory deal with Pete in his own way. Cory kills Pete by giving him the same chance that he gave the girl, in the middle of nowhere, barefoot, and afraid. The audience views the death of Pete as a closing of the loop and is more satisfied with the result because in this world's law, he got what he deserved, even though his death would have been seen as unjust in the law's eye. This film highlights how when the law fails those who need protection, it is up to those individuals to step up and uphold their own sense of justice. The law makes sense for the audience that lives in a society where this law would protect them and keep them safe; however, for the people of the Wind River reservation, this law has failed them and in order to survive in their cold world, the law has to be abandoned and the rule of Nature accepted.",Wind River
699,uniqartem,Pleasantly surprised by the movie,9,27 September 2018,"Didn't know what to expect really going into the movie, just found it while i was browsing movies to watch. The cast seemed adequate , but upon seeing the film, i must say i have a newfound respect for Jeremey Renner. His performance was quietly powerful.
 He gave an earnest and calmly determined portrayal of a man set on helping to solve the mystery of the death of a young woman who turns out was a friend of his daughter, who he lost to a mysterious tragedy as well in recent past.
 Elizabeth Olsen was great in her role as the FBI agent called in to help investigate. 
She more than held her own and her casting alongside Renner seemed flawless.
 
ON a personal note, i will mention i watched this with a friend of mine who is actually native american, living in the midwest as well.
 THe fact that the movie's setting and plot was based around the the victim being a Native woman , supported by veteran Native american actors , smartly presenting and even noting quite plainly that missing native women go almost undocumented, bring to bear how the movie while still retaining great dramatic and suspenseful appeal, gives a plain insight into the plight that was and still is the painful legacy of natives today. 
 Great movie, overall.",Wind River
