0,Leofwine_draca,A disappointment,4,24 October 2021,"This looked good from the trailer but the film itself let me down. The script is poor and way too derivative and the over the top comedy is way out of place given the violence elsewhere. The story is too obviously copied from JOHN WICK and the substitution of the library for the hotel doesn't really work or feel legitimate. Some solid acting talent is present here but Karen Gillan has bitten off more than she can chew as the lead and her doubling is too obvious and too often. Some good fight choreography is lost between the over editing and over cutting. Overall, I expected more but didn't get it from this film.",Gunpowder Milkshake
1,SnoopyStyle,Jane Wick,7,21 July 2021,"Sam (Karen Gillan) is a professional assassin. 15 years earlier, she was left behind after her hitwoman mother Scarlet (Lena Headey) escaped from her boss Nathan (Paul Giamatti). Anna May (Angela Bassett), Madeline (Carla Gugino), and Florence (Michelle Yeoh) are Scarlet's former comrades. Sam has a new job from Nathan but she has a change of heart to save little Emily (Chloe Coleman).This is trying to be a female John Wick. It even has a neutral site. I love Gillan. Quite frankly, I love everyone here. I actually love the numb arm fight although I question how she pulls the trigger. I do have two problems. First, I would make young Sam the same age as Emily. There needs to be a parallel to heighten Sam's emotional connection. Also Sam is old enough there to leave Nathan and the life. She needs to be young enough to be dependent on him. Second and more important issue is the long running time. This type of movie needs to be 100 minutes at the maximum. The last 15 minutes start to drag. To be sure, this could be dismissed as a female John Wick movie but I choose to see it as a good thing.",Gunpowder Milkshake
2,Prismark10,Gunpowder Milkshake,5,1 August 2021,"Gunpowder Milkshake tries too hard to be a stylised female John Wick. It needed more inspiration instead of ripping off Hong Kong action movies.It also lacks the heavy duty gunfire of John Wick and the playfulness of Keanu Reeves.Sam (Karen Gillan) was abandoned by her hitwoman mother Scarlet (Lena Headey) some years earlier.The older Sam has followed in her mother's footstep by becoming an assassin for her boss Nathan (Paul Giamatti.)When a job goes wrong. Sam needs to look after a little girl and get help from three women who were her mother's comrades called the librariansThere are some nice touches such as the diner shootout. However the story is thin, the movie overlong and Michelle Yeoh is the real standout when it comes to action.",Gunpowder Milkshake
3,nogodnomasters,Don't worry about the bullets,8,22 July 2021,"Sam (Karen Gillan) is a hit person for ""The Firm"" abandoned by her mother (Lena Headey) who is also an assassin. Sam fills her mission, but in doing so takes out the son of a rival group that is ready to go to war. Her next assignment has a hiccup and she ends up on the lam with a little girl, hung out to dry. Sam seeks the help of the Librarians, a group of women who are also trained killers and whose function is a bit of a mystery.This was a fun film with good dialogue and soundtrack. It showed influence by Tarantino and elements of John Wick. I was disappointed that I didn't see a large painting of Bob Newhart in the library. Good film for those who don't take their action films too seriously.Guide: F-word. No sex or nudity.",Gunpowder Milkshake
4,kosmasp,This milkshake will kill the boys in the yard,9,17 October 2021,"I understand that certain things and beats do not work for everyone. And even if you are a fan of the actresses involved you may not be entirely convinced by what you see here. Especially if maybe your favorite female actress does not get enough screen time or something else you'd wish or don't get in the movie.Having said, the movie is funny and gory as can be. The direction and some of the ideas are quite mind boggling in only the best of senses. It's obvious where Navot was inspired by and there even jokes that go into the horror genre he began with (back then with Aharon as his directing buddy, now they both are doing their own stuff).Another great point is the child actress - she is quite pivotal and very important for the whole movie. She makes everything work - not just three quaters of the way - but all the way. There are hickups and certain things that may not feel entirely true to the nature of the movie, but you can have so much fun with this, why bother being upset with the flaws? Women power ftw (don't make it a gender issue! I think it's more than refreshing to see that switch myself, but above all this is a really good movie)",Gunpowder Milkshake
5,classicsoncall,"""Oh, that is so sweet. I'll try not to kill you too.""",7,16 July 2021,"Don't overthink it. That's the best advice I can give. Sure, there are a lot of things that don't make sense, but if you come to this looking for something cerebral, you're bound to be disappointed. The fight scene between the paralyzed Sam (Karen Gillan) and the three goons sent by Nathan (Paul Giamatti) will only prove that point. The clichéd dialog can be a distraction too, but it's spaced out fairly well enough to get by with. Me, I thought the title was a blast, and that's what brought me to the film. I wouldn't have expected anything more than a mindless action flick and got pretty much what I bargained for. Besides, any diner brawl backed up by Janis Joplin belting out 'Piece of My Heart' is going to win me over.",Gunpowder Milkshake
6,BA_Harrison,Not as tasty as it sounds.,5,1 August 2021,"Like its title, Gunpowder Milkshake comprises of two ingredients: OTT girl-power action and calculated coolness. The problem is that writer/director Navot Papushado only gives us a single scoop of each, and doesn't blend them together very well. A double-scoop of crazy action (actually, make that three scoops, heaped), thoroughly whisked together with several scoops of innovative style, and the results would have been much more tasty.Papushado borrows from action cinema old and new: assassin Sam's fashion sense is Meiko Kaji, circa Female Prisoner Scorpion (wide brimmed hat worn at an angle and long black coat), the action scenes are inspired by the likes of Tarantino and Woo, the music is pure Spaghetti Western, and the neon lighting is very John Wick (as is the story). Unfortunately, Papushado fails to stamp his own mark on the film, content to mimic others, delivering an unsatisfying pastiche rather than something new and bold to genuinely tantalise one's cinematic tastebuds.To be fair, a couple of scenes bristle with potential, but the choreography and execution let them down: Sam (Karen Gillan) dealing with several bad guys despite her arms being paralysed is a neat idea, but her enemies are far too cartoonish and spoil the effect; eight year old Emily (Chloe Coleman) steering Sam's Porsche during a chase scene is lacking in edge-of-the-seat thrills; a library makes for a great setting for a shoot-out, but the actual gun-play is disappointing (Carla Gugino firing a mini-gun is all too brief and the damage minimal); and a single-shot, linear tracking, slow-motion fight in a diner is technically impressive but quite dull to watch (with too much CGI blood) .Don't get me wrong - as a mindless piece of action fluff, this is entertaining enough for a one-time watch - and I've always got time for Gillan (even if she doesn't quite suit the role of bad-ass assassin), but I feel like the film falls short of being the delicious, thick, creamy, full-fat treat it should be (especially given the excellent cast, which also includes Angela Bassett, Lena Headey, Paul Giamatti and kung fu legend Michelle Yeoh).And, yes, there is a character sporting an eye patch.5.5/10, generously rounded up to 6 for IMDb.",Gunpowder Milkshake
7,paul_haakonsen,Highly enjoyable action movie...,7,23 July 2021,"Well, I must admit that I was having a bit of expectations to the 2021 movie with the odd title ""Gunpowder Milkshake"". Why? Well, simply given those that were on the cast list.I must say that I was definitely loving the movie's cover/poster, because it have that retro-feel to it. And that certainly helped sell the movie to me.""Gunpowder Milkshake"" is a great action movie, so thumbs up to writers Navot Papushado and Ehud Lavski for that accomplishment. And it was good entertainment from start to end.The storyline is good and well-written, offering a heap of action to the viewers, as well as some fair enough character development and character interactions thrown in between the action scenes. So I was definitely more than adequately entertained.Visually then ""Gunpowder Milkshake"" was just a blast. The fight scenes were well-choreographed and equally well executed on the screen. It was definitely a joy to watch those action scenes.And of course it should be noted that ""Gunpowder Milkshake"" had a fantastic ensemble of actors and actresses to portray the character and bring the story to life on the screen. With the likes of Angela Bassett, Michelle Yeoh, Carla Gugino, Lena Headey and Paul Giamatti, you know it's bound to be good. And I must admit that while I wasn't particularly familiar with lead actress Karen Gillan, then I will say that she definitely carried the movie quite well.""Gunpowder Milkshake"" is a great action movie, kept very much in the spirit of the 1990s action movies, especially those from Hong Kong. But yet, there was something cinema noir about the way the movie was filmed and the cinematography, which surely added a unique touch to the overall feel of it all.I was very entertained by director Navot Papushado's 2021 movie. My rating of ""Gunpowder Milkshake"" lands on a seven out of ten stars.",Gunpowder Milkshake

9,Calicodreamin,"Amazing cinematography, lacked in script",6,14 July 2021,"The cinematography was amazing, bringing the comic vibes with vibrant colors and exaggerated action. Seriously top notch. The storyline was pretty basic and lent itself to good action scenes. The lack was in the script, it was hokey and not in a good way. Acting felt stiff even though it was an all star cast, which was a bit of a let down.",Gunpowder Milkshake
10,FlashCallahan,Jane Wick.....,6,18 September 2021,"Sam was only 12 years old when her mother Scarlet, was forced to abandon her. Sam was raised by The Firm, the ruthless crime syndicate her mother worked for. Now, 15 years later, Sam has followed in her mother's footsteps and grown into a fierce hit-woman.When a high-risk job goes wrong, Sam must choose between serving The Firm and protecting the life of an innocent girl, Emily. With a target on her back, Sam has only one chance to survive: Reunite with her mother and her lethal associates.These three generations of women must now learn to trust each other, stand up to The Firm and their army of henchmen, and raise hell against those who will take everything from them.After a long time from being absent from screenplays and narrative, it seems that the wannabe Tarantino crowd have once again invaded cinemas with this, Uber stylish film, which is nothing more than a hodge-podge of other, much better films.That's not to say that the film is bad, it's quite entertaining, and the action set-pieces are a lot of fun.Gillan is very good in her role, but gets upstaged by the Librarians, and oodles of disposable bad guys with little quirks (Hello Quentin), which leaves Gillan a little redundant in some scenes.The first half is wonderfully silly, featuring a wonderful set piece in an emergency room for the more 'discerning' patient, which is genuinely mind blowing whilst it lasts.The final act foes for wall to wall action, and I was reminded of 'Face/off', the first Kingsman film, and of course John Wick 3, which this film owes a lot to.If you like very silly action films that go all out for no other reason than to be exploitative, then this is for you, as the action rarely holds up.But if you want something with a little more depth, that doesn't heavily reference other, better films, you may find this a little maundering.So all in all, it's by no means a bad thing, there are some genuinely good set-pieces, but you'll forget about it in no time..",Gunpowder Milkshake

You just can't take this serious.Because it has some funny situations in it, even slapstick style with the masked gangsters and the laughing gangsters. The laughing gangsters is really a funny and stupid situation and it works out really fine. Another thing that makes it really good is the slo-mo used as fighting is going on. Just watch the scene at the diner with the shoot-out.So after all, this is a pure over the top entertaining shake full of action, a good story, excellent score, nice effects and editing. So weird nobody is talking about this one.Gore 2,5/5

12,siderite,Spectacularly bad,4,15 July 2021,"This might just be one of those movies to watch drunk. Haven't done that in a while, so I can't tell. I can already picture some soulless suit somewhere saying ""all we need to do is make a John Wick, but with girls! Cha-ching!"". And while the over the top mannerisms and slow motion scenes of very cool people doing something really ordinary and even part of the script are extremely similar, this film is a complete letdown.Why? Let's compare, shall we?John Wick kills everybody because of one reason: his love for his dead wife and hate for the people who killed his only connection to her. Plus Keanu is a PETA supporter, so it was the obvious thing to do. Why does Samantha kill? Because she picked a random little girl to save and some people thought she was out of line and started hunting her. Every scene after that it's like this girl is the most important thing in the world to her, even if she just met her.Who does John Wick kill? Armies of nameless henchmen, obviously, but it is necessary to get to his goal. Many people help him, as they are a support network for paid assassins and also contacts he has cultivated in the past. Who does Sam kill? Men. They are stupid, brutal, violent, lecherous, cruel, disloyal and self destructive. And the reason is that they are trying to kill her, but also, look at them, who would miss them? And she is helped by her mother who lived next door for fifteen years without contacting her and her arms dealing ""aunts"" which she also hasn't seen for fifteen years and could maybe not even remember them. Certainly they don't recognize her.How does John Wick kill? With style. He is efficient, unstoppable and looks good doing it. How does Sam kill? Awkwardly, always remaining out of ammo, always almost getting killed by low level thugs or tricked by random people and always trying to make a joke out of it.I could continue on and on and on. The only reason for this gender swapped abomination is money. It's not political agenda or intersectional feminism or anything else. It's a femsploitation movie and it does it badly, too. I would say shame to whoever came up with the concept, but I don't expect them to know what that is. Instead, I say shame to all actresses who accepted to act in this horrid piece of dung.Bottom line: Karen Gillan wasn't picked for Guardians of the Galaxy because she could kick ass, but because she looked good, she has that angry Scottish look if she tries and because no one actually expected the movie to fare well. They didn't choose her because she was a good fighter and perfect for an action hero. And it shows in this film. She looks like she's not really sure why she's there. And I know all the actors were in it for the money, but I've seen every one of them in good movies where they gave their all and made the world a better place. Shameful display, people, shameful!",Gunpowder Milkshake
13,cherold,stylish and wildly entertaining,8,3 September 2021,"In the uber-stylish, super-violent Gunpowder Milkshake, Karen Gillan plays a jaded hit woman with a tragic past who finds herself trying to save a little girl with the eventual help of a bunch of tough women.This is all an excuse for a little comedy, and little drama, and a whole bunch of beautifully choreographed and absolutely insane fight scenes. Some of these are as entertainingly gimmicky as a Jackie Chan fight, most notably when Karen is given an unlikely drug that paralyzes her arms while leaving the rest of her unaffected, resulting in a whole bunch of whacky moves.It's not remotely realistic, with its over-done gun library and the sort of unending series of unfaltering henchmen you see in a videogame, but it's funny and fun and has some wild slo-mo battles that are as precise as clockwork.I don't understand why it's only got a 6 average here; I'm torn between 8 and 9. Highly recommended, and well worthy of a sequel.",Gunpowder Milkshake
14,Cineanalyst,Shoot-'Em-Up Junk Food,5,19 July 2021,"It tells you what it is within the first few minutes--nay, it tells you in the title, ""Gunpowder Milkshake"": it's a confection of cartoony violence. If you want a character-development, story-driven salad, eat elsewhere. So, the only question remains, are the fight scenes well choreographed and stylized? Good enough to be of mild amusement, I say. A neon-lit color scheme, an established cast, ironic detachment to the point of gunplay with paralyzed arms against wounded others who are also intoxicated by laughing gas and a child drives during a car chase, and a good mix of elongated one-shots and choppy cutting. Much like a sugary ice cream dairy concoction followed by more sugary dairy with a bowl of cavity-causing cereal, it's fun while it lasts. I wouldn't recommend a steady diet of it, but, once in a while, why not.This feminine ""John Wick"" is what I wish a picture such as ""Ava"" (2020) had been, speaking of redheaded female assassins taking on their former, blandly-named employers--the ""Management,"" the ""Firm,"" whatever. In a way, it even beats all the wasted time on franchise world building in other Karen Gillan action flicks, of the Marvel Cinematic Universe and Jumanji kind. Ditto Lena Headey, of ""Game of Thrones"" fame, too. I mean, get to the dragons, already. If anything, ""Gunpowder Milkshake"" wastes too much time on exposition, as well. And, featuring one of the brawls in a library seems rather condescending for a movie that employs the novels of female authors as props. Regardless, it's not until the security-camera footage that the action movie proper truly gets under way, and then it's time to sit back and stuff the face with popcorn as the eye candy unfolds. You can worry about exercise, mental or physical, afterwards. If you decide to take the librarian's advice, Agatha Christie's ""The Murder of Roger Ackroyd"" is novel.",Gunpowder Milkshake

16,tabuno,A Notch Above Average Diversting Assassin Thriller,7,17 July 2021,"Karen Gillan of Dr. Who fame stars in this action thriller hitman genre. With a strong cast including Angela Bassett, Michelle Yeoh, Paul Giamatti, Carla Gugino, and Lena Headey, this mostly light-hearted playfulness takes from the John Wick (2014) formula and adds a distinct film noir flavor mixed in with Kill Bill (2003) sweetness. Gillan gets to continue to break away from her more spacy adventures from Dr. Who and distinguish herself as a sensitively hardened, estranged daughter character turned killer. As is typical of female-driven movies, there is more emotional connecting scenes and somewhat less action with a sort of somewhat less dramatic, melancholic Jessic Jones (2014) lead. The ending scenes are a bit lazy with a few characters sporting high-powered weapons against many characters sporting much less so weapons as well as the ultimatum threat to conveniently tie up loose ends. Overall, Gunpower Milkshake is a notch above average, a diverting entertainment piece that has few creative new features that add to the genre.",Gunpowder Milkshake
17,The-Sarkologist,One Awesome Ride,8,3 August 2021,"Plenty of people have said it already, and I'm basically going to add to the many people who have already said it and that this film is a feminine version of John Wick, and it doesn't pretend to be anything other than that, which is why it is pretty good. However it goes much further than that to actually be a lot more tongue in cheek as well, something that John Wick wasn't. Okay, from what I can remember, you do get some laughs in John Wick, but this one is much more so. Well, okay, more chuckles than laughs, but it also has a much more comic book feel about it as well. Oh, and it is pretty good, certainly a film to watch if you like the John Wick franchise.I could give you a run down of the plot, but there isn't much to say in that regards, other than our protagonist being a hit woman working for an organisation known as The Firm. Oh, her mother disappeared when she was a teenager, but she ended up following her in her footsteps. However, she is told that she needs to go and get some money that was stolen from the firm, but it turns out that it was stolen because an accountant's daughter was kidnapped by some thugs (though the film does a good job at making you think that there is some organisation behind them, only to reveal that they are basically some thugs, though there is a suggestion that they do know who they are stealing from, considering the elaborate set up that they have arranged).Another interesting aspect of this film is their use of sugary products. That also adds quite a nice twist to the film. Most films the protagonist usually drinks alcohol and smokes, but not with Gunpowder Milkshake. When she gets home after a successful job she doesn't reach for the spirits but rather she goes to the fridge and pulls out a tub of icecream and starts eating from it. Not only that but instead of going into a bar she goes into a diner, and instead of ordering a coffee (or spirits) she orders a milkshake, and a pretty elaborate one at that.That certainly does build up the feminine aspect of the film, and adds to the quirks that make up the characters. They also have an armoury, but it is in a library, and the guns are all hidden in books. In fact, if one pays careful attention, one will notice that all of the books are written by female authors, and are also books that tend to be read by females. Sure, books holding guns is nothing new, but they tend to be hidden in Bibles (namely because nobody actually reads the Bible, but also because nobody actually checks a Bible either, which is why they tend to be used to smuggle stuff).One could suggest that this movie is about a group of women struggling to survive in a male dominated world, and of course all of the antagonists are men, and all of the protagonists are women. Then again, that is a little too cut and dry for this film. Sure, all of the protagonists are women, that is true, but you can't necessarily suggest that all of the antagonists are men - it isn't as cut and dry as that, but they do all seem to come across as untrustworthy. Of course, one of the men does do what he can to protect our protagonist, and he does claim that there is little that he can do once she has alienated herself from The Firm. Mind you, she doesn't seem to buy his rubbish.The interesting thing is that the film has left itself open for a possible sequal (which has been confirmed), namely because the people that she deals with aren't The Firm, but rather another organisation that she has upset because she has basically killed the leader's son. However, it is clear that the film does have a lot of influence, and they are able to allow or prevent this group from going after their targets.There is a lot to this film that makes it quirky, and in a way it does remind me of some of the French films that I have seen in the past, though it actually seems to be a German film, despite it being filmed entirely in English, and basically staring a mix of English and American actors. I suspect that this was done to appeal to a much wider audience, namely because Americans (and others) tend not to watch films with subtitles because, well, they are thinking films, and the general audience tend not to like thinking films. Oh, it was also directed by an Israeli director, so this is probably why the film happens to have so many quirks.Yeah, this film is actually pretty good, and it certainly well worth checking out, especially if you like the John Wick style, but with a lot more quirks.",Gunpowder Milkshake

19,cruise01,Cheesy action flick but flat story and characters.,5,5 October 2021,2.5 out of 5 stars.Gunpowder Milkshake is a pretty bad action film. That tries to be the next female version of John Wick. With Karen Gillian being the next action heroine assassin. The cast ensemble is great. Except the script is flat with the characters that makes them forgettable. The story is a cliche assassin story that has been told before. An assassin is burnt from the company she works for. And now every assassin is after her.The direction is cheesy. The music score is annoying and borin. The action sequences is plenty but it is all mindless shoot em up action that is forgotten once it is over.,Gunpowder Milkshake

There are some really good and some solid female assassin movies around (Salt, Kill Bill, Anna, Hanna, Léon: The Professional, Atomic Blonde, Point of No Return just to mention a few) but unfortunately, Gunpowder Milkshake does not belong to them. This little flick is a redundant, forgettable piece, a series of already known scenes and ideas, and even the solid working cast can't save or disguise the generic story. Again the incompetence of the writing staff is to blame for a missed opportunity. Anyway, some action scenes are fun, so I wouldn't call Gunpowder Milkshake a total failure.",Gunpowder Milkshake

Wonderful pastiche of the old gangsta cliches. Terrific tarantesque music score. Original screenplay and terrific dialogues. The goodies just keep on coming, honestly!Not anything bad? This is as playful, witty and original as it can possibly get. I honestly cant think of any bad. Well if you are a dude, who doesnt like to see men get wacked by women, then you might wanna skip this female empowered movie.

24,Vartiainen,Uneven mix of great style and ideas mixed with shoddy execution,6,23 September 2021,"Gunpowder Milkshake focuses on Sam (Karen Gillan), a lethal hitwoman working for The Firm. But then a job goes sideways - they so often do - and she's forced to flee for her life as her old employers are now gunning for her.I like a couple of things in this film a lot. First of all, it's very nice to see Karen Gillan getting a leading role in an action film. She definitely has the chops for it and she sells her role well, being able to seem unstoppable while at the same time remaining identifiable and entertaining.Second of all, the neon coloured pop culture world created for this film is effortlessly cool and I'd like to see a slew of movies taking place in it. Think bubblegum John Wick and you're not far off.Alas, the story of the film could have been better. More specifically, it seems unfocused. For example, there are these three women running a library while also smuggling guns and whatnot. Very cool idea. Superb idea! Barely focused on. The whole movie is like that. Cool ideas not given their due.There's also a character, who we thought had already left the film for good, that comes back. Can't really talk about it too much without spoilers, but suffice to say, I was not a fan of them returning. Took too much spotlight away from Sam.Gunpowder Milkshake is worth a watch for its good parts, but unfortunately its bad parts keep it from being an honestly good film.",Gunpowder Milkshake

But I had fun watching it, the film is never a dull moment, has fun with itself, never tries to be real, and if you're not willing to suspend a serious of disbelieve, then your not probably not gonna enjoy this film.The filmmakers where inspired by Hong Kong action director John Woo, and some Quentin Tarantino style mixed in. Karen Gillan does play badass with a heart of gold to perfection, Leana Hedley, Angela Basset, Michele Yeoh, and Carla Gugino. All seem to be having a blast making this. It's made.in the style like a graphic novel, all the colors stand out in each scene. Action scenes are well shot, and shoot out scenes are also fun to watch, don't go into this movie expecting high art, but just an enjoyable ride nothing more.",Gunpowder Milkshake
26,alindsay-al,An Above Average Fun Film,6,17 September 2021,"This film made its way to Sky today and I have had the chance to watch Gunpowder Milkshake and here is my review for it. The premise of the film sees an assassin go on the run in an attempt to save a young girls life.Main Character
Karen Gillan plays Sam the lead character in the film and I think she does a really good job in the role. She plays the tough action hero well and she is clearly having fun in her role and enjoying doing maybe something a bit different then what she is used to at the current moment. In films like this one you need to be able to root for the protagonist and I felt like I could root for Sam in this film and that made it rise above some of its weaker material.Supporting Characters
Lena Headey plays her mother and she is decent but she doesn't exactly play a huge role in the film. When they are on screen together I thought they had good chemistry together and managed to squeeze the most out of their time together. Young actress Chloe Coleman played Emily and I really liked the dynamic between her and Gillan, the film really gets going once she is introduced and the banter between the two characters is done pretty effectively. Michelle Yeoh, Angela Bassett and Carla Gugino do decent jobs, though there characters aren't exactly that interesting and it feels like there is more that can be done there. I mean the film wastes Paul Giamatti and makes him this generic and that leads to the bad guys who just aren't very threatening and they feel like they could have come out of any action movie of the last few years.Story
The story isn't clearly the focus of the film but I thought the film did well in creating an interesting and likeable protagonist. Plus I thought the character interactions between Gillan, Headey and Coleman are entertaining and actually do a quite effective job. But as I said the focus is not on the plot here and the film is utter nonsense and it feels like just an excuse for explosions. I have no problem with that but it becomes way too convoluted with its villains and it feels like the film would have been more effective if it had less antagonists but actually gave them something that made them stood out and interesting.Script
The script is okay, there is some little bit of funny banter and heart in the film but it just isn't enough. The script is just average, nothing amazing and nothing terrible and that kind of fits this film.Style
The film has some pretty decent action films that are very hard hitting and bloody that you will have plenty of fun with. But the pacing is a bit off here, it takes 30 minutes for the first action scene and I was slightly bored before then, but then it has action non stop for what feels like 20 mins and it never hits a happy medium.Overall
Overall, Gunpowder Milkshake is an above average fun film. If you have 2 hours of spare time then maybe give this one a go but I wouldn't rush to watch this film.",Gunpowder Milkshake

33,IonicBreezeMachine,"Not a great first impression, but stick with it and it recovers.",6,16 July 2021,"Sam (Karen Gillan) an assassin for the criminal syndicate, The Firm, takes a mission from The Firm's HR head, Nathan (Paul Giamatti), to retrieve money stolen by one of their accountants. When Sam encounters and kills the accountant she finds the money was stolen to pay a ransom for his daughter, Emily (Chloe Coleman). Sam against the advice of Nathan takes the money to try and rescue Emily and leading The Firm to sever ties with Sam and alert rival criminal Jim McAlester (Ralph Ineson) that Sam was behind the mission that killed his son. Now hunted by both The Firm and McAlester's men Sam and Chole must now turn to Chloe's estranged mother, Scarlet (Lena Headey) if they hope to survive the night.A French/German co-production, Gunpowder Milkshake is the latest film from cult Israeli filmmaker Navot Papushado better known for his horror films Big Bad Wolves and Rabies. The movie is well within the realm of Studiocanal and The Picture Company's wheelhouse following similar Euro financed action pieces such as the Liam Neeson films Non-Stop, The Commuter, and Cold Pursuit. In Gunpowder Milkshake's case it goes for a more sardonic approach to its well-trodden ""burned assassin"" material and for the most part succeeds.When the movie starts it doesn't make the best impression with a rather head scratching decision to not show two action sequences in its first 25 minutes that are set up but in one's case it's not shown, and in the other we ""hear"" the action but its obscured because the camera is at a closeup on a character's face. I'm honestly not sure why they did this for their introduction to the movie but it creates a stumbling block for itself that it has to recover from. The movie also has problems establishing tone in its opening act with strange quirks exaggerated in the style and characters that are honestly fairly head scratching. Luckily, once we're past the rather clumsy first act the movie gets much more sure footed.When Chloe Coleman enters the film as Emily at the beginning of the second act the movie finds its identity as a quirky, surreal, violent buddy film with a dark sense of humor. There's some really cleverly staged sequences such as the identity concealing costumes the kidnappers wear that can be appreciated on a ""Universal"" level (it'll make sense once you see it) and there's a fun sequence where Sam has to teach Chloe to drive her bulletproof car which leads to a unique take on the standard and familiar parking garage scenario that perfectly blends the humor and action elements. The movie does try to create a sort of dysfunctional surrogate family dynamic among the characters and for the most part it works reasonably well, but three characters played by Angela Basset, Michelle Yeoh, and Carla Gugino I felt were too similar and really felt like the same character copied and pasted across three different actresses and could've benefitting by maybe being scaled back to one or two. The movie also does run a bit long at roughly an hour and 50 minutes and a big reason for that is the rather unimpressive first act, and a library sequences that while well staged does go on a bit longer than it should.Gunpowder Milkshake isn't groundbreaking but it's well made and an impressive showcase for its talented cast and director. While it stumbles coming out of the gate and maybe could have been trimmed by about 15 or twenty minutes, Gunpowder Milkshake is ultimately worth watching thanks to a talented cast, well staged action, and humor that hits more than it misses.",Gunpowder Milkshake

39,Movi3DO,Fun and feminist,7,16 July 2021,"Girls Power TimeBrand new action thriller on Netflix where an assassin teamed up with associates to take down a crime syndicate while saving an 8 year old girl.The biggest power in this movie was its all-female protagonists killing a bunch of men. The acting was solid for all of them, even though no one stood out. They all looked cool, badass, and did well in the action scenes.The fight choreography was no John Wick level, but still plenty of fun. One unique action scene was when the assassin character had to fight three other guys with both her hands paralyzed. It's creative and funny. Some of the fights weren't realistic, and an example was a scene where the 8 year old girl handled the car wheel while the assassin pressed the brake and gas. There was no way that an 8 year old could park the car perfectly. It's fun but exaggerated.The story was nothing special. I have seen the plot a bunch of times before. However, I did like the style of the movie, which was old school but cool.The relationships were problematic. I didn't feel the tight bonds between the main assassin and her mother and the 8 year old girl. This was mostly affected by the predictability of the story and characters.A nitpick that I had was that a character got injected in one arm that temporarily paralyzed her hand. For some reason, both her hands were paralyzed while she could move her body. That didn't make any sense and bugged me throughout the action scene.Overall, a fun action with a great cast despite its predictable plot. 6.5/10.",Gunpowder Milkshake

41,SoumikBanerjee25,Oh God! I tried so hard to like this.,4,23 July 2021,"When the trailer arrived at Youtube, I got pretty excited; not just because it supposedly had similar vibes to John Wick (Which I'm a huge fan of) but also the cast looked oddly promising. Little did I know, I was about to get nothing but a big pile of disappointments.Trust me, I tried hard; I made legitimate efforts to like it, but I couldn't. This is bad execution at just about everything. Whether it be Characterization, the layout of the Narrative, or the much important emotions; it all fell flat!However, from a technical perspective; this was no slouch! 'Gunpowder Milkshake' has its redeeming qualities in the self-evident Cinematic representation and in some of its prolific Action Choreography. Coupled with its enticing stylization; gotta admit, this was a sight for sore eyes. In the meantime, the Score played an important part too.When it comes down to Performances, things aren't bad either. Karen Gillian, Lena Headey did reasonably well in their respective spaces. You know what? Had the Writing been a wee bit favorable; this whole Mother-Daughter dynamic could have actually paid off. What a pity, It wasn't meant to be!Let me be very clear, I don't have any issues with women being portrayed as invincible, unbeatable badasses nor do I have any objections regarding story ideas that are being recycled time and time again; It's just that the Script here feels so bland and all the missed opportunities cannot be overlooked!",Gunpowder Milkshake
42,SameirAli,Create Original.,6,25 October 2021,"Gunpowder Milkshake is kind of lady version of John Wick, that's the biggest problem with the film. It doesn't feel original at all. Film like Kill Bill, Tomb Raider etc were so original (at least in it's own space).

43,MrDHWong,"A stylised, albeit uneven onslaught of bullets and knife fights that should entertain fans of these types of films",7,22 July 2021,"""Gunpowder Milkshake"" is an action thriller directed and co-written by Navot Papushado. Starring Karen Gillan in the lead role, along with Lena Headey, it is a stylised, albeit uneven onslaught of bullets and knife fights that should entertain fans of these types of films.After a hit goes wrong, assassin Scarlet (Lena Headey) is forced to go on the run, abandoning her young daughter Sam in the process. Fifteen years later, Sam (Karen Gillan) now works as a hitwoman for the same firm as her mother, taking odd jobs for reasonable prices. One day, Sam is given an assignment by her boss Nathan (Paul Giamatti) that requires her to take out a man who stole a large sum of money from the firm. As things start to escalate, Sam soon becomes entangled in a new objective involving her protecting the man's 8-year-old daughter Emily (Chloe Coleman) from a rival group of assassins who are now hunting both of them down.It seems ever since ""John Wick"" was released all the way back in 2014 that there have been an abundance of films trying to emulate its stylistic vision. A recent example of this is the Bob Odenkirk-led ""Nobody"", which actually shares the same screenwriter as the ""Wick"" films. ""Gunpowder Milkshake"" also follows a similar pattern here, except this time it swaps out the male lead with a female one. Right down to the very same plot elements like a gun-toting hero, the Russian mafia, and old acquaintances who happen to be weapons experts, the film happily wears such familiarity with pride, delivering a fun action flick that will keep enthusiasts of this genre satisfied for the most part.Unoriginal or not, there's no denying this refreshing change of pace by watching our female hero do all the dirty work here, ploughing through hordes of bad guys using a combination of guns, knives, and hand-to-hand combat. Unlike John Wick, who is infamous within the seedy criminal underbelly, or Hutch Mansell from ""Nobody"", who is generally an unimportant figure, our heroine Sam is somewhat in between these two. She has some notoriety but not yet enough to instil fear in her adversaries, which makes her a competent middle ground protagonist for a film like this. What kept me invested in the story was my curiosity to see how far her character would develop as the story progressed, as it often seemed as though things could have gone either way. Without spoiling it, I was quite happy to see how things ended up for her at the film's conclusion.Visually, the film appears to be going for a hybrid of both 1960s Americana and Noir. This is especially noticeable during scenes set within an old diner, where of course milkshakes are served, and in a neon-lit bowling alley, where a prominent fighting set piece takes place between silhouetted combatants. Here, director Navot Papushado uses a combination of vibrant, colourful foregrounds with muted, dark backgrounds to help the characters to stand out, and in doing so, the film looks very much like graphic novel come to life. His use of symmetry is also worth mentioning, which made one scene in a criminal hospital feel so much more exciting to watch. As to be expected, the film is also very violent, with plenty of blood, gore, and creative death scenes that wouldn't seem out of place in the aforementioned ""John Wick"" films. These are later punctuated with some mildly amusing comic relief to help alleviate the severity of some of the film's most brutal moments. However, I do think the film suffers from a weak first act, which didn't exactly grab my attention right away. The opening scene, which involves Sam performing a hit, is immediately followed by a flashback that attempts to establish her tragic backstory right away. I couldn't help but feel this flashback should have come later in the film after we have gotten to know her better as a character. Instead, we get too much expository information thrown at us and are expected to absorb it all before we've even had a chance to hear her speak a full sentence.In her first lead performance in an action film, Karen Gillan gives quite a convincing portrayal of the one-woman army that is Sam. Aside from her supporting roles as Nebula in the Marvel Cinematic Universe and Ruby Roundhouse in the recent Jumanji films, Gillan hasn't really had much opportunity to show off her physical talents as a character like this, at least not as the main star. She plays Sam as someone who isn't afraid to take lives if the situation calls for it but is also shown to have a nurturing, motherly side when caring for young Emily. Moments like this helped ensure that Sam isn't simply a genderswapped John Wick and stands on her own as a completely original creation. I liked her scenes with Lena Headey as Sam's mother Scarlet, especially during their shared shootouts with the bad guys. Even though there is only a 14-year age gap between Gillan and Headey, you can definitely feel the mother-daughter warmth that comes with their onscreen interactions. The two of them make a great team and if a sequel is ever made, I hope to see more of them together.As yet another film in the vein of the ""John Wick"" series, ""Gunpowder Milkshake"" still has some surprises that may catch seasoned viewers off guard. Though it doesn't really break new ground as far as the genre goes, it still offers fun, no-holds-barred action thanks to Karen Gillan in the main role. It's hard to say right now if Gillan has a future in films like this, but I like to think she has already proven herself worthy of standing among the ranks of other noteworthy action stars, at least until the next ""Wick"" influenced film comes along.I rate it 7/10.",Gunpowder Milkshake
44,CANpatbuck3664,Mostly Sizzle but There's Just Enough Steak,7,24 August 2021,"Instead of going for grounded and more realistic action fare, Gunpowder Milkshake tries to bridge the gap between the stylized and the grit. The movie has a neon glow with the cinematography, the action scenes hit hard but they're all scored to pop music and there's more than a few jokes between gunshots and stabbings. The movie kept jumping between too much and just right with the over-the-top humour and goofy tone. I ended up having fun so I'll concede that it ended up working but there were many times I was ready to just throw in the towel. Sometimes you have to pick a lane and Gunpowder Milkshake borders on being too cute for its own good.Casting Karen Gillan as our protagonist is an easy way to earn some good will. She's a fan favourite (I loved her as Nebula in the Guardians movies) and despite her being so buttoned up and serious here, she gets across what's needed in her performance. There's just enough empathy and a very subtle jokey vibe underneath her stone faced demeanour and along with her work with the action, she gave a good performance. Lena Headey ducks in and out of the movie but she's well utilized as Scarlet and I liked her chemistry with Karen. Angela Bassett, Michelle Yeoh and Carla Gugino were fun portraying the Librarians, but I sometimes couldn't distinguish how tongue-in-cheek their performances were. Were they playing it straight or did they intentionally mean to make me chortle with their delivery? They're all pros and they all did their part. I also liked that Paul Giamatti held back a little as Nathan, in another movie he's twirling a moustache and screaming at henchman but they had the sense to avoid those tropes. Chloe Coleman also did a decent job as Sam's ""apprentice"" Emily.The action does bring the pain here and I winced or shuddered a few times while watching this. The tonal inconsistency does rear its ugly head a few times, one of the set pieces at the hospital plays like a demented cartoon and while it was intentionally trying to be funny, it just didn't work for me like the movie wanted it to. The decision making of the villains and their henchman didn't help matters either. The shootout in the library probably worked the best for me and a lot of that was the creativity baked into that set piece. I'd still give it a reluctant thumbs up, Gunpowder Milkshake didn't blow my mind but it fulfilled the contract.My rating on this movie fluctuated a lot at different moments in the run time. There are elements to boast about here, there's a great cast, the required thrills are here and there was a concerted effort to try to do something different with the cinematography and the set design. But on the other hand, I couldn't decide if it wanted to be a parody of John Wick (there's more than a few parallels) or if it was supposed to be a genuine action drama and my attention and suspension of belief drifted in and out constantly. This is a case where I'm going to give it the benefit of the doubt, there's a nice theme of girl power and if you're in the mood for a violent and stylish action romp, Gunpowder Milkshake capably will fill that need. I think its worth streaming if you're interested.",Gunpowder Milkshake
45,trinaboice,Bloodbath with a feminine touch,6,17 July 2021,"Movie Review: Gunpowder MilkshakeIN A NUTSHELL:
Gunpowder Milkshake is an upcoming action-thriller film directed by Navot Papushado. He's an Israeli director who clearly loves movies by Quentin Tarantino. The film's producers are Alex Heineman and Andrew Rona.The premise follows a secret organization of female assassins which has 3 generations of women, who fight to stop impending violence...using violence.THINGS I LIKED:
The title definitely lives up to its name.The cast of leading ladies is impressive: Karen Gillan, Lena Headey, Carla Gugino, Angela Bassett, and Michelle Yeoh. Unfortunately, many of their talents are wasted.Fun fact: there is only a 14-year age difference between Karen Gillan and Lena Headey who play daughter and mother.Fun fact #1: Karen Gillen says her favorite treat is a milkshake! I love her in the Marvel Cinematic Universe in GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY
Chloe Coleman is so great. She crushed it in My Spy where she was able to really show her talents. Unfortunately, she's not able to do much more than be a frightened little girl in this story, although she does it very well.I also adore Paul Giamatti in everything he does. Sadly, he's also underutilized.The entire cast looked like they had a blast making this crazy movie.There are a lot of great action set pieces.There is an incredibly violent and bloody action sequence in the diner toward the end of the movie that is an impressive one-cut masterpiece. It feels like a ballet, beautifully choreographed.The stunt work is impressive.The humor is dark and very funny at times.If you love this movie, you'll be happy to know that a sequel is already in the works!I laughed at all of the metaphors for firearms.I got a kick out of the colorful neon palette.There are outlandish moments that make it feel like a video game.THINGS I DIDN'T LIKE:
The tone is uneven, taking the viewer on an expected bloodbath of a ride. It's unexpected if you haven't seen the red trailer for this extremely violent flick. If you like and can handle John Wick, then you'll be prepared for this movie.We don't really get to know any of the characters. The plot only takes us on a journey at surface level.Is this what feminism has given us? We're simply replacing violent action movies with vicious men with cliched female characters. In woke Hollywood, all female characters are morally superior, while all of the male characters are idiots.The movie trailer gives away some of the big moments in the movie.There are a lot of cliched moments.TIPS FOR PARENTS:
This is NOT appropriate for kids.TONS of bloody violence...as in there is a ton of blood and a ton of violence!Lots of profanity and F-bombs.As a university professor, I appreciate the literary aspect of this story. (wink)You can see my full review on my Movie Review Mom YouTube channel!",Gunpowder Milkshake

Like its absurde but funny title, the movie has its fair share of ""wtf"" moments but if you do not overthink it, its very easy to have fun with it. Karen Gillian is very good in action roles and she has the right charisma to carry us trough what is a pretty standard run of the mill story seen a million times before, exept this time put in a heavily inspired by John Wick assassin's world and setting.Its overall well acted, well directed, have good production value, personally its just what i enjoy from action movies and i totally recommand it.",Gunpowder Milkshake

48,ethanbresnett,Disappointing but just about entertaining enough,6,20 September 2021,"I really wanted to like this film as I love Karen Gillan and Lena Headey, but it really missed the mark and was a big let down.The plot was as generic as they come really. An assassin working for a shady organisation does a job that goes south and then gets hunted by her own people. It's a story that's been told dozens of times and it wasn't done particularly well in Gunpowder Milkshake.The dialogue was shaky, the characters relatively bland, and the pacing too slow. Attempts to inject an emotional core into the film through the mother daughter relationship largely failed, and the side characters of the 'librarians' could have been great but were poorly executed.I was also left disappointed by the action. There were occasional glimpses of brilliance (a scene where Gillan's character is semi-incapacitated was a real highlight, as were some of the final sequences), but for the most part it was pretty generic.In fairness I did love the aesthetic and style of the film. It had a lovely colour palette and brilliant sets, but this wasn't enough to earn Gunpowder Milkshake redemption.A let down considering the great cast, but worth a watch if you are into action films.",Gunpowder Milkshake

Even when it did I felt myself wanting to fast forward through the tedious girl fight scenes. It was like this movie was in another world with it's own set of rules that didn't apply to our own. Then the mother daughter relationship was sketchy at best. You never quite knew if they gave two $***$ about each other or not. So if you like movies with magical scenario's and mixed emotions then this is a movie for you. I enjoy a bit more gore, but that is just me.",Gunpowder Milkshake

It has a lot of artsy direction and blood but the plot was written by a 12 year old. There are things that make no sense at all but you are just suppose to go with it.

53,Lebowskidoo,Shake Shake Bang Bang,8,17 August 2021,"Gunpowder Milkshake is a super-stylized, ultra-violent, all-female action movie, another Netflix production unceremoniously pushed into view. It's very entertaining due to its relentless pacing and a few moments of inspired creativity.I just wish there had been more substance and more depth for the characters. Am I overanalyzing what was merely designed to be an all-gal shoot 'em up? It borrows heavily from Smokin' Aces, Kill Bill, John Wick and, yes, Shoot 'Em Up. It doesn't worry about getting too original. It's enjoyable, just oh so similar. Milkshakes are tasty but even better if they're well shaken.",Gunpowder Milkshake
54,cgvsluis,"Great images, fun concepts, could use some better choreography on the fight scenes.",4,15 October 2021,"I loved the cinematography in this film, the retro colors, the great film noir lighting, and the retro sets from the diner to the hotel room.There were some beautiful touches. I loved Sam's raincoat and rain hat...it made for some great looks, especially when you can't see her eyes. The library and librarians were fantastic! I loved the concept, the books, and the decor...like the gorgeous trick door lion in the painting. The underground doctor/dentist was a nice touch and the lighting in the bowling alley was great.My one complaint is the choreography of the bowling alley fight...it was terrible and very unrealistic. The second fight scene with the same group, while equally unrealistic at least added humor which made it more enjoyable to watch. I appreciated that a group of bad guys used classic horror villain masks. The high rise office of the firm with it's city view and snifters of brandy, whiskey or scotch was so stereotypical that it worked perfectly for the film.It did not escape my attention that all the men, including the firm, are bad whereas all of the women are good.""I'm eight and three quarters,""-Emily.If you are a woman and pissed of at a man or men the big gun battle/fight at the end may feel very satisfying.

This was uncut popcorn fun. A straight to the point assassin with a heart save the little girl from the bad guys cliche film with a decent cast. Good action, not to bad a story and like I said, decent actors. Nothing to write home about because the story has been done a million times over. But to call it bad with bad acting is a simply not true to say the least. This was a Saturday afternoon action flick that keeps your attention from start to finish.

56,daisukereds,What a boring movie..,3,19 July 2021,"From the looks of the trailer, I had high expectations. But sadly, I was disappointed.From the highly noticeable Sherlock Holmes-like music at the start and over-use of other hits during most action scenes.. to the visible exertion to attempt to replicate the style of John Wick movies. And it doesn't come close. The action is too simplistic, and the shots are flat at times (if anything, the inconsistency between decent action and bad one is distracting). It's a cross between realistic and childish. The use of pointless slow-motion is one of the worst things in movies. All in all, it lacks oomph, energy and originality. It also takes itself too seriously, coming off comical and silly.Karen Gillan delivers her lines in a rather boring way.. just like a robot. I get that it's part of the character, but wow, it's charmless!The rest of the cast is mostly nameless thugs vs women with lack of personality.Decent sets and set pieces.. nothing memorable.Ultimately, it feels cheap.",Gunpowder Milkshake

59,DeBBss,Goofy and lighthearted with a paper thin story,6,24 July 2021,"For every positive in this movie there's at least one negative. There's a lot of acting talent but the performances were mediocre to okay. There's great action and music but the story and characters were paper thin. And for whatever reason, this film doesn't want to give any exposition about anything.They tried to set up this underground hitman/hitwoman world, but they executed it so poorly. Once again, the exposition was lacking to give any depth to its plot devices. The film also spent so much of its time with actions scenes that it couldn't develop anything that could've been interesting. But, since this is an action movie, how well does it do in terms of its action? I would say pretty decent. It's not the best I've seen, but there are quite a few creative and well choreographed fight scenes. The music and colors also help a lot with adding a fun and lighthearted tone.But with all its positives I've just mentioned, my favorite part had to be the Porsche 944. For some reason, action movies rarely add any cool cars, and if they do, its either a muscle car or a supercar. The Porsche 944 is such an underrated beauty, so I love that they added something cool for the car guys. In fact, I'm raising this movie to a 6 just because of that.Gunpowder Milkshake has a fun and goofy tone, but has close to zero depth. This is a film that you should watch just for the entertainment. It's certainly above average in the genre, so I'll it a 6/10 as its final score.",Gunpowder Milkshake

61,ayoreinf,Once Upon a Time in a city controlled by the Firm,8,21 July 2021,"I know, this site was taken over by the anti feminist agenda, so whatever I write doesn't really matter. But that's the way things are, I may not write what the majority here likes but I still can write what I think and that's the way it'll go. I don't correspond to this anti feminist agenda - I like or dislike movies based on the way I see them and I liked this one, I liked it a lot.You see. This is a legend, a myth if you will, about a city controlled by a secretive society of men who uses women and then throws them away when they think they no longer have a use for them. And about what happens when some of these women come together and fight back. You see, these women may not be as strong as the men but they are better fighters and they are tough as nails. Look at the design of this movie it's designed to look like a designers movie a bit like Sin City but with more to say. Reminded me a lot of Alan Rudolph's Rain City from his 1985 masterpiece Troubles in Mind. But even if you have different association, you'll have to agree it's designed like a movie set with iconic movie set locations such as the Diner the shady clinic the shady motel and so on. Everybody moving around in this movie is a walking cliché, and often they also sound like one. That's not bad script writing that's intentional telling us we're looking at a situation that took place so many times it became a cliché. And the fact we still feel like we do see flash and blood characters among al these cliché and stereotypes is because we do get a stellar cast performing superbly. I personally felt as if I was watching the real people behind the banalities and the cliché.This was a visualization of the bloodbath that took place in Hollywood when the Me Too movement came to light.

67,huh_oh_i_c,"A choreographic masterpiece. Pays hommage to Sergio Leone, John Woo & Tarantano",8,19 September 2021,"Gunpowder Milkshake, a title which isn't directly explained in the movie, is an action movie which borders on the action-comedy, but doesn't cross the line entirely.It's about a gun-for-hire woman, Sam(antha), who gets her kill orders from a mysterious organisation with the terribly unimaginative name ""The Firm (and this unimaginativity is immediately the movies biggest problem). The rest of this film is pretty flawless. Sam gets two assignments. During the first one, she kills a mob boss' son. During the 2nd one, she kills an accountant, who was forced to steal from The Firm because someone kidnapped his 8 year old daughter. Or, as she repeatedly insists, eight and three quarters. The 2nd kill is accidental-ish, and it makes her feel guilty because she too, lost her mother at a young age. So, hilarity ensues.What makes this movie stand out, are the action sequences, which are highly stylized affairs, which remind us of John Woo flicks and the soundtrack, which unapologetically 'borrows' from Ennio Morricones work for Sergio Leone movies. What's especially satisfying about the action sequences is that the women who do the punching and the stabbing and the shooting are doing so very convincingly. This wasn't so 20 years ago. Then ""She hits like a girl"" was both pejorative, but still a real thing. Not so much these days. Of course, this isn't the first movie where women do convincing fight scenes and such. But still, here they are not only amongst the best, male or female, but they are top 5, top 3 of the most aesthetically pleasing. They are just really pretty to look at. It's more ballet with guns, than anything else.Aside from that, while the story line isn't terribly inventive or unpredictable (it's actually very predictable) the acting is very good, also from the child/teen actor, and the direction, and the production values are solid.So, 8 oth 10.The Melancholic Alcoholic.",Gunpowder Milkshake

Acting was also very solid from the cast and the action was mostly believable. This was not John wick quality action but the budget also wouldn't be close to the same.

75,Wililjam,An entertaining film with potential...,8,16 July 2021,"Karen Gillan is in the lead role, but it doesn't feel like it. She has a lot of fun scenes and some good action scenes, but the ones that shine are the librarians, ESPECIALLY Carla Gugino. The only issue I had with Carla Gugino was that she wasn't in the film for very long.Lena Headey is great in the film as well, she had a really cool scene which was shown in the trailer. I wish they didn't spoil that scene in the trailer, or the diner scene.What really stood out to me was the comedy, and the physical comedy in certain scenes. Though the whole laugh-gas shtick was barely funny and I have no idea why they chose to go on and on with it. Other than that, most of it worked in the films favor.The action scenes, although some were spoiled in trailers, were great. The choices of music was perfect. Michelle Yeoh was perfect as well. Anytime she's in a film, it's a win. Angela Bassett. Also a win. She had some amazing fight scenes as well.The potential exist for getting sequels, and honestly, I am all for it. Some may say that it's a all-female John Wick film, where the bad guys are all men. Which is a fair point. But I like it. I kinda hope they go to different cities where they encounter other librarians. Helen Mirren, Michelle Pfeiffer, Jamie Lee Curtis, Diane Keaton, Sigourney Weaver and Julianne Moore would all be great librarians.Hope it gets a sequel.",Gunpowder Milkshake

Just knew that a new all female cast movie starring Karen Gillan and Lena Heady is on the way. I had no idea about the rest of the cast.I don't know why they tried to fill plot with John Wick type assassin universe creation. That was dumb. They should've stopped at the library. But the action is pretty good. There's good amount of gore and some new stunts. Michelle Yeoh was great to watch. Carla Gugino, such a great actress was underutilized and wasted. Angela Bassett was okay given what they gave her. And that's the major flaw here. Despite entertainment, mindless fun action, this cast was not given enough to do. Karen Gillan was amazing in Occulus and as Nebula. Here she is asked to hold back tears and suppress emotions for some reason, I guess to look ""tough"". Lena Heady, is gone for half of the movie, again for whatever reason because of her past which was very unconvincing. Other than that it's just bad vs good. Writers had this amazing opportunity to make these women badass and all they could think of was, oh let's have Angela Bassett shoot a bunch of goons with a shot gun, and Lena Heady can do a dual gun.The background score, songs were good, action scenes are shot well, make up is good, VFX was solid. Watch this but don't expect Atomic blonde or Baby Driver or John Wick or Anna.",Gunpowder Milkshake
78,BijeshNagesh,"Stylistic, Sensational, Steady",8,15 July 2021,"From the get-go, I received a distinctly Tarantino-esque ""Kill Bill"" vibe from this movie. I also observed more than a few ""John Wick"" elements. Combine these with a strong 80s-Noir (maybe even a previous era?) flavour and a female-led storyline, and you have yourself a multi-layered movie that is both entertaining and immersive.Being a fan of ""The Witcher"" I was pleasantly surprised to see Young Sam's introduction - Freya Allan did a good job with her character here. The 'grown up' version of Sam, played by Karen Gillan, kept the beat going steady throughout the plot. She gave a curiously blended performance in this film - and I'm not just saying that because the movie has the word 'Milkshake' in its title.I liked the way she balanced femininity and old-fashioned style-statements without deliberately sexualizing her character. She was at once human and relatable. It was a relief to see the way she maneuvred an essentially action-driven plot using that 'blended' approach. Sam's initial dark-trenchcoat-and-hat costume could've been a whole lot better, though - the girl looked like she was drowning in hers. At times, it even felt like she was not wearing something of her own.Karen's performance as Sam struck all the right chords, though the same could not be said of her fighting skills. She was outstanding in ""Gunpowder Milkshake"" Netflix, but her character's combat legerdemain was a tad over-estimated - factoring in the bowling arena scene.I think this might've been due to a laxity in pre-shoot rehearsal and training for her character. She did get better towards the end, though - the finale fight scene alongside her mother Scarlet. The intrigue and mystery surrounding her in the film were well-woven.Sam doesn't feel pain like normal people do, the reasons for which were never properly explained anywhere in the film, I believe.Her mother Scarlet - played by Lena Headey - was a great addition to the cast. She's no stranger to action movies (""The 300"") and series (""Game of Thrones""). She gave a slightly 'butch' performance in this film - pulled it off rather well. Her take on being protective of her 'baby girl' was not altogether unreasonable - especially considering her back-story. Lena gave off noteworthy action-heroine vibes in select scenes.I must confess that Scarlet and Sam didn't quite look like mother and daughter to me. At least not as strikingly similar to warrant some of the characters' interest in the fact that she 'looked familiar'. The 'aunts' in question are indeed familiar with Scarlet, having worked with her and all that. But Sam does not look a lot like her mum, to be honest. Must take after the father, who was murdered early on, as Scarlet tells it. The story-segments about who killed him and what followed afterwards complemented Scarlet's character-motivations.I liked the blasé attitude the waitress Rose (played by Joanna Bobin) at the diner and the nurse (played by Mai Duong Kieu) at the hospital brought concerning 'temporary weapons storage'. It was an amusing addition to the script.Michael Smiley's Dr. Ricky was an unoriginal character-choice but a needed one in this script. Reminded me of the ""John Wick"" film series for some reason. Michael's performance was fun-funny and entertaining.The Russian thug, played by Ed Birch, was interesting though a tad stereotypical. Birch gave a well-paced performance. His accent felt forced, though. His character's 'look' added good contrast to the scenes in which he featured, short-lived as they were.The masks - Dracula, Frankenstein, Mummy, and Wolfman - used by the other thugs (as the movie progressed) were sufficiently sinister and well-chosen. These four thugs brought their own fun and treacherous element to the film.Yankee, played by Ivan Kaye, had nice screen presence. Crow and shocker - played by Jack Bandeira and David Burnell IV, respectively - as well. They were remarkably funny, though not in a laugh-out-loud way, and distinctly incompetent. ""Three Stooges"" indeed.Whoever decided to cast Ralph Ineson as the villain Jim McAlester, give them a raise. Ralph felt like the perfect choice for this movie. I enjoyed watching him give that suave chill-dark performance he did.Virgil, played by Adam Nagaitis, was another smart casting choice. His bad-guy performance was rather good.Nathan, played by Paul Giamatti, was the 'balancer', and not just because of his gender. His character was great to watch, and his performance even more so. It was 'classic Giamatti', and most welcome in this film. The subtle way in which he turns comedic is just spellbinding.Madeleine, played by Carla Gugino, was at once adorable, knowledgeable, conciliatory, and sharp. She brought a clever and amusing twist to the librarian character trope. Madeleine gave brave meaning to the phrase 'axe them'. I was genuinely sad to see her go.Angela Bassett's Anna May brought sass and clever dialogue to the movie. Her character was thoroughly enjoyable and brutally brilliant - talk about 'hammer-ific - from the moment she came on the scene.Michelle Yeoh's introduction as Florence added to the insane cast-glorious value of this movie. Michelle too is no stranger to action movies. Her performance throughout this film was rather different from her usual go-to style. Florence was subtle, precise, nerdy, and outstandingly 'chain-worthy'.The book-and-gun references - books by female writers containing select guns - were interesting, though a bit too feminist. But then again, this being a female-led action-film I found it an apt choice.Special shout-out to the little girl Emily, played by Chloe Coleman. Chloe did good work in other films and series, and did not disappoint in this one. There was a certain wisdom and realism to her performance that I found laudable.Soundtrack score was mighty interesting. It fit the 'mood of the moment'. Music, in general, was ideal for this film. I especially enjoyed the Synthwave inclusions. Good one, Haim Frank Ilfman.Scene transitions were neat and careful. They ensured a steady 'flow', and kept the tension and the thrills on point.The team that went location-hunting for this movie brought their A-game, apparently. Berlin was quite the treat to see.I firmly believe that Michael Seresin's cinematography did a lot of the heavy-lifting in this movie. Without most of those wides and close-angles, those pan- and track-shots, several portions of this film would've failed to impress.Production Design - including atmosphere, ambiance, and lighting - nailed it! The lionesses in the library (i.e., the wall décor) was a nice symbolic touch. In fact, the entire library was a work of art. Kudos to David Scheunemann for not skimping on details.More than a handful of story-symbolism prevailed in this movie. The way Sam's hat gusted off that one time felt like a sign that she was giving in to her human side despite working hard to hide it in her line of work. And that's just one of several that I can recall off the top of my head; no pun intended.Nothing I could find that felt 'convenient' in this movie. Everyone was right where they would normally be, given their circumstances and character-motivations - and the style of the film.Noteworthy screenplay from Navot Papushado and Ehud Lavski - it was quirky and amusing, thrilling and tension-packed. Navot also holds the prominent position of director, and he genuinely excelled at his task where ""Gunpowder Milkshake"" is concerned.All the action sequences were brushed with beautiful attention to detail. The choreography was clever, and had an eye for resourceful character-driven choices. The violence was not 'no holds barred' but carefully structured so it fit the scenes, and what was needed in them.""Gunpowder Milkshake"" on Netflix is certainly a must-watch thrill-fest of an action-entertainment movie - don't let some of the critics/ratings tell you otherwise.It was nuanced and detailed with 'just right' amounts of 80s-noir (perhaps other eras too?) and pulp fiction tropes adequately sprinkled across various stylistic themes in the film. Adding to the entertaining mélange was a sturdy thread of Asian and Southeast-Asian cinematic storytelling influences without which this flick would have looked quite different.The movie builds up to a crescendo and contains an action-packed flow designed to thrill, entertain, and empower - it succeeds on all three counts - from start to finish.",Gunpowder Milkshake

The thin narrative only functions to service its over-the-top ultra-violent action and it does not build enough lore to garner any sequel interest. That said, Gunpowder Milkshake is a fun one-time watch that will immediately dissolve after it is over.As the lead, Karen Gillan plays her gun-totting stone-faced heroine too straight and undersells the film's intended ironic tone. She looks the part but lacks conviction. In her martial arts fights, Gillan struggled to sell the power in her moves. Hunched over in her tall frame, she wasn't squatted low enough to properly draw power from her core and would often spring her legs and move in a clumsy manner. A choreography detail is not normally a critique point in a review but the narrative wasn't compelling enough to distract me from it.Lena Headey, Michelle Yeoh, Angela Bassett, and Carla Cugino end up overshadowing Gillan as the supporting characters. The end sequence crosscuts between all five action heroines fighting against the bad guys and they all executed their choreography beautifully. I wish more time was spend with them as they are under-utilized.David Scheunemann's production design, with its neon-lit high-contrast graphic novel aesthetic, reminded me of the eye-popping sets from Warren Beaty's Dick Tracy. Scheunemann must have spent many hours on a color wheel working out the maximum color contrast for the film's many gorgeous sets. He builds a cool snazzy-look world which was one of the memorable things about this film.There are influences from Quentin Tarantino's Kill Bill and the John Wick franchise in its world-building sensibilities, but it is all half-portioned. Writer-director Navot Papushado needed to push things further with this world through its story, beyond the flashiness, cool soundtrack, or hyper-violence. Gunpowder Milkshake needed more story, more world-building, and more irreverence. It needed to give us a reason to care.",Gunpowder Milkshake

88,waltermwilliams,Gunpowder Milkshake is a lesson in style over substance,5,22 July 2021,"We need more substance and less style.""Gunpowder Milkshake"" is a lesson in style over substance.Which is a shame because on paper it promised so much.Just take a look at the diversity in this cast for starters (Dr Who's companion) Karen Gillan, (GOT) Lena Headey, plus Carla Cugino, Michelle Yeoh, Angela Bassett, Ralph Ineson & Paul Giamatti.Director & Writer Navot Papushado may be the weak link here because of his predictable gangster style script and lame direction.Optically this is a stunning looking neon flavoured movie with nods to Quentin Tarantino, Epic Spaghetti Westerns plus Suicide Squad, Hitmans Bodyguard, Kingsmen and Birds of Prey.It's a very empowering film for women taking charge and running an amazing library, just don't go into the ""Self Help"" section.The slow-mo fight scenes are brutal and Sergio Leone stylised gun battles even more brutal.Forget the OK Corral when you've got the Diner scene complete with an Ennio Morricone inspired soundtrack by Frank Ilfman with shades of Giorgio Moroder.There's lot of boxes to tick when making a successful movie and I feel this one was more paint by numbers.Shame because it could have been so much better if they'd sharpened the pencil on the script and given the actors better direction.Still worth a look if you want to brush up on your fighting skills from a Mother/Daughter team and driving skills from a little girl who's only 8 and 3 quarters.",Gunpowder Milkshake

The action is choreographed well. But the women didn't have enough power or gravitas to pull it off convincingly most of the time. (Scarlett Johansson - Black Widow/The Avengers - is one of the few female actors that consistently pull off fighting scenes convincingly.) Most of the time the actresses just seem to be dancing through the fight scenes, just touching male actors, and they go flying. Although Leana Headey's fight scenes usually looked good in this movie.I don't understand most of these bad ratings. These reviewers just seem sexist. Most male action movies have no story, stupid dialogue and bad acting. Just a dumb excuse for action and violence.In my opinion, this movie is clearly better than garbage like John Wick (Keanu Reeves) and Wrath of Man (Jason Statham).

I can see people liking this movie. I enjoyed this more than 'Kingsman: secret service' because along with the insane fighting skills (and keeping your clothes perfect while doing it), they portrayed a bit of vulnerability, Kingsman was more cartoonish to me.the ending - spoiler-The final scene is where the girl trio shoot, helpless, unarmed Russian gangsters in what is supposed to be neutral territory. The was bad ending for a few reasons. 1. it's anti-climatic, the outcome is not in doubt, and 2. The Russian mob weren't the worst bad guys. The firm setup the blood feud between the Russian syndicate and the library (name of lady assassins) and the firm wasn't even touched. It would have worked better if they figured this out and turned against 'the Firm' or at least has an armed fight.

So many talented actresses and actors, acting so bad and awkward, saying so many dumb, amateurish and unfunny lines.And PS. One really annoying thing about IMDB-reviews is all those people who just have to reduce other reviewers opinions, claiming that ""they don't understand"" the movie for some reason. I love great well made fun action movies and i consider John Wick, Zombieland, Kill Bill and Kingsman being some of the best, fun and well made action movies out there. Gunpowder Milkshake doesn't come close to the quality of those movies. It surely want to be cool, but it fails miserably and i don't know why this director was handed the opportunity. It has nothing to do about understanding, ""taking things too serious"" or whatever. It's just a very bad, poorly made movie with a horrible script, totally void from any type of enjoyment.

This time it's an all female cast kicking ass and that's another reason why I like it.Story is fast paced and interesting to me and watching Karen Gillan (""The Doctor's companion"") in a much more gritty role was a super plus for me as well.

108,ty-jensen,Okay Netflix movie,5,18 July 2021,"I was curious about Gunpowder Milkshake since I like Karen Gillan and Paul Giamatti. Gunpowder Milkshake was okay, it's a decent time waster.The acting was fine like most genre films. Gillan gives the best performance in the film. The little girl is fine, she was in the Dave Bautista film My Spy. Giamatti is fine but his role is small.The plot is weak and cliche, it's simply a chase film. If I'm not mistaken, rogue assassins are cliche. ""Milkshake"" is like a 90s action film, it's cheesy but the humor falls flat. The dialogue is okay, it's cliche.The action was okay, it could of been better. The choreography is just okay and the editing is mostly normal. The library shootout is the best action scene, you could call it the climax. There's some slow motion like a Zack Snyder film.For those who don't know, the film is rated R. The violence is brutal and stylish. The blood is digital which looks awful mainly in the ending. The film looks gorgeous, it has plenty of blood red neon lighting.Overall, Gunpowder Milkshake is an okay action movie. It's like a 90s action film, you can't treat it seriously. I can see why it was dumped onto Netflix in North America. The film has some sequel baiting so a sequel is already planned. If you like action movies, you could give it a shot.",Gunpowder Milkshake
109,ravencorinncarluk,"All style, zero substance",4,15 July 2021,"I really liked the cast, though I disliked how the director had Karen Gillan tying to be too deadpan and badass in the first act. It made her seem like a poor actress, but I've seen too much of her so I know it wasn't her fault.The movie has a neat aesthetic, but it really borrowed far too much from previous movies in a similar genre. There was some John Wick, Shoot 'Em Up, Desperado, The Professional, Kill Bill, and more. The three Librarians even reminded me of the ladies from A Wrinkle In Time.The hodgepodge story also meant that the tone varied. Far too many scenes that would have been fine in an actual comedy, but then the movie would whiplash back to the borderline drama-action.I don't totally hate it, but there were some lines at the end that just stuck in my craw as unnecessary. Like some producer somewhere said ""Oh yeah, we need to make sure people understand this is about smashing the patriarchy."" Didn't actually lower the score, but it rankled after the somewhat mess of a movie had concluded.Worth a watch once so long as you go in knowing that it will remind you of all the other movies like this.",Gunpowder Milkshake

115,isabellacheng,"Intriguing first half, braindead second half",6,11 October 2021,"This is an action movie, so let's talk about the action.The first scene in the bowling alley, that's creative. Very Jackie Chan like choreography, clever use of a kid's suitcase and redirected attacks. The ""boneheads"" attacked together, instead of one after another because reasons, which is a competent choreography rarely seen today. Even rewatching it in slow motion, the moves still make sense.The next major fight is the paralyzed fight. That is so much fun! Basically sets the tone of what kind of movie this is, in case you are still expecting a female John Wick. The limitations on both sides are logically consistent with the narrative.Then there's that brief carpark chase where Emily's steering. Kind of fun, but the bulletproof car has too much of a plot armor. This is where the choreography, and the script, and the logic, start to go downhill. How did the thugs lose sight of Sam's bright red race car? Just because the camera panned away? In the end, a seasoned assassin such as Sam, is tailed by a thug's heavily damaged car.The subsequent escape leads up to the highly anticipated library fight, where the main casts all come together. This only happens because the casts are arguing loudly, which is just plain stupidity. In what's supposed to be an arms dealer shop with virtually unlimited ammo, the casts decide to go melee after firing off a few rounds. If ammo is limited, they didn't attempt to conserve either. Heck, Anna May didn't even bring a gun, just two smoke grenades. Given that the library is basically their home, you might expect a clever use of the environment, but no. You get a drawn-out melee fight where the thugs suddenly decide not to use their guns. You might also expect the only one using a (really large) gun, Madeleine, to be more competent, but again, no. Even though it has been foreshadowed, twice, that she has an axe, an appropriate weapon given her environment, she decides to blow off her stealth advantage by firing the big gun because it looks cool, and got killed.In the final diner fight, you would expect another creative fight because of the ""no guns"" policy. But then they break their own rule by taking guns to the fight. Unlike John Wick, who broke the rule and killed someone in the hotel, this moment is not earned. Basically the librarians swapped with the waitresses, and not a single person noticed, just because the camera panned away. And this is just the beginning of the nonsense. The entire fight is shown in slow motion, and all the flaws in choreography lay bare for everyone to see. I can't even switch off my brain to enjoy the fight, pretending I didn't see the flaws, because it is in slow motion!This is a situation where the women have guns, and the men only melee weapons, except Virgil. This should have been a slaughter. The gang leader, who brought a knife to a gun fight, is idiotic enough to start the fight, and got headshot. Florence, who already has her guns trained on two thugs, decides to spin a 360 before firing. Then she just run past a thug to do another 360 spin with Scarlet, and got slashed in her eye by a thug who is originally just straight ahead of her. Why would anyone with a gun run into melee range of their opponent? Let alone doing unnecessary spins? Then Anna May turned her back from the fight to smash a thug's head into a milkshake. Here, Virgil from the gang who has a gun, has a clear shot at Anna May, but didn't take it. He jumped out of the window and got shot. Here we see again an extra gun-bearing waitress who's just there, unexplained.Describing the last two fights as disappointing would be an understatement. They are just bad, and not creative at all! How could the choreography mess up so badly? If you screwed up a scene, hide it in quick cuts, speed it up, but never show it in slow motion! This scene might be a one-take thing, yet regardless, the choreography is not well thought out.Story-wise, we were teased of a ""Léon: The Professional"" relationship (actually two, Sam and her mom, then with Emily), but nothing of significance comes out of it. We'd also expect tension from an absent mother who left Sam for 15 years, but that is immediately reconciled. In terms of narrative there is nothing but wasted potential.The quality (not really, but the amount of fun) of the first half would have worth at least a 7/10, I might even consider a 8/10. But the second half of the movie is just nope. There is way too little narrative and development to justify a 114 minute runtime. Therefore I would give this movie an overall 6/10, and that has already taken into account the merits of the first half.",Gunpowder Milkshake

The plot is amazing, the characters are completely into their roles and the setting is just amazing. I especially like the Library and the diner settings and their rules, regulations and contributions to the story line. The comic book creation of a whole shady underworld is baffling, complete with a female-led group of fighters known as the Library, run by Anna May (Angela Bassett), Florence (Michelle Yeoh) and Madeleine (Carla Gugino).The performances are superb. Gillan delivers a fiercely straight-faced performance that works perfectly. The filming is stylish throughout, aided considerably by the gorgeous production design, colourful costumes (especially on the Librarians) and neon-drenched lighting.In short, this is very much a film of surface pleasures, but it's hard to complain when those pleasures are so much fun. Here's hoping the film achieves its obvious franchise potential, because another round of Gunpowder Milkshakes would be most welcome. And bowling balls.....

130,kelvynchin,A film of two halves,6,28 July 2021,"Just like a football match involving Liverpool FC, Navot Papushado's brightly coloured action flick about a young female assassin (Karen Gillan) is a tale of two contrasting halves. The first is gleefully ribald, with more than a dash of humour and some slickly orchestrated action sequences that exhibit an uncommon wit for films of it's ilk - for example, how do you take out a trio of heavily armed goons with both your arms paralysed? However, as soon as everyone gets shut in the ""library"" (which, in movies like this, is not really one - in this case, it's actually an armoury with enough heavy weaponry to make a regular SWAT team blush), the movie devolves into the kind of tepid action that we have all seen before - you know, the sort that relies a lot on slo-mo and ""ironic"" musical choices punctuating the gunplay. Which is quite a shame, really. Still, star Karen Gillan gives an assured physical performance, and is plenty stoic enough to carry the film. Leana Heady, Angela Basset, M. Yeoh and C Gugino all appear to add some star power. Doesn't really stick the ending, but well worth a watch, especially the excellent first half.",Gunpowder Milkshake

There was an incredible amount of dark humor, some silliness, and great acting in this movie. I snickered in a lot of places through this. That's my kind of dramedy. I love a good guffaw, who doesn't. But a dark comedy that takes you a bit off-guard, well that's great for me.Some commenters brought up harsh comparisons to a couple of other Directors. Sure this movie is somewhat derivative; what's wrong with that? It's not a film shooting for the Academy Awards. I so enjoyed seeing women (particularly these ones) carry this genre as well as they did. The six female leads (including Chloe Coleman) were a delight in conveying the vivre of their character as well as throwing darts of comedy.Was nice to see Paul Giamatti doing his thing as an empathetic bad guy.That's my take.",Gunpowder Milkshake

Plus, she has to take care of an 8 (and three quarters) year old girl whose father she kills and who becomes her apprentice along the way.Some might complain it was too unbelievable but, they probably give a boy who got superpowers after being bitten by a spider, and a man who turns into a green monster when he gets the hump, 10 stars.Movies should be about good quality acting that keeps us entertained for a couple of hours... and this does just that.A good film, obviously helped by the presence and great acting of the beautiful and sexy ginger, Karen Gillan.",Gunpowder Milkshake

150,Aria_Athena,I had a bad time,3,15 July 2021,"I rarely have a bad time watching a movie, usually the worst case scenario is me being bored. This one rubbed me the wrong way.One of the first scenes is 15 years in the past, where young Karen Gillan and her mother are sitting in a diner, cheesy music playing on the background, sharing a milkshake, both having a straw in their mouth while staring deep into each other's eyes, yet not drinking. This indicates that it's not the milkshake they enjoy, but the ritual itself and company of one another. Or perhaps it's in the actresses contracts that they don't have to consume any sugary products, I don't know. At least someone came along and took a sip between shots. I don't know why this bothered me so much.As for the movie itself, I don't have much to say. I found it meaningless. It's decently shot, but the action is mediocre, Karen Gillan's deadpan performance was fine, but the rest of the cast was pretty bad. I don't blame the actresses though, I blame the script.I think it tried to be a metaphor for a male dominated world in which women have to fight for change. They pointed out twice that The Firm consists only of men. ""There is a group of men called The Firm. They've been running things for a long, long time. They make all the rules and change them when it fits their needs. They think they are untouchable and can get away with anything, but they wont"". The thing is, the main character is an assassin working for The Firm and she
ends up killing the son of the leader of another organisation. Then she takes another job, she disobeys orders knowing very well the consequences and on top of that she also messes up. She loses the protection of The Firm and now the other organisation is out to get her. They are the main antagonists, not The Firm. So what was the point? Whatever they were going for doesn't work on any level.Let's just say the Librarians wouldn't recommend her Tolstoy, would they now.",Gunpowder Milkshake
151,politicidal,Netflix attempt to ride the 'girl power with firepower' wave left by Atomic Blonde and Mad Max: Fury Road,5,26 October 2021,"Action-comedy about an efficient if socially awkward assassin (Gillan) who becomes a young child's protector when some nasty villains come after them. She gets assistance from a group of gun toting women (Angela Bassett, Michelle Yeoh, Carla Gugino, Lenda Headey) disguised as librarians. It's cool seeing these four very talented actresses doing badass things.There are some things that work. For instance, Karen Gillan wrestles with not telling the little girl that she killed her father. Meanwhile, Gillan herself has a strange familial relationship with her boss turned nemesis (Paul Giamatti).Paul Giamatti himself is pretty good in the role. And it's made apparent that he's gonna turn on Karen Gillan at some point, you do get the feeling he is reluctant to do so. Ralph Ineson plays the lead villain and has quite an intimidating presence. It's similar to how Liam Neeson plays a bad guy except Ineson's voice is actually kind of scarier.The action is appropriately bloody given the R rating. But the story and its various subplots feel like an outline instead an actual script. It's oddly enough a similar structure to the superhero film BIRDS OF PREY except that movie has a wild anarchic energy that compensates its narrative problems.And if I was being honest, while I like Karen Gillan and she's not a bad actress, she's not quite as charismatic as Margot Robbie. It's funny seeing Angela Bassett trying not to swear in front of a small child;it doesn't last long. Lena Headey has a major role in the plot and she's good as always. Both Michelle Yeoh and Carla Gugino are kind of sidelined by the end of the movie and it seems unfair.You can see the elements of other better action movies in the style and script.

And fails at both. The only positive is the visuals. That's it. Not even the action is good as it feels like it was choreographed by a coked up Buster Keaton (there's a scene in a bowling alley that's not engaging at all). The score even feels distracting as it has this spaghetti western feel to it that just doesn't fit with the John Wick-esque world and story on display.At least Birds of Prey, despite having bad writing, editing, pacing and characterizations, had great direction and action sequences and even acting. This film didn't even have that advantage. I mean they had a good cast, possibly even better than Birds of Prey and they just.....wasted it. Enough said.",Gunpowder Milkshake

How else can you attempt to encapsulate the story, the acting and the level of entertainment across films? You can't really compare movies of different genres with a simple numeric summary. Wizard of Oz vs FIght Club as a generic example. I look at every movie and try to imagine a different unknown cast being in the film. If the story holds its own it really doesn't matter who the stars were. Anyway, if you compare this film to Kill Bill it's a 6. Expendables maybe a 7. Unfortunately I went into the film thinking it was going to be more complex than it was. I recommend you pass on the movie altogether.

168,afrocut,Disappointing,4,18 July 2021,"A script hits the table in front of some really interesting actresses, but instead of lines of dialogue or any sense of narrative outline there are pages and pages of harshly drawn action set pieces with the words ""Music video"" scribbled across the top of each one. The top page reads ""gunpowder milkshake"", the actress sees that bizarre title and thinks 'well, I do like milkshakes' and says ""I'm in"". That can be the only way it went when such good talent signed on to this movie. It also would explain why they are all so bad in this barely thought out film. Karen Gillan acts like a robot who is pretending to be cool, her character comes off unlikable. It's not just her, almost every actor or actress that comes in seems just a little off. I can only imagine this is the directors fault. After all he seems to not understand character set up, jokes, action, use of music or physics. Sets look cool, but they are like ghost towns. Every location is empty and lifeless. This makes action set pieces feel even more fake. That and the lack of physical harm to lead characters, lame comedy tones and a constant need for an up front musical showcase, kill all intentions of its action landing. It's like 6 music videos were stuck together with a flimsy premise in between each. The only person that seems to have any life is Angela Bassett, but she's not even in it enough to really care. I want to give it a more averaging score but the more I think about its lame plot (assassin organization vs mob) the more the rating drops. Maybe if I cared about the characters, or hell , knew them, I'd think some things would work better. I'm so disappointed with this one and have to settle with a 4/10 stars.",Gunpowder Milkshake

In the same way that Tarantino halfway through Pulp Fiction exposed the fact he's a talentless hack.The colour timing and grading is inconsistent, and to me it comes off as pastiche.It's a worthy-ish attempt, using recycled imagination, but like I forgot to keep watching Star Trek Nemesis, I couldn't keep a grip of this...

Add some humor and you should get a perfect recipe... yet it's not quite the case - first half of the movie the scenes are quite disparate so there's no smooth line in the visual story (the general story is quite linear), second half it gets better as it's more unbroken scene since then. Then the acting is a little uneven - some actors are great, the others are cardboard. And then the villain part of the characters is really lacking - it's really hard to tell who are all those people and why do the care so much.

The action sequence was a mixture of John Wick and Jackie Chan.Director Navot Papushado and Cinematographer Michael Seresin transform a generic script into a blast. There was a smart use of a camera and lightning. The music, color grading, costumes, makeup, production design, and the whole atmosphere was brilliant.I loved the library scenario and the classic literature language used for the guns. It reminds me of the John Wick movie.The script was decent and predictable to some extent but the direction and Cinematography made it more interesting. Also, I can't forget the funny fighting moments. So It's a must-watch movie.",Gunpowder Milkshake

185,lu_lou_belle,"A montage of 20 years of action movie trailers, devoid of life.",1,23 July 2021,"Michelle Yeoh, Lena Hedley, Paul Giamatti, Angela Bassett and other talent wasted. Not sure which bold assassin with a heart of gold movie this is supposed to be ripping off but there's a little Kill Bill a little John Wick, and so so many video games. My attention began to wander after 5 minutes. Editing of action sequences leaves alot to be desired, as does incoherent script, set design and directing. Actors do spend alot of time standing around and sneering between action sequences, except for Carla Gugino who is pleasantly adrift on painkillers and a little ecstasy, Mona Lisa smiling through it all. Once again, another script that misuses dialog to explain and describe plot as it happens, rather than embue it with life-always an indicator of incompetence. I think they might have recycled the library set from the beginning of The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen toward what feels like the end but isn;t. You will not notice since you will probably be asleep. The waste of Angela Bassett is particularly frustrating. I can't remember ever seeing her in a film where she didn't light up the screen, even in genres that I dislike. Film is too long by at least 45 minutes, and is rotten as a women centered film, proving once again if you're going to perform in a traditionally man's genre exceptionally wonderful is your minimum standard. The producers and director let these vibrant actors down. Well its july 2021, covid delta is running rampant so finding quality on the netflix is a bit of a challenge.

Karen Gillan from Dr. Who, Joanna Bobin from Bridgerton, Freya Allan from The Witcher, Lena Headey from Game of Thrones (or 300), Angela Bassett, Michelle Yeoh and many more. It almost feels like a Hollywood meeting of contemporary actresses. But wait, this should be a movie. And it is quite entertaining and never gets boring, I give them that. But do not start to think about the plot or the directing. These are unfortunately the worst parts of the movie. The story is not inventive or original in any way. Just some boring stuff we have seen a hundred times over and over again with a lot of plot holes in it. But okay, it's enough to carry on the action. But then, the directing is surprisingly old school for such a young an inexperienced director like Navot Papushado. Sometimes, the movie even feels like a school project of a nerd, who knows all the great movies and now tries to copy some of his favorite scenes in a very uninspired way. And what's with the people always doing things in slow motion? Is this Bad Boys part three? And we all know, at least from Despicable Me, you shoot first and then shout out something cool afterwards, if you want to take advantage of the element of surprise. And not the other way around. So the movie is watchable but it feels totally unpolished. Plus, I am all about gender equality. But this movie is yet another testament to the mindset of people who want to achieve gender equality by exchanging the inequality of men centered stories with stories which are women centered. So prepare for some heroines shooting a lot of dumb guys. Or not, you are not missing out on anything.",Gunpowder Milkshake

They tried to make her cool, but she was just bland. There is nothing to her.The choreography was mostly well done. I enjoyed the mild-ish violence the usage of things in the room (similar to Jackie Chan films)but the problem was the main ""actress"". She never did sport for the sake of being fit. She only did it to look hot.Why do action movies with female protagonists do this? Why do they cast women who look like they need help with carrying their groceries? Why can't they cast women who look like the character they are supposed to play? In one scene the baddies were kicking her, but the statists were afraid to hurt her, so they did not kick her at all, but slightly touched with their feet. It was hilarious.Editing was mostly fine. Better than 70% of generic action movies. It was clear what was happening. The slow-motion on the other hand were trash. As they usually are. HEY, MOVIE MAKER, STOP USING THEM! They just make things cheesy and bad.There were also some really cool and colorful shots. While this movie has basically no stakes and no scale, the sets look fantastic. Visually speaking, this movie is nice to look at.Comedy was trash. Not a single joke was funny. Slapstick is also not funny.This movie is not bad, but sadly it does more things wrong than right.

Unfortunately that tone is monotone. I like my trained assassin revenge stories to have some passion, and this one had all the passion of a rock at the bottom of the arctic ocean.I assume the plot is supposed be over-dramatized, with the fancy assassin club and super fake-looking ""cover"" businesses and the super-sinister boys-club ""company"" that does ... things of some sort, I assume. Other than order people to be assassinated by the girls-club assassin guild. But it was so badly over-stylized that it just came across as stiff and fake.It also skipped over the big fight scenes, I assume because they couldn't make them look believable - not that that stopped them in any other scene.It does have the dubious honor of being by far the most boring assassin movie I've ever seen.",Gunpowder Milkshake

First off, I love Karen Gillian, and it looked like a solid fast paced Karen Gillan goes John Wick flick. Which, is kind of derivative on its own, but looked very entertaining nonetheless. I was excited. But it became an exponentially derivative mash-up in a hurry. Substitute a kid for the puppy (and car), The Firm for the High Table, a Library for the Continental Hotel, and of course be sure to include the never ending supply or Russian mafia cannon fodder. Bad spaghetti western music and ""dramatic"" slow motion sequences, when there was ZERO drama, evoked Quentin Tarantino Kill Bill in a hard way, right down to the satin bowling jacket . The studio set backgrounds were on purpose cartoony, Sin City maybe? But with more color. I laughed out loud a couple of places in the movie where you obviously weren't meant to laugh, but it was trying to be so hard it started to feel like parody. I should also note that, while I did watch it through completely, I had the urge to fast forward on multiple occasions, and my wife walked out of the room ""to do something more productive"" way before the midpoint. Ultimately, this movie seems to just borrow from half a dozen other cult favorites in hopes of synergizing it into a hit. But, being so obvious about it makes it... not.",Gunpowder Milkshake

A big fan of Karen Gillan having watched her as Amy Pond in Dr Who and then Nebula in Guardians/Avengers I was happy to see her have her own big budget action flick. It was a bit of a let down though. The choreography of the first fight scene in the bowling alley felt staged and poorly done. It felt like Gillan was counting as she played out the scene.....1, 2, 3 duck, 1, 2, 3 thrust etc. It was a weak effort. The choreography did improve with some of the fight scenes pretty decent (except for the Dr's office against the same 3 guys from the bowling alley which was laughable). The acting was very over the top, especially from the librarians although Michalle Yeoh I thought was far and above everyone else in every aspect. The story is very much in the vein of John Wick with secret societies of assassins and instead of the Continental you have the Diner. Hopefully the sequel will be better then the original.",Gunpowder Milkshake

The Neon Aesthetic throughout the movie was cool to look at 🔥🔥There are a lot of comedy but unfortunately they did not hit for me a lot of times. It isn't cringe-inducing tho.The Characters - Karen Gillian was really good in her role.

She cannot carry this like Uma Thurman did in KillBill. Maybe no fault of hers given the supporting cast of actors are criminally wasted with a poor script, aimless direction and a plotline that makes little sense or gets your interest. It is lazy and the sort of storyline they did in a hurry, never vetted and maybe done to a budget with short timelines. It's a straight to video effort to use an older terminology. The film itself has being well advertised but disappoints considerably in being lazy in direction, cheap in how it is done, incoherent and loses your attention early on as it runs through a very predictable cliché storyline.

Michelle Yeoh, an equally-brilliant and versatile actor, is also present. However, the three of them were not enough to salvage this mess. The movie rips off pretty much ever film in this same genre. For example, using flameco-style music for the soundtrack during one of the shootout scenes is an obvious steal from Quentin Tarantino's sword fight scene between Uma Thurman & Lucy Liu.Fight scenes in a movie like this have to be either so over-the-top that you suspend disbelief and just enjoy them (think Robert Rodriguez's films), or so elegantly and accurately choreographed that they look quite genuine (the Ong Bak series with Tony Jaa).The movie also ""borrows"" quite liberally from ""Hotel Artemis"" with Jodie Foster, which was far superior in its portrayal of an underground hospital for criminals.I can't remember the last time I was this bored by an action film.",Gunpowder Milkshake

I'm not a huge fan of the John Wick movies due to bad plot/writing. So, yes in this regard Gunpowder Milkshake seems to be a spiritual successor of sorts with its asinine plot and writing. But this is where the similarities end. I don't need to be a fan to understand the appeal of the John Wick franchise. It's a simple story with gritty action trying to fake realism with the tactical gun fights/handling as well as rough combat. Gunpowder Milkshake on the other hand doesn't try to emulate any kind of realism. It goes straight for over the top dark humour / action straight out of something like a Deadpool comic. Imho then comparisons to Birds of Prey make much more sense than the comparison to John Wick.My advice is, just don't think too much about it and enjoy the movie. It was fun and surprisingly violent. The action itself is very often a mixed bag of Moments of Awesome and Comic Relief thanks to either the way the opponents are handled or the state they end up in.I won't go into plot details.

The movie knows what it is and knows where it wants to go and it gets there. The cinematography is pretty tight, the film is colored nicely, and the action and dialogue are at least on par.I also have to say, Karen Gillan is building a nice resume for herself. She might not be at the oscar nominee level yet, but she is a joy to watch in the movies she has been in so far. She carried this movie nicely. There was also some quality supporting roles as well.I only gave this a 6 out of 10. While I enjoyed it, I also have to say that it didn't blaze any new trails.

The plot is just like they all are, somebody is trying to kill the star of the movie (Karen Gillian of Dr. Who & GOTG Fame) and instead she kills them. Along the way she gets help from various female stars, Lena Heady, Angela Bassett, Carla Gugino, and. Michelle Yeoh. Quite a lineup of some badass B****s.While watching the movie it reminded me of several films, such as spaghetti westerns when a shootout is about to happen and the camera goes from one person to the other, usually focusing on their eyes. Another film it remonded me of was the Dick Tracy Movie with Warren Beatty. The bright pastel colors. Various sets were very colorful, why, I don't know but it was cool.There are somewhat of a plot, but that's not important. This isn't that kind of a movie. They tell the audience from the getgo, this is not Casablanca, it's a fun ride. Don't expect a lot of stuff to be 100% logical. If I had to say what movie(s) this movie reminded me of I will say, Most spaghetti westerns, Dick Tracy, Pulp Fiction and John Wick. Lots of gunplay and martial arts fighting.

241,b_trought,Looking for a female version of John Wick? This isn't it,5,26 July 2021,"I like Karen Gillan as an actor; from Doctor Who all the way through to the MCU stuff. She tries hard, sells the roles as best she can and I think she'll make a steady living from it over the next couple of years.She Can't fight though. And her lack of skills are on show here, as are the rest of the female cast (Michelle Yeoh aside, who has plenty of experience with fight scenes in her earlier years). If the film focuses on a female assassin and its underworld then there are going to be comparisons with John Wick... and this film doesn't hold a candle to the action in that film.Part of the reason John Wick is so popular is that Keanu Reeves can actually fight and use a gun... just check out his training videos on Youtube. The guy works hard. The action here is sloppy, clearly over choreographed to help the actors struggle through the fight scenes, and the dives that the stunt men&women take after being tapped by the ladies is just laughable. It was so bad it was good, but took itself so seriously that it was cringy and the poor dialogue adds to this.Stylistically the film was entertaining. The colour palettes used were very standard for Netflix, but each character had their own colour theme which was nice, and there was no obligatory lens flare in a Netflix film ... yay!!!I'd recommend giving it a look before watching John Wick just to see the difference in quality with the action.",Gunpowder Milkshake

I was really happy she was getting her first real starring role in a movie and I really wanted to love this,However, I was very disappointed as this is the first piece of work I've seen of hers where she was not real for me.There were a lot of smart lines but they weren't embedded in any fully developed character. Not just Karen's character but all of the main characters came across as just delivering lines on cue, slick but a bit soulless.Personally I found this a dreadful waste of talent, which was abundant in this movie.Instead of creating something new, the whole movie was cliché and a pastiche of every shoot'em up that has gone before. There was nothing new here, For all the flashes and bangs,The concept of the library was frankly contrived and silly.

So all the action fun should belong strictly to the dudes? Guess what? It's ALL FANTASY, regardless of gender. Frankly, I don't know a single soul, male or female, who knows how to do a genuine judo chop. The idea is just to have fun and delight in things like Michelle Yeoh machine-gunning the bad guys from the library balcony. It's also fun to see a cross section of ages among the ladies, again another thing never questioned in male action heroes.Could this script have been better? Yep. These gals deserved more.

Just keep in mind that the storyline is only there to support the fabulously executed fight choreography. You're there to watch them dance. The thinness of the plot is a feature, not a bug.My only complaint is addressed to the mixing balance of the soundtrack. When the score is bearable the dialog is unintelligible, and when the volume is high enough to understand the spoken lines the music becomes uncomfortably loud during the frequent fight scenes. I spent the whole movie with the remote in hand, going up and down on the volume buttons depending on what was happening. If I'd been in a theatre I'd have walked out and demanded [E: a refund].

I mean, it's like they purposely made it hard to place the time period for the movie with their artistic choices. A 1950's diner, late 1990s flip phones, 1980s walkman and Porche, and clearly modern TV in a few shots.There were definitely some unbelievable fight scenes, but it comes with the territory (though, most action films these days do pretty good jog of having the protaganists and antagonists making logical choices. In this movie, the ""bad guys"" are invariably dumb - unless they're miraculously tracking down the good gals, which they do unfailingly).The dialogue, was generally pretty good, and some of the situations were pretty inventive. At a few poignant moments, it was kind of stilted.I'd say the one thing that seemed a bit off-putting was that, invariably every ""bad guy"" was.. yeah, a bad GUY. And, every gal in the movie was, yeah, one of the good Gals. It just felt a bit forced and unnatural. I guess they could have titled the movie ""The Battle of the Sexes"".Look, I have three daughters and a wife who I love dearly all about female empowerment!

Is Gunpowder Milkshake a feminist John Wick? Kinda but not really as the story is more entangled but it absolute tries in this area. At other times, I felt some Kingsman steals in there with some of the action sequences and lead ups.Is the story something new? Absolutely not. We've all likely seen parts, if not wholes of this movie. But, is the movie a good watch? I think so and it's entertaining like a lot of movies of this genre.There are areas where this movie doesn't do enough and other areas where it does too much. That said, all the actresses do a good job and Karen Gillan does a great job, as usual. This movie also feels like it's decently edited and directed. The look/feel of the movie are well done as it likely has some bucks put into it.All in all, it's worth a watch. There are some good eye popping scenes with glorious acts of violence from Gillan. And you'll remain entertained by the action (mostly). But, you could also skip this movie and have seen it already. There's nothing new in the way of a story here and it even feels very borrowed and lazily put together. It does feel very much like someone said ""let's do a female John Wick!"". Then when the story was put together they feared it too similar and changed up bits and pieces. Is it Karen Wick? Not quite but might have been a better movie.",Gunpowder Milkshake

The writing is high school amateur and tries too hard, failing at a point horribly. It's all just absurd and boring. The fighting choreography is equally corny.

289,rossmcdee1,EXCELLENT CINEMATOGRAPHY AND LIGHTING- DIRE SCRIPT AND FIGHT ACTION,3,20 July 2021,"More time waste action twoddle with an incredibly bad script, full of stupidity and senseless contrivance.This film is so bad it may be funny if you like po-faced b-movie junk (as opposed to numerous brilliant b-movies!).. actually the script is more of a D-movie standard- laughable in it's ineptitude and contrived scenarios.The story is the same thing we've all seen hundreds of times before-with more wit,empathy and reverence to the genre than this, with some 'quaint' touches that are more nauseating than endearing,.The soundtrack is great... but not for this film, and is utterly inappropriate , ruining many scenes and distracting in others.The art design, production and cinematography/lighting are brilliant.There are some very good stunts,/stunt-work.The action choreography is sadly very poor, clunky and unimaginative- most likely due to the fact none of these actors can actually fight in a convincing manner.There are some very good actors, utterly under used and dreadfully directed, almost none of them have even remotely interesting characters to portray.The lead actress is rubbish, almost hilariously so... alcohol is probably required to fully appreciate the humour of how bad all this is? Her look of anger/contempt, rage or any other extreme state are all manifest by the same expression... a look of mild nausea or incomprehension.The woeful story romanticises the life of an assassins daughter- the idea is so pathetic it's hard to fathom just how moronic the writers of this kak actually are... for example, The hit-woman mother leaves her teenage daughter with a 'contract facilitator' for the 'Firm/Mob', to KEEP HER SAFE !!!! Ahem, so what do we see? She's become one of their top assassins, and then the mother says she's been watching over her for 13 (?) years , making sure she's safe... who can stomach this sort of crap- it seems anyone who writes a review telling the viewer NOT TO THINK during this brain rotten, coke fueled diarrhea.The stupidity of this film lasts for about 2 hours.The greatest farce in it is possibly the 3 Aunties armoury, and the storming of their residence. Others have mentioned it already, but if you can endure such cinematic rot, you will be able to swallow any sort of crap in a bap or 'video' box.The nitrous oxide 'Doctor' and bereaved mob-boss were so well acted it made most of the other actors/actresses appear plastic caricatures in comparison. Even Paul Giacomettis typically competent performance had little gravitas among the dreggy dialogue and misplaced direction.The only thing the director seems to have any real skill and affinity for are well staged head shots/ brain exploding bullets etc.Next time he may be better off using a GOOD BOOK as the basis of his story, when it comes to ideas and concepts his work is still infantile.",Gunpowder Milkshake

Diners with neon accents and a roadside flavor, turn into quickly into a generic diner between shots. This goes for almost every location. They lose every defining trait as soon as the slow-mo and music hits.Actresses did the best with what they had, but someone definitely wasn't making sure any aspect of this movie had quality control. One main character is killed in the most disappointing and uninteresting way. The blow that ends up killing her is only heard during a cut to black moment, that robs the moment of emotion.The action is slowed by the amount of slow-mo shots. Simple action scenes are made unbearable due to amount of film cuts. The amount of camera angle changes during one scene will make you feel dizzy. Some action actually will make you confused and questioning what was even the point.

302,jenniferbellydancer,Not bad but not great either,6,19 July 2021,"So keep this in mind, I have never seen any John Wick films, so I can't really compare them to this movie. While the plotline was pretty good, I thought the animation and some of the fighting scenes were kind of ridiculous. But maybe the animation is kind of the point since it does have that Tarantino feel? But there were certain scenes where I was just like ""why didn't you do that?!"" or the fighting scenes were not done very well.For instance, there is a scene where Sam is trying to get the money back after rescuing the girl from the thugs and she kind of just stands there as she watches them fight over the money, resulting in the money exploding. This is someone who is considered one of the most legit assassins ever and she just stands there and watches them fight over it and not prevent the money from exploding?! That made no sense to me.And there was a fighting scene in the diner where the men have the brawl with the women and one of the guys just makes it way too obvious he intentionally missed hitting one of them. Like come on, if you're going to make a femme fatale movie and have this sense of girl power, at least have this sense of the men fighting and the women just pushing back even harder to defeat them!Overall, it was very fun and entertaining to watch and I got some giggles out of it, but I probably would only watch it that one time.",Gunpowder Milkshake

Great gratuitous action sequences not too dissimilar from Deadpool and many others. However, up to a certain point, the story becomes a bit, dull? And then of course I got the whole feminist boost aspect of it. The film started off as just a good non-political original entertaining action flick, but then comes the political side with the firm being a metaphor for what I can only assume is all men holding women back. Change the record? It's such a shame as it holds the film back from being so much more than a political statement.",Gunpowder Milkshake

309,kennbr,Two men try to write a female-empowerment popcorn flick,2,18 July 2021,"I really don't have a problem with the all-female cast, but how do women not find this patronizing? About thirty minutes in I said to myself, ""This feels like it was written by men."" Then I looked up the writer and director, and sure enough, two dudes. The dialog and little female-literary-giant name-drops gave it away. It was the dialog that really ruined it for me, though. There's a point in the film where all the badass female assassins begin censoring themselves by saying things like, ""Fudge that!"" I don't know if the film was trying to be funny by pointing out the absurdity of them trying to shield a little girl from vulgar language while they're killing people in front of her, or if it was truly operating on a stereotype that all women are inherent nurturers and protectors that would naturally try to shield an impressionable child from naughty language. Then there's a terribly expositional moment where they're name-dropping all these female authors where a character actually blurts out, ""Very progressive, a feminist."" I guess they couldn't risk the audience not being familiar with the referenced author's works, but it was so clunky and unnatural that it made the actress saying it seem like this was her first role. The final coup de grace was the subtle-as-a-foghorn metaphor of the film's antagonists representing the patriarchy and its protagonists' triumph being some symbolic victory for all women. For people saying this was just supposed to be a popcorn flick, that was a really hamfisted attempt at social commentary.But it doesn't even have much going for it as a popcorn flick either. First of all, the noir genre is liked by many, but it was hard not to laugh when they made Gillan's character look like a liveaction Carmen Sandiego, and I'm still not sure if it was supposed to be funny or not. Then there was the nebulous assassin's-society world-building a la John Wick. Which is one thing to do if you're going to do it well, but the whole thing felt like a vague afterthought in this movie. I'm still uncertain if they were trying to make a satirical parody of that type of idea or if it was just poorly executed, but I didn't like that aspect in John Wick either. Where John Wick made up for it was in superb choreography and fight scenes, that while not exactly realistic, were good enough to make you suspend disbelief and made you feel like there was some seriousness to it. Gunpowder Milkshake's fight scenes, while not lacking in creativity for sure, had all the believeablity and seriousness of a Tom and Jerry cartoon. The one character with unquestionably badass fight scenes was Michelle Yeoh's, but unfortunately you only get to see her fight two different times.If the action had been better, I think it might have distracted me from the clunky, expositional feminist-pandering by the two male writers. As it is, I had to force myself to finish the film, and did not feel rewarded for staying it through. Do yourself a favor and watch The Old Guard or Kill Bill if you want to watch decent action scripts with female leads. If you just want to watch a Wickian popcorn flick, go checkout Nobody, or maybe just watch John Wick again. As a fan of all those movies mentioned, this movie left a lot to be desired.",Gunpowder Milkshake

Similarly, every scene felt like a choreographed set piece, whether there was action or not.Overall, I couldn't work out whether it was trying to be serious or funny - but if there was a knowing nod to the audience not to take this too seriously it wasn't obvious.I like Karen Gillan, and I guess a lot of people may watch this because she's in it, but personally I think she's better than this.",Gunpowder Milkshake

It is underwhelming to have such an amazing female cast and giving them nothing to really work with. No depth to personalities, no real story and just ok action.

I think there is definitely a subconscious message here given that all the protagonists are women and all the antagonists are men (not a big fan of when movies shoehorn stuff like that), but it's delivered in a cheese and entertaining way that the overall package is endearing.Some people have said this is worse than John Wick in the character development. I disagree because though I love John Wick, let's be real his character arc over 3 movies is less than most character's in one drama movie. So yes, the librarians are definitely underutilized (I really wanna know more about them!) and we don't really know much about the protagonist's deep inside feelings, but remember, we didn't get that much with John Wick either.Anyway, good action moments, some corny jokes, it doesn't take itself too seriously most of the time, and is the definition of a popcorn flick.

339,vert2712,"An incoherent, low-rent John Wick rip-off",4,18 July 2021,"If you want to find an example of how not to make a ""woman empowerment movie"", look no further than this sad, lifeless girl-power John Wick ripoff.Take the hokiest elements of the John Wick franchise, cut the budget of the fight/stunt choreography department by 50%, switch the gender of the protagonists to female and you end up with ""Gunpowder Milkshake"", a boring, lifeless action film that makes a good case for creating an Academy Award category for ""Best performance in editing a trailer that makes a mediocre film look exciting"".As the ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" and ""Jumanji"" films have demonstrated, Karen Gillan can be funny and believable as an action lead, but is neither in this limp hyper-stylized, neon-drenched turd of a movie which makes its Keanu Reeeves inspiration seem like a masterpiece of gritty realism by comparison.""Gunpowder Milkshake"" (a non-sensical title that has almost nothing to do with the plot) takes place in an even more absurd bizarro universe as the John Wick films: here, every single person on-screen is a criminal or has some connection with crime. There are no other living beings: no bystanders in the empty streets, no regular patrons in any of the various establishments seen in the film. You have to wonder whether these guys spend their time robbing each other, since there are seemingly no 'regular' activities. In lieu of the Continental hotel, we have a more budget-conscious diner which only serves criminals, and a hospital (more of a doctor's office, really) that only treats them. They seem to have good health insurance, at least, since nobody is asked to pay for medical services.No need to bore you with the plot details, because the story is just the flimsiest of excuses to have Karen Gillam (who is supposed to be a super kick-ass hit-woman) confront wave after wave of mostly clumsy henchmen who are hell-bent on killing her. Something about retrieving stolen money, or revenge for having killed the son of a mob boss, or protecting a little orphan girl. The motives are interchangeable and irrelevant. At some point she teams up with her hit-woman mom who of course abandoned her when she was little, and her sisters (who are librarians but also trained killers: like I said, everyone in the film is some sort of super-hero killing machine).It doesn't really matter: it's all an incoherent mess. Repetitive slow-motion sequences of relatively bloodless mayhem are interspersed with moments of attempted dialogue-heavy drama, showing the lead bonding with the little orphan girl, or reconnecting with her long lost mom, or having the mom argue with her librarian sisters. Who cares? The dialogue is stilted, and the bland attempts at characterization and woman-empowerment are as lame and cringe-worthy as you would expect from a film where the writers and every other single person behind the camera are men. The cast (Lena Headey, Angela Bassett, Carla Cugino and Michelle Yeoh) tries their best but the script doesn't give them much to do other than yell at each other and maim waves of faceless videogame-style enemies. Even the soundtrack is ridiculously overwrought and on the nose (one example: the closing scene, showing the triumphant female leads driving in a van on a sun-drenched highway, is scored with Mercury Rev's song ""Goddess on a Highway"").This is Israeli director Navot Papushados' first English-language film debut, whose previos movie (2013's Hebrew-language excellent revenge thriller Big Bad Wolves) was as nasty and darkly funny as ""Gunpowder Milkshake"" is bland and unoriginal.

Sure, some might say it gives you Kill Bill vibes with a mix of John Wick lore but who cares? It's Gunpowder Milkshake and it works. The characters are fleshed out enough that you do care about them, and I loved how each had their own personality that made them unique. Fantastic, over the top fight scenes that are enough to make this movie stand out by itself. Great camera work, settings, use of color, use of weaponry etc. This movie doesn't shy away from being a bit comical and that's absolutely okay because it owns that.

The acting was good. The plot was simple but unpretentious. The John Wick comparisons are unavoidable and it falls short of Wick in terms of intensity and choreography but it isn't trying to be the same. It's like a lighter, more self aware Wick with hope in place of despair. The violence is highly stylized which isn't something I'm always a fan of but they make it work well. I definitely recommend this movie, especially if you're a fan of any of the amazing cast members.",Gunpowder Milkshake

I spent most of it sighing, rolling my eyes, or squeezing my eyes shut.There was a lot of cringe packed into the first half hour.I was hoping for ""good campy"" humor, 50ies style, and good action scenes. The neon signs, the library, the diner, all those things sucked me in. The trailer I watched had good comedic timing, and lured me into its trap.Everything is ""off."" The dialog is off. The timing is off.Typically the pauses are too long, or the camera focuses on the characters after they're done speaking for too long, so the film is punctuated by awkward pauses. They all feel unintended.The world building in the first half hour is off too. The heroine is supposed to be a badass who made a name for herself, but her first two ""jobs"" ended badly due to incompetence.That's how she comes across. Incompetent.The truest, most funny line was from a side character, a doctor. ""What do we do? Well you can start by not shooting people!"" Because it highlighted the heroine's incompetence sandwiched between her false bravado episodes.Her dialog is intended to be demanding, curt, sure. ""Fix him."" ""Do it."" ""I happened."" However, the delivery (which is partly Gillian, partly writing, partly the timing issues I spoke of before) leaves us with an unbelievable character, because what people are telling us isn't what we're seeing.The first fight sequence is when I quit the film. By that point I was disenchanted with the heroine and the world she was living in. I was disappointed and already convinced I wasn't going to find a group of deadly, awesome women that the trailer had promised me.If you want a cool, intelligent, legitimately tough heroine, go watch The Old Guard.",Gunpowder Milkshake

In terms of plot and premise, there is nothing new or original here. The movie is set in a kind of John Wick inspired stylised underworld of secret societies, criminal gangs, and professional assassins. In Gunpowder Milkshake, however, the main kick-ass protagonists are all women, going up against groups of ridiculously cliched male adversaries. The script isn't going to win any Oscars, but that's not really the point. I could probably write a thesis on the never ending stream of formulaic actions movies that Hollywood churned out over the years where female roles are cliched and void of substance, and I love how this movie flips that all on its head. The action is imaginative and well choreographed, and Karen Gillan is hugely likeable in the starring role. She has a manner that is both endearing and at times very funny, whilst still looking cool in the fight scenes. Due to the nature and style of the movies, comparisons with John Wick are inevitable. However, to dismiss Gunpowder Milkshake as a Wick wannabee is unfair. Gunpowder Milkshake is well made and whilst it won't threaten the IMDB top 250 list, its above average and and unexpectedly enjoyable.",Gunpowder Milkshake

I loved it.Gunpowder Milkshake borrows shamelessly from others. From the stylised criminal underworld of John Wick, to the pre-fight eyeballing standoffs from Sergio Leone Spaghetti Westerns, there are recognisable references everywhere. The twist here is that all the main kick-ass protagonists are women, taking on and endless number of ridiculously cliched male adversaries. There's a clear statement being made here about the battle against sexism, but given the history that Hollywood has for churning out formulaic action movies with cliched females characters, I for one have no problem with a movie like this attempting to turn that on its head.Karen Gillan is incredibly likeable, and carries the movie well.

382,RogerRoger77,Too late to the party,4,2 October 2021,"If this had been released a few years back, it might have scored more points, at least for originality. However, the female-action-hero-who-can-kick-ass-just-like-a-man genre is now so oversaturated that a film really needs to be doing something much more original than this even tries to do to make its mark. We've had Hanna, Atomic Blonde, Anna, Salt, Kate, Black Widow etc all ploughing very similar furrows (not to mention TV shows like Buffy, Alias and so on). At this point, it would be more original to have a female lead who doesn't know martial arts, or one end of a gun from another.Ok, but how does this stand up in its own terms? Frankly, not very well. I like Karen Gillan a lot in many of her other projects (right back to Dr. Who!), but the script here does her absolutely no favours: if I hadn't seen her before, I would probably think that she simply isn't a very good actress. Her character is not much more than a cypher, and I simply didn't care at all about her or her (tedious) mommy issues.One of the more annoying features of the film is that the makers opt for the tired trick of trying to humanise someone who is, in reality, nothing more than a murderer by giving her an annoying kid to look after, to make her more sympathetic. Ok, this worked for Leon (and, to some extent, Kate), but here the manipulative nature of the plot device was just too transparent.Perhaps the biggest failing - somewhat fatally for an action movie - is that the action scenes are tired, clichéd and insipid. Living in a post-Bourne, Taken and Wick world, we've all seen much better.I'll be honest and confess that I gave up at around the 70 minute mark, but unless it suddenly became a whole other film, I can't imagine I missed very much.",Gunpowder Milkshake

387,Phillip Marlowe,Top notch cast wasted,4,17 July 2021,"The best thing--by far--about Gunpowder Milkshake is that the bright candy colored movie is a visual marvel to watch on Netflix in 4K and Dolby Vision with a solid internet connection and a late model top notch TV. (I saw it on on 2020 LG OLED. Thanks Joe Biden and the Congressional Democrats!) The second best thing is that it has a terrific cast, including personal favorites Michelle Yeoh, Carla Gugino, and Paul Giamatti, that in a more just world would have far better movies to work in. (These three are also among the few non-UK actors in the film though almost everyone uses a North American accent.) There is no third best thing.The movie is an unabashed collection of cliched plotlines, characters, and dialogue. (The producers of the John Wick films, no beacon of originality itself, in particular should sue if you could copyright plots and ideas. Which you can't.) While I realize that, although set in a recognizably contemporary world, this film is essentially a live action cartoon and as much a high concept fantasy as LOTR (though with less to say and far less believable), it's hard to forget that our heroines are all as much remorseless mass murderers for hire as the busloads of dispatched villains. (BTW, this is literal. At one point we see a bus loaded with dozens of murderous villains on their way to be dispatched.)

The movie doesn't seem to be making a statement though, so much as they felt like telling a story about fierce mama bear killers taking on an endless army of mobsters.Understandable. It's great seeing Lena Headey, Angela Bassett, Carla Gugino, and Michelle Yeoh in these roles. They don't usually get to play this much. For her part, Karen Gillan shows she can be a decent lead in a movie.",Gunpowder Milkshake
393,bingobingo25,Not nearly as bad as these reviewers are pretending it is,6,17 July 2021,"Funny. Sharp. The only weak link in the cast is Karen Gillan and her wooden performance which could potentially be blamed on a script riddled with clunky dialogue. I wish the bad guys were a bit more menacing and I'd love to know more about the librarians but this was fun! The first action sequence at the bowling alley is lazy and awkwardly choreographed and edited but the scene where a paralyzed Gillan has a scalpel and gun taped to her hands was truly wonderful and one of the most fun action sequences I've watched in ages.My one last thorn is the cheesy generic score. It sounds like a student film and not professional or fun at all but to end this, Lena Headey's the film's rose overall. She steals every scene with her radiating charisma and charm.",Gunpowder Milkshake

404,shailakumbhare-83719,Riverdale and John Wick's Horrifying Franken-Baby,1,19 July 2021,"This movie is everything that is wrong with Hollywood right now. It has all of my pet peeves about movies. It is style over substance and performative activism at its finest. It feels like the Franken-baby of John Wick and Riverdale. Let me break down my biggest issues with this film. Spoilers below
1. The feminism- My problem here isn't that the film is feminist, it is that it thinks its audience is so stupid that it needs to club us over the head with it. All of the good guys are girls and all of the bad guys are men. I think the best example of the heavy-handedness of this is the villains motive. Throughout the movie we know he's mad because the main character, Sam, killed his son. This is already an understandable villain motive. It doesn't need any more context really. But the movie adds the context that the villain feels like an alien among his wife and daughters and his son was the only one he could relate to because of their shared manliness. So now the villain is sexist, but it's just shoe-horned in. It's not built up at all, he just goes on a sexist rant about his annoying wife and daughters randomly.2. Hide your gays trope- Now I could be off-base on this one, but I think they were hinting at a romance between two of the library women. However, we don't see it in screen. If this was an implied romance it definitely falls under the same criticism that J. K Rowling and other writers have received for having gay characters but being too afraid to actually show their love. If you want to have gay characters don't cloak it in this mystery like it's a dirty little secret.3. The costuming- Ok, I'm being a bit petty with this one, but there is a large amount of screen time where Sam wheres this huge hat and a trench coat with a popped collar. It's so cartoonish. It looks like something Mary Kate and Ashley would've worn on their mystery series. On this vein is also the fact that she never puts her wisps into her ponytail and the bowling jacket. Of course female action hero has to make impractical decisions just to look cute.4. Acting- I hate to say this. It genuinely hurts me. I'm a huge Dr. Who fan. But Karen Gillan just isn't pulling it off for me. She comes across kind of flat. She's trying to go for the quiet intensity of John Wick (I can't stress enough how much this movie ""borrows"" from him), but it just doesn't work for me.5. The writing- So my main issue is the writing. This movie is so badly written. It makes no sense. So much conflict takes place off screen and then is just explained (Sam's father dying, Sam's mom getting revenge on her father's killer). I could go through this movie beat by beat and explain why every single plot point does not make sense. The very first scenes of the film set up that the mom has to go on the run because she has killed the man who killed Sam's father and now there are people coming after her. But, she kills the man's son and all his henchmen in the diner at the start. So whose coming after her now? They also set up that you can't have weapons in the diner, similar to the continental in John Wick. In this movie though it is just so clear that this isn't enforced at all. Right at the start the diner girl asks a guy to surrender his weapons and he just pushes her aside and goes in anyway. So why does anyone hand their guns over? Conflicts also just resolve themselves. Like, the robbers all just kill each other conveniently. When she kills the little girl's dad she shoots him for reaching for his phone but then just lets him answer it? Everyone just forgives each other for conflicts in seconds. She forgives her mom, the library women forgive her mom, the little girl forgives her, and there's barely any struggle to get there. The assassin league that's set up to be so dangerous and powerful is taken down by Sam simply threatening Victor who has many times made it clear he has no power in the organization. It just... it makes no sense.6. Action- I'll end here. I have more points but this is already too long. The action sucks. Bad guys attack one at a time or stupidly split up. People shoot point blank and miss the protagonists constantly. Things like metal trays block bullets. The hospital fight scene require such a suspension of disbelief you have to believe the movie is taking place in a parallel dimension where magic exists. In lots of the fight scenes you can count the beats. It's a mess.To conclude, this movie is terrible. Please Netflix, I'm begging you, there are so many talented writers and directors out there clamoring for a shot. You have the power to make GOOD movies, so use it.",Gunpowder Milkshake
405,shampyon,"A lot of fun, if a bit shallow",7,18 July 2021,"Some folks need to remember that ""not as good as (X)"" is not the same as ""bad"". This is a fun movie with fun action. In this review I'll address some common criticism of the film. I'll try to avoid spoilers, but some things may come close.1) ""It rips off John Wick/Shoot 'Em Up!"" No, it's more accurate to say they all clearly draw from the same vast well of action cinema - a bit of John Woo, a bit of Jackie Chan, a bit of Quentin Tarantino, a bit of Sergio Leone, and so on. John Wick and Shoot 'Em Up are far from original films (hell, Michael Davis straight-up admitted his film was based on the famous baby-saving scene in Hardboiled), but they're fun. That's what matters. I had fun watching this movie.2) ""It's SJW propaganda/She-roes vs Misogynists/Hating White Men!"" Aside from three chumps at the start who are clearly the d-list of their organisation (they get high on Nitrous in the middle of a job), there are no misogynist bad guys in this film, nor is race mentioned even once. There are white people and people of colour on both sides of the conflict. Hell, the antagonist is a self-described feminist who actually seems to be getting the protagonist on his side... until he commits the cardinal sin of Changing The Rules Mid-Game in order to sweeten his revenge. It is that, not Man v Woman, that is the central conflict driving the protagonist and much of the plot.(Honestly, this complaint seems to be something certain viewers decided on before they watched the film, then conveniently ignored every single actor and line in the film that contradicted it.)3) ""The story/characters are a bit thin!"" While there was enough for me to stick around, it is true that they could have been developed more. Perhaps that will improve with the writer's and director's future movies. But keep in mind that this is, after all, an action flick. John Wick isn't exactly a deep and complex character either (""My wife's dog is dead. Now I will emotionlessly slaughter a thousand people.""). As I said before, what matters is that it's fun. We're not watching a movie called ""Gunpowder Milkshake"" expecting Shakespeare.In summary: This is not the best action film you will ever see, but it's not a bad one. It's a colourful, fun popcorn action flick.",Gunpowder Milkshake

408,masterowl-58988,The action-movie equivalent to microdosing LSD,5,25 July 2021,"So many non-action scenes were incredibly weird, complete with stilted dialogue, off-putting music choices and unnecessary slow-motion. It sometimes made the movie feel like satire of generic 80s action films.

409,felixstaffanson,Wasted opportunity,4,20 July 2021,"It's such a shame that this movie is ruined by tacky writing. The premise for it was amazing and the general plot is also ok even if the way they got there was ridiculously stupid.

410,Spartanical,Inane dialogue..,5,26 July 2021,"Okay I'm giving this 5 stars simply because I didn't finish it and I want to give the cast of countless stars the benefit of the doubt that they actually read the script before signing on and found something in it that was redeeming. Who knows? But if I was rating it on only what I saw, It'd be more like 2.I don't understand what the writers were going for, but it was just a series of corny, wink-wink double speak. Then as seems typical of the more pointless movies today, certain characters are inexplicably rude/hostile but it is passed off as normal and sensical, all the while the main character, who has hardly spoken a word and whose confusion goes completely unacknowledged, seems to be regarded as somehow giving offense. It's just some weak attempt at painting the picture of a secret, insider-only world where the rules are meant to be known without explicitly being stated; and DON'T YOU DARE BREAK THEM! Oh the audacity in being a lowly outsider.These kinds of movies come off as lazily written, indulgent facsimiles of the esotericism inherent in the John Wick parallel universe.

You can literally see where the actors held back to give the protagonist a chance to defend herself.Needed to suspend reality a bit too much on this one. A good action movie must make you think that while unlikely, it's at least possible. Too many ""not a chance in hell"" moments, especially when it was clear that the hero can't fight.Breaks the rules.

With greatness like Angela Bassett and Michelle Yeoh however, I think it could have been much better.My main problem with the movie is that they structured the movie badly, so that the supposed emotional payoff isn't there. The makers of this movie are trying to impose feelings on you as a viewer, without the building blocks to create it.The introduction of the characters and their relationships are way to short to give us anything substantial. It's just enough so we know what's going on, but not a smidge more. All we really get to know about these characters are that they are badasses. And without character development you will never get more than a mediocre movie with great action set-pieces.This movie is lightweight like ""John Wick "", but I need a bit more substance to really appreciate a movie.

I liked every one of our leads in their roles, from the ladies to the villains they were against. Set design and cinematography was also very interesting, almost a Drive/Only God Forgives feel to many of the shots.Story was a little boring in the first act and didn't really ramp up until the hour mark. Action scenes were alright, but didn't quite have as much impact as they needed. I can't tell if the budget was low or the stunt choreographer didn't know how to work with the actor's abilities, but it just felt slightly off. The heavy use of digital squibs was very disorienting, but that seems to be more of a problem with many modern film than a problem with this one, but when it's action focused, you'll notice it a lot more.Overall it was a decent but forgettable John Wick styled movie.

Making it closer to an hour and some change versus 2 hours would have been a smart choice IMO. Some scenes just kind of meander and lag and don't drive the story forward.

467,weirdg,Netflix's all-female version of John Wick,4,16 July 2021,"This movie has a great cast of actresses, but the story is so poorly written. Needs better character development and fight choreography. The slow motion fight scenes really exposed how badly the fight choreography was. It was almost like watching an episode of Arrow.I'm all for inclusion and diversity in TV and film, but I'm getting sick of men being painted as the villains in movies where women are the heroines. If studios want to get it right, they need to make things seamless and less forced.Just to be clear, I'm okay with the women being the good guys, but the villains could have been a mix of men and women but they weren't.The story is incoherent and sloppy and you feel absolutely no attachment to most of the characters. It's really a shame too, because I've always enjoyed watching Karen Gillan, Lena Headey, Michelle Yeoh, Carla Gugino, and Angela Bassett in other movies and TV shows. Netflix had an embarrassment of riches to work with, but failed to put together a good movie.Oh... and I'm a big fan of Paul Giamatti and his talents were completely wasted in this.Going forward, Netflix should take more time to properly develop their projects so they avoid releasing more stinkers.",Gunpowder Milkshake
468,walrave-david,Emotionless action flick more about style than story,5,17 July 2021,I expected far more from an action movie with a lot of famous actors in it. It's more about the style it is presented than the story. Highly predictable and the action scenes are so far fetched that it comes laughable instead of exciting. Karen Gillian shows more emotions while playing as a robot in Guardians of the Galaxy. Only good to kill some time and when you have seen almost everything else on Netflix. Not recommended.,Gunpowder Milkshake

It had a good castthe cinematics and atmosphere were cool.Nice action.Now for the cons:
Predictable and standard hollywood writing.Lame magical solutions to get the characters out of bad scenarios.Well I guess it is kind of hard to know really were to put this.When I watch movies, some things catch my eyes for the better or worse.Some ilogical behavior can be ok in some cases, but when a movie like that uses it kind of everywhere like a magical solution to why none of the good guys (or girls in this case) actually getting hurt, it starts bugging you.And I did try to ignore it, telling myself that my expectations were too high, but I came with no expectation at all. There were some nice humorous attempts which were ok, but none save this movie from being just a mediocre one at best.If you have seen these sort of movies once, you deffinitely not losing anything by skipping this one. It bring nothing new, it is predictable and lazy in writing and for those of you that say that it is just a fun action nonesense movie, I would say that I have seen many many movies that are really bad ones that were much more fun than this one.",Gunpowder Milkshake

I found myself thinking about half way through that it was like Quinton Tarantino's little brother had tried to remake Birds of Prey after watching John Wick...but he screwed it up.In better hands this could have been a master piece. Seriously, look at the cast. However, the director misused every single one of these actors. For example, why is Michelle Yeoh, one of the original queens of action, not throwing punches? Instead they gave her an M16 whose stock was too long for her to get into the shoulder pocket. Lena Heady's dry wit was wasted. Angela Bassett's intensity was smothered. Karen Jillian, who flips everywhere in Jumanji during fight scenes, was given the most boring choreography I have ever seen. Really?

Not getting the John Wick (really?!) comparisons at all. It's not on the level of Kill Bill, but Tarantino is pretty much in a class by himself, so no surprise there.

But, it seems like an clunky ode to Quentin Tarantino's movies mixed with Dick Tracy-like (movie) colorful comic book sets. The fighting choreography isn't up to par for this type of movie. The whole tone is off, the director seems to have failed Karen Gillan on finding the right amount of percolating anger & resentment to bring to the character.

509,Nicky-add,Poorly executed ripoff of better movies with less budget,1,19 July 2021,"I can only assume the director of this movie is related to someone with pull in Hollywood.This movie is a fun concept, with great actors, good production design, and clearly has quite a bit of budget. $30M according to the internet.I imagine in the production meetings the director said things like ""I want this fight to look like John Wick"" and ""I want this to be like Kill Bill"". Part of me wonders if this movie was actually initially setup to be an action comedy or if the studio decided to call it a ""comedy"" so that the audience would be more forgiving.The bowling alley fight was an insult to stunt sequences. The choreography was trash, it was poorly shot, predictable, and boring. The set was beautiful though. The DP and G&E team did a nice job lighting the scene. If you have 30M to spend on your movie perhaps convince your lead to train with a stunt team for a few months before prep starts.... Like Keanu did with 87eleven before Wick...Lots of money was spent on techno crane and steady cam shots. These are my favorite tools of the trade. It's a shame to see them so poorly executed and overused. Also, framing matters.Sergio Leone style mariachi music can be fun but not in this movie where it was overused and felt gimmicky.""Mom always has a plan"". Great. My guess is the scene that sets this up either got cut or the director couldn't make his days and they just wrapped and said the hell with shooting it.What a waste of Michelle Yeoh's talents. She is an amazing performer. She is literally the closest thing the world has to a female Jackie Chan and she's an amazing actor.Quentin Tarantino does bad process car work in his films intentionally. It's fun. This guy's poor attempt at doing this was annoying.The bad back lot feel of the diner didn't come off as stylistically cool. It came off as lame.Bad ass assassins don't drive red 944s with automatic transmissions. Also, the fact that the car was fully armored was a really weak choice.All in all this movie seems like it was directed by a talentless hack who fanboys over better directors with vision and attempts to poorly imitate their art.",Gunpowder Milkshake

I've also seen enough action hero badass movies to know that they ALL take something from another action hero badass movie and make it their own. (Tarantino took his cue from Hong Kong action flicks. ""John Wick"" movies were spun from Park Chan-wook's vengeance films. And the beat goes on.) I hope they make a sequel.

528,gabedc-50804,It's fine! Lighthearted to a fault.,6,17 July 2021,"This movie has almost nothing that will keep you invested nor anything too bad. It certainly had much more potential than what was made, but it's very obviously not a serious or particularly deep movie. The trailer was perfectly representative of what it is and what you get, a simple, lighthearted time mostly composed of vibes and that's about it. And, no, there is no evil political agenda. It's a movie with a female cast. There are countless with only male casts. The fact that a female cast is even notable is probably a sign that it's lacking in attempts overall. That being said, I can see why people would be annoyed; it's whatever! It's fine. The cast isn't an issue, it's just alright.",Gunpowder Milkshake
529,tmasterino,"Action-Packed, Neon-Filled, Cartoonish Bloodfest",7,14 July 2021,"Gunpowder Milkshake is not a movie for the thinkers. It's not a movie that will make you leave the theatre reflecting on what you just saw. The story isn't inventive or impactful, the characters aren't particularly interesting and the dialogue is generic. Or... to put it simply: the writing does not standout... at all.However, if you know how to manage your expectations, you will have an absolute blast, because the movie gives us everything we could have wanted from an action-thriller. It's stylish, beautiful, action-packed, violent and incredibly fun.Director Navot Papushado and cinematographer Michael Seresin transform a generic script into a neon-filled blast, making smart uses of lighting, music, production design, make-up and color grading, creating the perfect atmosphere for such a videogamish movie. Scenarios such as the bowling alley and the library are also captivating, giving place to entertaining, expertly-choreographed, hyper-violent, creative action sequences... that unfortunately get worse as the movie progresses, but are pretty fun nonetheless.In conclusion, Gunpowder Milkshake isn't to be taken seriously. It's fun, simple, violent, captivating and you will wish for more. It's contrivances will certainly affect the more demanding watchers, but if you take the movie as seriously as the movie takes itself, you will have a great time at the theatre.",Gunpowder Milkshake

Apart from that, this film is still a banger, if you like the humour and the kind of retro aesthetic. Besides, I LOVE the library. It has so much hidden treasure! I'd like to visit the library one day and that's what make it an 8. And I love Michelle Yeoh's fight scene.

Gunpowder Milkshake has an eye catching list of quality actors, but the story is flat and the effects are definitely on a smaller budget than most. The choreographed fight scenes were borderline comical (one where the protagonist fights 3 guys looks like it was sped up using iMovie on an old iMac). It is basically a cross between John Wick, Kill Bill, Jason Bourne, and the TV show Alias.

Is done perfectly, no. Problem is the actresses in the movie don't actually know how to shot a gun in real life most likely. If you expect the level of detail that Keanu provided in John Wick you need to look elsewhere. That being said it is good at what it provides, a mindless sugar pop woman killing movie that really shows off Gillian's action chops. But this movie was suppose to be sort of poppy and gruesome and not really totally serious. It sort of gives that away in the title. If you expect a serious movie like John Wick I think you will be pleasantly disappointed. Just enjoy it as it is meant to be and not try to compare it to the obvious comparable movie.

Why not use a good stunt double like in Jumanji instead of humiliating Karen with the worst fighting choreography?Then the director told Karen: ""At the hospital, you will channel your inner Nebula as well, same voice and expressions but this time Nebula thinks she's a headless chicken and her arms won't work, but no worries a little girl will tape a knife and a gun to your hands so you can whip them out aimlessly and even when your fingers won't work, as you spin and whip your arms somehow the gun will fire and you'll win the fight against the same 3 stooges"".The parking lot and library action sequences are truly the creative work of a Bonehead, pun intended.This is the level folks... this is how bad this movie is, no joke or exaggeration.Lena Headey looks confused in the little time she appears in this movie. There's a scene where Karen and Lena are escaping through a kitchen freezer door from bunch of half witted chumps. And Lena Heady, for no reason at all says to a total stranger (Chef) ""that freezer is a mess, someone should clean that up"" Why would a fleeting trained assassin stop to justify her actions to a stranger? Made Lena look like a moron.I could go on.... I can see why the overall rating is so low, as low as the writer's IQ.This movie deserves 0 stars rating for wasting this amazing actresses talent, insulting women and audience intelligence .

I have never been more wrong about such a thing. In Gugino's series JETT, there is no scene, action or word wasted. Everything ties into everything and there is a marvelously tight script for every episode. I wouldn't recommend GPMS to anyone, it insults your intelligence and wastes a truly phenomenal cast by giving them little to no developed dialog and presents a ""story line"" that could have been written better by a 5th grader.If you want to watch a really great action movie, watch The Old Guard or Atomic Blond.

The tone was constantly switching making it confusing to define what the movie is. Karen Gillian I had a difficult time watching cause of her awkward acting. It was stiff and seemed like she was trying really hard sometimes.

The writing isn't great so it fits nicely in with most other fun, exciting and silly action films we are accustomed to. Try it out and remember that you're sitting on your couch and not in front of the big screen.",Gunpowder Milkshake

Total fail at girlpower.To everyone saying ""it's good, an 8 even, if you just turn your brain off and enjoy the action"", I tried and I failed.To everyone saying ""just take it as what it is"" I agree, and would give it a 10 if the genre was 'boring ripoff'.",Gunpowder Milkshake

I'm even more pleased, though not the least bit surprised, to see there are plenty of insecure guys having fits of apoplexy over this fabulous movie.

623,dont-psychoanalyse-me,"Fun, but not fantastic",6,16 July 2021,"Ignore all the reviews freaking out about the feminism/woke-culture aspect of this movie. There are issues with this movie but they lie primarily in the lazy directing and writing and have nothing to do with the gender of the protagonists (why would they?).Lemme start by saying this is a fun movie, it's got the aesthetic sensibilities of Baby Driver and the excessive violent action of a grindhouse flick with enough humour to keep you from getting bogged down in the blood. Where Gunpowder Milkshake fails is in giving its characters depth, keeping the direction fresh and obeying its own rules.Sam, deadly protagonist with mummy issues, is the character we get the most insight into, nevertheless much of her characterisation and growth is fumbled and crudely depicted through rushed dialogue and all-too-easy forgiveness speeches. Her mother and the mysterious Librarians are even less fleshed-out, and the consequence is that as a viewer I really didn't care enough about what happened to these characters. In such a state of apathy even the climax held little tension. Much of the flashy editing we expect from these types of movie is over-used and cringe-inducing. One Spaghetti Western inspired stand-off is cute, two is just unimaginative. The climactic battle suffers for its resemblance to the scenes which came before it, despite being quite a lovely fight scene in its own right.Finally, the lore and logic of the film's setting is confused. We are told explicitly about one mysterious organisation, The Firm, and later on discover there are actually two organisations, the other unnamed, and they aren't really enemies but don't work together either. For some reason they also run a 1950s diner where guns aren't allowed, but which everyone brings anyway. The Librarians seem to be their own entity, but their purpose is never properly explained either. It's like the writers wanted the feel of the John Wick universe without really thinking any of it through.Despite all this, Gunpowder Milkshake is a treat for the eyes, dancing through aesthetics from every decade from the 40s to the 90s and crafting some delightful scenarios for a good throwdown. The bowling alley and the hospital fights were certainly memorable, as well as the underground carpark chase which was inventive and original. All-in-all I enjoyed this movie, if you like your violence to look good and don't mind if there's not much nuance, then grab a milkshake and go nuts.",Gunpowder Milkshake

627,j-hedman,"A decent ""turn off your brain and have just fun""-action movie.",5,14 July 2021,"Gunpowder Milkshake is what happens when you get a great cast of female actors together and a script that isn't as great. Which is a shame cause all of the actresses are actually very good at what they do, but this script just won't let them shine. Some dialogue and some of the ""jokes"" fall kind of flat.Characters in the movie makes weird decisions, wielding tomahawks when the whole library is filled with firearms for example.The use of slow-motion in the movie gets very repetitive and just drags out action sequences. Don't get me wrong, slow-mo can be a very fun and cool tool to use in action but there is such a thing as overdoing it.None of the villains in the movie get any real character development, they're literally just there.However, the style and the kind of retro aesthetic of the movie really works (for me at least). Badass women blasting and slashing random henchmen to death? Fun!But it is a overall decent film, nothing that's gonna blow you away or anything. Just decent, try to relax and enjoy it, maybe check your phone during the slow bits (it's a netflix movie after all).",Gunpowder Milkshake

633,dagsolsteins,John Wick meets Shoot 'Em Up,7,29 August 2021,"This is the type of movie where you can shut off your brain and enjoy the action and fun, and it does a very good job at it. If you're starving for more John Wick style criminal underworld, this will scratch that itch while also being overall more ridiculous with the fight scenes being reminiscent of Shoot 'Em Up.The movie takes the ""Girl Power"" approach with all of the protagonists being female, but that's where the effort ends as it often feels as if the screenplay was written/directed with a male character in mind. This can be felt the most in the fight choreography which mostly regurgitates the same moves we've seen in man-on-man fights in other movies. Ultimately this makes the evil boss-man's monologue on ""not understanding women"" ridiculous, since the movie failed to show any distinction between its male and female characters to the point where you could place Keanu Reeves in Karen Gillan's role without changing anything.Overall the movie is a fun watch for a lazy evening. The plot is abysmal, but the movie makes it obvious that the plot is secondary which is fine. The movie tries to go against the male-centric mainstream but fails by neglecting to actually make their female characters female.",Gunpowder Milkshake

I'd probably give it a 7, but I've overmarked to try and compensate for the incels.As a man who is not intimidated by women existing and was looking for a fun, stylish popcorn movie with plenty of action, great aesthetics, and an even greater cast it (mostly) ticked the boxes.Lena Headey was the standout, I'd argue this type of role is her at her best; imperious, sexy, convincing in the action, wryly humorous and still a striking beauty at 45+. I'd love to see her take the lead role in a spy thriller or even her own action franchise.Angela Bassett brought fire and gravitas, Michelle Yeoh was elegant with understated strength and a natural grace in fight scenes, Carla Gugino brought warmth and an unexpected poignancy while Paul Giamatti was Paul Giamatti. Karen Gillan was okay but overshadowed by Headey and the Librarians.If there's a sequel/prequel I'd watch, and if it focuses more on Scarlet/The Librarians even better.",Gunpowder Milkshake

653,trippnobles,Missed the mark!,6,16 July 2021,"With this cast, it should've been a much better movie! A lot of people are comparing it to John Wick. While I saw similarities with JW and Kill Bill and the list goes on, I believe it wanted a Smoking Aces style. It failed. Miserably. KG's performance was robotic and emotionless. LH was doing the best with what she was given. MY, AB and CG did well in the short period they had with it. Same with PG. Let me say that I'm a big fan of ALL the actors I listed. But, the writer, director and editor must have been on a amphetamine bender. The script failed at giving us a character to care about or cheer for. I don't believe this film knew what it was. Personally, I believe the goal was (maybe) John Wick, Jason Bourne, Kill Bill meets Smoking aces. I would rate 5.5 if allowed. Unlike a few comments re: Women=good Men=Bad, I feel like this movie resisted the temptation to tear men down to elevate women. It could've gone there. But, (for the most part) resisted the overt pandering that other reviews stated. It's not a bad movie. It's not a good movie either. And what's with clearing stating rules by characters then, immediately breaking them as if they'd forgotten what they just established for the viewer?!
