0,TheLittleSongbird,"Much better than expected, but a case of being more faithful not always equalling better",7,19 June 2016,"Don't let the subject matter of Vladimir Nabokov's book put you off, it is a brilliant book and one of the most entertaining, thought-provoking, poignant and daring pieces of literature there is.Stanley Kubrick's 1962 'Lolita' film, while not one of the great director's best, even when comparatively downplayed, is a brave and worthy attempt and is a fascinating film that gets funnier, more layered, sensual and better with each viewing. This is not personal bias talking, speaking as someone who is not afraid to admit that Kubrick's debut 'Fear and Desire' was a shockingly bad misfire and that he didn't properly find his style until 'The Killing', with his first masterpiece being 'Paths of Glory'.This 1997 film, directed by Adrian Lyne and starring Jeremy Irons, Dominique Swain, Melanie Griffith and Frank Langella, could have been a disaster and to be honest in hindsight I prepared myself for it to be. Actually it is a much better film than expected. It is more faithful to the book and there is more of the story, which understandably will make some prefer this film. The book is very challenging to adapt and like Kubrick's this is a more than laudable effort that should be applauded for trying. At the same time though there is something missing, a case of being more faithful not always equalling better. Despite more of the story and details being here, Kubrick's version, even when hindered by issues with the economy and censorship which played a part in not having the full impact of the book, this reviewer found more layered and with much more of a sense of danger and ahead-of-its-time feel, with this version almost too conservative and soft-focused in places.It also drags badly in some of the final third, especially towards the end with some long-winded scenes that go on longer than they needed to, giving the film a slightly overlong and stretched feel. And while the cast do very well on the whole, Melanie Griffith disappoints and is no match for the hilarious and poignant Shelley Winters in the earlier version. Griffith is too attractive, and not only is more irritating than funny but fails to bring any tragic dimension to the character.However, 'Lolita' (1997) is an incredibly well-made film, with spot-on attention to detail and it's shot and photographed superbly. Lyne is no Kubrick, which in all honesty is a big ask, but does a very solid job directing, directing with an elegance and tension. The script, especially the beautifully delivered and powerful narration, is intelligently written, with more focus on the tragic and sexual elements, which are pretty well done and well balanced. Some parts are quite moving and there is a genuine sensuality, one does miss the deliciously black humour though. The story is mostly well executed and is absorbing, everything included is well told and never incoherent and rarely dull but could have had slightly more impact.Jeremy Irons makes for a splendid Humbert, a cruel but tortured character here (thankfully not the total creep that Humbert could have been in lesser hands) that Irons plays with the right amount of cruelty and pathos, while he is somewhat too civilised to be classed as a monster he is very believable as a seducer. Dominique Swain in the title role, like Sue Lyon, is too old, but is compellingly sensual and gorgeously seductive but also affecting. The chemistry between them is beautifully played. Frank Langella is suitably odious as Quilty, and just as sinister as Peter Sellers. Before one forgets, the music score is really quite marvellous, whimsical, haunting and elegiac, like its own character, and there is a preference to the one in the earlier version.All in all, much better than expected and certainly not a sacrilege. It's just that despite being more faithful it feels like there is something missing as a result of perhaps being too faithful. 7/10 Bethany Cox",Lolita
1,SnoopyStyle,the anti-Kubrick Lolita,5,21 August 2015,"As a 14 year old in 1921 Cannes France, Humbert fell in love with older Annabelle but she dies from Typhus. In 1947, Humbert Humbert (Jeremy Irons) starts a professor job in New England. He rents a room from Charlotte Haze (Melanie Griffith) who has a flirtatious 14 year old daughter Lolita (Dominique Swain). Humbert ends up marrying dislikeful Charlotte to stay close to Lolita. Charlotte discovers Humbert's secret lust for Lolita and gets killed by a car. Humbert drives Lolita on a road trip but lies to her about her mother. There is always Clare Quilty (Frank Langella) around.The opening shot of Lolita is way too thirsty. The sprinklers getting her wet is completely over the top. It reeks of desperation from trying to top Kubrick. It's like a bad teenie porno. Melanie Griffith is an inferior Charlotte. Her character is smaller and less interesting as a minor role in this film. In another anti-Kubrick move, Quilty is reduced back to his original size. Jeremy Irons and Dominique Swain take up most of the space in this over 2 hours movie for better or worst. Dominique does a nice job. Jeremy Iron is a great actor as always.My biggest problem is that his character is constantly the victim in this version. He is superb in convincing the validity of his love for Lolita. Jeremy Iron does this sympathetic weakness. He does the same thing in 'Damage' but in this case, it's very off-putting. It goes beyond the fear of discovery. While it may be more true to the intention, it makes it a harder thing to watch. I always wonder what the movie would be like from Lolita's point of view. By the last act, I got very tired of Humbert and his patheticness. At that point, I found his narration like fingernails on the chalkboard. The movie is already too long and I couldn't wait for it to be over.",Lolita
2,rmax304823,Time to give up.,9,13 October 2003,"One of the best and most important novels written in English in the 20th century and they cannot get it right on the screen.Maybe it's the fact that the novel itself is so packed with word play and games that it simply doesn't transfer that well to a different medium. A voice-over can maybe give us some of it -- that famous first paragraph -- but the problem is that there is such mellifluous gamy prose on every single page. (I think there are only about three sections in which Humbert doesn't undercut his expressions of love and guilt with irony.) How can we transpose HH's offhand rhetorical remarks like, ""Where is the rapist in therapist? Where is the jest in majesty?"" And that's not to mention all of the literary allusions or comic references to pop culture.The story itself is so simple that, if Lolita weren't twelve years old, it would be just another love story. And, I was, by the way, surprised when this film was released at the horror some people felt -- oh, my gosh, a movie about pedophilia. I mean -- in this day and age? Movies about thinly disguised pedophilia of course have been around for years -- ""Sundays and Cybele"", ""Pretty Baby,"" among others. And the Shirley Temple movies may not have been all that innocent either, she prancing about in those tiny skirts reeking of popcorn and lollipops, wagging her tail, a forty-year-old midget for all we know. And if we think of Lolita as innocent and corrupted, we don't know as much about what's happening with kids that age as we might like to think. This is a story about pedophilia in the way that ""Faust"" is a story about Satanism. Jeremy Irons is superb here, as he is in almost everything he's done. One can't help comparing this version to Kubrick's earlier one, and this one isn't as good. Dominique Swain is no Lolita. She's an improvement over Sue Lyons, to be sure, but not actress enough to break a grown man's heart, or to project that peculiar combination of meanness, crudity, and ultimate loneliness that Lolita embodied. Melanie Griffith does what she can with the role of Charlotte Haze but I thought Shelley Winters brought a bit of additional, maybe unintended vulgarity to the part. Griffith is serene and self-confident, which is closer to the Charlotte of the novel, but for unashamed raw hunger nobody can beat Winters.The direction is competent, not much more than that. But this is a hollow movie. It fails to capture the outrageous humor of the novel (""I was a pentapod monster....""). The score is lugubrious. The photography gloomy where the novel is filled with summer warmth, aspens, butterflies and sunshine. In other words, the movie treats the novel as a ""masterpiece,"" deserving serious treatment, which is the kiss of death for ""Lolita."" Like Strick's attempt to film ""Ulysses,"" all the humor is lost and what's left is a kind of humdrum story about people talking to one another without having that much to say. But if you are interested in unusual love stories I can recommend seeing this. See Kubrick's piece as well. They're rather different, because Kubrick, maybe realizing he could never capture the wisecracks in the novel, at least brought in Peter Sellers to provide laughs. But here, Quilty, Frank Langella, is little more than an ominous shadowy presence, whereas both in the novel and in Kubrick's film he was a terrible and hilarious tease.",Lolita
3,moonspinner55,"Faithful adaptation with one terrific performance, but aloof film is never absorbing...",5,29 September 2006,"Flirtatious girl named Lolita Haze has ruinous relationship with her new stepfather, Prof. Humbert Humbert, who only married her mother in order to be close to the young temptress. Stephen Schiff's adaptation of Vladimir Nabokov's controversial novel, directed by Adrian Lyne, is exceptionally faithful to its source (which wasn't the case with Stanley Kubrick's version from 1962, this despite the fact Nabokov was credited with that film's screenplay). One can tell almost immediately that Schiff and Lyne obviously revere the novel; they astutely, amusingly include details from the book that stick in your mind, such as Lolita's love of brushing her teeth or the sound of the toilet-paper roll spinning in the Haze bathroom. Unfortunately, while Jeremy Irons is very fine as Humbert (although, perhaps, too conventionally good-looking for the role), the other performances fail to measure up. Frank Langella, in Peter Sellers' old shoes as Humbert's walking paranoia, is too far over the top, while lanky Dominique Swain isn't much of a presence as the new Lo (she tries to be squirrelly and teasing, but just looks like she's showing off). Melanie Griffith fares the worst as Lo's nagging mother; Griffith never learn to modulate her voice, and she's completely out of her league acting alongside Irons. Lyne's film is full of hypnotic images, but the narrative doesn't hold up (the last act crumbles and finally falls apart). The '62 version is more surreal, more suggestive, simply by not showing as much. Kubrick got deeper into the crazy muck and mire of the book, and his interpretation remains the superior choice. ** from ****",Lolita
4,Theo Robertson,I Blame The Director,3,15 August 2004,"I`ve never read Vladimir Nabokov novel LOLITA or seen the 1962 Kubrick version but someone say there was an air of tragical satire between American and European values in the novel with this being present in the Kubrick adapation ? If so this seems to be absent in the most recent version
And yet both Stephen Schiff`s screenplay and Jeremy Irons performance hints that the story is a tragic farce caused by the catalyst of Humbert`s forbidden ( Imagined ? ) desire for his under age stepdaughter . When we`re introduced to Humbert after the credit titles , he bangs his head against the wall and lacks any sort of grace . He`s a total klutz , a sort of sad pathetic shmuck and his character interaction with Melanie Griffith`s landlady seems to reinforce this . Unfortunately director Adrian Lyne seems to have missed the point as he gets Dominque Swain to play the title character with as much subtlety as a bull in a china shop which destroys the whole tone of the movie and turns it into a rather uneasy film to either watch or comment upon",Lolita
5,grantss,"Not as good as Kubrick's version, but good enough",7,10 September 2015,"Good adaptation of Nabokov's novel, though not as good as the 1962 Stanley Kubrick version. Captures the controversy and sinfulness of the Humbert-Lolita relationship well. Far less subtle than the Kubrick version, though not at all graphic. Does drag from about 2/3rds in though, and feels excessively long in the end. The latter scenes in the movie could easily have been condensed into something more interesting. This said, the Kubrick movie also suffered from this affliction.Mostly very similar to the Kubrick movie, plot and sub-plot wise, though this version does shed some new light on Humbert's motives, which does tie up the story quite nicely.Solid performance by Jeremy Irons as Humbert Humbert. Melanie Griffith is quite irritating as Mrs Haze. Frank Langella is also a tad irritating as Quilty. To me, Peter Sellers' portrayal of Quilty in Kubrick's version was the stand-out performance of that movie. Sellers also had more screen time.While Dominique Swain was OK in the role of Lolita, I preferred Sue Lyon's portrayal - more innocent, less bratty. If you haven't seen the Kubrick version, this is worth the watch. Less watchable if you've seen the Kubrick version, as the two movies are very similar. However, there are some differences, especially at the end, which makes this worth seeing too.",Lolita
6,Boba_Fett1138,Better than currently given credit for.,8,13 May 2008,"Well, with already ""Lolita"" from 1962, by Stanley Kubrick, circulating, expectations for this 1997 version weren't very high. How can you ever beat a Kubrick? Well, this version doesn't exactly beat the better Kubrick version but it simple is a real great movie on its own nevertheless, that really deserves to be seen.This version is of course somewhat different from the 1962 Stanley Kubrik movie and as far as I understood, this version stays actually closer to the actual Vladimir Nabokov novel. What this movie does is trying to explain why Humbert Humbert likes them younger, while I believe in the Kubrick movie he isn't interested in Lolita at all in the beginning and actually tries to fight it but finally falls for her fatal seductions. In this movie they both want each other from basically the moment they see each other.It perhaps also makes this version more sensual, although it's not very hard to be more sensual than a movie that got made back in the early '60's. This version is also more sensual due to both Jeremy Irons and Dominique Swain. There is nothing wrong with James Mason and Sue Lyon but Jeremy Irons and Dominique Swain have a better natural chemistry together. And while Frank Langella ain't no Peter Sellers, he does a good job in his role, even though his role is rather restrained in the movie, which is a sort of a waste of such a fine character and actor such as Frank Langella.It simply is its fine and also controversial story that makes this movie such a great one. I like movie don't portray things as being black and white. A pedophile is not just a pedophile and this movie shows how a seemingly normal man with a respectable profession falls for a 14-year old girl. When you read about a story like this in the paper you tend to see; 'What a creep!' or 'how sick!'. Real life however of course isn't as simple and black and white as you would read about in the papers. It's a multi-layered story with complicated characters, feelings and emotions.Adrian Lyne once more shows that he is a real capable director. He doesn't make an awful lot of movies but when he does it's often something really good. The movie has a good style although the movie made me wonder why they didn't attempted to give the story a more modern update. I mean, there basically is no reason for this movie to be set in the '40's. He lays the emphasis mostly on the two main characters, which does go at the expense of the other characters obviously but it's a choice he made and did not worked out all too bad I must say. Really a movie worth seeing. Give it a change, even if you known that it just simply can't beat the 1962 Kubrick version.8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",Lolita
7,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,Great acting and a great film,7,28 August 2004,"Having seen neither this nor the Kubrick version of Lolita, a few weeks ago, I started to wonder, if the films are really as great as they are made out to be; so, after reading as much as I could about both films, I finally bought this film on DVD. After having watched it, I was very impressed, both by the acting and the overall film quality. The theme is based on the well-known novel of the same name, by Russian author, Vladimir Nabokov. I found it very well-presented; unlike what you might expect, you don't loathe or despise Irons' character. You may find some of his actions disturbing, perhaps even disgusting. But you understand him, and you sympathize with him. The plot is great, it evolves at a very good pace, rarely standing still at any point. I don't think there was any point during the film where I was bored. The acting is great; Jeremy Irons gives a stellar performance, as do Melanie Griffith, Frank Langella and Dominique Swain. Of all those, I think it was actually Swain who impressed me the most; maybe it's because this was her first film, and she didn't have any acting experience. Or maybe it's because, well, despite knowing that she was very young when she made this film, I was, just like Irons' character, Humbert, attracted to her. Her performance as Lolita is amazing. The cinematography is very good, at times great. The dialog is well-written and well-delivered. The characters are well-written and credible. The amount of humor in the film, however little it may be, was good. It helped the viewer ease into the somewhat uncomfortable subject of the film. The climax of the film is great; despite being hinted at, throughout the film, it came as a surprise, and truly sent a chill down my spine. Now, as I mentioned early on in this review, I have not seen Stanley Kubrick's version of Lolita; I have not read the book, either. Therefore, I can't really say if this is an accurate depiction of the story or not. But I found it to be a very good piece of cinema, and I suspect most people interested in the subject would too. I recommend this to fans of any of the actors, possibly Nabokov's novel, and/or people who are interested in the subject matter. I will advise anyone who sees it, though, to be prepared; the film is quite explicit, and some will definitely take very much offense from it. If you can sit through the film, though, you probably should. It really is great. 7/10",Lolita
8,Bored_Dragon,Ignore description on IMDb,10,9 October 2016,"""A man marries his landlady so he can take advantage of her daughter."" - The worst description of this movie possible, lie that gives a completely wrong picture of what you can expect to see in this film.Disturbed, but at the same time very romantic and sad love/life story, much much better than the original novel by Nabokov. One of my favorite movies of all time.10/10""She was Lo, plain Lo in the morning, standing 4'10 in one sock. She was Lola in slacks. She was Dolly at school. She was Dolores on the dotted line.

9,videorama-759-859391,"A all new Lolita, that will whet many appetites",8,12 May 2014,"Here was another remake, I enjoyed more than the original, this one would of really come well across the big screen. Perfectly filling the boots of the Lol real here, Swain is one hell of an acting revelation. She can act, but also as proved in this, can act younger than she looks. She's the whole package of Lolita: cheeky, innocent, flirtatious, and soon to be manipulated and corrupted, by a playwright/pedoarse, (Langella, hauntingly evil) who's a bad turn of fate upon Irons in the finale. Swain is up against some stiff acting competition, like her older lover, Irons, her strict and selfish mother, Griffith, really impressive, and of course Langella as I mentioned before, who cringes like a toad, for his sins, in the finale which I really liked. This time around, Lolita has been done more visually, with more plotting and life poured into it's characters, sorry Stanley, although that vivid sunbaking scene, to whet your whistle, I never got out of my head. It was easy to see, the controversy that burst out from the public, accusing it of promoting pedophilia, where there was one or two scenes with our leads stark, making love, that actually bordered on crossing that line. Adrian Lynne, of course renowned for that 86 hit, Nine And A Half Weeks (god that was a long time ago) has done us proud here, or remade us proud here. A must definitely watch: of course it's main reason, fresh new acting find, Swain.",Lolita
10,smatysia,"Good film; not better than Kubrick's, but different",8,4 June 2000,"I didn't really expect to like this film, being a fan of Stanley Kubrick's 1962 masterpiece. But I did. Really excellent work by all major cast members. Adrian Lyne was able to bring out the road movie from Nabokov's novel much better than Kubrick. Kubrick really couldn't film the vastness of America since he'd rather die (obviously) than film in the U. S.
The casting of Jeremy Irons was interesting. James Mason as Humbert Humbert was sort of a regular looking guy caught up in this terrible obsession. Irons was much more believable as a pedophile, which is sort of creepy, and I'm not sure what that says for Irons. I'm a little surprised that Melanie Griffith took this role, wherein she looks quite unattractive. This was good however, she nailed the part. Frank Langella was sufficiently creepy as Quilty. Dominique Swain was extremely impressive in her acting debut. She was, however, still too old for the role, as was Sue Lyon in '62. From the book it seemed that Lolita was more twelvish than fourteen. Yes, that means Nabokov's Humbert was a seriously sick puppy. Throughout the film Lyne seemed to constantly point the camera at Miss Swain's bare feet. Fifteen or twenty times. I'm not sure what's up with that. Maybe it's a visual metaphor for unhealthy obsession. Anyway, in spite of my initial reservations, I thoroughly enjoyed this show.",Lolita
11,MarieGabrielle,Beautifully filmed...,8,8 March 2012,"This film tells the narrative in a visual way with haunting music, flashbacks in sepia from Humbert's past, first sexual experience at age 14, and his subsequent landing in New England as a professor who stays at a boarding house against his better judgment. He is attracted to the landlady's nymphet daughter, Lolita.One has to be an artist, mad enough to choose the devil, the nymphet in the group of schoolgirls, he reflects. For some reason, Dominique Swain, while at times sensual, comes off as lanky and silly in some scenes. Perhaps this was the directors intent to further demarcate the age difference, although Jeremy Irons slips into the role in a believable, somewhat humorous sense, scarcely believing his luck that the young seemingly innocent child is more promiscuous than he has ever been.The early scenes with Melanie Griffith as Lolita's frazzled mother are amusing, she gives a good performance as lonely widow wanting Professor Humbert to herself. She sends Lolita to camp, Humbert is beside himself. There is an amusing scene where he visits his physician asking for a prescription to ""knock out a cow"" so he will not be disturbed while sleeping in the marital bed. Mrs. Hayes finds the disparaging comments Humbert has made about her in a diary, lashes out at Humbert and dies in a tragic accident.Be careful what you wish for, Nabokov (book author) seems to be telling us. Now, Professor Humbert has Lolita all to himself. He takes her cross country after he breaks the news that her mother has died in hospital. Lolita accedes to his wishes, in bed, and becomes his obnoxious travel companion.Her childish pranks begin to grate on Humbert and things begin to unravel. Admittedly the side story with Quilty (Frank Langella) doesn't work as well as it could have, although Langella always does have an interesting and sinister presence.Overall recommended, as Irons gives another good performance here, the girl could have been cast a bit differently, however. That said, also watch the early Stanley Kubrick film with James Mason, Shelley Winters and Sue Lyon, as Lolita. Also read the book for a better framework from which to view the varied film versions. 8/10.",Lolita
12,Spleen,Nabokov lifts Lyne above himself,8,1 September 1999,"The closer a director sticks to the letter of the book, the odder each divergence looks.  If we were to look at the date given in the book's mock preface and count back the years, we would (I suppose) find that the story begins in 1947 - so Lyne dutifully begins the story in 1947.  (Kubrick's setting, more indeterminate and more modern, was also more successful.)  But why, if he was so obsessed with dates, did he compress events into just three years?  If it was to allow the older Lolita to be played by Dominique Swain, then it was surely a mistake: she looks impossibly youthful even for a seventeen-year-old, and there's no particular reason to use the same actress in any case.  Lyne was careful to include as many scenes from the book as possible.  But why bother doing so, when he often removes the sting from them?  The scene where Humbert gets the `knockout' sleeping pills from his doctor is retained, but we never see its culmination.  The crucial big fight between Humbert and Lolita in Beardsley remains; but Lyne muffs (as Kubrick doesn't) the disturbing way in which it suddenly ends.  I'm not convinced that Lyne always knew WHY he was including a particular scene or detail.  `It's in the book' isn't a reason in itself.Kubrick deserves credit, too, for telling the story without resorting to (a) memory-style flashbacks, and (b) verbal narration.  Indeed if there's one single damaging flaw it's Humbert's frequent voice-overs.  Very often he says no more than what is obvious to anyone attending to the story or images or dialogue - and what's the point of distracting us from the movie in order to tell us what we'd have been able to work out if we hadn't been distracted?  On the rare occasions when the narration actually gives us information it's either information we don't need, or information we could have been given some other way.  It's simply a weak device.  Yes, Nabokov's first person narrative is superb; but that was a book and this is a film.All the same it's a good film.  We ought not sneer at the fact that it looks good - very good, in fact, and I urge you not to judge its appearance from what you may have seen on television - since it looks good in the right way: we see the tourist attractions of America as a motorist would see them, but beautifully shot, as if imbued with poetry by Humbert's overactive, lovelorn mind.  It's important that the affair between Lolita and Humbert not physically repel us, and it doesn't.  (No mean achievement considering that Dominique Swain is only fourteen.)  This is really no more `the movie of the book' than Kubrick's version was, but enough of the book survives to make it well worth watching.  -I'm putting it uncharitably.  Let me say rather that Nabokov's posthumous gaze keeps Adrian Lyne honest.  The director of `Fatal Attraction' somehow manages to avoid cheap sensationalism.  Not nearly as sharp as the Kubrick version, it's by no means foolish, and has its own languid charm.",Lolita
13,DeeNine-2,"Maybe they ought to remake ""Gigi"" while they're at it",8,7 June 1999,"The first thing amiss with Adrian Lyne's ""Lolita"" is that Melanie Griffith is entirely wrong for the part of Charlotte Haze. ""The Haze woman"" must be UNattractive. Shelly Winters in Kubrick's Lolita (1962) was perfect for the part because she was a woman who had once been attractive, but had become fat and had lost her looks. Charlotte must be unattractive as a contrast to Lo (and not just in Humbert's mind); furthermore the references to her as a ""fat cow"" and Humbert's disinclination to make love to her, do not play well if she's attractive. Melanie Griffith is actually better looking than the young star, Dominique Swain, who plays Lolita. Swain is pretty enough, however, and although not the great beauty that Sue Lyon (who played Lolita in the original) was, she is actually sexier, and she is an excellent actress. She does the coquettish muggings better than Sue Lyon did and she is allowed more latitude. Humbert never even kissed Lolita in Kubrick's version! The direction is patently stupid in parts as though Lyne wasn't paying attention to his film. He has Humbert stare at Lolita in the famous scene when he first spots her on the lawn much, much too long so that Charlotte Haze could not help but notice his noticing. And in the scene on the front porch, with the three of them together on the couch, Charlotte would have to be blind not to see the sex play between the two right there in front of her eyes.This is a cynical, loveless Lolita. The scene at the Enchanted Huntress is not enchanted. Instead Lo teaches Hum some sex numbers. By the time they are in the car driving away from the Enchanted Huntress, the romance is over.Once on the road, Humbert finds out that he has to be a father as well as a lover. She thus begins to despise him. But she has nowhere else to turn. The rooms of the motels are not romanticized. Lyne makes them sorted and cheap. He shows a sign advertising ""Children under 14 free"" at one of Humbert's choice stopping places, slyly reminding the cognoscente that Nabokov's nymphet should be younger than Shakespeare's Juliet, who was thirteen. (Given the puritanical nature of the American political psyche, neither Lyne nor Kubrick was able to make a ""true to the book"" film.) Irons is now looking older with the stress of taking care of Lo and dealing with his forbidden love.Lyne wants to emphasize the idea that Lolita has been robbed of part of her childhood. She becomes a prostitute, effectively speaking, as she negotiates with Humbert about quarters and dollars for her favors. Kubrick glossed over this while Lyne highlights it. When Humbert tries to grab her saved-up money for fear she will use it to escape him, she shouts indignantly, ""I EARNED that money!"" We feel no affection or identification for Humbert as played by Irons because he seems so consumed by his sexual need that he is aware of nothing else. James Mason as Kubrick's Humbert at least aroused our pity. In the novel and in the Kubrick film it was clear that Humbert loved her. In this version it appears that he only wants to use her to get off. And in fact can only get off with her, and so in one sense he is her prisoner.One of the strong points of Lyne's film is the photography of Swain. The camera brings both her adolescent body and face alive. She is natural and confident. It's hard not to feel a strong affection for her. Again I would like to see more evidence that Humbert loves her. In some scenes we see that she, in her on-again off- again way, loves him, as though she cannot not help but love him because there is no one else. It is kind of like we love our parents because they are our parents--and hate them since they control us.The Kubrick film and the novel had Humbert as the focus. The Lyne film, despite the Humbert voice-over, is really seen from Lo's point of view. And Lyne did not, I suspect, like all the comedy in the Kubrick version.The really terrible thing about Nabokov's tale that both directors got right is the unrelenting possessiveness of Humbert, the unrelenting control he exercised over Lolita. That was his undoing of course, and really shows the perverted nature of his love for her. If he had really loved her, he would have stepped aside and let her live a normal life. That's what fathers do. That he loved her as a woman is not in itself a tragedy. It was the jealousy and control. Lolita makes this clear when as the pregnant, married and glasses-wearing ""Dolly,"" looking common and matronly in a cheap house with a dirt yard and a working-class husband, she sees Humbert for the last time.Lyne wanted us to focus on something sad and corrupted. This is a Lolita for the Nineties. She is exploitative; he is a sick man she is exploiting. This interpretation will be more agreeable to some since it reenforces the idea that teen sexuality is wrong. As usual, we see that nobody cares about the girl. The feminists know she has the sexual power, and they are jealous. They want to put her off limits so that they have a better currency themselves. This is the political position of the sexual wars, and Lyne has fallen into it. I think we need a French Lolita, as done by somebody like Louis Malle. I don't expect this for another hundred years, however.

14,Spuzzlightyear,Jeremy Irons Weird Role # 27435,7,2 October 2004,"Once again, we have Jeremy Irons playing a complete scumbag (please see Dead Ringers, Reversal Of Fortune Madame Butterfly etc etc). In Lolita, Irons plays Humbert Humbert, a man with no morals whatsoever who sees nothing wrong with falling in love with his landlady's 14 year old daughter, then marrying the Landlady, so therefore the girl is now her father. Even though the material here IS quite questionable, Adrian Lynne pulls it off quite remarkably well with the acting from Irons and Dominique Swain as Lolita. Melanie Griffith and Frank Langella I can take or leave. One thing that I liked about this film is the superb art direction, with the late 1940's feel being handled quite well. Somewhat of a surprise.",Lolita
15,Joxerlives,A laudable attempt to film the unfilmable,5,12 February 2013,"Going in you know this has to be a film which treads very lightly around the most sensitive of subject matters. In that regard it succeeds admirably, there's nothing remotely titillating here, indeed the only real nudity is Frank Langella's rather startling full frontal scene as he flees a gun-toting Humbert in the finale. From start to finish despite the beauty of the photography and Humbert's elegiac narration it's plain to all that this is a tragedy, Humbert's final words are those of regret that through his selfishness he has denied Lolita her childhood (and through the ultimate revelation it seems the joy of motherhood too).Plenty of good here, Irons is great as Humbert (to think this is the guy I watched as a child on kids variety show 'Playaway'!), handsome enough for the role but not some blatant Casanova, you can understand why he appeals to women without casting him as an incorrigible womanizer or pervert. He achieves the near impossible task of creating audience sympathy for a man who attempts to drug rape an adolescent virgin (or so he thinks). Melanie Griffith does well with the frankly thankless task of playing Lolita's mother and Swain is fine as the title character, a shame she never seemed to be able to capitalize upon the brief fame it brought her. Langella almost steals the entire show as the odious Quilty (the dark reflection of Humbert himself, murdering him as an act of self-loathing?).If there's one flaw it's that ultimately it falls short of confronting the monstrosity of Humbert's actions. Dominique Swain's Lolita is always clearly a teenage girl on the verge of womanhood, she's very obviously 14. In the book Lolita is only 12, the film chickens out from casting a girl who looks the correct age as it would just be too uncomfortable for the audience and legally difficult to cast an actress who'd look the right age but have to take part in (both literally and figuratively) 'adult' scenes. Casting her as older puts everything in an altogether different light (Humbert and Lolita's relationship would actually be legal in parts of Europe and the US at the time) and lessens the impact of the taboo being broken, with every year older she becomes the subject matter is conversely less shocking. In the end the film doesn't have the courage of its' convictions. Still I think that ultimately it is the best adaptation we shall ever have of this most controversial of literary classics.",Lolita
16,CharltonBoy,A Beautifull Film,10,17 February 2000,"Lolita is by far the best film i have seen in a long , long time. Most people know the story so i wont go into the plot but what i will say is that there cannot be a better adaptation of a book than this. Some people will shy away from the subject matter and that is understandable but it far from tastless in fact i would go as far as to say that it is beautifull.

18,EijnarAmadeus,Lyne outdoing Kubrick,10,27 July 2010,"LOLITA by Adrian Lyne, was immediately and understandably compared to Stanley Kubrick's adaptation of the novel by Vladimir Nabokov, and although I think Kubrick made a wonderful film, what I do think director Lyne's version does better, is the way it captures the tragedy of it all, instead of the comedy. Tragedy in the sense that it dares more than Kubrick's film did (which I believe has nothing to do with the censorship in the 60ties), because director Lyne isn't interested in sexually or provocatively exploiting the relationship between Humbert (a marvelous Jeremy Irons) and Lolita/Dolores (Dominique Swain), he makes it sort of enigmatic, carefully lingering and beautiful. More faithful to the novel, the film successfully achieves the great character nuance of the civilized and sophisticated Humbert Humbert, and the way he falls completely in love with such a obnoxious and difficult child, who's at the same time such an alluring, facetious and sexual creature. Another stronghold for the film in its dignity as an adaption of the novel, is Ennio Morricone's sweepingly romantic and classic score. It may just be a notch better than Kubrick's film, and for me personally, as an adaptation of the novel, it also rings more true.",Lolita
19,manitobaman81,Good,7,18 August 2014,"Jeremy Irons proved to be a better choice than James Mason was in Kubrick's version. It's the kind of film that proves that a small story can be much more meaningful than a larger one. The colors are amazing and seem to follow the mood of the story. The highlight is the last scene in which Humbert surrenders. The cinematography is stark and bare, with only the soundtrack adding some effect. From an artistic standpoint, there were some plot elements and character developments I didn't think were totally needed. They do however drive the story, which seemed to be their purpose, so I can accept them. Nothing to laugh at.",Lolita
20,alice liddell,"No butterflies: this film lacks beauty and delicacy, and so cannot fly.",3,27 August 1999,"Let's try something original; talk about this film without mentioning Nabokov or Kubrick.  Impossible?  Probably.  But cinema owes no respect to literature, so let's meet Lyne on his own terms.Plot: rather dull.  The Humbert/Quilty confrontation is necessarily muffled. Actually, I can't keep this up.  This LOLITA doesn't exist in its own right: it suffocates in the shadows of its predecessors.  The whole point of the novel (NOT AGAIN.  GROAN...) was a mocking of ideas of 'plot' and character.  Humbert is a madman (he confesses to many stays at 'sanatoriums' (sic?)), supposedly dying in prison, who manages, in a first draft, to create a work of polished beauty and perfect artistry.  Yeah right.  He is constantly playing games with the reader, with Nabokov playing further games on him and us.  Whole passages, of seemingly vital plot importance, are undermined by parody, pastiche, allusion, word-games.  The vital final clash is played as hysterical farce, as is much of the book.How on earth do you capture this on film?  Kubrick ignored much of the (untranslatable) book to created a masterly black comedy, which forswore Humbert's mendacious viewpoint in favour of Nabokov's more detached eye (funny how the hyperintelligent Vlad failed to notice this).  It is, however, primarily a Kubrickian work, with the source material serving as a blueprint for many of the director's favourite themes, especially the idea of a moral monster as point of audience identification in his struggle with a repressive society.Lyne, rather facilely, thinks that because Kubrick did not stick to the letter of the book, that he somehow betrayed it.  His film is therefore superficially authentic - we are back in 'real' America, not Kubrick's English invention (which actually transliterated very well the book's themes of appearance, pastiche, deception and reproduction).  But throwing in a few 40s signifiers does not a sense of time and locale make, and Lyne completely fails to grasp Nabokov's use and subversion and understanding of popular culture, as one of the two forces shaping Lo.The major impression one gets from the book is the sweltering heat, the 'haze' (also Lo's surname), and this too is faithfully reproduced.  But this only serves to make realistic a novel which is always rupturing into the fantastic.  Lyne makes the fatal error of taking Humbert at his word.  The glorious mixture of wild, disturbing farce and poignant melancholy of the book, is seriously unbalanced by almost completely obliterating the former, and drowning the film in the latter.  Yes, we sympathise with Humbert, but he's a fiend - he has sex with pubescent girls; he enjoys his mastery and their pain; he tries to murder Charlotte, and only fails because he is too timid; he drugs Lo so that he can sleep with her unawares; the money he so generously offers her at the end was hers anyway, through her mother.  I mention these examples because they are suppressed in the film, as it tries to make of Humbert a tragic figure.  This is helped by the fact that Dominique Swain, wonderful nymphet that she is (although the ideal Lolita is surely Shirley Temple), is far too old, tall and beautiful for Lo: in an age where Catherine Zeta Jones and Sean Connery are a viable box-office item, there doesn't seem to be anything all that distasteful about the relationship.And so the film is actually profoundly scared of the book, not daring to make us sympathise with an absolute monster.  The casting of Jeremy Irons conspires in this.  He is superb, his best since DEAD RINGERS, but he is not Humbert, he has no madness, no poetry; more like Charles Ryder twenty years on.  James Mason specialised in suave lunatics, and his perceived 'coldness' is a perfect interpretation of Nabokov's Humbert, as opposed to Humbert's self-image.  This LOLITA is as safe as can be - there is hardly any sex at all (I mean, we wouldn't want to offend anyone, would we?); the style is glossy and fatuous, TV-movie blandness, abandoning Nabokov's figurative language, and offering none of its own.  The detailed descriptions of landscape in the novel have an untranslatable moral import: Lyne gives us a few blurry shots of trees.  The film is such a mockery of Nabokov that when we do get unimaginatively large chunks from the novel, they actually, unbelievably, sound daft.  The Quilty climax, one of the funniest scenes in literature, and perfect in the Kubrick (with Sellers: how could it not be?) is reduced to FATAL ATTRACTION-style psychodrama (Nabokov, even beyond the grave, was spot on about modern cinema).  Once again, Lo's anguish, in the hands of a 'sensitive' male (Lyne), is reduced to hysteria. Very sporadically, there are moments of cheeky Nabokovian farce (especially when Humbert checks that Charlotte is asleep, and the interviews with Lo's principal), but the Nabokov tone is never caught, the sense of cartoon, non-sequitur, and sheer charming Humbert bull, is rejected as not being highbrow enough.  By trying to be so serious, the film ends up looking silly.",Lolita
21,diane-34,"A sensitive, poignant film",10,6 February 2000,"I rented Lolita on the weekend after having never seen Kubrick's version nor having read Nabokovv's novel; therefore I saw the movie totally fresh except for having read the odd newspaper article about its controversial nature.I thought the movie was brilliant; I thought Lyne's direction was remarkable and the acting was virtually faultless.  Iron's Humbert was an immensely tragic figure-a man damned by the fates of his past, toyed with by the chances of his present and led inexorably to his future demise by forces his scholarship had ill-prepared him for.Adrian Lyne's photographic direction was superb; his camera angles and choice of shot distances was perfectly matched to the unfolding tragedy. So many directors seem to be overawed by the story they're telling, particularly with famous-books-to-film, that they lose sight of the nature of cinema-that is, cinema as a separate art form, meaning the images must be crafted as a movie rather than a filmed stage play.  Lyne succeeded  where so many others have failed before him; he has used another art form, crafted it and created something new-something brilliant in its own right.Above all else, see this film and marvel at its beauty, be moved by the tragedy of its characters and ruminate about the vagaries of our humanity.

22,Angeneer,Trapped in its controversy,7,15 May 2000,"Since I have not (yet) read the book, I cannot rate the adaptation, so for me it's a film on its own. In general, I liked it. It has quality, good dialogues, beautiful cinematography and a perfectly cast Jeremy Irons. At the beginning Dominique Swain, except for the teacher's eyes, managed to capture mine also, so I very much sympathize with the guy! And what a performance by this young girl. But after an hour or so, Irons' obsession with her becomes tiring and is not well explained. As the film progresses, we see the magic being lost gradually and we arrive at a totally Hollywood ending. My guess is that they tried to fit in very few minutes dozens of pages, that's why the result is so shallow.",Lolita
23,Flagrant-Baronessa,"Introspective, delicate - but far too long",7,7 August 2006,"This is a long, introspective adaptation of Nabokov's acclaimed novel 'Lolita', starring a superb Jeremy Irons and a then 15-year-old leggy Dominique Swain in the lead roles. It is an effective film in the sense that Adrian Lyne makes us see the appeal of Lolita, but at the same time makes us understand that we could never be attracted to her. It all bottles down to Humbert's (Irons) past experiences and his subconscious search for a 'child' he loved and lost when he was young, finding this child in Lolita and obsessing about her.Lyne introduces a narrative by Humbert in Lolita, which is a vital device to the story, because seeing things from his perspective, he becomes something of a lovable pedophile. We feel for him. Everyday of his life after meeting this young girl, he is consumed with love for her and this is captured beautifully in the film through long visual shots. Their relationship is certainly an illicit affair - and it definitely feels like it from a viewer's perspective. All the kissing, fondling, cuddling, the looks - it gets rather intense and very uncomfortable at times. Lolita is arguably one of the least likable characters in film history; she is an ill-mannered, manipulative attention-whore who knows the power she has over Humbert and uses it to her advantage for money, attention and just generally to hurt people. I have not read the book, but I understand she was a bit more subtle in it - intelligent, witty. In this film she reeks of Britney-like schoolgirl sucking on lollipops and chewing on jawbreakers. Perhaps the filmmakers thought that this would make her more accessible to late 20th century audiences. It's wildly stupid.While the film has plenty of powerful passages, it is far too long. It really drags on toward the end so as to do the book more justice by adding pseudo-depth to it. Film is a different medium, so I think Lyne should have had a bit more fun with the script - not as much fun as Kubrick did with his version (which was unbearably silly), but lighten up just a bit. I cannot pinpoint any more negative aspects to 'Lolita' (1997), but I know there clearly are some because I was not too crazy about the film when I saw it.7/10",Lolita

26,hasosch,Humbert Humbert and Hermann Hermann,8,17 December 2009,"Nobel price laureate Vladimir Nabokov was a specialist for doubling of personality, elimination of individuality and confusing the reader by using multi-perspective levels of narration. Both in ""Despair"" (filmed in 1978 by R.W. Fassbinder) and in ""Lolita"" (filmed in 1962 by Stanley Kubrick and in 1997 by Adrian Lyne), the protagonist is suffering from an impossible love. In Despair, Hermann Hermann breaks apart living together with his ""stupid, scatter-brained"" wife Lydia, starts to see himself, looks for a real Doppelganger (who has no resemblance with him), kills this Doppelganger and starts his Trip into the Light (so Fassbinder's sub-title to his film).In ""Lolita"", a college professor who bears strong resemblance with Edgar Allan Poe (cf. Annabel Lee vs. Annabel Leigh) looses as a boy his 14 years old girl friend (Poe married a 13 years of girl) by death. Since then, he is without inner rest and looks to find her in another body. Who is Humbert? And who is Humbert? A split personality as Hermann Hermann? Too late in the film version of Adrian Lyne we learn about his antagonist, Clare Quilty. Who is he? How was is possible that he could liberate Lolita during the night from the hospital, after the physician told Humbert that he will keep her until the morning and Humbert was waiting directly before the hospital during the whole night, sleepless, in his car, his eyes directed to the only entrance and exit? Is Quilty Humbert's Alter Ego? Totally dissimilar to him as is Felix Weber to Hermann Hermann? At the beginning and at the end of the movie, we see Humbert sparkled with blood from his execution of Quilty. Of course, this could be Quiltys blood. Or --- did he try to kill himself - but did not succeed - while Oscar Wilde's Dorian Gray actually did succeed? But there is another motive, as I see it, which gives the whole novel a quite strange last perspective which has been constantly overseen. After Humbert's Doppelganger Quilty has liberated Lolita, she lives in a relation to a young man from whom she is pregnant. Humbert needs years to find her, crossing all around Amerika. She confesses him that her love to Quilt was the most intense in her life, and when he asks about her love to him, she looks like she has already answered his question. Neither one of them survive their love. She dies in child-bed the same year, he dies five week earlier in prison from a heart disease. Thus, the end of the story reminds strongly Abaelard and Heloise who could only be together after their death.",Lolita

What i liked about this more recent version is Jeremy Irons playing the part of Humbert Humbert and so precisely. This film in my eyes had a certain Kubrick quality to it. This is high souled genius if you ask me with a fervent faith that art is a divine game. and that pleasure in art consists in following the moves of the game with the artist himself when he communicates his own playful and Godlike bliss. Poet and pervert, Humbert becomes obsessed with twelve year old Lolita and seeks to possess her, first physically and then artistically, out of love. The magic of nymphets. This is a dizzying seduction, a masterpiece in a strange dimension, very rich. Lolita is a major work in fiction, equally intense as wildly funny. A Medusa's head with trick paper snakes chewing gum.

Frank Langella is barely in it as Quilty and ""seems"" like he has some interesting issues clouding what's left of his brain.A 6 out of 10. Best performance = Mr. Irons. It's not up to the Kubrick version, although I ""think"" (haven't read novel in many years) may be closer to the tone and feel of this touchy issue.

32,basilisksamuk,Much better than the Kubrick version,9,24 February 2013,"Lyne's version of Lolita is a million times better than Stanley Kubrick's version, which wouldn't be difficult. I admit James Mason was good in the original and so was Shelley Winters but you just can't do an American road movie in Britain. Kubrick's badly-judged, conservative and unfunny adaptation was frankly rather poor. Adrian Lyne, formerly known for less than scintillating films such as Flashdance and Fatal Attraction, has done an excellent job of bringing Nabakov's difficult and challenging novel to the screen. He has chosen to stick fairly closely to the original plot and he has managed to walk the difficult tightrope of balancing the story of Humbert Humbert's obsession with the satire of American life observed. The production values are astonishingly high and would shame the sterile efforts of the average frock movie hack. I was utterly convinced that this was 1940's America and the sets, the locations, the clothes, the props were all so believable I wanted to walk right into the film and live there. In fact this was probably also the film's most vulnerable point – at times it looked so good that it could have been an advert.Jeremy Irons recorded an unabridged audiobook version of the original novel and it's well worth seeking out. I'd heard this first and found it almost impossible to imagine anyone else in the part than Irons. He is the right age. He has the right air of naivete and doom and the gravity to deliver the lines required without sounding silly. In many ways it is the same character he played in ""Damage"" and indeed this has many resonances with ""Damage"". Dominque Swain is perfectly cast, having the look of a child and the look of a woman at the same time. Her acting is astonishingly good and she ought to go on to greater things if this film doesn't ruin her like the first version ruined Sue Lyon's career. And yes, she is incredibly sexy and yes, Adrian Lyne has gone out of his way to make her appear sexy often using low camera angles and lingering shots of her legs and shoulders and face and whatever else he could get away with to make the point. Why should this be a surprise? This is Humbert's story and if the director can't make us feel the passion that Humbert feels for Lolita then he wouldn't be doing his job. Frank Langella must also get an honourable mention for his role as Quilty, a part badly misjudged by Kubrick when he cast Peter Sellers in the role.A certain amount of hysteria surrounds this film, often stirred up by the popular press. However, rest assured that if you weren't a child molester before you saw Lolita you won't be one after you see it, any more than you will become a Jedi knight after watching Star Wars. Humbert Humbert is a sad lonely man who destroys what he most loves and this is clearly portrayed in the film",Lolita

You feel every minute of it and that is an amazing thing.While the subject matter is taboo -- the story of Humbert Humbert's (Jeremy Irons -- The Lion King, Reversal of Fortune, Being Julia) love for a 14-year-old nymphet, Lolita (Dominique Swain in her feature film debut) -- the story is one of true beauty and depth. While the story is both disturbing and distressing, the moral dilemma each of these characters find themselves in becomes one of true fascination. Perhaps reading Nobokov's novel is essential to better understanding where Humbert is coming from with this undeniable love and so I would highly recommend the read (the prose flows) as this is a beautifully tragic human story that should be felt.Truly faithful to its source, I was impressed with the high production value, the cinematography and haunting score composed by Ennio Morricone.

It's impossible to review this film not comparing it to Kubrick's 1962 film, but that one is simply better, and although not as close to the novel as this one, it captures the spirit of the novel much better. Also, this one, though more recent, didn't age so well as the latter, and sometimes gets corny and unintentionally funny. However, it still has some powerful moments, and it's a very beautiful, moving experience. The cinematography is gorgeous, the actors are all very good and Frank Langella's interpretation of the character is one thing I consider superior to the 1962 version, even if Peter Seller is a great actor, he is far too funny for the role, and while that one works much better as a dark comedy than as a drama, he is sort of miscast. The highlight of this film is actually the music score. Ennio Morriconne's beautiful soundtrack never fails to bring me to tears, it perfectly captures the mood of the film.

They see them as their peers. A lot of adolescent teenagers already have grown adult figures which might intensify their sexual fantasies. It's complicated to explain why they are not attracted to adults instead. Partially, they want to control their objects of affections. This movie indeed showed those vital characters.Some scenarios were far-fetched in the story like the playwright's role and mother's death. However, they were faithful to the novel. Jeremy Irons played a very convincing Humbert who covered all the flaws in the story. I could see why this movie was censored at that time. I saw 1962 version also.

Adrian Lyne's Lolita is only 21 and it's already forgotten. Jeremy Irons is very good but it doesn't have any of the embarrassing self awareness of James Mason's Humbert Humbert. James Mason was monumental. Then, Kubrick has Shelley Winters as Mrs. Haze - in my book, her best performance - she's a jarring human spectacle. superb. Lyne chose Melanie Griffith in what very well be her worst performance and one of the worst in any movie, ever. Kubrick had Peter Sellers and his performance is already part of film legend. Frank Langella is a bit of a shock in Lyne's version, not the good kind. And then Lolita herself Stanley Kubrick had Sue Lyon and although she was a bit older than Navokov's Lolita, she is sensational. The innocent temptress and destroyer. In Lyne's version, Dominique Swain is pretty and crushingly obvious. Kubrick's version is a masterpiece, exciting to be able to say that 56 years later.",Lolita
41,Mobithailand,A faithful adaptation of a great novel.,7,31 March 2016,"After I finished the book, I watched the 1997 film version of Lolita, directed by Adrian Lynne and starring Jeremy Irons and Dominique Swain. It is a well-made film and faithfully follows the book in pretty much all respects, but omits some of the events described in the book due to time restraints.Irons is a believable seducer, 'Humbert Humbert', and he captures the essence of a man lusting after 'forbidden fruit'. Swain is excellent as the promiscuous and provocative 'Lolita' – depicted as a 14-year-old in the movie, rather than a 12-year-old, as in the book.Neither the book, nor the film in any way glorifies nor condones the act of sex with underage girls. Nor does it make any excuses for the protagonist's illicit desires and actions. It does however, seek to understand what motivated him, how he came to be the way he was and why did he go to such lengths and take such risks to satisfy his urges.If you are interested in fine literature, read the book and then maybe watch the movie. You will not be disappointed.",Lolita
42,Primtime,Not faithful to Nabokov,6,14 July 1999,"Adrian Lyne's portrayal of the famed Nabokov novel has all of the beautiful cinematography, enrapturing score and great acting that one would expect. However, this film still falls short of actually presenting what the novel is all about. It isn't a tearjerker about the innocent Humbert Humbert being unfairly taken advantage of by the bold, yet still childlike Lolita, it is in fact the exact opposite.After watching this film, I couldn't help but feel sorry for Humbert and his endless longing for Lolita. After all, Lyne makes it seem that Lolita used him, then took off with another man who could give her the satisfaction that she needed. Nabokov never intended for this to happen in the novel, so why is Lyne so unfaithful himself to the actual story?The strong point of this film is the large performance of Jeremy Irons as Humbert, a man who truly loves Lolita very much and never could fight off any feelings for her. One can see the pain build up within Irons as the film progresses until the final scenes in which he finishes off Quilty (a very unnecessary scene). My favourite scene of the film happens to be near the end when Humbert is being followed by the police, drives into a farmer's field and proceeds to get out of his car and just stand there. This scene alone speaks more than the majority of the film itself.Melanie Griffith seems miscast as Charlotte Haze (who in Nabokov's novel is fat and unattractive), I don't know of many men who would want to subdue her with sleeping pills every night in order to pass on their ""husbandly duties."" Dominique Swain puzzles me in the role of Lolita. She captures the whole nymphette quality, but should have been a little more subdued at times. She seems slightly more childish in her performance than Nabokov intended.I would give a slight recommendation to the over 16 crowd who have an appreciation for the more artsy-type films like Lolita. However, it may seem quite subdued when compared to all of the hype.6/10 stars.",Lolita

44,HarlequeenStudio,The truth is not PC,10,20 June 2017,"This film is true to its source novel. And it also tells the uncomfortable truths: the monsters are sometimes not 100% monsters and they can be handsome. Looks like a lot of self-righteous people out there expect Humbert to be a cartoonish character, so they will be disappointed and maybe terrified when they start to sympathize with him while watching this film. And I guess they expect Lolita to be the victim - which she is, it's just that people have this idea of victims as non-threatening, saint-like individuals, void of any sex-appeal. They pretend to think that nymphets don't exist and that they have never seen Brooke Shields. Dominique Swain, what is she then? Well, I can tell you she is a perfectly cast nymphet. Jeremy Irons - I had a HUGE crush on him when Lolita came out and I just turned 18. I fell for him when I watched Damage (1992) and was just 13. It just happens sometimes that a minor falls for an older person. These things may be illegal, immoral or sick, but Lolita is not only true to the source novel, it's also true to the human nature. The director doesn't moralize, which I like. He just puts this story in front of us, taking great care of the visual elements that make the film. And everything is perfect, the acting, the costumes, the music, the dreamy photography, the editing, the camera movement... I think Lolita would have won some Oscars, had it been given a chance. Dominique Swain deserved much, much more. She is wonderfully talented. And Jeremy has always been one of those brave actors, not only in terms of choosing his parts, but also the way he somehow reveals himself in these parts. Even Melanie Griffith shines here as Lolita's obnoxious mother. Here's another awful truth: abused kids are often neglected by their mothers. Frank Langella as Clare Quilty, Humbert's nemesis, always in the shadow, is what the viewers expect Humbert to be in order to satisfy their PC demands, but he never becomes that monstrous. So, I guess this film was too much for too many people when it was released. I will always cherish it. I love it when mediocre people get upset by true art.",Lolita

46,inioi,"Powerful, beautiful and thought provoking",9,3 January 2016,"To begin with, I will say that Adrian Lyne's one of my favorite directors. Whatever he does, he adds his unmistakable personal stamp on filming. The depth and detail are overwhelming. Each frame is a picture by itself. He is a master at creating atmospheres along with music and photography.He is also a provocateur, and he likes to be considered as such. One of the recurring subjects is the attraction between men and women, which can also be seen in ""Unfaithful (2002),"" ""Indecent Proposal (1997),"" ""Fatal Attraction (1987),"" ""Nine 1/2 Weeks (1986) """" Flashdance (1983) ""and"" Foxes (1980) "".On ""Lolita"" The film seemed intense and intimate in equal measure. And even could say that is extremely private, as depicts personal feelings and sensations that could cause rejection or criticism.For me, there is nothing to criticize.The question of our capacity to empathize with Jeremy Irons role, arises.The psychological game between the two protagonists is as intense as unstable, and the roles of dominator and dominated are exchanged. We finally have a dramatic situation in which nobody wins, so it is as real as life itself.We stand before a, deeply and brutally honest movie.9/10",Lolita
47,keith-moyes,Unfilmable?,4,21 August 2009,"This is not at all a bad movie and is surprisingly faithful to the book. At times I suspected some scenes had been inserted to appease a contemporary sensibility but, on checking, I found they were all in the book.I generally prefer this Lolita to Kubrick'e version, but both versions raise an interesting question.It is a presumption of cinema that any novel can be satisfactorily filmed. Lolita casts doubt on this.The problems can be illustrated by a small, but crucial, change that both films make to the book. When Humbert first meets Lolita she is 12. In the movies she is 14 and is played by actresses who were 15 and 16 respectively.Objectively, this change shouldn't matter: under age is under age. In practice it does. When you see a 14 or 15 year-old, you can see the woman she is about to become. When you see a 12 year-old you can only see the child. Raising Lolita's age makes Humbert seem less perverse than Nabokov intended and James Mason and Jeremy Irons both make him too sympathetic.All Nabokov needed to write Lolita was a typewriter and some paper. To film it, Kubrick and Lyne needed a young actress. Jodie Foster, Nathalie Portman and Lindsay Lohan all show that it would have been possible to find a 12 year-old actress good enough to carry the movie - but should she be asked to? If it was absolutely necessary to have a 12 year-old in order to make this movie, then most people would say: ""Don't make it then"".But this is only part of a wider issue.Nabokov wanted to put readers inside the head of a paedophile without them endorsing his actions: empathy doesn't necessarily imply sympathy. His first attempt was The Enchanter (which gave us the word nymphet). It was written in the third person. Nabokov was unhappy with it and it was only published after his death.Lolita was written in the first person and that changed everything.The book is Humbert's own testimony. He wants to present himself as a sensitive aesthete: a romantic lost soul surrounded by dull, uncomprehending Philistines. He charts his seedy obsession in elaborate, over-ripe 'poetic' prose, trying to draw the reader into his self-delusion, but we soon come to doubt the truth of what he is telling us. He can't help letting us see through his self-serving narrative to glimpse the murky reality that lurks beneath. Lolita is in real distress and is being profoundly corrupted by this unhealthy relationship.Humbert's nymphet fantasy soon starts to crumble before the reality of a troubled, wilful, increasingly manipulative child. Then he finds himself haunted by the ominous shadow of Clare Quilty, who we come to realise is his dark alter ego (Humbert's doubled name is a fairly obvious clue to Nabokov's intentions). Humbert is the doomed romantic he wants to be seen as: Quilty is the evil sexual predator he really is. Inevitably, it is Quilty that wins the battle for Lolita.Eventually, Humbert emerges from his pubescent fixation and has a relationship with an adult woman, so when he finally meets Lolita again he is able to see (and love) her as a real person. But it is too late. At this point, there is nothing left for him to do but finally kill off his evil doppelganger and then die himself.The point of Lolita, therefore, is not just in the the events it depicts, but in the particular way it depicts them. It is not only a story: it is a specific literary device. I think this presents an insoluble problem for a film-maker.I doubt if there is a cinematic equivalent to Nabokov's mendacious first person narrative. Cinema only really works in the third person and is a very literal medium: 'the camera doesn't lie'. When Hitchcock used a misleading flashback in Stage Fright people were outraged and even film critics, who should have known better, complained about the deception.Kubbrick and Lyne can both show us that the real Lolita is a far cry from Humbert's idealised nymphet but we are always seeing the disturbing reality itself, rather than that reality filtered through the haze of Humbert's prevarications.Kubrick tried to defuse the problem by playing up the humour. The first hour, in which Shelley Winters's Charlotte vamps the stiff, repressed Humbert to his considerable discomfort, mines the humour of embarrassment. Then Kubrick lets Peter Sellers loose to do a series of virtuoso comic turns. They are great, but overload the picture. Kubrick's Humbert is constantly being harried and badgered and in the end is less a sexual predator than a hapless victim. I don't think the movie works and Kubrick seemed to agree. He often talked about remaking it.Adrian Lyne uses the voice-over to give us more of Humbert's oily verbosity and he can be much more frank about the true nature of this deplorable relationship. But, again, we are spectators of events as they actually occur, rather than as Humbert wants us to see them, and the greater frankness only compounds the problems. Although his version is better in many respects than Kubrick's, it is even more uncomfortable to watch.Because of the nature of the medium in which they were working, Kubrick and Lyne both ended up making The Enchanter, not Lolita.I am not suggesting that it was wrong to make these movies. Film-makers should be free to tackle any subject that intrigues them - and it is not a crime to fail. It is just that the problems inherent in some books are so great it is unlikely there will be any solutions to them. Perhaps there are some challenges that film-makers should just decline.I suspect Lolita is one of them.",Lolita
48,Dia Klain,"Brilliant movie, true to the book.",10,22 July 2001,"Let me start by saying that this is one of my favorite movies of all time. Brilliant reproduction on the book, which is also one of my favorite. As the book, it paid very close attention to detail. The time period, 40s, was very accurate which added to the charm of the movie. Perhaps the best thing about it was it's great choice of characters. It is true, as some critics have mentioned, that Melanie Griffith is too thin and pretty to physically match Mrs. Haze, but her acting is so wonderful for this part that she perfectly carries across the roll, especially with all her screeching and hollering at Lolita. So, even though she does not look like a fat cow, her manner surely suggests it. As far as criticisms go, it is also true that seventeen-year-old Dominique Swain is too old to play Lolita. Alas this is also made up due to her excellent acting and coquettish manner of a true nymphet. One of the things I found interesting is that in the movie Lolita is a reddish blond even though in actual life the actress has dark brown hair. This is curious because in the book when Lolita is described she has dark brown hair also. Perhaps as a blond Lolita gave more of a sunny light image then she would have otherwise. As far as Humbert himself; Jeremy Irons received no criticism at all. He matched the image of Humbert Humbert even if one were not to consider his great acting. The way his face becomes strained and he mumbles every time Lolita got anywhere close to him is absolutely touching. As a matter of fact, touching is the key word in this movie. Perhaps the major difference between the book and the movie is, in fact, how touching Humbert seems, how innocent, and how vindictive Lolita in the movie, whereas in the book Lolita is the obvious innocent and Humbert is the fiend. In the movie one constantly gets the feeling that Humbert is trying his best to be good but it is Lolita who always thrusts herself on Hum and makes it ever more difficult for him. I watched this movie as DVD so I had a chance to see the parts of the movie that were later cut. These parts make up most of the little scenes that are missing in the movie; for example the seen where Humbert pictures drowning Mrs. Haze, but then can not do it. Once I examined all the scenes almost all of them were of Humbert being more forward. So at first Lolita was created closer to the book, but then most scenes where Humbert is showing his wicked side are cut. One might wander why, but one has to consider the problems this movie had which have not been spoken of. It started out as rated R and, though it is really not bad at all, it was proclaimed as child porn, simply because of the ideas in it, and not allowed to be shown in American theaters for a long while. This is probably why it has not been heard off and then out of nowhere appeared on shelves in the video rentals after it was revised and no longer proclaimed to be child porn. One might also add that in Europe no one had any problems showing it what so ever. Another very nicely made part of the movie was the secretiveness surrounding Quilty. Overall artistically done movie, though not to the point of movies like Titus or The Cell. Defiantly worth watching although the lack of conventional morality may be disturbing for some.",Lolita
49,JanetSnakehole3,Thought provoking and controversial,10,21 June 2003,"I really cant understand why is Humbert viewed as pedophile, when clearly Quilty is sick and immoral. Some people say that this movie promotes pedophilia, but in my opinion, it only represents pedophilia as something sick and wrong. You really want to hate Humbert, because of what he has done, but this movie has some tender moments (ending) when you finally realize that pedophilia was never part of his case, but that he actually fell in love with much younger girl. Jeremy Irons is probably one of the best actors, and his portrayal of Humbert was great. I do agree that movie has very disturbing sexual actions which should not be allowed, but im saying again, in my opinion its not about pedophilia at all. Who ever thinks so, please view movie again, and if its possible DVD, so that you can see comments by Addrian Lyne. I agree with director completely: every movie should be thought provoking, and being able to be discussed when its over, and the day after that, and day after that. Great movie, I trully recommend it to anyone who is open to talk about it and debate on it. This movie can be really loved, or really hated. Ratings: 10/10",Lolita

53,jjh6519,Much better than expected,9,16 March 2003,"After seeing the Kubrick version, and thinking no one could ever make a better Humbert than James Mason or a better Lolita than Sue Lyon, I saw this updated version, and I was very impressed.   It's actually an improvement.1. Quilty:  Of all the things I did not like about the Kubrick version, it was Peter Sellers' quirkily irritating and totally unclear portrayal of this jerk.   The latest version completely downplays the character, other than to show that he is a dark, mysterious, monstrous person who keeps showing up in the shadows.   Also, it finally clarifies that Quilty is the very worst of Humbert... It is Humbert without a soul, conscience or any redeeming quality.  It becomes clear that he is truly a monster, and makes Humbert look almost saintly by comparison.2. Humbert and Lolita:  While I enjoyed the chemistry between James Mason and Sue Lyon immensely, the chemistry between Jeremy Irons and Dominique Swain is ten times better.  This is due mostly to Swain, who basically portrays a part of herself.   Her teasing and her battles with Irons are priceless and extremely believable.   Also, the Sue Lyon version showed Humbert going after an older teen, not as repugnant as the Dominique Swain version showing Humbert going after an actual underaged teen.  Also, in this version, most of the movie is about Humbert and Lolita, and their adventures, misfortunes and run from the law.3. Humbert himself:  For the first time, we see the reason for his obsession, and it isn't entirely pedophilia, as in the case of Quilty. Irons is given many additional scenes to show the conflict between his better nature and his pedophile nature, to show that he understands that what he is doing is not only wrong but will be his downfall.4. The ending:  I prefer the way it ended so much more in this later version.  First, Quilty finally, for the first time, comes out of the shadows, and we see him for his repulsive self.  Sellers' portrayal was too offbeat to allow us to despise this guy as he should be despised.  Also, the final ""fini"" is so downbeat so as to let you know in no uncertain terms that you have just witnessed a multiple tragedy.Adrian Lyne did an excellent job of directing, and the music of Ennio Morricone was a great help to the also excellent cinematography.",Lolita
54,ChrisBagley,Heart-rending tragedy with irresistible tender moments,8,11 June 2002,"Great movie. Gave it a 9.Swain was fabulously gripping as Delores,in frolicking, in flirtation, and in grief. I'd heard it was her first acting job. Amazing.I found Irons a lot less credible here than some of the other reviewers did. His infatuation in Delores seemed artificial and excessive in most scenes. Almost as if he immediately reverted completely to his 12-year-old self. For example, take the scene where he first saw her on the lawn. Sure, her sprinkler-soaked figure looked great, but if Irons has been stuck on 14-year-olds ever since Annabel, what's so special about his first glance at this one? And Charlotte didn't even notice the 10-second stare? C'mon!At times, Humbert's discomfort over his own feelings toward her and over being discovered in the situation seemed less than fully credible.Still, as an angry, jealous lover and a grieving confused lover, he was superb. His voice-overs as the narrator really made the film for me. They framed the entire tragedy perfectly. Of the result of his relationship with Annabel, he said ""Something in my heart remained frozen."" And then at the end of the film, he said he regrets not hearing her voice among the chorus of children's voices on the playground. Just a couple of unanswered questions: 1. What did Charlotte write in the letters that Humbert burned? 2. Was it Quilty following them all along, or just paranoia? Did Delores fabricate the story about going along with Quilty in a final, cruel attempt to pique Humbert's jealousy? Guess I'll have to read the book.",Lolita

There is significant grounds for arguing that this movie glamorizes pedophilia, and I don't blame you if it turns your stomach. But somehow, it builds up to be very moving, particularly when he gives her all the money at the end. When this movie was over, I only wanted to start it over again. It was like seeing in black-and-white all your life, then suddenly you can see colors. I'm surprised too. It may disturb you, but you will never forget it, I guarantee. The period detail lends it a timeless artfulness. It is set up and shot beautifully--I wanted to live in Mrs. Haze's house. Ennio Morricone's score did that rare thing, a marriage of music and story that makes me really choked up. It sounds like one of the themes from Sense and Sensibility!The actors, namely the two leads, really bring their A-game. Dominique Swain's performance complicates the story by giving Dolores a character beyond that of rape victim. She is trying to meet Humbert on his own level. I'm not saying this version of him is blameless--he does hit her! But this does raise an interesting question: Let's say there was mutual attraction. What do you do with that? There's no easy answer. Back when I was in that age range, if a gorgeous older English man moved into my house, I wouldn't have had the scruples to stay away from him. I know that much. Hey, reality doesn't always fit our lofty ideals of morality, and this movie proves it. As compelling as Swain is, Irons just might carry the film. This is the perfect sort of role for him. Kudos to whoever decided to keep showing him in a wife-beater. I watched this and not the '62 movie because I just love him so much. Regardless of other versions of this story, this one makes you buy into it and worry for the leads, quite a feat. There are parts where the directing goes off its hinges and the tone gets silly and over-the-top, but these parts are brief. In short, give this a chance, if you know you can stomach it.

From the musical score of Ennio Morricone to the strikingly beautiful cinematographic scenes that only Howard Atherton is capable of delivering under the direction of Adrian Lyne. This movie will take you on a roller coaster of emotion. It will lift you up, let you down gracefully then drag you through the dirt just before wiping your tears and leaving you changed forever. Dominique Swain's controversial DEBUT portrayal of ""Lo"" with improvised antics are playful and perfect. Jeremy and Melanie are the concrete that build the wall of professionalism, drama and realism. I'm only on my 10th viewing and to the naysayers who aren't capable of such extreme emotion, may god pity you that some day you may be. To the dismissive critics, you're not worthy of such gifts. And to the poor soles who are, may god have mercy on you after viewing this film because every other flick there after will be just that. A second rate flick. I haven't read the book or viewed the other version nor will I ever. For me, there is no book or other version. Only Humbert's Dolores Haze and Adrian Lyne's ""Lolita"".",Lolita
65,Rick-174,Brilliant acting - but the difficult subject matter ultimately overwhelms the film,6,23 October 1999,"The performances are brilliant. Dominique Swaine as Lolita gives an astonishingly mature and powerful performance. Jeremony Irons is also very good.But the subject matter ultimately overwhelms this film. It is a difficult subject - and both the original book and this film are so near to brilliance that it seems churlish to condemn. But the fine line between the, very real, subject matter of a man's psychological failure to get beyond a childhood love which was lost, and subsequent paedophilia is crossed. It makes for uncomfortable viewing, not because the film is powerful, but because it is seedy.",Lolita
66,speedo58,Evocative,9,8 June 2008,"The genius of Nabokov's novel is that it makes us sympathize with the monster. The movie has managed to capture that aspect of the novel, making us feel that Delores was the aggressor and Humbert the victim. The duplication of his given and surnames is a hint that Humbert is probably a paranoid schizophrenic. Many of the things we see happened only in his mind, much like Russell Crowe's depiction of John Nash's imaginings of a nemesis in ""A Beautiful Mind"". Quilty was the manifestation of the hated side of himself. When he killed Quilty, he finally in a lucid moment realized what a monster he was, and in the final imaginary scene overlooking the village, he felt remorse.The evocation of the seedy motels and desolate landscape of 1940s America reminded me of many such scenes from my childhood. I knew that Mr. Irons had the depicted the character to perfection because the performance evoked a long-forgotten memory of an over-rapt neighbor who frightened me when I was ten years old.",Lolita
67,kategiulianotti,Exactly how the book is,10,28 February 2020,"Now, I don't mean it follows the book exactly. However, the portrayal done by JI is exactly the theme of the novel. And the film follows that perfectly. It is about a a man who is totally disillusioned with his idea of attraction. He justifies it in his own way and that is exemplified by the final act.",Lolita
68,MartinK75,Beautiful film,10,24 February 2005,"Adrian's Lyne's Lolita is an exceptional film which hasn't received the praise and attention it deserves since its release, probably due to the media-fuelled sideshow over whether the film is too explicit or whether its treatment of the Humbert character is too sympathetic. For what it's worth, I don't consider anything in the film to be particularly explicit or salacious and therefore couldn't understand what all the fuss was about in the first place. Does the film portray a sympathetic paedophile? Arguably, but it must be borne in mind that the film, like the novel, is narrated by and viewed entirely through the eyes of Humbert, thus leaving itself far more open to the charge than if, for example, events were seen from the viewpoint of Lolita. I also remember reading some rubbish in sections of the British press at the time of the film's release about its ""glamourisation"" of paedophilia through its choice of a handsome leading man like Jeremy Irons. The filmmakers were only following Nabokov's lead here as he has Humbert mention at various points in the novel (somewhat immodestly) that he is a very good-looking man. In any case, it's just nonsense to suppose that all paedophiles are hideously ugly people. The only lesson I think can be drawn from all this is that any film made nowadays which tries to deal with the issue of paedophilia is really playing with fire, whether it's explicit or not. The film sticks fairly closely to Nabokov's novel with much of Jeremy Irons' narration culled directly from its pages, a nice touch, as Nabokov's prose is so beautiful and poetic. The performances of Irons and Swain are superb and Melanie Griffith, a much-maligned actress over the years, is ideal as the bitchy, annoying Charlotte Haze. Frank Langella is also great as the creepy, depraved Quilty. The film is beautifully photographed and the recreation of late 40s/early 50s America is spot on. Ennio Morricone's score is simply breathtaking, one of the best I have heard. How he was denied an Oscar nomination is beyond me. I can only assume that the controversy-hating Academy could not bring itself even to give the film a nomination in one of the more minor categories. The film, like the book, contains some very funny moments but is ultimately a tragic and moving experience.",Lolita
69,mligorio,"An Impossible Dream, A Moment of Bliss, and the Tragic Cost",7,25 June 2011,"It's one thing to wish for something, it's quite another affair to be happy with what you get, especially since it's not really what you had hoped for in the first place. A desperate pedophile, Humbert, somehow makes his wildest sexual fantasy actually come true, or at least that is what he longs to believe, but at the tragic cost of the lives he destroys, including his own.Humbert explains why he is attracted to 14 year old Lolita. By his own account, he became fixated on girls the same age as his childhood sweetheart, Annabel, who he lost forever during his own youth. It is still a mystery, however, why a man of Humbert's maturity indulged an adolescent sexual fantasy for as long as he did. A man his age could no more have a love affair with a 14 year old girl than could he resurrect his long lost lover from the dead. Nor could he go back to being a 14 year old boy himself.In a transparent attempt to approach the object of his desire, Humbert marries Lolita's mother, Charlotte, even though he does not truly love her. Charlotte's accidental death gives Humbert what he had been secretly hoping for, complete custody of Lolita. But, how could he be happy knowing that it was his rejection of Charlotte that practically drove her to suicide, especially since his flagrant negligence also hurt Lolita? This shocking realization should have interrupted Humbert's erotic dream and marked the point in the story where a responsible man assumes his natural role as a father. However, when Lolita approached him, inexplicably, he could not control his pedophile nature.Humbert refused to abandon his love fantasy, until the day when Lolita was practically torn away from him, and he finally realized that he couldn't have her. But by that time the damage he had caused her was already irreparable. He destroyed Lolita's happy childhood in much the same way his own had been destroyed by the death of Annabel, and he could never forgive himself for his 'sin'. Murdering Quilty, an even more perverse pedophile than himself, was as close as he could come to suicide. In the end, he died in prison of a broken heart, leaving us to ponder whether there was ever any need for such a tragedy, or is it simply true that none of us can ever find bliss except for a fleeting moment.",Lolita
70,waxwingslain77,Not a good one to film but there are factors..,10,26 April 2001,"SPOILER ALERT: Do not read the below unless you have seen this film AND the 1962 version, too.I've seen both versions of ""Lolita;"" 1962 and 1997 are of course two different eras, yet there are too many similarities in each film which prove why Nabokov's book was never meant for celluloid.Quickly, I must state that I'm a Nabokovian and I've read his entire oeuvre. My grandmother gave me a copy of the book when I was eighteen. I had never heard of the masterpiece, but it is ""Lolita,"" the novel, which ignited my passion for brilliant prose and ""Lolita"" remains my favorite book.Why can't the book be filmed? Let's see. In the Kubrick version from 1962, Lolita is sixteen; in Lyne's (this) version, she is fourteen. In the novel, she is twelve. 1997 and Lolita is still two years older than she was in the novel. The real-life difference between twelve and fourteen is enormous. About the last thing I want to see is a twelve year-old girl and a middle aged man making out on screen. I don't suggest that a fourteen year-old girl and a middle aged man is acceptable. Nor sixteen and middle aged. The point is that this literary masterpiece simply needs to be read to be appreciated; if a faithful rendition of the novel is to be made, it would be kiddie porn. It would also have to be ten or twelve hours long. And really, the sickness of Humbert, his blighted lust and love for small girls, isn't even what the book is about. The book was written with venom, yet venom so rich and esoteric that it only makes us hate Humbert more than we already do, yet a measure of sympathy does emerge, and more so in the two films than the novel. Nabokov wrote the book, knew it was a gamble, knew it would be censored and above all, knew it would be talked about by EVERYBODY. He wrote the book in order to achieve financial independence and to say that he succeeded is a masterpiece of understatement. The anger I refer to is Nabokov's contempt for cruelty (yes, contempt) in any form. Dolores Haze is ruined by a depraved animal; America is roasted slowly over fire on a spit. And never has America been ravaged so exquisitely! Okay, I needed to mention all that. The actual film is wonderfully photographed and Frank Languella, as Quilty, deserved a Best Supporting Oscar. Jeremy Iron's narration is hypnotic and outstanding; Domonique Swain is quite good given the circumstances. Sue Lyon had far more censorship problems in 1962 than did Swain in 1997, and Swain is thoroughly believable. However, the pedophile aspect can never be overcome, neither can the richness of Nabokov's prose be transmitted visually to the screen with consistency--and THIS, even more than the kiddie angle, is the primary reason why a GREAT ""Lolita"" will never appear on a silver screen. I can think of two brief exceptions to this, no more. In my favorite scene, where Quilty uses word-play to terrorize Humbert, the zapping of the insect killer, the purple sparks, the tone of Quilty's voice, his expressions (""sleep is a rose, the Persians say"") are pure Nabokov, and this scene is superb. The other ""Lolita"" book-like part of the film, and a close second to the above scene, is Humbert's murder of Quilty. Quilty eats cigarettes, he spouts richly literate nonsense, a piano covered with blood keeps playing--it is also superb, this scene.But the rest of it, and honestly the film is about as good as one could make of the novel, is hit or miss. In the Kubrick version, Shelly Winters, of whom I tend to be no fan, is impeccable. Melanie Griffith, in this one, is flat-out AWFUL! I wanted her dispatched long before she had been. Of course she is supposed to be vapid, but shrieking literally half of her dialogue isn't necessary to achieve this end.Lyne did a good job and I would recommend this film. But with serious reservations. A six.",Lolita
71,JerryLambert,"You would have to be a mad man , an artist......",10,11 November 2003,"Based on the Nabokov novel and a remake of the Kubrick original, this film is why remakes should be done. Kubricks version was a good attempt, but at the time there was only so much contraversy allowed in a film. Lynn takes this rendition where Kubrick wasn't allowed. This film will make you understand women. Dominique Swains performance was Oscar worthy. Irons portrayal of Humby was very mesmorizing. This is one of the best films that I have ever seen.

Adrian Lyne as director...(if you're in the mood for masochism, please rent Indecent Proposal -- the worst movie of the decade (and I see a LOT of movies)). Casting was all wrong, the direction was unnecessarily lurid, and the movie had Absolutely No Sense of Humor. If you have read the (brilliant) novel or seen the (brilliant) Sellers film, you know that part of the disturbingly beautiful nature of *Lolita* is that it is unexpectedly hilarious. I laughed at the Lyne film, as I say, but only because I was amused at how seriously it was taking itself. Yes, Lolita is a serious work about serious matters, but this movie is flat and austere compared to the novel or the other film. No wonder it couldn't find an American distributor. The idea that America is too disturbed by this subject matter is crap (see Happiness ... please). This movie just Sucked. 2/10.",Lolita
74,lilcharmer,Beautifully Directed Tale of Forbidden Lust,9,12 January 2005,"So I was walking through my parents living room one night when a scene caught my eye. It was of a young girl in a sailor short set, jump on an older guy and kiss him, all in slow-mo. She ran out of the room gleefully and the older guy looked pained and pleased at the same time. I thought ""What is this?"" I checked the TV book and found it was the 1997 remake of Lolita.I made sure to watch it the next time it came on and was completely intrigued by the whole sad story. I'd heard about the original story but instead of it being this dirty old man lusting after Lo, Jeremy Iron's portrayal makes you feel for Humbert because he isn't just some old perv, but a very kind, loving man who has feelings for a girl who represents that love he lost as a teen. You actually hurt with him as Lolita toys with him, bribes him and leaves him. Dominique Swain was perfect in the role. Beautiful, seductive but also childish and playful.The cinematography is great along with the musical score. You get a real sense of the 40's era. This version is way better than the Kubirck original, which I saw afterwards. Mason seemed like a dirty old man and though Lyons was okay. I prefer Langella's Quilty as dark and mysterious (and surprisingly naked!) to the original screen Quilty.Highly underrated. This is great work for all involved.",Lolita

Because of the time, the story couldn't be told properly then. I was completely drawn in to the movie. I thought it was well made, well directed, and the cinematography beautiful.I was told by a friend it's just a movie about a sick, perverted old man. Not so. Like another user commented, it's an emotional roller coaster. It's a deep, sad, and tragic film. Yet, a joy to watch. I think everyone should give this movie a chance. If you think it's just a film about a pervert, look a little deeper. It's much more. I consider it the best film I saw that year. 10!!!!!!",Lolita
77,FlixFan-2,A Moving Film Deserving of a Bigger Audience,9,3 December 1998,"Thanks to Showtime or I might not have seen this powerful film, featuring an Oscar-worthy performance by Jeremy Irons.  It is poignant, sad, funny, ironic, all-in-all, one of the best films of the year.  Kudos to Adrian Lyne, Stephen Schiff, Dominique Swain and the others who helped create this fine film.  Rather sad in many respects that it was kept from a larger viewing audience who would have appreciated a truly adult work of rare power.  If people think this film glorifies the subject matter, they more assuredly missed the point.  How sad!",Lolita
78,moviola-2,Good but the original is unbeaten,8,19 November 1998,"While the new adaptation of Lolita is an excellent piece of work deserving attention and viewing, and both the actors, director and crew did a good job at keeping us interested from beginning to end, I think (and again, this is just a subjective appreciation like all the others) that the original is the one I would keep in my movie library.I can give numerous reasons while that is my choice. First, it is unrealistic to expect that a movie will stick to the original book in a one hundred percent faithful manner. There are obvious time constrictions that rule out a lot of the intangible thought processes involved in savoring a book that are seldom depicted in crude reality on a screen. This is not to say that there are not superb adaptations from masterpieces made by BBC television that are almost quite as good as reading the book. But that is a rare quality in one-time movies. In order to truly adapt a book it is much better to go through the mini-series formula.Second, I find the new version lingers too much on the nitty-gritty and less on the background and the development of the characters and the relationships. I find this is totally unnecessary to understand the plot and the consequences.Third, the final scene excessively long and detailed (when Humbert kills Quilty). The Kubrik adaptation still holds my highest regards for being subtle, yet revealing, and gives the scenes that ""The good if brief twice as good"" feeling.Fourth, I liked better the character portrayal of Shelley Winters, James Mason and Peter Sellers than (with all due respect) the one of Melanie Griffith, Jeremy Irons and Frank Langella. This is not to say that these fine actors and actresses have made an award-winning job at some other movie or movies or could do it in the future.Summarily, I keep my Excellent (9/10) vote on the 1962 version, and give this one an 8. I think this is a just vote, but keep in mind that always beauty is in the eyes of the beholder. Even when I am a relatively young viewer, I find the excessive realism of the post-1970 cinema sometimes a bit distressing, and increasingly encounter the 1930-1970 movies to have a much more adequate perspective and treatment of the subjects than the new movies have.",Lolita

Lyne's LOLITA is quite simply one of the most heartrending films I have ever seen. I was so affected by Jeremy Iron's incredible performance as Humbert Humbert that I am still now shaking from its aftermath. That final scene in which Humbert stands on the hilltop, his face speckled with the blood of the man he felt had destroyed his happiness and in which he fully regrets his past actions that have lead to the destruction of a young girl's innocence, will stay with me forever.

I got the 1962 Kubrick version too, which didn't follow the book very well (it being 1962 and too risque even in its diluted form for persons under 16).  This version even used direct passages from the book.  The music, actors, and overall cinematic technique are excellent.  They have an art-film, well-produced quality.  The dark colours follow Humbert's despair and inner torment.  The choice of Melanie Griffith as Charlotte Haze was perfect.  Dominique Swain was convincing and excellent.

First is the casting of Jeremy Irons and the easy way he delivers the most difficult and beautiful lines. Precocious Lolita was exemplary! There were no doubts there but what i fell in love with about this movie was the Precision of the Direction.I have never heard of this Director before and it is always such a gift to discover another good Director. I don't know what more Kubrick would have done to make his a better movie and I hope I find out soon. One or two flaws will be found as with any other work of genius but genius is never perfect.

Dominique Swain was the center attention of this story. I think, casting & directing her wisely had done 50% work of this film.Her innocence, child like activities, mysterious vibe sometimes, violent behavior, Erotic fitness & at a time childish nature. Too conflicting & complex. There was always a thrilling sense in entire film. Yeah Director Adrian Lyne could maintain the suspense. The Last conversation was tragic without being loud & meaningful which left me in melancholic feeling & empathetic at a time towards both of them. It was well made intense drama.I didn't read the book but heard this film maintained the rhythm with original novel. Stanely kubric version was presented in satire tone . I found this version more touching .",Lolita

This essentially by-the-book adaptation is good if all you want is to see the prose translated into images, and some might consider that Lyne's ability to be sexually explicit is an improvement over the ambiguity of Stanley Kubrick's film, but I found this film a disappointment. I liked Jeremy Irons' performance, and thought Dominique Swain was also very good, but Melanie Griffiths was miscast and (of course) no portrayal of Claire Quilty can compare with Peter Sellers's.  Kubrick's film shows more artistry, creativity and genius",Lolita
87,survivor-2,"Powerful, moving, imperfect. Nabokov would be proud",9,15 January 1999,"I don't really know what I can say about this film. Being Dutch-speaking It had taken me some time to get to grips with Nabokov's book (still one of my favourite books of all time). The movie is in my opinion the best possible adaptation of the book. This doesn't mean the movie is perfect, far from. But it's as good as book adaptations come. The cast is nearly perfect. Especially Jeremy Irons, who is appropriately tragic and funny, and newcomer Dominique Swain (most people will remember her as the teenage daughter in Face off) as Lolita. The movie is very much like Nabokovs novel a combination of a love story, a tragedy and a lot of Irony and sarcasm. There is one fatal flaw in this film though, which stops it from getting a 10 mark from me. The ending. The overly theatrical death scene of Quilty. While (like the rest of the movie) following closely to Nabokovs very words (the playing piano...) it should have either been a lot more (sarcasm) or a lot less theatrical. Still that's not enough to spoil a truly great film.Now as you may have seen I'm Belgian. Remember, Belgium is the country that started all this paedophilia witch hunts. So when (surprisingly) the movie opened here, I saw a review in one of Belgium's most important weekly mags (Humo) who were furious about this film. (and gave it zero out of four possible stars). There main reasons were these: one you don't make this sort of movie post-dutroux(The belgian child molester), second you don't remake a kubrick movie. There was no word on Nabokov's book or even the movie itself. I was furious. First of all their two reasons for destroying this film are invalid: the movie was greenlighted quite some time before the dutroux-scandal and it's not I repeat NOT a remake of a Kubrick film. It's an adaptation of one of the greatest works of fiction of the 20th century! I hope people will dare to see this for what it is and not for what they think it is. And I also hope the Oscar voters dare to nominate it . There are at least two spots more than deserving of an Oscar: best actor (Irons) and best adapted screenplay.",Lolita

I was in a small, one-screen theater with the girl that I loved, and had loved for a long time.  She goes to school there, and I was visiting.  We both wanted to see 'Lolita', but only she had read the book.  I had to drive 500 miles back to San Diego immediately after seeing the film, but I wanted to see it with her, anyway.I didn't know what to expect.  You can always rely on Jeremy Irons to play that passionate character that ends out getting crushed.  I don't think he ever did it better than he did in 'Lolita'.Before this film, only one movie ever made me cry, and that was 'Grave of the Fireflies'.  By the time this film ended, the tears were streaming, and fought them hard.After seeing 'Lolita', I can't even hear the name 'Lolita' without feeling love, beauty, sadness, and pain in my heart.Seeing Humbert try to rekindle his lost love through the illusion of his relationship with a curious young girl was just crushing.  He was a lover... a lover that fell for the charms of a nymphet.This is movie perfection.  The performances are astounding.  The script is excellent, devastating, and beautiful.  The music is simply wonderful.

Lyne's extraordinary sense of time and place, the uncanny casting of Jeremy Irons and Dominique Swain (although I agree with some posters that Melanie Griffith wasn't up to the job; makes me miss the late great Shelley Winters), Morricone's haunting music -- they're all remarkable.

Dominique Swain was pretty but she was probably five feet seven inches or taller on film. Lolita is supposed to be short. In the film, Irons who plays Humbert says that Lolita is barely five feet tall. In this movie, Lolita is clearly too big to be five feet tall. Tall and slim Dominique Swain was too tall to be short Lolita. This height problem was odd. Swain is not a bad actress, I just feel that she was miscast as Lolita. Jeremy Irons did his part very well. I feel that Melanie Griffith was also miscast. She was not old enough to be the ""bopper mama."" In the Kubrick version, Shelly Winters plays Charlotte Haze. Shelly Winters was on point in Kubrick's version. I actually prefer Lolita (1962) to Lolita (1997). Kubrick's version had perfect casting, a perfect script, and perfect directing.

This isn't a funny/weird story, it is a tragedy. Sad and haunting with a real monster not a ""Sellers"" clown (although some will say that Kubricks's Quilty is more faithful to the book, there is no menace in him and yes, Langella's Quilty does have a measure of whimsy (many monsters do).For those of you who are going to use big words like pedophilia, take the time to understand the pathology. Humbert is NOT a pedophile, his love of Lolita never changed (did you see the ending?) ""heavy with another man's child, I loved this Lolita"". When his child-love died, he too died. Emotionally the man remained a boy (did you see the beginning?)""but I continued to search for her, I should have joined the priesthood"". A pedophile would have had no use for an adult Lolita. His killing of Quilty was a violent rejection of such monsters. The killing didn't need to be included, Humberts final admission in spite of his love for Lolita was justice enough. ""Victims aren't we all"", Eric Draven's words were written for these tragic characters.Had Lolita demanded that Humbert wait until she was of age, he gladly would have. She was the ""lost"" child, his love, his life. In a country that cherishes the on screen butchering of children and finds entertainment in watching predators ply their trade (we justify it by their being caught on Dateline), we have consigned this beautiful, sad film to the graveyard of the censures.But...This film will find its way like so many before it. The American film-goer is the one cheated. And yes, the film contains one of Grand Maestro Morricone's greatest scores. Shame on you America, and we send our kids to Iraq to die and be maimed for freedoms we don't even believe in.....How sad.",Lolita
95,t-mestdag,"A conservative, yet interesting adaptation of a classic",8,16 March 2016,"Having read the book and seen the movie several times now, I can assure you that if you've only watched the movie you'll have seen about 40% of what happens in the book. I'm not saying the movie is bad, it's actually quite good considering. But if you really like the movie and knows it's about a classic, if you know that much, you REALLY should read the book. As for the movie, apart from all the stuff you don't see in the book, like the comments and views of America by the main character(Humbert Humbert), also the general lust is a lot deeper in the book than it is depicted in the movie. I would say that this movie tries hard to put on the screen, fit into a little over 2 hours, the most they could have considering the amount of stuff in the book.As for the acting, it is spot on! All of the main actors and even the secondary ones are simply great! What can I say that hasn't been said about Jeremy Irons?? He's simply perfect as Humbert. Dominique Swain was chosen out of 2500 girls!! She's amazing, although if I might be so bold as to point out a miss in the movie about Lolita(Swain), it's that when she shot it, she was 15, not 12 like the real Lolita for obvious reasons, and she wasn't 1,47m(5 feet) tall like in the book, but rather about 1,69m(5'7'') tall.All of the above is for you who wants to know everything about this classic but hasn't for some reason, to read the book. I beg you to read the book. If you love reading like I do, and if you like this story like I do, please, do yourself a favor and read the book.",Lolita
96,Zambelli,"Why did we have to wait over 40 years to see the real ""Lolita""?",10,2 August 1999,"Adrian Lyne's ""Lolita"" has everything it takes to be a good movie adaptation. Lyne follows the original plot very closely, with few slight changes. Even the dialogues in many scenes remained exactly the same. Most of the movie is a flashback, but Lyne doesn't make the same mistake as Kubrick and he follows the correct order of events (Quilty's murder, i.e.).The casting is excellent. Jeremy Irons proved to be a much better choice than James Mason was in Kubrick's version. Irons delivers probably one of his best performances as he portrays the tragic character of Humbert Humbert. Iron's voice overs help us get into the mind of Humbert and understand his thoughts and actions. Dominique Swain is excellent as Lolita. She is the perfect nymphet. Young and innocent, but vulgar and crude at the same time. Frank Langella as Clare Quilty is a little bit ""too mysterious"" and he probably should've been a bit funnier, as his character was in Nabokov's book.The final reason why this movie is better than its predecessor is its photography. The colors are just amazing. They actually seem to follow the mood of the story - from excitingly colorful to tragically dark.I'm going to keep this user comment rather short. I could compare it to Kubrick's version some more, but it's easier if you just read my comment for Kubrick's ""Lolita"".The highlight of the movie is definitely the last scene in which Humbert surrenders to the police - he stands on the top of a hill, listens to the voice of children playing and expresses his remorse for ruining Lolita's life. In this one scene, Lyne managed to capture the whole point of the book that Kubrick totally missed in his movie.The movie is a perfect 10. Just please go see it without any prejudice.",Lolita
97,teegz,Haunting...,8,10 January 2001,"North American distributors have been leery of circulating Lolita due to its sexual content; namely a sexual affair between a 40-year-old man and a 12-year-old girl. Critics who are offended by the subject matter say Lolita glorifies paedophilia. Using the same line of argument, one could say that murder is offensive and illegal, so why doesn't the public have a problem with movies featuring serial killers? Did The Silence of the Lambs glorify murder? Ironically, the violent scenes in Lolita are more disturbing than the sexual ones. It's a shame all the hype surrounding the movie isn't concerned with the film itself.Lolita is stunning, emotionally and visually. Adapted from the novel of the same title by Vladimir Nabokov, Lolita focuses on Humbert's (Jeremy Irons) relationship with Lolita (Dominique Swain) and the tragedies it creates.Humbert is a scholar who is infatuated with young girls. A reason for his 'condition' is given in the film, but it really doesn't explain the extent of his desire. It seems reasonable that Humbert would be an evil predator in the eyes of the viewer, but what makes the movie so interesting is how he is portrayed as a tragic figure trapped by his desires. Humbert understands his affair with Lolita is wrong, but he is unable to change it-stating the relationship was a ""paradise, whose sky was the color of Hell-flames."" To Humbert, Lolita is not just an outlet for his sexual desires. He falls in love with Lolita herself, not just the idea of her as a sexual object.The viewer's sympathy for Humbert has a lot to do with Lolita herself. In many ways she is more of a predator than he. Lolita initiates the first few sexual encounters and is fully aware of what she is getting in to. Yet, as with Humbert, her innocence in the affair shines through. Director Adrian Lyne contrasts Lolita's sexuality with child-like images. In one scene Lolita is reading a comic book and laughing, when the camera pans down to reveal a naked Humbert underneath her. In another scene she is lying soaking wet beside a sprinkler, and for a moment the viewer forgets her true age, until her smile reveals a retainer.Newcomer Dominique Swain shines in a very difficult role. She can go from woman to child in a instant, which is crucial to the part. Without Swain's ability, Irons' character would be much less sympathetic to the audience.Lolita's beauty can be found in its character's complexities. In many films the characters are one-dimensional and predictable, making even a good script seem dull. The viewer wants to feel sorry for Lolita and to despise Humbert, but the characters and script don't let conventional norms take over.Lolita runs at two hours and 15 minutes, and for the last half-hour, it loses some of its focus. The ending is disappointingly over-dramatic, but it doesn't take away from the first hour-and-a-half. Lolita isn't exactly a fun ride, but it's one you should take.",Lolita
98,vinitneo,a perfect movie?,10,28 March 2011,"This is one of my favorite movies. I love everything about this movie - The story, characters, music, scenery etc. I have read Vladimir Nabokov novel and this movie is an almost excellent adaptation of the book. The movie has been so beautifully shot that it stays in your head long after you watch it. The relationship between Lolita and Humbert has been shown exactly as in the book. Humbert is obsessed with Lolita because he lost his lover when he was a teenager and he is always looking for her in other teenage girls. And Lolita was discovering her sexuality and had a desire to seduce Humbert who had feelings for her.A beautifully written novel and a beautifully shot movie. Watch the movie and read the book. Go!",Lolita
99,claradondes,A fine adaption of a masterpiece,7,25 October 2021,"Stanley Kubrick's Lolita wasn't Lolita. Not even close.NOTHING can ever truly be like the book, but this is a good film. Dominique Swain plays Lolita perfectly, portraying the adolescent girl between childish but kinky complexity that is Lolita. Jeremy Irons is great too, but he is not fully Humbert. He portrays him a bit more mildly. However, this book is almost impossible to adapt.There will never be a Lolita like Nabokov. Still, great acting and a fine script. Thank you, Adrian.",Lolita
100,Cecil-5,Dreadful,2,15 November 1998,"Critics have been raving about the faithfulness of this version, and while it is certainly faithful in the strictest sense of the word, gone is the wit, the humor, and bitterness of Nabokov's novel.  They have been replaced by exactly the kind of garish puffery that Nabokov was making fun of.",Lolita
101,Logic1,"Both Nabokov, and yet not, Lyne's work is (to me) a masterpiece.",10,16 February 2000,"In writing this, I suddenly realize it is impossible not to mention the novel, so let us get that out of the way quickly, yes?Schiff's screenplay is very, very close to the source novel. But somehow the film ends up very different. One could not expect any adaptation (though I admit to not having seen Kubrick's '60s version) to contain all the layers of the novel. So Adrian Lyne goes for just one - the tragedy.True, the Humbert here loses all of the craftiness of his literary counterpart. He is still deceitful, but seems caught up in events, almost betraying himself with every lie. Although the events of the movie are almost identical in every way to Nabokov's novel, the movie's tone becomes completely different.Now that I have (very *very* briefly) said that, I must point out that I do not consider this a flaw in any way. True, the movie is based on the novel. But if it were exactly the same, what would be the point in any adaptation at all? You'd be as well reading the book.So, quickly now (I hate long comments on IMDB), I will attempt to encapsulate my favorite things about this movie:Lyne's attention to detail. Not just small things from the novel (Quilty's aliases in hotel books, for example, or Mrs Opposite) but just little things. Lo spinning in her chair at the soda place. Numerous authentic 40s items, lovingly recreated (despite  the novel's Humbert's derisive attitude to much of American consumerism). Just a myriad of small details that could alone sustain this movie for dozens of viewings.The acting. Irons (as has been much discussed) is so perfectly tragic (again, unlike Nabokov's Humbert - but so what?) and sympathetic, even in his depravity. Swain is superb (though a little poor as 17 year old, pregnant Dolly), a real find.The directing. Especially the way Lyne transforms Nabokov's shadowy Quilty to the screen. Brilliant!The music. So beautiful (especially the opening tune, with its occasional discordant note).The comedy. Small things. Sedatives for ""a cow"". Charlotte's adoration of ""the French tongue"". ""Is she keeping you up?"" Some wonderful lines!As a side note, I had not read Nabokov's novel when I saw this first. I loved it to death. Now, having read Nabokov's novel (perhaps the best thing I have ever read incidentally) I am even more impressed with Lyne's (and, of course, screenwriter Schiff's) movie. Not just it's faithful recreations, but its departures. Surely the ability to recreate the letter of the source novel so accurately, and yet defy the tone so dramatically, must be a talent worthy of some praise?",Lolita
102,andrea-fryer,A mesmerizing film which will leave you questioning your own morals,10,2 April 2011,"Mesmerizing, magical, addictive, obsessive, erotic, beautiful. This is the film Lolita in every possible way.Being a 40-something single mother, I should relate to the mother Charlotte Haze as she struggles with her teenage child and emerges from her loneliness as she falls for Humbert. And yet, it's Humbert I sympathize with.Being a woman who has been burned by selfish men in the past, men who have led me on for whatever purpose suited them, I should feel rage on Charlotte's behalf and feel furious that Humbert so blatantly uses her, writing such nasty things about her. And yet, it's Humbert I sympathize with and share his irritation with Charlottes behavior.Being a protective mother of my children, I too would be horrified and utterly disgusted if some old creep was lusting after my kids. And yet, the way in which the erotic tension is built up between Lolita and Humbert is very fulfilling and delicious to watch. One practically yearns to see them interact in a sexual way.So basically Adrian Lyne managed to take me to a place far, far away from my normal values and attitudes - leaving me confused and disturbed by how I could feel such things watching this film. But in this case, it says less about me and more about what an utterly brilliant director and storyteller he is.",Lolita
103,JoshJDS,Lyne's passionate adaption of Nabakov's tragedy is brilliant and focused,10,8 October 1998,"Although I admit to being skeptical when I heard Adrian Lyne was going to remake ""Lolita"", a novel excellently written by Vladimir Nabakov, and filmed in 1962 by Stanley Kubrick, I was impressed by the results.  I have been unable to get this film out of my head since I saw it.  I was fortunate enough to see it in the theatres; I know it was on Showtime, but this is a film to be seen on the big screen.  Because there are less limits on sexuality in films now than in 1962, Lyne is able to show more than Kubrick was ever allowed to imply.  I was shocked to see that scenes of sexual intercourse (although they were merely simulations) between Humbert Humbert and the 14 year old Lolita were allowed to be seen, although it helps the viewer picture what is at hand, and Jeremy Irons uses the scenes to show us Humbert and Lolita's inner turmoil.  Mr. Irons is simply brilliant, as is Dominique Swain as Lolita.  This was her first film, and if she continues to give performances this strong, she will be very successful.  This film is special because Mr. Lyne had such a passion for it, and because of this, he understands the characters and has prepared well.  There is a human element present in this film that even the book lacked at times.  The film focuses more on the road trip across America than Kubrick's version did, but this is for the better.  I found myself moved by the script, performances, and direction, and by the final frame of the film, I was in tears.  [IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THE FILM, AND DON'T WANT THE END SPOILED, PLEASE STOP READING AT THIS POINT.]  At the end, when Humbert has been pulled over, covered with Quilty's blood, before he surrenders himself, he looks over a cliff, and hears the voices of children playing.  He says that he regrets everything except the murder of Quilty, and was saddened, ""Not by the absense of Lo by my side, but her absence from the sounds of children playing in the fields."" It is at this point we see that Humbert's obsession was really over the girl he loved from his youth, and from that, he has destroyed another girl's life, and deeply regrets it.  For the first time since the existence of this character, whether in print or on celluloid, Humbert is human, and he is redeemed, in only a way that Jeremy Irons is capable of portraying.",Lolita

Lolita is an illusion, just a fallacious appearance of love. She is a devil, she tortures, she plays, she kills, she is a ""nymphet"".

I think the 1997 Lolita is a better depiction of the story for today's generation.  There was much more visual sexual tension and it made it easier for me to understand Humbert's character.  I also like how this one starts out as opposed to the original.  I received a lot of criticism for liking this remake better.  To go against Kubrick, who would dare?

This is an immensely powerful, emotional and visually captivating movie. Nothing at all like the insepid version Kubrick did with Peter Sellers turning the whole thing into trash. ( That's tuff to say. My favorite director of all time is Kubrick and I love Peter Sellers) But Kubrick missed the whole thing of the Lolita story... the man obsessed with youthful beauty, the maniacal impulse to try to control it for one's owns advantages and needs. Adrian Lyne does greater justice to this story and concept than one could ever anticipate and Jeremy Irons is flawless and brilliant in his portrayal of the obsessed adult. The score by Ennio Morricone is unbelievable... after the movie you will hear it in your head for days. Dominique Swain was a devastating choice for the role. Everything this little beguiling vixen should have been... is seen here. You might laugh at the idea of Melanie Griffith reprising the Shelley Winters role of the unattractive mother, Charlotte Haze... but her personality in the character makes her just astonishingly perfect.

109,anitadelre,Be Sure to See This Movie - But Puhlease! READ THE BOOK FIRST!,9,25 August 2014,"Just recently read the book. I'm kind of prudish about giving my attention to themes that are offensive - I knew Lolita was about a sexual predator, and so I avoided it for decades. (I also avoided Breaking Bad on behalf of my prudishness, but yielded when someone with a brain told me to give it a chance.) In any case, the book is enthralling, absolutely magnificent. I'll be on half.com to order all of Nabokov's English-written and English-translation stories - what a writer! (I hope I don't find out that he's a pervert.) But seriously, the story he tells is breathtakingly human, gorgeously written, even humorous.Now, this movie. Or rather, let me start with the 1959 movie, with James Mason, who did a fine job, within the constraints of 1959 movie-making. Pretty much what I expected, and so I was disappointed, altho a well-crafted movie.NOW, this movie. Jeremy Irons blew it out of the water! The only thing he didn't convey - that Mason did - was his utter disgust at touching a woman in her 30s (old, decayed flesh)... but everything else (by Irons) was blindingly perfect. And in fact, I was actually able to believe that perhaps HH did love little Lolita... (Perhaps I had read through my prudish eyes?) I tend to look with jaded eye at obsession and supreme selfishness, which were abundant in HH, of course...Yes, and yet, I do believe that the movie romanticized HH QUITE a bit. For some reason, the director wanted us to like this man. I would have preferred the total HH. Book is quite more to the point about the ugly reality of the whole situation (that's why I read).Melanie Griffith - did fine; too bad there wasn't more of her.But Dominique Swain (do I have that right?) - she was perfect in her childishness, in the girl-child-sexually-bloomin'-woman plane. Far better portrayal of Lolita than Sue Lyon (she played it like a 17 year old, and Little Lo was a mere 12 when HH discovered her). I was very pleased with the casting, and the portrayals that no doubt were part of the director's vision.",Lolita

It's visually just stunning. The soundtrack gets you in the mood for the times. Ennio Morricone did such a good job with the scoring of this film, he truly deserved an Oscar nomination.

Having read Nabokov's book long before the film was released, I had fallen in love with the tale and the author's wonderful method of weaving the story of lovers Humbert Humbert and Dolores Haze.  I watched Kubrick's version and found it disappointing. I always considered Jeremy Irons the perfect casting director's choice for the stumbling, enamoured yet strangely endearing paedophile Humbert.  He holds the audience captive with his gentle yet misunderstood love of the naive, selfish Lolita.As we follow the curious couple around America, we see loving Hummy's paranoia grow as he becomes more possessive of errant and careless Lo. his fears are proved to be true as the emotion of the masterpiece reaches it's peak when all the love and care he gave to Lolita not only as a lover but as a father is ignored by her and she rejects him for another Sugar Daddy.It's so very possible to see the difference between loyal affectionate and adoring Humbert and the Lecherous unappealing Clare.Written and filmed with irony and subtle humour to complement the hard-hitting and emotional subject matter,""Lolita"" Should be seen by all who will have respect for it's content, for it truly is a beautiful piece of cinema.",Lolita

121,saffron-3,I'm going to give this a wishy-washy review. . .,6,3 October 1999,"Sorry, but this film just can't hold a candle to the novel.  (Of course, with the exception of 'Lawrence of Arabia' and its source, 'The Seven Pillars of Wisdom', I can't think of one movie based on a novel that can.) I won't dwell on its more obvious flaws, but will mention them in passing: Jeremy Irons is too old for his role; Dominique Swain is a convincing 14-year-old but not a pregnant 17-year-old; the character of Clare Quilty, a figure of black humor both in the book and in Kubrick's version, is rendered by this script as a sinister, charmless pimp.  The role which has taken the most heat on this site, and which I believe is the most impressive, is the role of Lolita's mother, acted by Melanie Griffith.  I've read several comments that state that this character was intended to be fat and unattractive.  What these viewers may have forgotten (or perhaps they have never read the book) is that every character in the story is seen through the eyes of one person:  Humbert Humbert.  Therefore Lolita is described as being an enticing, irresistible nymphet, although most people who actually came into contact with her would find her to be a rather unattractive, slatternly little brat; and her mother Charlotte is described as being a 'fat cow', when the fact probably was, was that she was a normal, healthy woman who had those secondary sexual characteristics (hips, thighs, breasts) that Humbert wasn't too crazy about and which he recoiled away from as 'fat'.  Nabokov deliberately romanticized Humbert's predilection for girl-children by portraying him as a man haunted by a lost childhood love (rather like Charlie Chaplin); if he hadn't done this, the reader (and viewer) could have interpreted this aversion to grown women as more of a latent homosexuality than to pedophilia.  That digression aside:  the movie is gorgeously photographed and beautifully scored, and the ending is as likely to bring tears as the ending of the novel.  Superior in many ways to the Kubrick version--I preferred Peter Sellers' Quilty in that film, but hated the way he kept intruding so obviously throughout the movie--and inferior in others.",Lolita
122,Haphazardben,A brilliantly riskier re-imagining of a classic story.,10,12 September 2001,"This film will teach people to have more respect and understanding for those with socially unexceptable behaviors. In this case, the deeply rooted desire for someone of much younger age. Lolita doesn't account for all behavior of this type, but in Humbert's case, it sure does. In the original Kubrick version, you really had to have read the book to understand why Humbert behaved the way he did. The sexual tension was barely hinted in those days. For someone who didn't know about the movie before they saw it, they probably had no clue as to what was going on. In the 97 version we understand Humbert's need to replace a lost love that was frozen in time. The cinematography was beautifully choreographed with soft natural light and gritty textures that allowed for the smooth and tempting youth of Delores (Lolita)to be enhanced. Every twist is dramatic to the point of feeling Humbert's horrible frustration when he finds himself in the same place again, with a lost love a second time. Like he missed his second chance. The acting is realistically played out in newer, more natural styles that don't hold back (Which is not often accomplished intelligently in remakes). I give this picture my highest rating.",Lolita
123,spyflea,The little things,9,3 January 2004,"This movie is very well directed and casted and acted out, overall its an incredible movie.  Usually I judge a good movie by comparing it to a book as in the descriptions the words used and such.  Lolita does all of the little things that makes for one great film. There is the scene where lolita takes Humberts breakfast to him, and when she does she steps her one bare foot onto Humbert's left foot, and i can imagine a small warm foot against his.  And she warns him ""Don't tell mother I ate your bacon.""  Shes able to experiment with her power and exploit Humbert for his unfortunate situation. As well in the opening music of the film is very beautiful and sweet, and out of place touches of dissonent tones, reflecting Lolita and her effect on Humbert.

The movie brings a strong eerie presence that was only felt slightly in the book. Humbert is not the perfect step- father he is made out to be, he is obsessive, and a pedophile. Lolita is seen mainly through his eyes, but glimpse of the real Dolores is shown throughout the movie like when she argues about the death of her mother and runs away to the diner. She isn't this ""nymphet"" he portrays her as, shes a normal girl taken from her normal life. Dominique Swain brings the perfect amount of attitude and innocence to perfect her character and Jeremy Irons brings the perfect amount of crazy into Humbert.",Lolita

I never thought the end result could be more powerful and haunting at the same time. It is also not lost upon me over why such an unforgettable and meaningful film could stir so much controversy in the US. There are after all much more disturbing depictions of sexuality available and to generate so much fuss over this film just indicates plain hypocrisy. This film does deal with incest and pedophilia but the moment one finishes with the film the darker overtones of the film is superbly overwritten by the film's many strengths. From the exceptional cinematography to the perfect choice in casting (I thought Melanie Griffith was adequate), this film certainly did tug at my emotions. I can't recall any film that did have quite the same effect on me before. I also thought that Adrian Lyne did a great job in this film. the whole film was beautifully done with honest and tragic human drama carrying it on. Those looking for gratuitous and explicit sexuality will certainly be disappointed... in fact, the more erotic scenes just adequately delve into the forbidden bond that the film's two main protagonists share. I will not talk any further about this movie... one should really see it to at least have an inkling of what I feel about this fantastic piece of art. This one has got to be among my all-time top 10.",Lolita
129,mr_quizzical,"Shallow, overly somber adaptation",4,16 August 1999,"Lolita slowly eats a banana in front of Humbert. Quilty fingers the loop of a dog leash. These are the things in Adrian Lyne's version of Lolita that pass for subtle sexual metaphors. They are metaphors, but of a different sort; they represent the shallow and humorless tone that pervades and undermines this film.Say what you will about Kubrick's 1962 version of Lolita, but the characters had depth, the performances were excellent, and the film's darker moments were counterpointed with humor, which is much truer to the tone of the novel.Not so in this version. Jeremy Irons' one-note performance has him gaping and moping from beginning to end. There is no sense of manipulation on his part, or of an intellect at work; just a awestruck shamble from scene to scene. Melanie Griffith gives a similarly untextured performance.What the film lacks in acting or subtlety, it attempts to make up in flash, as you'd expect from the director of yes, ""Flashdance."" And while a strobing bug light might add to the disorientation and paranoia of a scene, I again direct you to the Kubrick version to see how the exact same dialogue can be more effective with good performances and directing.Again, I think it is the pervasively somber tone that ultimately undoes this film. The one bright spot is Dominique Swain as Lolita, who captures the effervescence and half-innocent sexuality of a ""nymphet"" quite effectively.",Lolita
130,calders,Wonderful movie of forbidden love,7,24 February 2000,"The film from start to finish is a tantalising story of an older mans forbidden lust for a very young girl. It seems that it is 'Lolita' Dominique Swain who has ideas of what she wants from the relationship that is yet to blossom.There are some parts of the film that are quite funny such as the time where 'Humbert Humbert' Jeremy Irons faces school trustees and is informed by the principal that it would be fitting for Lolita to be told of the ways of the world and that it should preferably be an adult, maybe him.It is a shame that Melanie Griffith' character is not in the movie for longer from the point where she finds the blossoming affair in print in Humberts diary. However, this is a main part of the plot that leads to the psychology of the relationship becoming ever closer.This is especially the case in respect to Lolitas feelings for Humbert when she is told that her Mother is dead and looks to Humbert as an obvious but more so father figure.Overall a very good movie.",Lolita

Jeremy Irons here is all Humbert Humbert was meant to be, and not the stiff, unbelievable James Mason that dragged down the original film. And thank goodness Lolita is played by someone closer to the age of a nymphet: of course Hollywood has a problem with Lolita's age (here said to be 12), but after all, nymphets are prepubescent (Nabakov's definition, not mine). The book remains better than any film can be.",Lolita

134,mersault3b,Fails on nearly every level,2,12 October 2000,"This movie should be required viewing for anyone who wants to know how not to create a film from a novel.  The basic premise underlying the adaptation of Nabokov's work (among the best modern literary works in English) is flawed; much of the novel's power stems from Humbert's thoughts and how things look from his twisted yet insightful perspective.  Nearly all of this is left out of this telling which, to be fair, is difficult to avoid with a work like ""Lolita"".  But it's removal does much to rob the story of it's vividness (and it certainly destroys any sense of Humbert as a coherent, if flawed, character)The actors do absolutely nothing to help this situation.  The best is the usually-solid Jeremy Irons who simply looks lost throughout much of the movie.  Melanie Griffith's Charlotte is a grotesque cartoon with almost no form and less inspiration.  And then there's the much-heralded Dominique Swain, chosen to represent the nymphet Lo.  Watching this film, it was clear that she either had no notion of what ""nymphet"" means or was simply incapable of playing a moderately sophisticated role that requires some sense of sexuality.  There was a lack of any chemistry between she and Mr. Irons in all the places where such chemistry was warranted.There were some interesting visuals in the film, particularly the nightmarish sequence near the end.  That said, they don't do nearly enough to save a very weak movie.  This film fails on nearly every level.",Lolita

Kubrick made some changes and created one of the most beautiful black comedies ever.How can you even imagine that you could make a film about Lolita AFTER the perfection in itself and for itself : Stanley Kubrick's Lolita ? How can you think that you could create a compelling drama (and, obviously, Lyne wanted to make a drama ?!!!) out of a story about a man who is sexually attracted to children ? The premise of this movie is absolutely ridiculous. You just can't present a story about a man who wants to have sex with a twelve years old girl as a love story and a drama.",Lolita

In terms of the cinematography and editing, I prefer Kubrick's version and I don't see the need to elaborate on that. However, I think it is more meaningful to make a film that actually confuses the audience and makes them question about morality. Kubrick's version serves more as a satire while Lyne makes us sympathize Humbert, and I believe that it is also what makes the book by Nabokov great. I believe that films are not obligated to explicitly teach us what is right and what is wrong. The capability to critical thinking should be required for well-developed moviegoers today. If you dislike the film because you consider it disturbing, I feel bad for you (but don't worry, you'll get there). By the way, the performance by Jeremy Irons and Dominique Swain are marvelous.",Lolita
139,FrameXFrame,A wonderful adaptation of the novel,9,2 January 2010,"I've read the book, twice, and seen the Kubrick movie twice but Adrian Lyne's new version is the hands-down winner. The casting, the photography, and the production values are amazing. Having directed Fatal Attraction and 9 ½ Weeks, Lyne understands the dark side of love and sex. It's interesting that in his Lolita, he keeps that understanding of the obsessive as the keynote, but adds sunlight, beauty, and humor (a more sophisticated humor than Kubrick's). This dynamic works beautifully. Jeremy Irons adds a guilty edginess to the role and is excellent throughout, portraying complicated emotions naturally and credibly. In my opinion this movie is among Irons' top work.There are many scenes that play out as they did in the book, and the small additions where Lyne has diverged from the book enhance the scenes with rich detail and beauty. The scene on the porch of the Haze house, with Humbert, Dolores, and Mrs. Haze, is wonderfully choreographed, and Swain, as Lolita, is believably kid-like yet sensual. Her sensuality is a new toy, something to experiment with. Dolores, becoming a young woman, plays with her emerging sensuality, but has a child's understanding of adult relations. When she's done playing with sensuality, she'll read a comic book, or listen to the radio, and she doesn't want Humbert bothering her again. Lyne brings out that contrast of normal teen to obsessive object Lolita—the contrast of Dolores Haze herself, and how her obsessive lover sees her.The performance of Melanie Griffiths needs to be noted. She's beautiful, yearning, and a bit socially inept as the small-town landlady attracted to the sophisticated European professor. When she and her daughter get into arguments several times, Griffiths' voice cracks and takes on a shrill tone. These scenes are well-done, and Griffiths handles the switch from charming to infuriated extremely well.The last of the main characters, Clare Quilty, is perfectly acted by Frank Langella. Where Sellers' Quilty was manic and funny, Langella's Quilty is shadowy and sinister, which is as it should be. Near the end, as Langella's Quilty talks to Humbert, we see precisely how Quilty is Humbert's dark (or is that ""darker""?) side and we see that Humbert sees it too. Langella's Quilty is almost always seen smoking a cigarette in the shadows, and his devilish presence adds weight and gravitas to a small but crucial role.As I noted, the production and photography are excellent. The set designs, cars, clothing, and music are all late 1940s, which is the time of the story in the novel. The Kubrick version was set in the time it was made, 1962. I appreciate Lyne getting this right. One of the themes of Nabokov's novel was post-WWII America, with its brand-new recovering economy, and its many highways that spanned the country. A good portion of the book details Humbert's and Lolita's wanderings across America,and Lyne portrays this in his version. He also portrays how immersed in her era Lolita is, using the slang, singing along with the popular music, and gorging on movie magazines and comic books. Lyne and Swain get this aspect of Lolita's character right. The attention paid to detail in Lyne's Lolita is gorgeous and eye-filling. Yet everything feels natural, with never a whiff of self-conscious retro. There are beautifully-lighted scenes, and a sunny surface that contrasts with Humbert's dark obsession. That contrast is the crux of the movie. Kubrick's Lolita brought out the dark comedy of the novel, but Lyne's version of Lolita brings out its lyrical beauty. Both deal with the unhealthy obsessive love Humbert has for Lolita, but in very different ways. I think those who have read the book will appreciate this second version of Lolita for its beauty and for Swain's portrayal of Lolita as an ordinary bratty young teen, and Irons' portrayal of a man with a fierce, yet helpless, obsession.",Lolita
140,LongPantsTramp,A curious rarity,9,5 October 2005,"In many ways, this film is a true rarity. Take a producer like Mario Kassar (Rambo III, Cliffhanger...) and a director like Adrian Lyne (Indecent Proposal) and what do you get? An unbelievably lyrical and beautiful film full of sadness, melancholy and unfulfilled longing.How did this happen? Where did this film come from? There is something magical about the production. Indeed, this film could never have been made as a studio picture. Maybe it's precisely an under-appreciated director like Lyne who could go his way and make the film as it should have been made in the first place. Going through making-ofs and audio commentaries, one realizes that Lyne was actually doing something he can never do again. He was temporarily insane and had an ""I MUST make this film"" passion that transformed the film into something more than just ""an adaptation"".Of course, he couldn't go wrong. At least not with a team like Jeremy Irons, Dominique Swain and Ennio Morricone.By no means does the film reach the heights of the book - and that would pretty much be an impossible task anyway - but what the film does so well is capture the essence of Humbert's doomed love. Kubrick's Lolita is wonderfully witty and funny and, fair enough, that was also an important part of Nabokov's book - but that version lacked all the beauty that the most beautiful subject in the world (doomed love) deserves.Sadly, Lyne's masterpiece has now been forgotten - as if it never existed and Kubrick's Lolita is still considered as the definitive version of the book.I will definitely always defend Lyne's version.",Lolita

The novel was forbidden for a time and terribly criticized. So you could imagine critic's reaction with this adaptation.And that's a big thing to talk about. You know, Jeremy Irons had a lot of problems, because of his ""hot"" scenes with Dominique Swain. Of course, as she was under-aged, the adult scenes were filmed with an adult woman, and all the proper means for avoiding all contact with Dominique in some scenes in which she sits over his legs. All this, and some ""erotic"" scenes, such as watching her eating a banana, or she on the grass, with her T-Shirt all wet, makes the movie ""pornographic"".As you could imagine, I don't believe that. Those are just details, that doesn't make a common and touching drama an erotic movie.The acting, is great. Jeremy Irons, as Humbert Humbert, is perfect. It's like he could catch the character very precisely, a serious, introverted and formal man, who just wanted love, sadly, a forbidden love.Well people, I hope this can help you, at deciding whether seeing the movie or not, as I know the critics you will find, and they may be not good. But of course, even known it all depends on you likes, I think it can be enjoyed by almost anyone.

What made me unsure is the storyline, as it was very disturbing for me, many scenes caused me discomfort. It has gone to the point that I had to stop watching the movie 30 minutes in, and continued it in another time when I was alone, because for some reason I felt quilty while watching it. Aside from this, I actually found the storyline to be well written, and I liked it. When I saw this movie I was around the same age as Dolores so maybe for that reason it was really meaningful to me.

In the case of Lolita we are talking about a very well made film by Lyne ,accompanied by a music of incredible beauty . For once more Ennio Morricone has composed music that has the power to convoke the most beautiful feelings. The music perfectly underlines the scenes and vice versa.The perfect combination!!!",Lolita
150,Ricky-47,Vladimir Nabokov would not enjoy this film.,6,12 August 1999,"It is sure that the screenplay writer stayed faithful to this Nabokov's classical novel. Nobody could dispute it. But beyond this positive point there are some characteristics of the movie that make it just middling as an artistic creation.Lyne's direction uncovers his unsuccessful effort to let on the film his personal ""stamp"". What he finally succeeds is the fact that we do not understand if we watch a film noir (surrealistic plans similar to those in ""The Third Man""), a psychological drama directed by David Cronenberg (the chill we watch on the screen is supported by the without-feeling way of acting) or a boring James Ivory film! The performances - except of Dominique Swain's - are really tragical. Jeremy Irons is so bad as he could never be. Sometimes he makes you believe that he is not acting but just reading indifferently the script.At this point I should emphasize Steven Schiff's impotence in rendering some of the great moments of Nabokov's novel. For example find in the book the point at which Dr. Humbert Humbert sees Lolita for the first time and try to compare it to the correlative scene. In this way you will find out what I am talking about. Schiff is also unable to analyze Humbert's character. Someone who has just read a few pages of the book will easily understand that Humbert is a complexed personality, a man sinking in his unrealized lusts -which outrun every moral limit- and trying to save himself by creating an imaginary world for him and his Lolita. However Schiff does not seem to have understood it .Closing this comment I have to say that Dominique Swain's performance is remarkable as she manages to combine in a perfect way the innocence of a 13 years old girl with her developing eroticism, without having to be seductive.",Lolita
151,aleesas_attic,"""the word is incest""",9,26 December 1999,"When ""Lolita"" was filmed and showed during 1995-97, there was an enormous outrage, fainting-fit-where-is-my-smelling-salts etc etc in regards to the film, that I was half-dreading a 90 min marathon of salacious sex, dirty old man and soft porn actresses. Instead, I was served with a rose-tinted, romanticised version of Nabokovo's great work. That is not to say that it is bad - the cinematography, the music, and the actings were superb (Dominique Swain is one young actress to look out for), but after reading the novel prior the movie, I cannot help but wondering whether the movie is trying to elevate and plausibly explain Humbert's pedophilia. At times, it almost seemed (in the movie) as though Lolita had seduced Humbert, when really the stalking is done otherwise. The ending, however, is very poignant, and beautifully illustrates Humbert's epiphany. On the whole, definitely worth watching.",Lolita
152,ohmss7,A brilliant film exploring the complexities of love...,10,21 January 2000,"The only truly fair way of evaluating this movie is on a stand-alone basis. Lyne's Lolita works wonders with Nabokov's novel, but it does not pretend to be an exact representation of its literary counterpart (and arguably this should be preferred, as so many book to movie translations are doomed to failure and inferiority). Rather, the film dwells in emotion that might be considerably less prominent in the novel. We see the tale of one Dolores Haze and her tortured pursuer in a decidedly softer light. Yet the result is still Lolita. The emotional whirlwind that we are treated to is Humbert-as-hero- we come to view Humbert as he might think of himself by the novel's end. Humbert is the tortured lover, Lolita's desperate protector, and a father(?) who has been ""cheated of his redemption"". Whether or not audiences see Humbert as such is up to them. Most of our hatred for H.H. is derived from our societal views of pedophilia. Those of us who are somehow able to overcome these obstacles may come to feel for this ""monster"". At the heart of Humbert's relationship with Lolita is a desperate struggle to preserve a crumbling love (or maybe even to build one that was never there...). This struggle is beautifully/painfully rendered by its actors. One never knows whether things are going well for H.H. and Lolita, and we watch Lolita slowly slip from Humbert's grasp with as much pain as he does. Even H.H.'s last noble effort against Quilty is disastrous, and his last chance at redemption is unsuccessful. We need to see Quilty die almost as much as Humbert needs to kill him. There is no finality to the tale short of death. Humbert is ultimately unfullfilled (as he is with the death of his Annabel), his life becomes tragedy.And this is what we ultimately bring from this film- a lasting feeling of frustration and emptinness (not entirely unlike what Humbert feels). This is, in a sense, Humbert's ""paradise""- ""a paradise with skies the color of hell-flames, but a paradise nontheless."" In short, Lyne's Lolita is a not to-the-word exact translation of the book, but a faithfully created and beautifully crafted film.",Lolita

Jeremy Irons shines in this role, as a vulnerable, weak-minded father getting ""abused"" by his 12-year-old stepdaughter.  Contrary to what the law dictates, Humbert was not so much a pedophile as a victim of Lolita's cunning wit.  From the way she toys with eating her banana to the way she always seems to have her legs propped up somewhere to expose her thighs, she was asking for it the whole time.Not to say that this kind of behaviour is acceptable; indeed, it was Humbert's responsibility to resist to Lolita's advances and to teach her better.  Needless to say, pedophilia is shocking to say the least.  But even more striking in this movie is the fact that even overly mature 12-year-old girls can use sex to their advantage, and in this case, get absolutely everything they want.  Humbert wasn't a sick pervert:  he was a man who didn't have the mental strength to resist to Lolita's (excellently played by Swain, who is nonetheless too old for the part) excellent tactics.",Lolita

156,Lwchapelhill,"A ""Lolita"" more true to the novel",9,26 August 2017,"I've read the book, twice, and seen the Kubrick movie twice and Adrian Lyne's new version is the hands-down winner. The casting, the photography, and the production values are amazing. Kubrick's version, released in 1962, was plainly nervous about the subject matter, and to offset that nervousness, cast the most charming leading man of the day, James Mason, and for Lolita, the junior sexpot Sue Lyon. Peter Sellers' manic delivery of his lines eliminated the sinister aspects of the character of Clare Quilty, and various comic moments kept the movie from being dark or obsessive. But Lyne is not a man to shy away from the dark or obsessive. Having directed Fatal Attraction and 9 ½ Weeks, Lyne understands the dark and obsessive side of love and sex. It's interesting that in his Lolita, he keeps his understanding of the dark and obsessive as the keynote, but adds sunlight, beauty, and humor (a more sophisticated humor than Kubrick's). This dynamic works beautifully. Jeremy Irons adds a guilty edginess to many of his scenes, as when the headmistress of Dolores' school hems and haws about Dolores' understanding of sex. Irons, as the incestuous step-father, is plainly waiting to be denounced as a monster, as he assumes this conversation has resulted from Dolores telling someone about their illicit relationship. The headmistress fusses a bit more, then comes out with ""Mr. Humbert, someone needs to tell that girl the facts of life!"" Irons' agonizing tension and fear, followed quickly by incredulity and relief, is masterfully done. There are many scenes that play out as they did in the book, and the small additions where Lyne has diverged from the book enhances the scenes with rich detail and beauty. The scene on the porch of the Haze house, with Humbert, Dolores, and Mrs. Haze, is wonderfully choreographed, and Swain, as Lolita, is believably kid-like, yet sensual. Her sensuality is a new toy, something to experiment with now and then. Though it's not in the book, Dolores' tossing her retainer into Humbert's drink, then Humbert trying to conceal this from ""Mama Haze,"" is a terrific addition. Playfulness, sensuality, and concealment of a guilty secret all work to set the tone of the first half of the movie. Dolores, becoming a young woman, plays with sexuality and sensuality, but has a child's understanding of adult relations. When she's done playing with sensuality, she'll read a comic book, or listen to the radio, and she doesn't want Humbert bothering her again. Lyne brings out that contrast of normal Dolores to obsessive object Lolita—the contrast of Dolores Haze herself, and how her obsessive lover sees her.For those nervous about the age thing, Dominique Swain was 16 when the movie was shot, and she credibly plays a coltish 14-year-old. (In contrast, Lyon was 17 when she made the earlier version, and looked close to 20, a peroxide sex bomb of the early 60s).In the book, Dolores/Lolita is 12 when she first beds Humbert; we're not at the point where we can make a movie completely true to the book. (What would be required would be an actress of at least 17 or 18, who could credibly play a 12-year-old.)The performance of Melanie Griffiths needs to be noted. She's beautiful, yearning, and a bit socially inept as the small-town landlady attracted to the sophisticated European professor. She and her daughter get into believable fish-wifely brawls several times, and Griffiths' voice cracks and takes on a shrill and frustrated tone. These scenes are well-done, and Griffiths handles the quick switches from charming and agreeable to infuriated mother extremely well.The last of the main characters, Clare Quilty, is perfectly acted by Frank Langella. Where Sellers' Quilty was manic and funny, Langella makes his Quilty shadowy and sinister, which is as it should be. Near the end, as Langella's Quilty talks to Humbert, we see precisely how Quilty is Humbert's dark (darker?) side, and we see that Humbert sees it too. Langella's Quilty is almost always seen smoking a cigarette in the shadows, and his devilish presence adds a weight and gravitas to a small but crucial role.As I noted, the production and photography are top notch. The set designs, cars, clothing, and music are all late 1940s, which is the time of the story in the novel. The Kubrick version was set in the time it was made, 1962. I appreciate Lyne getting this right. One of the themes of Nabokov's novel was post-WWII America, with its brand-new recovering economy, and its brand-new highways that spanned the country. A good portion of the book details Humbert's and Lolita's wanderings across the map of America, and Humbert's frequent incredulity and well-bred amazement at the simultaneous bounty and brassiness of his adopted country. As well, the novel portrays how much of her era Lolita is, using the slang, singing along with the popular music, and gorging on movie magazines and comic books. The attention paid to detail in Lyne's Lolita is gorgeous and eye-filling. Yet everything feels natural, with never a whiff of self-conscious retro in the entire film. There are beautifully-lighted scenes, and a sunny surface that contrasts with the dark guilty obsession of Humbert. That contrast is the crux of the movie. Kubrick's Lolita brought out the dark comedy of the novel, but Lyne's version of Lolita brings out its lyrical beauty. Both deal with the unhealthy obsessive love Humbert has for Lolita, but in very different ways. I think those who have read the book will appreciate this second version of Lolita for its beauty and for Swain's portrayal of Lolita as an ordinary bratty young teen, and Irons' portrayal of dark, yet helpless, obsession.",Lolita

158,feliciaunicorn,"Spoilers, but totally underrated movie",8,10 July 2021,"Let me just begin by saying I love the book. Not because it's a feel-good tale but because it's tells it story perfectly. The very heart of this book is a dark, twisted and tragic one, and its poetic prose serves an important function - abuse is not always in a gritty, obvious setting, it is not always perpetuated by ugly and charmless people. Sometimes it takes a backdrop against idyllic suburbia, sometimes predators are attractive and good humoured well to do - but the impact of their abuse on the victim is no less heartbreaking for it. In my opinion this film's dreamlike cinematography and softly spoken storytelling via Irons performs that very same function. It does not romanticise the relationship between Lolita and Humpert, it does that the poetic prose of the book did. Everything about this movie from the opening music with its not-quite-right-off-notes in the otherwise romantic score to Jeremey Irons awkward, forced and humanless grind against the backdrop of an otherwise charming presentation pulls this off.As far as the acting goes, it's pretty flawless. People seem to have an issue with Melanie Griffith, but I actually really quite liked her in the role. She had the pitiful, resentful nervous energy that the woman in the book did, Jeremy Irons is perfect in the role and Dominique Swain was a prodigy of an actress - not a lot of people her age could have pulled off what she finally did after so many missteps and misinterpretations of this character - she did Lolita's tragic character justice. She played her as a heart-broken, confused and lonely child, and that's precisely what Lolita always has been.I've seen so many comments about how gross this movie is. It's an uncomfortable movie and it's supposed to be. It's about a man who steals a child at the most vulnerable time in her life, lies to her and forces her to be dependent on him so he can sexually abuse her. He grooms her and objectifies her, reducing her to a fantasy and imprisoning her for 3 years in his valuation of her. The subject matter is supposed to make you feel sad and angry and helpless, so if you felt like that - that was the point, I think.",Lolita

160,LittleLindyLouWho,A true work of art.,10,8 August 2002,"I first saw Kubrick's 'Lolita' and then this version. To me, the original lacked in many ways, the most prevalent being that Humbert's obsession with young girls was never explained. I saw him as a dirty old man and did not sympathize with his character at all. James Mason was more like an angry father than a troubled lover. Sue Lyon was completely wrong for Lolita. She was a brat, and a loud one at that. There were absolutely no nymphet qualities to her. I was highly impressed by Adrian Lyne's adaptation of 'Lolita'. The way in which Humbert's obsession was explained was so understandable. I think it's virtually impossible to not fall in love with Jeremy Irons as Humbert. His eyes seemed to convey so much sadness and passion. Dominique Swain was a perfect choice for Lolita. She's childish, yet awfully flirtatious. I found myself feeling more for Humbert than Lolita. I saw her as a spider who had captured poor Humbert's heart in her tangled web of seduction. True, she was a child, but her actions and words told a different story. Most would have fallen hopelessly in love with her, had they been confronted with the beautiful nymphet. I was inspired so greatly by this version of Lolita that I read Vladimir Nabokov's book of the same name.",Lolita
161,raskolnikov100,A beautiful and accomplished introduction to Nabokov's masterpiece.,10,8 August 2005,"As an adaptation, the Adrian Lyne version is far more faithful to Nabokov's classic novel than the earlier, albeit again great Kubrick film.The leads, Jeremy Irons, Dominique Swain and Melanie Griffith are all excellently cast; indeed, rather than the slightly older age of Swain being an impediment, it actually allows Lyne to explore the sexuality of the novel in a far more frank and striking way than would have been possible with the age and maturity of an actress any younger than Dominique Swain. The appearance and delivery of the two older central characters are also superb, with Irons and Griffith both presenting the darkly pitiable natures of Humbert and Charlotte Haze.Lyne's film also succeeds in highlighting the range of scenery as Humbert and Lolita travel across the American landscape; whilst Ennio Morricone's score appropriately depicts the tragic sentiment of the novel. Moreover, Lyne also succeeds in balancing the tragic elements with the black humour of Nabokov's prose and his fascination with US pop culture.Of course, no film can ever stand as a substitute for a novel as profoundly brilliant as Nabokov's Lolita. It might at least encourage people to turn to the stunningly beautiful prose of the original. One final point to an earlier comment made; the details of Lolita's fate are by no means a creation of Lyne's but are actually tacitly alluded in the fictional ""Foreward"" to the novel.",Lolita
162,esoinila,A forbidden mutual attraction flies in the face of society,10,21 April 2003,"It's a story of the forbidden affair Humbert(Middle age) and Dolores(Lolita(14)) have with each other. Based faithfully on the Novel by Nabakov. It really doesn't have much skin nor foul language in it but the subject is quite flammable, hence the 18 rating.It's got comedy, drama, romance, despair, detective-story, brilliant description of the 50's, lust, good plot... all the works of a great movie. It lasts for many views. Some details might not open unless you've read the book. It's a brilliant movie of a brilliant book.",Lolita
163,palindromicevilolive,"More Feeling, Less Funny",9,19 August 2008,"This film inevitably invites comparison to Kubrick's critically acclaimed 1962 interpretation. The two interpretations, while both more or less faithful to the material, differ widely in tone. Where Kubrick's film is witty, cerebral and detached, Lyne's is passionate and emotionally driven.Lyne's version is undoubtedly more erotic in tone than Kubrick's. Obviously, the time in which the two films were made is a factor here. More modern sensibilities allowed a younger Lolita and far more sensuality than would likely have been permitted 35 years earlier. This version has drawn some criticism for making Humbert a bit too sympathetic, for making Lo seem too much a seductress. These criticisms are perhaps valid, but there is an artistic advantage: We are seeing this story now through the simultaneously Quixotic and monstrous eyes of Humbert. We aren't given the luxury of watching this one from Kubrick's usual emotional distance nor of seeing Lo portrayed by a woman who is clearly of legal age. As a result, the scenes are both more disturbing and more powerful.In truth, Kubrick's film is probably more in keeping with Nabokov's witty and almost facetious tone. The characterization of Clare Quilty is a perfect example. In Kubrick's film, Quilty is portrayed by the legendary comic actor Peter Sellers, who captures perfectly the witty wordplay of Quilty. Frank Langella's Quilty had a silky-smooth and sinister-sounding deep voice, but somehow his relatively straight-laced performance seemed out of step with the almost vaudevillian lines he uttered.For me, though, this actually is a point in Lyne's favor. For Nabokov's Lolita seemed at times to devolve into literary word-play until the story itself seemed merely a hat rack for Nabokov to hang his verbal wit upon. This film instead focuses on the aspects of the novel that have led it be called ""the only convincing love story of our century"" by Vanity Fair.Jeremy Irons gives a magnificent performance as Humbert. Much as he did in ""Dead Ringers"", he gives the impression of someone who combines deviance and vulnerability seamlessly. Dominique Swain was marvelous as Lo/Delores, combining carefree pixie, traumatized victim, and wily seductress into a complex and convincing character. Langella and Melanie Griffith were, I fear, miscast as Quilty and Charlotte Haze respectively.",Lolita

Reading the book, although I did not even finish the part one, I must admit I was intoxicated with Humbert Humbert, his words, his madness, his longing for a spoiled little girl, Lolita.While mesmerized by this uniquely beautiful temptation of a book, the people - mostly my friends - gave me a yes-you-are-a-wicked-girl-I-know look and knowing smile; my fetish with old men is quite well known I must say.The movie was nevertheless exquisite to me. Jeremy Irons' charm was more than enough to fill the story I did not reach in the book.

166,ChristiansForKubrick,Do not watch this awful movie!!!,1,25 February 2012,"In the latest version of Vladimir Nabokov's ""Lolita"" to be filmed, Adrian Lyne assaults his viewers with scene after scene of sin. In case you are unfamiliar with the novel, here's a bit of background. Published in the 50s, ""Lolita"" is the pornographic tale of an 12 year old girl who engages in a lurid sexual relationship with her nympholeptic step-father. No, you didn't read that wrong: I said TWELVE YEARS OLD!! Nabokov had a lot of trouble bringing the book to press - the only people who would touch it were some sex novel publishers - and Lyne had a lot of the same difficulty. Distributors were afraid that audiences would be offended, and so Lyne had to bring out the film on TV. With good reason! I can only say that it saddens me that Showtime ever gave this sorry excuse for a movie a chance...and also that they gave America's perverts a chance to watch it! You MUST keep your children away from this monstrosity at all costs: cover their ears if you happen to chance across one of their classmates' ""progressive"" parents, shield their eyes whenever in the vicinity of a movie theatre, and if they should speak of this despicable film...well I at least wouldn't hesitate to give them the discipline that the movie's ""heroine"" so obviously needs. It is essential that you be alert for the possibility of corruption - a movie this scandalous will draw the seculars like butterflies to a flame. I hesitate to discuss the actual movie at all, out of a fear that even hearing about it might provoke your curiosity and lead you into temptation and also because reading about the movie is or should be a sin in itself. Even typing this out for you sends a shiver down my spine. In the end, though, I think that there is a greater good to be served by the certainty that I will deter readers who might otherwise have subjected themselves to the movie from that future error. Jeremy Irons plays the villainous Humbert Humbert, who comes to America in order to lecture at a reprehensibly elite college. He meets the disgusting Charlotte Haze, with whom he becomes a boarder and eventually a husband. This Haze woman, played by Melanie Griffith, is a portrait of vapid and loathsome sensuality. Her unveiled come-ons (before their marriage!) are absolutely sickening. In fact, this side of Griffith's portrayal is perhaps the movie's sole redeeming moral lesson: the utter undesirability of this woman and the sexual so-called pleasures she has to offer should help us in our fervent quest to keep our children pure. This repugnant sensuality is clearly the element shared by the little and big Hazes. Dominique Swain, in the title role, magnifies her mother's charms to a monstrous degree. We see, for example, her reading the funny pages, hair lank with sweat and exertion, toes curling, tendons straining, rocking, breathing deeply, bare leg, breathing more deeply, moaningbefore Lyne cruelly cuts away. Or later, we see the temptress prostitute herself for a raise in her allowance. Wherever did she learn to rub her hands so teasingly along her step-father's leg? The viewer, shuddering spasmodically, struggles to think. And Irons, with that bare, well-muscled chest, is hardly innocent in these exchanges either. Incidentally, I have not seen the film. I advise you follow my example.",Lolita

""you have ruined my redemption"" he says to quilty. i thought that was the best line in the movie.  if this is a movie you have not yet seen please do so. the comic undertones of this movie are absolutely brilliant.  melanie griffith was excellent for the duration of her stay on this film.  but, nothing out does the performance of Delores ""lo"" haze. she absolutely makes this movie convincing.",Lolita

169,darrenleewebster,The most beautiful version of this classic tale..,10,18 September 2021,"From the very start, even if never having heard of the nymphette Lolita, we know there is a darkness about to unfold before our eyes. We hear the silken smooth Jeremy Irons telling us of his undying, tormented love for Lo, we see blood on his hands, both literally and metaphorically. The incidental music is so perfect, we dream along with the narrator, as he tells his side of the events. The camera work and direction is such that we see the undeniably gorgeous, vibrant, vivacious and not quite as innocent as she should be, Lolita, totally steal our gaze, every move we are drawn in, we see what Humbert sees.The colours seem more vibrant, whether it be the crystal drops of water, the greenery of a garden, or the red warning to us and Humbert of Dolores' rouge lippy.This version is lighter than the novel, yes, the subject matter remains the same, but in this rendition, we are considering that there IS great love between the two lead characters. Lolita plays Humbert like a virtuoso plays a violin on many occasions, he has domineering, adult control at other points, but both 'seem' to love each other unconditionally and that makes this version much lighter viewing.This has to be Adrian Lyne's masterpiece full stop.Melanie Griffiths' rendition of Charlotte is sublime, so perfectly pretentious.!The is great comedic moments and lovely, lovely light moments and scenes that remind us this is about human behaviour.. Not conventional behaviour, but very, very human, nonetheless.As a side bar, this novel and movie are most highly rated by women and women are always, like Lo, in power and in the right.

170,thephenomenon2085,"Lolita, interesting enough to watch",7,5 May 2005,"Lolita is a head jerker of a movie, even though most viewers already have some idea what the story is based on. The characters are very intriguing people, all of them, Lolita, Humbert and Charlotte. They seem to be weird people in awkward situations, although for all their problems you can still feel for each of them. Humbert the child molester strikes a chord of his sense because of his undying affection of this little girl who plays off his illness. Lolita is the easiest to fall for, but only because she is a young impressionable girl who always has innocence in the viewers' heart, even though at times she seems to rip that notion right out of you. This film tests the boundaries of what is right to most people and what is right in the heads of all the characters.A Constant battle goes on in feeling of pity or total disrespect for Humbert and his twisted mind. Also, what side causes this disastrous relationship to start and why it ended so abruptly? This movie leaves few answers to the questions you ask your self. Who is the real evil of this story, the situation that the two were put into after there is no more mother or is it the man that flirts with a 14 year old and eventually sleeps with or is it the girl who seduces a man, who she sees she can profit from or is this just a sick movie of people you never want to meet and think all should go to hell.Lolita is entertaining to those who like to see those whose characters are a little off and a storyline that shakes you and leaves you asking why. The movie is put together well enough were the story moves fluently and keeps the viewers attention and is well worth the two or more hours, especially if you have never read or seen the other versions.",Lolita

It was the scene where Lolita jumps on Humbert and kissed him. I was fascinated and curious since the kiss was shared between a very young girl and an older man, yet neither felt the kiss was inappropriate. However, I did not know any of the actors or even the name of the movie, until recently. I was channel surfing when the a clip from the movie caught my attention, I was thrilled.Before I saw the movie i had no idea what it was it was about since I had not read the book or saw the original movie. By the end of the movie it was not what I had expected, after seeing the clip at the movie awards. It was a beautiful, tragic and haunting love story that left me wanting more.Jeremy Irons was remarkable as Humbert. He made a supposed wretched character seemed lovable and noble. He made Humbert's love for Lolita to be genuine and not dishonorable as many would like it to be. He bought the complexity of Humbert's character to life. Notably in the scene in the hospital where Lolita went missing. The pain he felt was deep and agonizing, remarkable acting. It really was a pity that his performance was not praised as deserved. Honestly I could not think of a more perfect person for the role of Humbert.Dominique Swain was amazing. She was provocative yet innocent. The chemistry between both actors was powerful.At the end of the movie where Humbert felt that he had ruin the life of Lolita, I beg to differ since he really did love Loita and was willing to devote himself to her, instead she cruelly toyed with his feelings. I think she would have eventually be in the same situation if she had never met Humbert.",Lolita

The content of the story may put off many prospective viewers, but the story does not condone Humberts actions, it simply narrates them. For those of you unfamiliar with the story, Humberts (Irons) loss of his young love scars him in a way which compels him to rediscover it, through relationships with young girls. He moves to a town to accept a teaching position and while looking for suitable housing he meets Lolita Haze (Swain), a young girl who immediately catches his eye and his heart. The rest of the film chronicles their tempestuous relationship, one in which Humbert takes advantage of Lolita's natural curiosity and developing mind and body.

173,writerdudette,An admirable adaptation of a classic novel,8,18 February 2006,"Lolita, by Vladimir Nabokov, has been hailed as one of the greatest controversial works of art of our time, and much the same can be said for this film, as well.Adrian Lyne, who has been known for directing such risqué movies as Unfaithful and Fatal Attraction, proves his worth as a filmmaker by making this into a surprisingly touching piece of cinema. One thing he has been known for is casting excellent actors in parts wonderfully suited for them, and Lolita is no exception. The infamous Humbert Humbert is played here by Jeremy Irons, in an emotionally gripping performance, a sensitive man who realizes his unhealthy obsession with Lolita but is unable to stop it. The nymphet temptress herself is portrayed by Dominique Swain, whose acting ability is far beyond her years; she knows who Lolita is and what she wants, and she carefully and elegantly allows herself to evolve from an obnoxious brat into a cynical woman.Vladimir Nabokov's novel was a tragedy, a romance, a drama, a social commentary, and, at times, even a satire and a detective story. Lyne's Lolita is primarily a romance, with scenes that even border on campy occasionally. He is truer to the letter and plot of Nabokov's immortal novel than the spirit. He is careful to mold and execute the scenes exactly as Nabokov has written them, staying true to detail rather than feeling. Nevertheless, he has managed to produce an admirable adaptation of a classic work of literature.",Lolita

This movie stuck more to the book (because of the day and time I imagine). Interesting movie, sad in a way but not for either male characters. Mostly for Lolita. Losing her mother and her father and being taken advantage of by two very older men.

They try to make Humbert too sympathetic instead of a monster, when really he is a sympathetic monster, and that is the beauty of the novel Lolita, one moment you hate him the next you feel bad for him. I believe Irons could have been a good Humbert if the screenplay had been batter. Yes, Swain was too old to play Lolita but why, why on earth do they have her acting like a 5-year-old. Running and skipping and jumping and playing with dolls, by age 12 most girls are throwing out their dolls because they want to be more mature and are becoming interested in sex, which is exactly what Lolita was doing in the novel, she was smack-dab in-between the child world and adult world. I wish Swain would have remembered what it was like at that age instead of trying to over compensate for being too old by acting childish but maybe that is what the script required her to do. Griffith did an okay job but when I read the book I picture more of the Haze in the 1962 movie, meaning I see her as a bigger woman and more over the top. With all that said neither film lives up to the book but the Kubrick version gets away with more because he doesn't try to stay true to the novel, which is a masterpiece. No one will ever be able to capture the beauty of Lolita on film and I hope this is the last time they try.",Lolita

178,marilima,"A convincing, disturbing and mesmerizing story, all at the same time",9,2 November 2017,"Caution is necessary when falling in love with a story like this. The relationship between Dolores Haze, or simply Lolita, and Humbert should not be seen as love. It never was. The movie presents a story of a man who chronicles his perverted obsession with a child through his own sick, twisted point of view.In this film, H. H. has a sociopathic tendency to victimize himself. However, one cannot deny the beauty of the manifestation of his sensitivity when he cries for the first time the moment he finally finds out what happened to Dolores and in many other moments that clearly express his dementia. These troublesome scenes deserve attention because they were well executed and wonderfully played by the main actor. Lolita is one of the best stories I have ever been able to get my hands on, but it is a cruel story. The book makes the reader feel like part of the plot because he is inside the mind of Humbert Humbert, which is brilliantly done by Nabokov, and this is not as clear or well portrayed in the movie. Perhaps, I could simply say it is more subtle Either way, movies and books are different kinds of media and, by being so, one must take into account that there are different possibilities for each one. The 1997s adaptation fulfills its role by taking its viewers inside a pedophile's mind anyway. It enables you to see what Humbert sees, and to perceive what Lola perceives. It is a convincing, disturbing and mesmerizing story, all at the same time. Additionally, when it comes to the movie the extreme sexualization of a child is a disturbing factor, and it might creep out the most unwary spectators. It could not be different though, it is a controversial subject portrayed in an equally controversial manner. This fact alone pushes some people away from getting to know the story, but art is a vast subject. It can be vile. It can hurt. And honestly, I am glad it does. Fundamentally, whether you read it or watch it: Lolita is not a love story. It should be that it is, in fact, a story about pedophilia, rape and abuse – and that is what you bear in mind if you are willing to give it a try and watch it, even if the way it was made might make it a bit harder for it to be perceived as such.",Lolita
