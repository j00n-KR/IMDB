0,SnoopyStyle,hard Rock,5,5 June 2021,"Zeke Banks (Chris Rock) is a reckless undercover cop. Twelve years earlier, he had brought down a dirty cop and became an outcast within the department. His father (Samuel L. Jackson) was his supervisor at the time. Captain Angie Garza (Marisol Nichols) is his present day boss and she forces him to partner up with rookie Detective William Schenk (Max Minghella). They're assigned a strange case of a dead body in the subway.Chris Rock has been trying to act hard in a few roles recently. Some comedians can pull that off especially as they get older. All I think is that this is an unfunny Chris and it's weird. This is his acting face and it's fake. I try to image him without his past greatness and I can't do it. As for the movie, this is a lot of Saw essentials; overly complicated kills and morality lessons. The complicated tests are getting repetitive after almost two decades of Saw movies. I actually like the self-righteous morality in this one. The reveal is fine although it's somewhat expected coming from this franchise. Quite frankly, I wonder if this would be better if Sam Jackson takes the lead role.",Spiral
1,nogodnomasters,You're choice.,7,31 May 2021,I stopped watching the original series. I turned off Saw III in the middle as the franchise lost its soul. In this film there is a copy cat killer. Chris Rock plays the lead investigator. He has a rookie partner and Samuel L. Jackson is his retired cop father. The only hint the film gives us is that Chris Rock snitched on his partner who shot an unarmed man. It would have been nice to have something else to elaborate on.We discover the killer near the end in a scene that didn't seem as developed as the rest of the feature. There were basically no clues.Guide: F-word. No sex or nudity.,Spiral
2,jboothmillard,Spiral: From the Book of Saw,4,23 May 2021,"I wasn't expecting there to be any more Saw movies after The Final Chapter (Saw VII, or Saw 3D, as it was known), but they managed to squeeze out Jigsaw three years ago, and then there came this eighth instalment, directed by Darren Lynn Bousman (Saw II, Mother's Day, St. Agatha). Basically, at a Fourth of July parade, off-duty cop Detective Marv 'Boz' Boswick (Dan Petronijevic) chases a thief down a sewer drainage pipe. He is attacked from behind by a figure wearing a pig mask, and wakes to find himself suspended by his tongue in a trap above a subway tunnel. On a television screen plays a recorded message from someone wearing the pig mask with a distorted voice, telling him he has a choice: tear out his tongue that and live, or be hit and killed by the oncoming train. Boswick is unable to escape in time and is hit and killed by the train. The next day, police Captain Angie Garza (Marisol Nichols) assigns Detective Ezekiel ""Zeke"" Banks (Chris Rock, also producing) a new partner, idealistic rookie William Schenk (The Handmaid's Tale's Max Minghella). Banks and Schenk investigate Boswick's death, seeing the cirmstances of the officer's death, and a red spiral spray painted on the wall, Banks believes the crime to be inspired by now deceased Jigsaw Killer, aka John Kramer. Meanwhile, homicide Detective Fitch (Richard Zeppieri) is abducted and placed in a trap where he must rip his fingers off to avoid electrocution in a filling water basin; he also fails to escape and dies. Several years ago, Fitch ignored a backup call from Banks, resulting in him nearly getting killed. Some officers begin to suspect that Banks may be responsible, due to his history with Fitch. A box then arrives at the station, containing a pig puppet and a piece of Schenk's tattooed skin inside. A small vial inside the box directs the police to a butcher shop, which was previously a hobby shop that Banks and his father, retired chief Marcus Banks (Samuel L. Jackson), would go to. Upon arriving, the team discovers a tape recorder and the skinned corpse of Schenk. Deciding to track down the killer himself, Marcus travels to a warehouse, where he is abducted. Shortly afterwards, Garza is kidnapped, and placed in a trap in the precinct's cold storage where she must sever her spinal cord on a blade to stop hot wax flowing from a pipe onto her face. She manages to successfully sever her spine but dies of her injuries, with Banks finding her body. Following a lead, Banks is captured and wakes up handcuffed to a pipe in the warehouse with a hacksaw nearby. He considers sawing off his arm but manages to escape using a loose bobby pin. He then discovers Pete Dunleavy (Patrick McManus), his former partner who was fired when Banks exposed a murder he committed, chained in place. A large glass-crushing machine has been modified to hurl shrapnel at Pete at high speed; a tape recorder explains that Banks can choose to either free him or leave him to die. Although Banks tries to save Pete, he dies from blood loss. Moving to another room, Banks then finds Schenk, who is alive having faked his own death by using the skinned corpse of the thief who lured Boswick into the tunnels; he has been the copycat killer all along. He explains that he is really Billy Emerson, the son of the person Pete murdered, who was shot because he had agreed to testify against a dirty cop. He also reveals that Marcus, during his time as chief, deliberately protected corrupt officers, including Garza, to ""clean"" the streets of crime more efficiently. Emerson presents him with a final test to prove himself as a potential ally. Marcus is restrained in the air and slowly being drained of blood. Emerson calls 911 and claims that he is a civilian being pursued by a shooter, resulting in the dispatcher sending a SWAT team to his location. He hands Banks a gun with a single bullet and offers him a choice, to either shoot a target that will save Marcus but allow Emerson to escape, or to kill Emerson and let his father bleed to death. Banks decides to shoot the target to save Marcus, causing his restraints to loosen and lowering him to the ground. He fights with Emerson, and the SWAT team arrives. The SWAT tram inadvertently trigger a tripwire, causing Marcus to be yanked up, and a gun becomes affixed to his arm. The restraints and the gun are pulled upward, the SWAT mistake Marcus for a shooter and kill him. Banks screams in anguish as Emerson escapes. Also starring Ali Johnson as Officer Jeannie Lewis, Zoie Palmer as Kara Boswick, Dylan Roberts as Sergeant Morgey, K. C. Collins as Detective Drury, Edie Inksetter as Detective Kraus, Thomas Mitchell as Detective O'Brien, Carvin Winans as Officer Paul, Leila Leigh as Officer Mark, and Josh Stolberg as Police Officer. Rock proves himself as more than a comedian with a reasonable serious performance as the lead cop, Minghella is alright, and Jackson is an odd but interesting choice as the lead character's dad. This sequel is from the perspective of the authorities trying to catch the killer, Tobin Bell is nowhere to be seen (apart from some photos) as the culprit is a copycat, but it doesn't quite work. The traps and deaths are just as gruesome as the previous ""torture porn"" entries, but the film suffers from a lack of inventive twists, no scares, no thrills, and a predictable script, a pretty disappointing and boring horror. Okay!",Spiral
3,BA_Harrison,Clap-trap.,4,15 October 2021,"It's quite apt that the the star of Spiral, the latest chapter in the 'Book of Saw', is stand-up comedian Chris Rock, because the film is a joke.Rock, dreadfully mis-cast, plays Detective Zeke Banks, who is the focus of a campaign of terror by a serial killer who seems to be emulating the infamous John Kramer AKA Jigsaw, only this time the victims are corrupt cops (how topical). Banks is sent parcels in the post by the new killer, leading him from one gruesome discovery to another.In the opening scene, the trap is situated above a subway line, the victim given the option of losing his tongue or losing his life. Did no-one making this film question the logic of installing a complex mechanical device above an operational railway line? How long would the device have taken to assemble? Did no trains pass by on those days? Was the third rail electrified the whole time? It's just plain dumb.......but not as dumb as the trap that the maniac somehow manages to assemble in a police evidence room. It pumps boiling wax onto the victims face, thus requiring a power supply and some heavy duty equipment, yet is installed without a hitch, no-one interrupting the (presumably noisy) work, and with no-body questioning the presence of such a device.And I gotta love the following scene for all the wrong reasons: Zeke picks the lock on his handcuffs using a hair pin and then protects himself from high velocity shards of glass using a dustbin. Firstly, picking a lock is not that simple - it can be done, but takes practice and time. Secondly, that bin ain't protecting him - there's glass flying everywhere, but that's okay... what's a few deep flesh-wounds to a tough guy like Zeke?The ill-considered script also holds very few surprises regarding the identity of the killer: as soon as Detective William Schenk was declared dead without showing how he was killed or why he was chosen, I knew I had my man. And sure enough... (one might say 'I SAW that coming').Lastly, what's up with the killer's puppet: not only does it look stupid, but it's got a really daft voice as well. Bring back Billy!3.5/10, generously rounded up to 4 for the finger-trap, which is undeniably nasty.",Spiral
4,BandSAboutMovies,I felt obligated to watch this,6,29 July 2021,"Last year, I watched every Saw film in a day or two and it's not an experience that I would wish on anyone. Well, seeing as how this had the lofty title of Spiral: From the Book of Saw and was directed by Darren Lynn Bousman, who also was behind Saw II, Saw III and Saw IV, I was for sure that I was going to hate every single moment of this.Guess what? I didn't!I mean, it's the best Saw movie I've seen and I still didn't love it, but it didn't make me continually look at how much time is left in the movie, which is a major improvement on past episodes in the franchise.Honestly, this movie could have been its own film and had nothing to do with Jigsaw or any of the past films and it would have been just fine on its own.This film got its start when Chris Rock met Lionsgate vice chairman Michael Burns at a wedding and decided that doing a horror film would be a new direction for him. He's right, but it's kind of like the entire film is Rock testing out his ""I'm divorced now"" material on the audience, which isn't all that bad, because I laughed at a lot of it, but I'm also not certain that the film should have been about Rock's ""big divorce energy.*""Rock plays Det. Marv Bozwick, a man whose father - Samuel Jackson! - was a cop and when he finally became a cop himself, it turns out that everyone was dirty. Well, just from the opening, it seems like maybe Marv is on his way. Or maybe he's having too much fun playing a criminal. And hey, that scene is never brought back or discussed again.The idea that a copycat killer is cleaning up the police department is a good one, yet we're forced to feel sympathy for the kind of cops that have given the justice system the bad name that it currently lives under. There are about five minutes of actually trying to turn this into something interesting before people start getting hung up by their tongues, which is pretty much what this franchise is all about.The end of this was one of the weirdest edited mishmashes I've seen, more given to scattered imagery and flashes than showing what was really happening. It was like they realized they only had a few more feet of film - it's digital, guys - and just went with what they had. Or maybe this was shot during quarantine and they did the best they could.That said - the buddy cop aspects of this and where they go were interesting. And I'd much rather see where the Spiral and Mr. Snuggles the cop puppet turn up next than go back to the same story that the other films have mined more times than I thought was even necessary.Spiral is available in so many formats for your viewing pleasure: a 4K Ultra HD Combo Pack (plus Blu-ray and Digital), a blu-ray Combo Pack (plus DVD and Digital), DVD and Digital On Demand. You can get any of them wherever you choose to buy movies from Lionsgate. The physical media sets also include two commentary tracks: one with director Darren Lynn Bousman, co-screenwriter Josh Stolberg and composer Charlie Clouser and another with producers Oren Koules and Mark Burg.*© G.

5,CinemaSerf,"It is grizzly ok, but for all the wrong reasons....",6,14 September 2021,"Now ever since ""Agora"" (2009) i have had a tiny bit of a crush on Max Minghella - so I suspect i am being kinder to this bobbins than perhaps I would have been had he not starred here as ""Shenk"" alongside Chris Rock (""Zeke"") and his on-screen pop ""Banks"" (Samuel L. Jackson). Perhaps on-screen flop would have been a better description, though to be fair SLJ features only as if he were on a daily rate and the budget was frugal... It has a lot of ""Se7en"" (1995) about it - two cops, one a rookie, investigating a series of grisly homicides that, in this case, bear a striking resemblance to some previous serial killings - and the killer is leaving tantalising breadcrumbs for them to follow. Sadly, though, as the plot nears the sharp end, it falls foul of some frankly ridiculous twists the culminate in an almost risibly silly ending. Rock tries hard, too hard, and the script is banal with little characterisation to make you - or keep you - remotely interested in what's happening to whom. Straight to streaming, I'd have said...",Spiral
6,view_and_review,If Only Chris Rock's Character Stayed in Character,7,4 June 2021,"From the vaults of the ""Saw"" franchise is ""Spiral"" starring Chris Rock. This movie had a strong start. There was a gruesome Jigsaw style killing to begin with and Chris Rock was hilarious as the surly, yet honest Detective Zeke Banks. He played a very stereotypical loner cop who was indignant when he was assigned a partner, but it was forgivable because he was so funny.As the movie settled into the gory murder mystery that ""Saw"" is known to be, Chris Rock's character changed as well. He was far less funny which made him also less believable as a tough metro city cop who's face became congealed into a permanent mean mug. Chris Rock is not a mean mug kinda guy.The nameless faceless killer in Jigsaw's stead was killing dirty cops. I gotta tell ya, it was hard to hate a killer who was targeting criminals with a badge. Sure, his methods were brutal and sadistic, but his heart was in the right place.The movie seemed to be on overdrive the last two-thirds of it. Chris Rock was bouncing from place to place and receiving one package after another without there being any real sense of time. Things were happening so fast the gravity of it all never got a chance to sink in. I liked the premise, I just would have preferred Chris Rock's character to have stayed in character.",Spiral
7,neil-476,OK,7,29 May 2021,"Zeke is a police detective, ostracised by his colleagues for turning in a fellow cop who shot an unarmed man but lied about it. He is given a case, the murder of a fellow cop which appears to be a Jigsaw copycat killer. And it is the first of a series of killings which may have connections to when Zeke's dad was police chief.This movie undoubtedly uses the Saw trademark of presenting the guilty with the possibility of choosing redemption by way of self-inflicted extreme violence, but it does it in the context of a decent story. It's not an unfamiliar story, and I was able to guess the two suprises without too much trouble. But it's still a better story that the Saw series ended up with.The casting was a surprise. Chris Rock was rather good, Isle of Wighter Max Minghella is second banana, and Samuel L Jackson collects a paycheque.",Spiral
8,morrison-dylan-fan,My return visit to the cinema.,7,25 May 2021,"With cinemas having recently re-opened in the UK, I've been trying to decide what would be the first title I would see on the big screen. Marking the re-opening of cinemas in 2020 by going to see the wonderful The Vigil (2019-also reviewed)I decided to stay in Horror, and pick up the latest piece of the Jigsaw puzzle.View on the film:The driving force of this entry after he met the head of the studio at a mutual friends wedding in Brazil, Chris Rock gives a very good performance as cop Zeke Banks (Zeke being the shorten version of ""Ezekiel""- 25:17:""The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides By the inequities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil men."") thanks to Rock using his comedian persona to give Zeke a wisecracking confident swagger, which Rock chips away to reveal blistering terror at the jigsaw pieces coming into play.Storming in to take on the psycho, Samuel (yel) L Jackson gives a delightfully bombastic turn, with him visibly enjoying the snappy exchanges with Rock,and yelling at the killer to just bring it.Ending the title with a Trap track (Get it?) Darren Lynn Bousman returns to the franchise with cinematographer Jordan Oram making his non-TV/shorts debut, and unleashes the signature sped-up panning shots and rapid-fire edits on the chewy gory set-pieces.Whilst continuing the splatter of the past flicks, Bousman & Oram perform a successful reboot that slides the flick onto Thriller tracks, via stylish extended takes tracking shots gliding next to Zeke trying to pull out secrets from fellow cops,as another trap pulls out a jaw.Going right back to the morality motivation Jigsaw had used in early Saw flicks, the screenplay by the returning Josh Stolberg and Pete Goldfinger skewer the ruthless murders with vicious police corruption thrills,that spiral into a sharp twist ending,where on the path to find the killer, Zeke finds himself beset on all sides by the inequities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil men.",Spiral
9,kannibalcorpsegrinder,Barely watchable franchise reboot,3,21 May 2021,"Assigned to be partners together, cops who don't like each other find themselves as the latest to investigate a series of killings that are reminiscent of the original Jigsaw killings years earlier, and the closer they get to the truth find themselves the next potential targets to be caught inThis was a rather disappointing and unremarkable genre entry. Like most franchise efforts, this one only works with the brutality and graphicness of the traps the victims find themselves fallen into. Keeping more of a recent trend where the overall goal of the traps isn't truly about getting out of them to learn a lesson but more of just cruel and graphic methods of dismembering people, there's a rather brutal and unfair nature to the traps featured that makes the expected results at the end rather fun and impressive. With traps featuring one victim with his tongue stuck in a contraption and being forced to remove himself by tearing off his tongue before being hit by a train, another with his fingers tied together and forced to extricate himself before the fingers are all ripped off and then another is forced under a hox-wax dispenser and is forced to sever their spinal column to keep the wax from dripping onto their face among even more traps. This is a fun aspect of the film and really serves as the best factor here as the brutality present here serves this well enough. There are a few major issues with this one. The main problem is that we're being forced to stay on this one cop for most of the investigation, which is completely unrealistic or appropriate. The fact that this is a personal vendetta on several fronts, namely his history with the other officers on the force for his past behavior bringing down the corrupt officer to his struggles staying out of his father's shadow, creates a big issue of why he's even involved in the case, to begin with. Given the personal matters already, the revelations about the victims being cops tied to him creates a major conflict of interest that would make it highly unlikely he would be allowed onto it which only serves to highlight how unappealing he is as a pretty unimpressive lead. Brash, loud, arrogant to every bit of help he gets, and determined to do it alone regardless of how out of his element he is. This really makes it hard to follow him throughout the investigation. Sill, what makes the investigation even harder to follow is how underwhelming and uninspired it really is. The whole concept of the killer's identity being a mystery to figure out is a complete joke with the idea being telegraphed from the moment the character appears on-screen and we get their initial interactions with other characters in a manner that highlights who they'll become later on. As well, the amount of time spent on trying to figure this out from the clues left at the crime scenes or the interactions on the police force comes off with the intensity of a police procedural series on a random television show, barely taking hunches or guesswork and essentially just being lucky that what he's doing with strange objects in the station or other pieces of technology aren't corrupting the system like they easily could've. To hand this off at the expense of traps or anything else relegated to the franchise's past is a major factor when it's barely focused on these traps, all of which hold this one down the most.Rated R: Extreme Graphic Violence and Extreme Graphic Language.",Spiral
10,trashgang,"mixed feelings about the title, not about the flick",7,1 July 2021,"Watched it totally blind. Happy I have seen it but why was this made. I mean, what has this to do with the Saw franchise?I see that some countries it was only called Spiral, that would have been better.

But on the other hand, Kramer is referred to sometimes so okay, we hav a Saw connection...and the doll is here....the pigs...the gore..There's a lot of gore, that's a fact.

Pathetically predictable villain might as well be called Roy Burns.3. In a series known for terrible acting, Chris Rock said: ""Hold my beer.""4. Felt like some kids came up with the script from only watching Saw trailers.5. Chris Rock's oddly inserted stand-up comedy routines proved he had no idea what movie he was in.6. Or he just didn't care.7. And like the writers, I also suspect Chris Rock has never watched a Saw film.8. Hell, he even looks confused on the poster.9. Placing a Pulp Fiction reference in an overly dramatic scene is overly stupid.10. Kept expecting Pinhead to show up to make THIS the worst Hellraiser sequel.11. ""John Live TV"" showed me this for free which is too expensive even at half the price.12. Where is the 'Everything Wrong With' video? It would be their first hourlong episode.13. Using the Saw score in this is just as cringy as the Jaws theme in Jaws: The Revenge.14. This police force isn't just amusingly inept, they're all just standing around waiting to die.15. The Dark Knight Rises' police force is now brilliant comparatively speaking.16. The Peacemaker would love this movie's hero: the 2nd most hypocritical ""good-guy.""17. Was this originally a Scary Movie sequel due to the new & absolutely hilarious Jigsaw voice?18. And people thought Chucky's new voice in his remake was bad.19.

12,FeastMode,"not bad, but also not good",5,17 May 2021,"I was excited when this movie opened with an awesome trap, shown in a perfect way with close-ups at first before finally revealing the entire thing, similar to how someone who is regaining consciousness might experience it. Then we delve into the new tone if the movie, which i also liked. Same with the chris rock comedy. The setup was good, and the story was intriguing.But it did not culminate into anything of note and ranged from mediocre to disappointing for the second half of the movie. The traps were okay, and i feel like there were only four of them. And to make it worse, for two of them they let you know the player didn't survive before showing you the trap, which defeats the purpose and removes the tension.All in all, i liked the idea and the new tone, and i didn't have a bad time with the movie. I will probably give it another chance. And i would be curious to see a continuation of the story. But imo, this is worse than any of the original 7, and on par with jigsaw (part 8). And this is almost exactly what i said about jigsaw (1 viewing, 5/14/2021)SPOILERSthe most disappointing part about this movie is that i guessed the reveal. Guess isn't the right word. I knew who the killer was at about the halfway point and never waivered after that. This has never happened to me with any of the previous 8 movies, even sometimes on second viewing. Maybe it's more difficult to surprise a seasoned fan of the series. But that argument can't be used when the first 8 repeatedly surprised me. And it wasn't even clever.",Spiral

It was cool seeing Marcus strung up like a puppet and then a gun barrel shoots out his arm.

The direction which was made by Darren Lynn Bousman, it was good and I believe that he did an excellent job on the way he used the information from the old ""Saw"" movies. The interpretation of Chris Rock who played as Detective Zeke Banks was very good and I enjoyed watching Chris Rock playing on such a different role.

19,cruise01,Different take on the Saw franchise that still delivers a bone chilling sequel.,8,18 May 2021,4 out of 5 stars.Spiral is a good horror thriller film that makes it the ninth film in the series. And still being fresh with the ideas of creating another. This sequel is different. Just like how Jigsaw movie was. The concept feels like a crime solving detective film which has Chris Rock following several grisly murders that are caught as victims to the next jigsaw traps. But how are all these victims connected? And what is jigsaw motives behind all these murders? The plot is good. Has a theme which what the killers motives are. About corrupt cops and dishonesty. There is a twist in the end which is a fun surprise to the final few mins.The film is less gory and has less torture scenes than the earlier Saw films. Spiral is still brutal and has intense gory scenes with its few it does have. Some may leave you cringing. It does have some intense sequences.The cast ensemble is good. Chris Rock taking on a more serious role as a burnt out officer. Samuel L. Jackson playing his father. And others were good with the roles as well.The direction is a little fresh take with the franchise. Which still leaves room for more.One thing that could have improved is the script.

20,eddie_baggins,A new direction for the Saw series that only works in brief moments,4,14 May 2021,"Arising from the dead once more thanks to groundwork laid by its star and key backer Chris Rock (yes that's correct, Saw is now a vehicle for Chris Rock), Saw (the Fast and the Furious of the horror genre) returns for its 9th installment with Spiral: From the Book of Saw, a new beginning for a series that started out as humbly as you could imagine with the low budget James Wan creation all the way back in 2004.With Jigsaw well and truly laid to rest (but never say never), this time around Spiral focuses on a new copycat killer who is targeting the police force in a series of grisly murders that lead Chris Rock's tough to love but determined detective Zeke Banks team up with Max Minghella's rookie detective William Schenk to uncover the identity of the pig mask wearing mastermind that seems hellbent on bringing Jigsaws murderous pieces of art back to the big stage.Teaming up with director Darren Lynn Bousman who's got a long history in the franchise having directed three previous films in the mid-2000's, Rock and his partner in crime have taken Spiral in a different direction than previous iterations of the gore-filled series and while there appears to be lots of potential here for how the new focus may work, Spiral is only successful in parts as its rather tiresome and predictable plot takes hold with those seeking more Saw personified moments likely to be left underwhelmed by a more CSI/NCIS like approach to the material rather than some of the nail-biting scenarios we've had in times past.When the film kicks off proceedings with its most gruesome set piece that is likely to get tongue's wagging audiences will be lulled into a false sense of security about what is too come and while there are still some great ""Saw"" like moments, Rock and his story line aren't enough to make this grim and mostly charisma free affair from working as a worthwhile new take on an old staple.Surrounding himself with talented supports such as Mingella (who never seems to age a day) and an underutilized Samuel L. Jackson as his retired police chief father Marcus Banks, Rock's move to establish himself as a leading man outside of comedic affairs is a fairly poor attempt to subvert expectations and while those who saw the most recent season of Fargo can attest to his ability to be more than the loud-mouthed funny guy, Rock often looks out of place and feels out of place as a hard nosed detective that is in over his head.With all said and done and when the blood stops flowing come the 21 Savage backed credits, Spiral isn't a complete failure and there's a pulse for a future under this new directive but its not enough to save a forgettable film from being mostly pointless as a standalone effort.Final Say -Unlikely to appease long-term Saw fans and only passable as a film judged on its own merit, Spiral is far from the worst film under the Saw banner but its potential is mostly lost in a film that fails to make its own mark.2 parcel delivery guys out of 5.",Spiral
21,southdavid,Rock Paper Scissors.,5,26 May 2021,"""Spiral"" is the best film I've seen at the cinema this year.... It's also the only film I've seen at the cinema this year. With the Covid restrictions finally lifted enough to allow Cinemas in the UK to reopen, the first film that we were able to see was this spinoff from the ""Saw"" franchise, one I must admit, I stopped checking in on somewhere around the second sequel. Thrilled as I was to be back sat in the dark, ""Spiral"" has more than enough flaws to dampen anyone's enthusiasm.Detective Banks (Chris Rock) has spent years castigated and isolated from the rest of his department, for testifying against his partner, who had shot and killed a witness. He reluctantly accepts a new partner, Detective Schenk (Max Minghella), a rookie, fresh out the academy, just as he lands a new case. The case is the murder of another Detective, one which bares striking resemblance to the gruesome Jigsaw murders, from years earlier.There are, for my money, two things wrong with ""Spiral"". One perhaps is a matter of personal taste. I like Chris Rock. As a standup he is truly legendary. But the character he plays here requires far more nuance and craft that he's able to provide. In the opening scene, where he has to crack wise about ""Forest Gump"" he's perfectly cast, but later in the film, as the case starts to hit closer to home and risk people he cares about, all he has is shouting. The film itself doesn't appear to have any faith in him, so regularly intercuts images of Banks ""silent screaming"" in scenes, in an attempt to get any display of emotion across.Far more damning though, is that the story isn't very clever. Anyone who gives it an ounce of thought will work out exactly who is behind it, and why, well before it's revealed. For a series that has been proud of its truly inventive twists in the past, it's very disappointing. As well as having no faith in its star, the film has little faith in its audience too, so has it's first reminder flashback to something you've already seen, only twenty minutes in.It's not abjectly terrible. If you are into the traps and gore of the franchise that is all solid stuff, even inventive at times. The rushed ending points to sequels that I'd probably go back for but it's really not a good film.",Spiral

The dialogues and the story are simply boring and full of the usual cop cliches we have seen a zillion times before.More bad: there is no real suspense. There are no jokes either.

23,videorama-759-859391,New ways to kill,6,14 May 2021,"Yes, eyes afresh, with a new fresh Saw, cruelly and heartlessly violent, again those poor victims who brought em' all on themselves, this time a corrupt bunch of cops
without the trademark Mandalor one, who cop the brunt, in some pretty shocking ways. This is one of those nastier bloodier Saws, the first murder, again a standout. Talk about tongue and cheek. Avenging, straight arrow cop, Rock, yes Rock, with sunken cheek, and he isn't bad, leads the investigation, determined to nail down this supposed, Jigsaw copycat. This is a saw film that goes through the motions, with a few intense, and suspense filled moments. Drawing parallels with Saw 7, as in it
being the more the grisly blood and guts. Over suspense, with some over the top gore. Rock, heralds this one, and is the best thing about. Thriller wise, it is a spiral, with those cops dying much, deserved deaths, and I never shed a tear. Rock's new
young partner cop, I really liked, who brought cool flare to the solid acting role, and Jackson, great again as Rock's father, showing the acting pro, which always engages us. Spiral is a good thriller, but we've treaded these paths before, and it does lack the more suspense filled earlier Saws, the original, standing alone of course.

24,subxerogravity,"Like drinking Saw back in the day, stopped for a while, tied the new flavor and was like ""it's alright""",7,16 May 2021,"It's not a bad film it's quite enjoyable all the way through. I was geared to see what would happen when you have a fairly big name like Chris rock as the lead. This is one of Chris Rock's finest performances as a leading man. Not saying much because I keep going back to that rap movie, he made in the 90s CB4. Rock is not an actor of such a caliber to hold down a movie really, but lucky for him he made Spiral interesting just by playing Chris Rock as a cop. Rock was funny, that was the easy part, the hard part was the drama of being a cop who's the pin point of a Jigsaw copycat, but he pulls it off.The movie itself seems more like a juggle between Horror and police Drama, acting as the spinoff of Saw and not of Sequel (hence the sub title). While the Saw movies seemed more focus on Jigsaw tormenting his victims, with Rock as the police we are more focus on the investigation. We really don't get in depth with what Spiral is doing outside the superficial corrupt police system concept.The murders had potential to be truly brutal, but the focus on police drama over slasher horror prevented that and the police drama did not do much to make up for that lack.It's not perfect but still I did love Chris Rock in it plus Sam L. Jackson is backing him up as his retired cop father. It did not wow me, but I enjoyed what I saw.",Spiral
25,jtindahouse,Rock is excellent in a same (but different) entry in the Saw/Spiral franchise,8,13 May 2021,"As a huge fan of Chris Rock and a huge fan of the 'Saw' series, when I heard that Rock was behind the revamped 'Spiral' movie we were getting I was beyond excited. Then a worldwide pandemic came along delaying the film by 12 months which only served to get my anticipation levels up that little bit higher. The end product is an interesting one. It's better in some ways than I hoped, and less so in others than what I hoped.What really took me by surprise the most was how much I liked Rock as the lead. Early on we get a little stand-up routine from him (in context of the movie of course - more or less) and then here and there we get little glimpses of his terrific humour which he has obviously inserted into the script himself. But when it's time to get serious he is more than capable. He brings great intensity to the movie and combining that with his natural charisma, makes for a great centrepiece of the film.The film takes a little bit of a step-back in terms of the brutality of some of the traps. Make no mistake, there are some brutal things to watch in this movie, however I suspect a conscious effort was made to reign things in just a little. In previous 'Saw' movies it felt like they were going out of their way to make as many audience members faint as possible. Here is just feels like they are trying to find a good balance between keeping the gore-enthusiasts pleased, and keeping those less inclined to enjoy that type of thing in the cinema.The pacing of the film is lightning quick. There's a little bit of set-up and character introductions early on, but once the action begins it never relents. The film is only 93 minutes admittedly, however it is over before you know it.There's a new voice on the tapes this time around. At first it took me off-guard and I didn't quite know what to think of it. However by the end of the film it had grown on me a lot. It is very different to the one we had in the original series. I will be interested to hear what other people thought of it. I can see it being quite a polarising thing.I won't get into the conclusion of the film (always a treat in the 'Saw/Spiral' universe), suffice to say it is quite different to how we are used to these films ending. I still think I need to go back and rewatch the final scene to fully understand certain character's motivations and what they were trying to achieve. The door has been left wide open for more sequels though so if this one is a success then prepare yourself for Spiral 2-8 in the coming years. I say bring them on.",Spiral
26,jadavix,Ignore the rebranding attempt and cast - just another tedious Saw movie,4,1 July 2021,"So what is this, anyway? Is it a re-boot? A spin-off? Or just a straight sequel?It's so lacklustre and uninspired they should have just called it ""Saw XXXXLMIV"" or whatever its number in the franchise is. It starts sort-of promisingly, with a big name actor in Chris Rock having a monologue that suggests he is going to be able to flex his comedic skills, which is a more-than-welcome change in the totally unfunny Saw universe. But then we're just back to boring traps, an omniscient killer who does what a Marvel super-villain would consider too difficult, and lame twists you don't care about. There's no tension in the movie, and typical for a Saw flick, you don't concentrate or care about the story-line. You just wait for the next ""trap"", and they're pretty boring this time around as well.Just as the inclusion of Chris Rock and Samuel L. Jackson suggests something different for the series and then fails to deliver, so too does the theme of police corruption, but the movie doesn't do anything with this either. These ingredients seem to want to ground the movie more than the other thousand Saw flicks, but of course the ridiculous traps and ingenious plots of the killer are never going to be even partly realistic. You know what I'd like to see? A Saw movie that completely throws any pretense of realism out the window. They're not realistic at all anyway - even the first one was totally far fetched. Why not just go crazy? A Saw flick made by Takeshi Miike or Sion Sono - I'd watch the hell out of that.",Spiral

Jackson-The Hitman's Bodyguard, Snakes on a Plane.This movie is based on the Saw movies but it's a little different. For instance, there is no Jigsaw-although he is mentioned and his picture is shown. This psycho killer uses a pig symbol-puppets & masks-for his crimes, mainly because he focuses his elaborate torture devices at policemen, in particular, corrupt policemen. And you will discover why he does it. The torture devices are very brutal, as can be expected in a Saw movie so you might want to avoid this one if you have a weak stomach. Besides specific body parts being targeted-tongues, fingers, etc.-some victims are electrified, waxed, hit with broken glass and even skinned alive. Chris and his new partner Max are the first cops on the scene of the first victim so they are the lead investigators. Marisol is their police captain and Samuel is Chris' father, an ex_cop. Secrets are uncovered-like in most Saw movies-during the hunt for the copycat Jigsaw killer who is meting out his twisted justice and a sequel is hinted at, at the end. There are no scenes after the end credits.It's rated ""R"" for grisly bloody violence, torture and language and has a running time of 1 hour & 33 minutes.If you like the Saw movies, you should enjoy this one.

The storyline focuses on a copy cat killer of Jigsaw who targets police officers, specifically detectives. The son of the detective of the first Jigsaw murders takes it personally when the killer kills his partner; what he doesn't know is that it's about to get a lot closer to him than just his partner. This movie is directed by Darren Lynn Bousman (Saw II and Tales of Halloween) and stars Chris Rock (CB4), Samuel L Jackson (Pulp Fiction) and Max Minghella (Handmaid""s Tale). The storyline for this is very good and more intricate than you'd expect. The ultimate conclusion is clever and very well done. The script and writing is awesome. The comedic content works perfectly and there's some awesome conversations, some of my favorites were the Forest Gump and Pilates analogies. Had me dying. I was also cracking up when on how ""dad"" reacts when he discovers his son has been shot. The kill scenes and gore are of course first rate. The opening train scene, the meat locker skinning and the shards of glass scenes were all excellent. I also got to give the team a ton of credit for their ""new puppet"" to represent the new killer.

33,kirbylee70-599-526179,I WANT TO PLAY ANOTHER GAME,7,9 August 2021,"When the first SAW movie came out and I watched it I was stunned. Here was a mystery that slowly unfolded before my eyes. All the pieces of the puzzle were there, an apt description since the main bad guy was named Jigsaw. The movie presented a fresh new face for horror but was limited in both scope and location. Writers James Wan and Leigh Whannell had written a near perfect mystery.The success of that film made them big stars down the line and led to a series of SAW films. At first I wasn't convinced they could carry on especially since the second one was the weakest. But as they each unfolded the long term story was told. What seemed like the end in the first film was actually the beginning, pulling the viewer down a gore fueled bloody path that came to a complete end.But Hollywood never lets a successful franchise go away. Talk began of yet another story involving the character of Jigsaw character being made. Chris Rock was attached to it. The bad news for the film was that the pandemic kicked in just as it was about to be released. But it did get there and now it arrives on disc.Rock stars as Det. Ezekiel ""Zeke"" Banks. Zeke almost always works alone due to the fact that he turned in a dirty cop who killed a witness. The blue code is strong in this city and rather than be celebrated for doing the right thing the rest of the detectives shun him. He's bitter, going through a divorce and seems to be the only cop on the force looking for justice.As the film opens Det. Marv Bozwick (Dan Petronijevic) chases down a purse thief into the subway tunnels beneath the city. He's captured there and when he wakes finds himself chained, standing on a ladder on the tracks with his tongue in a vice and a TV nearby. It fires up and ask him if he wants to play a game. His lies in court have sent innocents to their deaths. He can jump and have his tongue yanked out or stay and have the next train hit him. Taking too long to decide both things happen.Zeke is handed a new partner named Det. William Schenk (Max Minghella) fresh from the academy by his captain Angie Garza (Marisol Nichols). Preferring to work alone he begrudgingly takes on the new partner and they get the next case in line, the demolished corpse in the subway tracks.Working the case they find clues seemingly left behind on purpose. Zeke has a feeling that something seems familiar here. When they return to the office he has a package waiting for him, a small box with a thumb drive on it. The drive shows the murder and offers another clue. Going to the location in the video they find a spiral like that used by Jigsaw who is now dead and another clue, the tongue and badge of Det. Bozwick.Zeke pushes Garza to appoint him the head of the task force investigating this murder. The detectives are reluctant at first but eventually fall in line. After their first day of working the case Zeke goes home to discover his father, Marcus Banks (Samuel Jackson) the ex-chief, waiting in his apartment. Words are exchanged and he leaves only to later follow up on a lead of his own.More officers are killed, more body parts as clues are left behind and we the viewers see the demise of each officer in glorious gross detail involving various machines of death. The big question is who is behind these killings if Jigsaw is dead? A follower? And why these particular officers, each one with a dirty secret to tell? Why does this revolve around Zeke? The answer are delivered in the final portion of the film. Some will be satisfied and others not. But the movie does add another chapter in the story of SAW.Rock does a great job here. For years he's appeared too young to handle a mature role like this. He does so here showing that he has the capability to take the lead in a film and deliver the goods. The supporting casts also does a great job but none stand out and perhaps that is because the film focuses mostly on Rock's character.If you're a fan of the series you will enjoy this one. The gadgets of death don't quite live up to previous efforts though. If you're at all squeamish this movie might not be for you. And if you are wondering, yes they do leave it open for a sequel.",Spiral

There's even a victim that gets skinned & strung up & there's some underground subway action too. I love Predator 2 it's one of my all time favourite films & i liked how ""Spiral"" mimicked it's style because Predator 2 is a great Detective/Cop film with a tough black lead as the hero & tossed in a serial killer alien just as this throws in a copy cat serial killer & the connection of Detective Banks police force are being picked off one by one is all Predator 2!!! I also felt there was abit of Will Smith's troubled Cop Del Spooner (i,Robot) mixed into Rock's performance too & that's really cool.Chris Rock is hilarious in this role & i personally think it's the best I've ever seen him. Rock nails the mouthy couldn't-give-a-shi# what anyone thinks type of rogue cop & he is so mouthy to his corrupt police force & its hilarious. I forgot how funny Rock was as it's been years since I've watched him in something but always loved him in Lethal Weapon 4 & New Jack City (that gets a funny mention by Rock himself in Spiral) among some of Adam Sandler's films but nothing has stood out til his starring as the unlikely lead here in Spiral. Giving Rock this main lead role in a big famous franchise spin-off film was an excellent if unexpected move. Rock proves he's always gonna be funny-as-hell but can still be a hard Bad-Ass too.""Spiral"" touches on the big theme of Corruption within the police force that is huge today with all the horrific cases of police brutality & corrupt cops & here it serves as the main reason for the whole story.Detective Zeke Banks is stressed out as he's the lead Detective on the case of a Jigsaw copycat that is targeting ""fellow"" officers of his police department, the one's that have done corrupt things in their past.Most of the cops are scum & we don't like them or care for them but we love Chris Rock & he totally holds the entire twisted film together with performance & hilarious remarks.Also the legendary Samuel L Jackson has a small role as Zeke's legendary hero Cop father & of course he's great.The look & cinematography is excellent with a real visual pallet of vivid colours that are striking.All in all Spiral is a really good serial killer Thriller & an excellent film & one of the best of the Saw franchise.",Spiral

36,kluseba,"Famous actors, awkward comedy, summer heat, profane dialogues and gangster rap don't equal innovation",6,12 August 2021,"Spiral is the latest and also the weakest instalment in the Saw franchise. The makers behind the movie try to tell you that there is a fresh approach to this film because it involves famous actors, takes place in the summer and includes a few comedic bits and pieces. The famous actors are however unable to shine in their flat roles as Samuel L. Jackson disappoints as exchangeable wise-cracking old man. The fact that the movie takes place in the summer doesn't change the atmosphere at all when the different traps can still be found in subway tunnels and basements. The comedic bits and pieces aren't even remotely funny in my book but that's a matter of taste. The addition of much profanity in the dialogues and gangster rap with an overuse of racist swear words doesn't make much sense either and gives the impression that the movie was imagined by some rebellious high school kids.The plot is predictable. As soon as the character who would turn out to be the bad guy showed up, I knew right away that it was going to be him. The reason is that the script copies from numerous cop thrillers and horror movies of the nineties and early years of the millennium but doesn't add anything new.The main reason why this film still got a good final grade is because it's entertaining from start to finish. It has an excellent length with ninety-three minutes. The film starts with a gripping trap scene in the key of its predecessors. The different lead characters are introduced smoothly and swiftly. The movie has great pace with occasional brief flashbacks and location changes. What starts as a dark cop thriller slowly turns into psychological horror movie. The plot thickens at the right moment yet again. Everything leads to an intense finale that doesn't overstay its welcome. The latter however leaves room for yet another sequel.At the end of the day, Spiral: From the Book of Saw should be interesting for avid fans of the franchise as all the traditional trademarks are kept and told in an efficiently entertaining manner. Those who are expecting fresh ideas however will end up being disappointed. This is the most predictable entry in the franchise so far and that's why the movie only just qualifies as average.",Spiral

For the most part, it is the generic Saw type of storyline, until in the middle of the film I instantly predicted the plot twist that is so bad that I thought they wouldn't dare to do it. But they did. Firstly, this is the only Saw movie so far for which I predicted the plot twist and also I predicted it by the middle of the film not even near the end. Secondly, I love all the plot twists of previous Saw films a lot, some movies themselves may suck, but the plot twists always were smart or interesting, or unique or just plain mindblowing even if they kind of did not make sense. Here the plot twist is so unrealistic, so lame and it does not even make any logical sense in the slightest. Just plain abysmal crap.The ending is so terrible, without spoiling I can't say why, but just as the plot twist, it does not make any sense, it's unrealistic and I've no idea how do they expect to follow up after this mess.I used to be a huge fan of Saw franchise, but this is as bad as a Saw movie could have ever gotten, I hope this franchise dies with this film because it keeps getting worse and worse with each film.",Spiral
38,aidanratesmovies,Don't listen to the critics- it's easily the best one yet,9,15 May 2021,"Smarter than the average sequel, reboot, spinoff or whatever the heck this film is- Spiral is an incredibly entertaining and wonderful social commentary on police brutality- that also just happens to be possibly the best Saw film yet. Chris Rock stars, writes, and produces the new entry in the long running horror franchise, and I must say he does an excellent job. Not only is the idea incredibly original and well executed, but he is easily the best actor in the film- providing such a charismatic presence on screen as usual- while also capturing a large amount of depth. The film is superbly written- providing an excellent balance between the typical gruesomeness of the Saw films with the intense and bitter turmoils of the L. A. cop life. The cinematography is excellent, providing an almost neo-noir type appeal to the film- which is interesting to say the least- and though the traps may not be as great as some before it- they are certainly decent contenders. Some of my problems with the film mostly rely with the films twist, not that it was bad, I thought on paper it felt excellent- but on screen it felt a bit predictable. I just feel that if they took a little more time to shoot the scenes with hints throughout that the ending may have felt like more of a payoff instead of simply an 'oh.' That being said, the very end of the film is fantastic, and perhaps my favorite so far? I guess we'll have to see. In the end, Spiral is an incredibly unique and refreshing take on one of my favorite horror franchises. It has its flaws, like the original, its ending stumbles- but it makes its mark more than well this time around, and has earned its place as my favorite among the franchise.My Rating: 8.7/10.",Spiral

40,masonsaul,Good gory fun,6,17 May 2021,"Whilst it's very generic, has some terrible flashbacks and isn't that scary, Spiral: From the Book of Saw is good gory fun that's funny, disturbing and surprisingly relevant. Chris Rock gives a great lead performance and Max Minghella, Marisol Nichols and Samuel L. Jackson are really good. Darren Lynn Bousman's direction is also really good but a few stylistic choices feel outdated. The music by Charlie Clouser and the soundtrack are both good.",Spiral
41,Reviews_of_the_Dead,Solid Spin-Off Sequel,8,1 June 2021,"This was a movie that I was pretty excited to see. I like the Saw franchise on the whole. When I heard they were going to make this spin-off, I was intrigued what they were going to do, especially getting the likes of Chris Rock and Samuel L. Jackson. Since I don't watch trailers, I had avoided most information about this movie aside from what I've shared. This was one of those that got caught in the COVID pandemic pushback as well. The synopsis here is a criminal mastermind unleashes a twisted form of justice.To just establish the world that we are in for this movie, John Kramer (Tobin Bell) who is also known as Jigsaw, is dead. There have been a few copycat killers and everyone knows about this criminal mastermind. Here we start at a 4th of July parade. A man gets bumped into by another guy who then steals a woman's purse. The man watches and he turns out to be a police officer, Detective Marv 'Boz' Boswick (Dan Petronijevic). He gives chase and it takes him into a tunnel under the ground. Boz is then knocked out while searching for the criminal.When he wakes up, he is suspended over train tracks. There is a contraption on his tongue and television propped up for him to see. A masked individual appears on it, wanting to a play a game with Boz. It doesn't end well, as you can imagine.The movie then takes us to Zeke Banks (Rock). We see him as he robs a drug dealer and it turns out he is a detective undercover. He didn't clear this with his captain, Angie Garza (Marisol Nichols) though so the operation's cover was blown. To punish him, Zeke is given a partner. It turns out to be a rookie detective by the name of William Schenk (Minghella). Zeke isn't happy, but he's also secretly worried. He is considered a rat for turning in a dirty cop, so the rest of the detectives don't take fondly to him.Their morning is turned upside though when Zeke and his new partner go to the crime scene of what happened to Boz. They don't know it's him and back at the station, a package arrives for Zeke. There's a flashdrive on it and shows a video of a spiral. There is also voice-over, cryptically informing them what happened to their fellow officer. Everyone knows it is another Jigsaw copycat. Zeke decides to follow the video to the courthouse. It is there they find something in a box along with Boz's badge. This gets their attention. It becomes a full-scale operation to get to the bottom of what happened to their fellow detective and stop this new copycat. This version of Jigsaw is targeting police officers and it might have something to do back in the time when Zeke's father, Marcus (Jackson), was the captain. It was a much different time, but someone remembers.That is where I'm going to leave my recap for this movie as I don't want to break it down too far or give away too many details. What I find interesting here is that this movie decides to get away from the story we've been seeing with the original run as well as the prequel, Jigsaw. The mythology is there. Jigsaw is known for what he did and seemed to have a reign of terror. This detective group didn't seem to work any of the cases from what I can see, which I liked. It allows this movie to start fresh.Since they're starting fresh, we're able to establish new back-stories. Marcus Banks when he was the captain of this department is legendary. He's the reason that William wanted to become one. I like that we establish Marcus' character subtle and the more we learn, the more we see he might not actually be a good guy. He didn't want Zeke to become a cop. He also didn't like that Zeke turned in a dirty cop, knowing that it would ruin his career and make everyone around him distrustful. That is exactly the case. It does create problems with Detective Fitch (Ricahrd Zeppieri), Drury (K. C. Collins) and Kraus (Edie Inksetter). I do like that Boz stayed friends with Zeke, which sparks him to want to solve this case. If it was any of the rest, I don't know that he would which works for me. It makes sense despite us seeing how much he despises the rest of the detectives around him.Since I'm not going to go into spoilers here, I just briefly want to talk about the mystery of this movie. I'll be honest, I didn't know where this was going. I really haven't looked to see if people were able to predict the reveal or not, but much like giallo films, if I guess it early then I usually check out. We get our red herrings here that I thought worked. Many of them I knew that was what they were there for. The reveal of the movie was effective for me. I do want to revisit this movie now that I know to see what I might have missed along the way as it does seem that a few people I've talked to knew.What we come to expect with movies like this are the traps. I will say that I pleasantly surprised that we get some brutal traps here. There were a few times that I was cringing in my seat. It looked like they went practical with pretty much everything that they could and if there was CGI, it was well done. Something else that I'm glad here is that cinematography was clean as well. They have moved away from that greenish filter that some of the earlier installments had. I do like that they sent this during the summer in a heat wave. Everyone is sweating and they feel uncomfortable. I also like incorporating the pig masks, especially since the victims are police officers. Combining pigs with the heat make for some interesting aspects as well.I feel from here I should go to the acting. I was wondering how Rock would work in this movie. To be honest though, I thought he plays his role well. He brings such anger to his character and his comedic timing is effective. Minghella is solid as this younger detective who is learning from Zeke. Jackson isn't actually in this movie all that much. I think that works though. When he's there, he commands the screen and I'm a fan of his. I didn't realize that Nichols was Angie Garza. She is looking quite good here and the feistiness she adds to the character is fitting for a woman in her position. Aside from that, I thought the rest of the cast rounded this movie out for what was needed as well.Then really the last thing to go into would be the soundtrack. This is something coming in that I knew a lot of people didn't care for. Being that this is a spin-off, I'm fine with them moving away from the more traditional score we had for the original series. What I like is remixing the main theme as well as some other songs to have a different take. I wasn't the biggest fan of the actual songs that were made for the movie that were used though. They seemed to take charge of a couple scenes and it wasn't as effective for me. I still think the soundtrack works overall and the sound design is as well. For this latter part, it makes it more effective when people are being tortured for the believability.So then in conclusion here, I'm glad that I finally got to see this movie. For me, I did feel that the entire story of Jigsaw was told and I like what they did here with a different take. There is a good mystery that worked for me and it had me guessing until the end. I thought the acting was good. The effects and the traps that are featured here were solid. My only issue here is that they take a bit of a backseat. The soundtrack wasn't as strong as some in this series for me either. Other than that they though, we do have more story here to tell. I thought this was an above average movie for me. Not quite good, but hovering just below that. If you like the Saw series, I would recommend giving this a viewing.My Rating: 7.5 out of 10",Spiral
42,vengeance20,Different But Ace!,9,21 May 2021,"I'll admit, I was skeptical when I first heard Chris Rock announced the film given his Comedic roots, in fact I thought it was a joke when I first saw the news report via Facebook, but further reports proved it was the real deal & then it really got me intrigued.Further on from that the news report I learned Chris Rock was a die hard fan of the Saw Franchise & was pitching his take on iconic franchise, I then learned also that Darren Lynn Bousman, director of Saw II, Saw III & Saw IV was helming the project so I really got excited knowing his work.Filmed in 2019 with a 21st May 2020 release only for COVID-19 to push the film back to the 21st May 2021, I finally got to see this film.The film follows a series of copy cat Jigsaw murders involving cops & Detective Zeke is assigned to the case along with his partner to track down the murderer. But a dark revelation in the case is about to be uncovered...!I found the film to be pretty ace! While it's different from the lateral 8 Saw Films, it's still pretty good & has enough interesting Saw esque traps & gore to get you through the lean & fast paced 1 hour & 27 minute film! The ending & its twist was insane!My only complaints were the absence of Jigsaw/John Kramer himself. Not to mention the Billy Doll we Saw fans all know & love! The film itself felt a bit different & didn't 100% feel like a Saw film.But aside from those things, the film is pretty damn good! 9/10.",Spiral

44,Abdulxoxo,Failed to make an impact,6,19 June 2021,"Spiral is the ninth film in the series and sees detective Zeke Banks being forced to team up with rookie William Schenk to investigate a potential John Cramer/Jigsaw copycat killing. This film seems to have fallen into the trap of trying to be two things without fully committing to either. On the one hand it stays true to the franchise in the way that it makes sure to provide us with some twisted, gory death scenes. However you could tell that it wanted to aim higher, with its style and tone. I'm just not sure that it succeeded, or stood out as a particularly great thriller or a twisted enough horror flick. It was just ok at both. While couple of the traps are good, they weren't as creative as some from the early films; and also they didn't feel as though they gave the people in the traps much chance of survival, taking away some of the tension that makes the first couple of films so great. And I didn't like the look of the film, it's covered with ugly color effects but you could tell that more money had been spent on this than the vast majority of the other Saw films. We also got a couple of familiar stars in the form of Chris Rock and Samuel L. Jackson, who plays Zeke's dad, and former police chief, Marcus Banks. To be honest Jackson fails to bring nearly as much to the film as he should have. Rock on the other hand was good. The writing, directing and editing could have been better? Absolutely. This script shouldn't have been the final one. More time and effort on it definitely seemed required. That said, the lead character's backstory was satisfying. The way they surrounded him with characters that weren't necessarily on his side. And the killer's motivation wasn't bad either. Overall, spiral is solid for the most parts, it isn't creative or unique that it could have been but worth a watch if a fan of franchise.",Spiral
45,arungeorge13,A Saw spinoff that's better structured but suffers from thin plotting! [+49%],5,2 June 2021,"I'll admit I have a (trashy) soft corner for the Saw films, however conventionally terrible they turn out to be. Spiral got me excited for the same reasons Jigsaw did in 2017, plus it has Darren Lynn Bousman (who directed Saw II-IV) back in the driver's seat with Chris Rock and Samuel L Jackson steering the franchise in a supposedly new direction. I secretly wished Leigh Whannell was back in the writing department too. Writers Josh Stolberg and Pete Goldfinger basically create a Jigsaw copycat (not an apprentice!) in Spiral who's targeting cops (with a personal agenda?). The procedural bits in Spiral are rushed, just the way I expected them to be. The film doesn't allow any character to breathe (including Zeke, the tired cop cliché played by Rock), because everyone involved is future trap-bait; it's only a matter of how and when.The traps themselves are a mixed bag. Some of them are definitely gruesome, but just as in Jigsaw, the underlying tension and probability of escape are deliberately negated for the purpose of cheap shocks. The good thing here is that Spiral's plot-building universe isn't restricted to a single location like some of the other entries in the series. The fragmented flashbacks do add up to something substantial, even if the twist reveal at the end doesn't make your jaw drop. Spiral pops a few questions on police corruption and complicity. Cops have always been at the forefront of the series right from the start. Here, this angle is explored from a fresh standpoint.The absence of Tobin Bell (as the infamous Jigsaw killer) should come across as no surprise, as he's only mentioned in name and referenced by way of pictures. The pig masks do return, and so do the videos (with a less intense voiceover!). It can be perceived as Bousman winking at the fans but indirectly telling them that this is not Saw IX. The offhand humour and lesser body count may surprise some longtime fans, but Spiral doesn't get bogged down all that much by this. It uses the ""Hello Zepp"" theme effectively, though the hasty climax and final shot leave you feeling sort of meh.Even if Spiral is staged as a standalone cop thriller, lines like ""John Kramer didn't target cops"" come off as absurd, especially when Bousman himself has helmed 3 Saw films, two of which had Jigsaw testing cops. All said and done, Spiral doesn't quite leave a lasting impression, but I wouldn't wildly complain about its hollow core as it's only a spinoff and not a direct sequel. Maybe, just maybe, there's more juice left in the tank!",Spiral

47,Pumpkin_Man,"The Next Evolution of Saw is Here, and it's Definitely Badass!!!",10,15 May 2021,"I really enjoyed Spiral: From the Book of Saw! It was a good funny bloody time! Saw has been revamped and revitalized thanks to Chris Rock, Samuel L. Jackson and Darren Lynn Bousman. If somebody told me five years ago that they would be the stars of 'Saw 9' I'd laugh and say they were crazy, but they make it work pretty well. There were some good traps and good gore scenes, and it's not overly violent and over the top like some of the original installments. It gives us time to breathe and learn who Chris Rock's character is. Yes, it is different, yes Jigsaw and Billy puppet are gone, but Saw has to evolve and make room for new characters, new villains, new copycats. I'm just happy it had that classic Saw theme they always play during the big twist. The new voice is kinda cheesy but I think it'll grow on me over time. I'm jacked and would happily see it again!Chris Rock stars as Detective Zeke Banks, the only decent cop on the force who constantly butts heads with corrupt and dirty cops. He doesn't even want a partner, but he's soon forced to work with a rookie named Will Schenk. They are called to a crime scene where it looks like the work of Jigsaw. With Jigsaw being dead, they are dealing with a copycat who is putting corrupt cops into their own deadly games. Zeke seeks help from his dad, Marcus, played by Samuel L. Jackson. (It's just fun watching him be in a Saw movie. The idea is just crazy!)The Jigsaw copycat begins to taunt Zeke and gives him clues and videos as to where the next game has been played and who will be next. Will Zeke be able to stop them, or will the new Jigsaw reign supreme? If you love the Saw series and ready for a brand new and different chapter, I would highly recommend SPIRAL: FROM THE BOOK OF SAW!!!",Spiral
48,Sergiodave,Very run of the mill.,5,11 July 2021,"As a plus point, I like the idea of going after bent cops, but unfortunately there wasn't anything original in this latest Saw flick. Chris Rock in the lead role was surprisingly okay, but everything else was mundane.",Spiral
49,Stephen_A_Abell,"Better Than Jigsaw, With A Concept Stronger Than The Saw Series.",6,20 June 2021,"Welcome fellow movie fans to my review of Spiral: From The Book Of Saw 2021The Story gets a 1 out of 2:
To show you can't keep a good and a bad Franchise down, writers Josh Stolberg and Pete Goldfinger bring us the next instalment of the Saw series. Fortunately, for the audience, it's not the works in the set and better than Jigsaw. I admit there are a few things to admire about the tale. I particularly appreciated the fact our new madman has chosen an establishment to punish. In this case, the police force. Naturally, with all the critical press they've received of late, it's easy to understand why they've become a vulnerable target. Even though I admire the idea, I hated how Stolberg and Goldfinger paint the police force. It would appear every one of them is corrupt, in one form or another. Only Det. Zeke Banks is honest. His integrity comes from him arresting his crooked partner after he executed a witness in cold blood. It would have been preferable if the writers introduced a few more good cops who visibly supported Banks.Next, we have the vicious and visceral killings themselves. It's here that Stolberg and Goldfinger let themselves down most. But that may be unjust; it could have been the special effects supervisor or the directors choice of murder machine. Nevertheless, the first revenge killing is the most stupid. Creating something so outlandish so early in the film is a bold or foolish thing to undertake. It may cause more discerning viewers to press the off button too soon. We see a cop chase a purse-snatcher down an access pipe into a subway tunnel. He spots a shadowy shape, which turns out to be a dummy in the felons clothes. Not unexpectedly, he's struck from behind. When he regains consciousness, we see he's stood precariously on the top slat of a chair. His hands restrained with razor wire, and his tongue secured in a nasty looking vice. He has one option, jump off the chair and lose his tongue or get hit by the oncoming subway train. I applaud the irony of his crime and the set punishment, which was constantly lying in court so criminals could walk free. But I groaned in disgust at the inconsistency of the murder machine. How the hell had Spiral hoisted this copper up onto the chair? How come he hadn't fallen off while unconscious? And many more ridiculous realities that would get in the way.Here's another discrepancy, which came later in the investigation. The police identified the mushed remains by dental records. The identification would have been an immense task for the crime scene investigators because the guys head bore the brute force of the smash. His jaw was in countless pieces. Then, Banks receives a package from Spiral. In it are the crooked cop's tongue and another bit of his upper jaw. Why wouldn't the CSI guys use the corpse's fingerprints to get an ID? His hands had been reasonably intact.And it's similar contradictions that wear down the story's power.I have to give Stolberg and Goldfinger credit for making the flexible timeline and flashbacks work better than in previous instalments. But even this praise is tinged with disappointment. The way the writers handled the murders in the flashback was: The audience observes the prey arriving at the murder scene and getting accosted: Next, we see Banks turn up on the scene after the killing: Then we experience a flashback of the killing unfolding. The routine usually works well, but that changes on one particular murder. If you haven't already deduced who Spiral is by this point, this should make it clear.Hey, at least you need to use your grey cells to determine who Spiral is, so that's a big plus point for the film.The Direction and Pace receive a 2.75 out of 4:
Darren Bousman delivers a roller-coaster of a film. It's notably down to the pacing of the movie. Bousman knows when to slacken the tempo and when to ramp it up. For example, though the opening killing is ludicrous, I found myself on tenterhooks to see if the copper would free himself before the train ruined him and his life. Though this scene, from the cop regaining consciousness to his body slamming the train, take place in only a couple of minutes, it felt like a lifetime, and in a good way. I was willing the bloke to jump. But when you see the train lights shine at the bend in the track, you know it's too late. The segment is perfectly constructed of mixed tempo shots. Two of which work perfectly. Both of them are slow. One describes the terror on the detective's face as we get a close-up of his features after he releases his hands. Even the design of the vice works to highlight the growing fear in his eyes. The second is of the train driver. We are looking into the front cab of the train and see an everyday train driver sipping coffee. He is totally at ease and oblivious to what awaits his train around one of the subway bends.These two shots are impeccably constructed. Though Bousman doesn't get too ingenious with the camera angles, he is a master of composition and lighting. With the police officer, he utilizes the blue led lights to add a harsh coldness, which adds to the terror. The train's cab has a normalcy to its lighting, though the inside retains a brown feel to the edges, adding to the mundaneness. The tunnels darkness adds a vignette to frame the scene. Set them with more frantic and frenetic shots, and you have an enjoyable, if not disturbing, segment.At this point, I will doff my cap to the special effects team. My God! The splatter was absolutely awesome and nasty. I savoured it. Indeed, in the later scene of the aftermath, the strewn body pieces were impressive and still yucky. Excellent work.The Performances get a 1 out of 2:
So, this is a Chris Rock film, and even though we witness him being his comic self in his initial sequence, he swiftly takes on a more sober side. Most of the time it works. But by the time you arrive at his skinned partner, you might be getting a tad bored of ""old squinty eyes"" Rock. He does squint a lot. He squints to show he's thinking. He squints to show he's enraged. He squints when he's upset. And even though there's no love interest, you know he has a squinty ""love face"". Maybe he should go to Specsavers. That said, his remains a decent performance.Samuel L Jackson, I was wondering when he'd turn up in this franchise. Woefully, he's portraying his familiar stereotyped role. He's a superb actor, and after regarding him in Black Snake Moan, I might say a skilled actor. Shame he repeatedly plays the same role. I wonder if he'll have ""Moth, er, f##k, er"" on his gravestone(?)
As for the rest of the cast, they are all passable and deliver a hundred per cent.And my Enjoyment level hits a 1.25 out of 2:
If it wasn't for the irregularities in the script, Spiral would have been a considerably more enjoyable film. Unfortunately, I found myself being pulled out of the narrative by them; it lessened my enjoyment. Thankfully, Bousman's input boosted it. And the acting bore me through to the end.These ratings give Spiral: From The Book Of Saw a 6 out of 10:
In some ways, Spiral is a lot better than the original Saw scripts. It has a more focused and believable storyline and structure. In fact, I would recommend fans of Dark Thrillers and Chillers to watch Spiral and not Saw if they had to choose between the two. Consequently, if you fans of Dark Thrillers want a gory fix and a whodunnit that's not hard to crack, check out Spiral. You shouldn't be disappointed.Now you've released yourself from the machine, come on over and check out my Killer Thriller Chillers and The Game Is Afoot lists to see where Spiral slashed its way into my rankings.Take Care and Stay Well, and Get Inoculated.",Spiral
50,gedikreverdi,The least charismatic Jigsaw-wannabe ever,6,6 June 2021,"The most annoying protagonist and the least charismatic Jigsaw ever. His motive is understandable but I hope the sequels won't have anything to do with this subpar plot. The first killing was good. The lying cop's tongue was torn as he was hit with the train down in the tunnel. The new partner of Zeke whose father is the former police chief. Angie the new chief's dead was impressive too as she was suffocated with liquid wax on her face. One of the killings were partly off camera as the corrupt police officer's fingers were torn off and he was electrocuted in the tub as the water touched the copper wires. The officers found a skinned body in a butcher shop and it was the new partner of Zeke but it was a set up. It was in fact the body of the homeless guy who lured the lying cop into the tunnel. Then Zeke kidnapped at the church where the cop that he turned in as he killed an innocent witness was working and living. He woke up and tried to survive that cop from the machine that's shooting bottle shards He couldn't save him and saw his new partner alive. He's taking revenge on the corrupt officers as one of them killed his father. Then to be able to trust him, he tested Zeke with his father in a trap draining his blood. He killed the spiral and took his dad down and saved him and went after that new Jigsaw to beat him. The swat team opened the door with a saw and cut some cords and his dad was in the trap again holding a gun to the officers without wanting. They shot him dead right away while the new jigsaw is walking away from a room full of a swat team.",Spiral
51,reddiemurf81,Painful to watch Chris Rock in this,4,29 October 2021,"For starters,, I'm a big fan of the Saw movies.That being said,, the final chapter was really the ending point the story needed (showing Dr Gordon as John's closest accomplice),, with Jigsaw as a good afterthought several yrs later (revealing even more about John, and another accomplice). This movie, however,, was in NO way needed,, and was just a giant mess!!I get that Chris Rock wanted to show a different side,, but this wasn't the way to go! He will always be Chris Rock,, he doesn't have the range to play a hardened, beaten down, honest detective like this. I have always liked Chris Rock, but it was very painful to watch him in a lot of this movie. Not believable,,,Samuel L Jackson was great, cause he is the tough guy cop kind of actor.Minghella really showed his skill here as well.This just did not work as part of the Saw movies. Other than a photo and mention of his name,, there was no connection to John Kramer. No freaky puppet with John's voice. No group of victims playing a ""game"".They should have stopped with Jigsaw. I thought it was a good final film/afterthought to end on.Just did not work imo.",Spiral

53,educallejero,Chris Rock is just awful (the writers too),3,12 September 2021,"And they wrote a Jigsaw movie that actually kind of needed a whole lot more acting than the originals before (2017 ""Jigsaw""), which forced Rock into acting mad; tired; emotional; exhausted; sad and desperate. And yet his face was the same for every single scene of the movie, regardless of the emotion his character was supposed to be feeling.The more superfitial things about the saga were there thanks to Bousman, the director (also director of Saw II, III and IV).But the fundamental stuff that made Jigsaw legendary was his ""code"", his ""purpose"", his ""logical madness"" (and also the ingenious traps). There is none of that here, with brutal but not that clever traps, and a villain that lacks any kind of coherent philosophy, which makes him basically a simple (and boring) serial killer.",Spiral
54,markthomassintek,One of the better sequels,7,25 May 2021,"REVIEW - SPIRAL: FROM THE BOOK OF SAWOne of the most difficult things to do when writing a review is not to give away spoilers and after watching this film I had to give some serious thought to how I would do this.So let's start, this is not a new chapter, this is a sequel to Saw and as such it is one of the best sequels we have had compared to some of the others we have had to suffer over the years.Yes you have the devices which are used that of course end up doing various nasty things these trapped in them but this is also a dark, deep investigation with clues that are right in front of you but you don't give them a second thought until they are shown again in a certain context, very smart.Unfortunately the weakest part of the film for me was the ending, a choice made which either way wouldn't have saved a certain person so why not shoot?A few plot holes and felt rushed in places, could have very easily been 2 hours with some more drawn out suspense but as I've said to sit through the film to have the end let you down isn't good, but of course they had to set up the sequel to the sequel.I see Chris Rock as a comedian with his high pitched voice screeching so for me personally he didn't work as the lead, don't get me wrong he did a great job but the voice and why the attempt at the start to throw in his trademark tirants?One of the better sequels to Saw and if you're a fan go see.Rating 7 out of 10.",Spiral
55,abisio,A thriller that stands by itself and also the best SAW sequel,9,15 May 2021,"I went to see Chris Rock doing a serious character. The fact that the movie was a SAW follow up or remake played as a bonus and I was not disappointed in anything.Rock is not a great actor; but he is funny, sarcastic and his particular humor is based on social (and sometimes political) commentary. He pretty good here; and he is able to keep his cynical monologues and sour humor most of the time he speaks. Max Minghella is very good and believable as most of the cast is too.As for the horror part; well is more like a thriller. A very gory thriller with sophisticated deaths and a mystery killer that most of the people will find out halfway of the movie; Still there is a good suspense and some interesting fleshed out characters.",Spiral
56,kjproulx,A Fresh Take on the Series that Doesn't Feel Fresh,4,10 June 2021,"I'd be lying if I didn't at least call myself a minor fan of the Saw franchise. I love the first film for what it is and I always find myself hoping that this series will churn out something fresh and original when a new sequel is announced. When I heard Chris Rock had an idea and would also be starring in it, I was intrigued to see what he would do outside of his comfort zone. With that said, although he himself is devoted to this role and the filmmakers are clearly trying to put a new spin on the series, it just felt like more of the same, with the added layer of the detective storyline. Here's why, unless you're a massive Saw fan, you can skip Spiral.It has been many years since the last installment has taken place in this world. The Jigsaw killer is officially dead, but a new killer (who is copying Jigsaw's old style) is now on the loose. Picking off dirty police officers who have caused people harm in ways they never realized, this killer has a very specific motive. I never once cared about who lived and who died in these traps though, because they always seemed over-the-top in terms of how ridiculous and elaborate they were. On top of that, they all play out in weird ways.In particular, there is a trap that occurs, but you are shown the aftermath first. When the film flashes back to show whether or not the person makes it out alive or not, you're already aware so the tension was non-existent. This happened a couple of times throughout the film, so really this film is about the detective storyline with the added addition of traps to keep Saw fans amused. I never found myself getting attached to any of the characters either, which is a shame because they're clearly all trying here. It's the fact that nearly every scene is an argument or a conflict between two or more characters and it became a bit of a headache honestly.I will always appreciate when a series tries new things in order to keep it going, especially when they're only making the films for profit. Sadly, not much worked here. What I will shine a light on though is the fact that cinematographer Jordan Oram really stepped up to the plate here. I thought every one of his compositions were fantastic and stood out as easily the best element of the movie. The look and feel of this film were absolutely one of the more impressive entries in the franchise, which is frustrating too because they deserved to be part of a better screenplay.Overall, Spiral just didn't quite do it for me when looking back on it. Saw fans will get a kick out of the traps as I said, but the movie isn't about them at all and most of them feel like they're only there for the shock value. Chris Rock Max Minghella and Marisol Nichols all stood out to me, giving solid performances, but the problem is that most of the dialogue is conflicts and arguments, which just wore off very fast. It kept the tension high, but when it can't get any higher, your film deflates itself which is what happened here. Spiral is nothing special, even for being a Saw movie, but I appreciated the effort to try something a little different.",Spiral
57,kuarinofu,"Not good, but for different reasons",5,13 June 2021,"Many reviews here completely reject Chris Rock in this. Personally, I thought he was so miscast it actually worked. It was something different than a default hardened cop. I liked the idea of him being a good cop, although put in force through nepotism.The problem is, they don't try to give you anything new besides this cast. It actually starts to feel lazy with everything else. There was no interesting dynamic between him and his father even though their views are quite different. An important plot element is thrown in like the last minute of the film. The traps were boring besides, probably, the glass one. Even the production design was weak. There was just nothing behind it, it will never be memorable as the original designs.Yet the biggest problem was the absence of a twist. Like seriously, at the moment he gets the skin present you know the end. Even if you haven't seen the previous films you won't be surprised. But for Saw fans...come on, guys. How can this even remotely come to a twist?More details, interesting dialogue, better production design, and actual character interactions would've saved this. But these combined are like 80% of the film. So...did anyone actually try? Or there was no effort put into this at all besides using the Saw theme and a couple of Kramer's photos?I miss Tobin Bell.",Spiral
58,Movi3DO,Pretty mediocre,6,31 May 2021,"Ah crap, let's play the game again.Another Jigsaw copycat showed up and terrorized a local police department with corrupted past.So Chris Rock, the comedy guy, now carried a horror movie. And he did a decent job. He showed pretty good emotion that the character needed.The traps were pretty okay. The quality definitely helped making the scenes more intense. However, the fast and annoying editing came back. Also, there wasn't a lot of time spent on a trap. It wasn't too surprising because Darren Lynn Bousmann, the man behind Saw II, III, and IV, directed this movie. The ending trap is a straight up rip-off of Saw IV, which was pretty lame.The story itself was pretty interesting. However, it didn't take too long before I saw the twist coming.Overall, another mediocre addition to the franchise despite a good performance from Chris Rock. 6/10.",Spiral
59,DarthVoorhees,Rock gives it his all but 'Spiral' is thematically empty and desperately misses Tobin Bell,6,23 June 2021,The buzz around 'Spiral' was that it was trying new things and taking the long running 'Saw' series into new and exciting places. Don't be duped in by that. 'Spiral' gets an awful lot right but it really failed to understand the appeal of the original 'Saw' series. I'm not saying that Chris Rock and co do not turn in worthy efforts. The entire appeal of 'Spiral' is Rock exiting his comfort zone and doing something we've never seen from him. His performance is a commendable effort but unfortunately in the end we don't have a good villain to match Rock's Zeke. The ultimate lesson of 'Spiral' is that you really can't make a good 'Saw' film without Tobin Bell's John Kramer.'Saw' was a yearly Halloween soap opera. It was the tangled storyline and melodrama that brought me in and they were interesting thanks to Tobin Bell. John Kramer was a fascinating and multi-layered horror character. I was paying to see Tobin Bell. Reimagining 'Saw' without Tobin Bell is a thankless task and yet I commend them for trying. The original 'Saw' unfurled with Jigsaw as a presence more than as a character in the film. 'Spiral' makes the mistake in assuming that we need to be handheld and shown everything. 'Spiral' doesn't have a large cast and so the killer obviously must be someone close to Zeke and with a cast with three leads it doesn't leave many options. An intelligent and alert viewer can probably guess who the Spiral killer is almost as soon as they appear onscreen. I won't spoil it but this performer is boring when they reveal themselves to be evil. It's hard not to view 'Spiral' in the shadow of George Floyd. The movie doesn't delve into the racial element of policing and it's unfortunate because it would have been stronger if it had and the villain would have been more intriguing. The final trap of the film involving Zeke and his father is probably the boldest in the 'Saw' series.Chris Rock really is entertaining and the real draw to the film. His screen presence transfers well to horror. He's always been a fearless performer and you can tell he had fun trying new things.As a horror fan I admire what 'Spiral' aspires to do. I don't think it achieves all of it's goals but I'll never complain about another 'Saw' film. I don't know how soon we'll see another 'Saw' but like John Kramer's victims I guess I'm a glutton for punishment because I'll be there for it.,Spiral

You almost instantly know who is a killer, because of how obvious it is!! This is the worst movie I've seen in a long long time.

61,Darkside-Reviewer,More from the book of Law than from the book of Saw,5,27 June 2021,"The Saw franchise is well known for two things high levels of gore and surprise plot twists. Spiral is a desperate attempt to try and revive the Saw franchise by taking the Saw franchises most basic elements and adding Chris Rock into the mix.The story revolves around two metro city detectives Zeke (Chris Rock) and his new partner William (Max Minghella) as they investigate a series of murders which mimic the Jigsaw killer John Kramer. Zeke discovers that the Jigsaw copycat is targeting police officers that have a history of corruption and violence on the force. Zeke is chosen by the killer to investigate the case due to his history of doing the right thing and turning in corrupt cops. Zeke and William soon begin to uncover evidence of deep corruption within the police force as more dead police officers begin turning up each with ties to Zeke and the police force. It's up to Zeke to put a stop to the Jigsaw copycat killings by following the law and doing the right thing in the name of justice.Spiral is certainly an ambitious new entry into the Saw franchise but sadly that's also the movie's biggest downfall, being linked to the Saw universe. This would have been a much better movie had it been it's own movie with it's own unique set of characters with a new and unpredictable storyline. Sadly the film just copies every Saw movie by trying to incorporate a ""Big twist reveal"" into the story which is so predictable and unoriginal it took me just twenty minutes to figure out with the killer was going to be making the film more like an episode of Columbo than CSI.I will give the movie credit for having some interesting ideas for new Jigsaw traps. The blood and gore in this movie is still pretty high as it is a Saw movie after all but it somehow feels lacking when compared to the previous Saw entries.Chris Rock gives a decent enough performance in the movie my only criticism about his performance is that his character act's more like a street cop than a serious homicide detective. Samual L Jackson ""Co Stars"" as Chris Rock's characters father but in my opinion Jackson is given way too much credit in this movie and is given top billing when he only has around ten minutes of screen time throughout the entire film. Max Minghella gives arguably the most believable character performance in this movie and deserves more credit for his role in this film.Overall Spiral is yet another disappointing entry into the Saw franchise which fails to bring anything original or even memorable to this already dead franchise. I recommend waiting until the movie becomes available on a Streaming service like Netflix as it's not worth the price of a cinema ticket or paying the equivalent of a cinema ticket to stream online.",Spiral

The reason being; overly loud performances, dire lack of character depths, and on top of that a dreadful execution nonetheless! This is not what the audience wished for!To count me as one of those devout fans of the 'SaW' franchise would be a misestimation! Even though I gotta admit; I have fun memories with the earlier chapters. As for the latter ones, well; everybody knows exactly how they fared! Therefore, going in; I sort of kept my expectations in check. Little did I know, that wouldn't be of much help!Let me just get it off my chest; Chris Rock as Detective Banks, The dumbest idea period. His unduly over-the-top demeanor, awful dialogue deliveries made him gravely unsuited for this particular role. Not only him, but each member of the cast also delivered the same level of cheesiness in their acts. Trust me when I say; it was unbearable & unwittingly comical at times.The tonality here seems to be largely antithetical! What was conceived to be a Horror-Thriller at its core; rather came out as a subdued version of the same with inapposite social commentary & artificial incorporation of dry humor; neither of those makes any sense!I'm quite surprised that Darren Lynn Bousman; the same guy who previously directed three of the earliest films under equal conditions, could come up with such a rotten piece of work!",Spiral

The clichéd notion of the only honest cop within your own precinct has been done before (& more importantly better such as in Attack on precinct 13) & to mesh it with the Saw Franchise does offer a new idea to explore.What I found annoying is the (lazy) clichéd over reliance of jump scares & plus the traps are very generic. Even the presence of Samual L Jackson could not saved this from mediocrity. The new voice of Saw is so millennials & LGBT approved; it is unintentionally comical & mockingly in its delivery.

I guess it didn't disappoint on that account: there are some fierce tortures with an impressively crafted amount of gore. But in my humble opinion it actually went a bit overboard, as if the makers tried to compete for Gruesomest Torture In Movies Ever, it was all too farfetched and bizar, the last one (that poor Samuel Jackson had to endure) was on the brink of ludicrous.The pace of the movie is extremely high, which is mostly a positive thing in a horror or police thriller, but here it was at many times a bit too much in overdrive, at the cost of the narrative. And although the openings-sequel and the first 15 minutes thereafter promised a Tarantino-like cynical sense of humor, this totally evaporated in the rest of the movie. Which was especially a shame of Chris Rock, who now fell back into an annoying kind of over-acting, all the time almost screaming his lines. As far as I'm concerned the only thing really rewarding in this the movie was the whodunnit aspect, that keeps you (or at least it kept me!) guessing until the climax.",Spiral

Razzie's meat.Second, the script is weak, and the characters all of them empty. You don't feel anything for them. So, consequently you don't care about how are they going to die. Also, the final twist (as all good Saw movies) is a joke. Are you serious?Last, even the Fx's are acceptable, the torture porn and climax are not well developed. Not as good as the original Saw movies. A wasted opportunity to reborn the franchise.So, overall this one is the weakest Saw movie. Not interesting even for fans like me.

73,JoelChamp85,Not Intelligent But Worth The Watch,7,21 May 2021,"""I don't see no Gump 2"" lol. Good to see horror creeping back into the cinemas, been a while since torture porn was on the big screens. This film was fairly enjoyable with a different angle on the franchise. For better or worse we follow the detective's story instead of just being thrown in a room with a bunch of victims. But, this is also where the problem is - the story is incapable of reaching the psychological thriller it tries to hit (like Se7en), so it sometimes feels weak and almost offensive to the viewer's intelligence.Looking beyond that, the film balanced that out with basically a ""stand-up"" platform for Chris Rock's comedy, which I was probably laughing a bit too loud in the cinema. The practical FX looked great, though the kill scenarios could have been better. It's better than the Jigsaw film which was a disappointing end to the franchise for me.

Saw II I can deal with it was more of time waster movie same goes with this movie but rest of other saw films were pointless, story plot direction doesn't know where it wants to go that's how Saw films started to be very sloppy could ended with 4th film but no they want go aheading continuing milking killing franchisewith characters getting kidnapped, I get sick and tied where main characters can't save other characters from traps not even 1 person gets saved they always keep dying that's how saw franchise got pointless with this new Spiral Saw film was alright that's all I can I wouldn't saw it's great or fantastic but I would say it's Interesting movie, also it brought something new to table it was different Saw film it's not repeat all over again you don't have to watch Saw 1-8 movies just to get to this movie I am series all you have to do is notice Easter eggs in movie noticing evidence from previous saw films that's all you need to know when you see movie but lucky you don't have to see 1-8 films just to get to this movie especially because Chris Rock Playing something new a different role a different character in a series film if your curious about him he does well he play's as very well lead character he did great wonderful performance to see him in a series movie I rather see him do more series roles. Rather him doing
comedy his usual style. But his style in this movie with series role was great wish it wasn't saw film. Samuel L Jackson did great in movie as always nothing to say about him he has been more then 1 movie. The cinematography in thisreally stands out in this compared to other saw films. It doesn't have that ugly coloring to it like with all other Saw films their cinematography looked like ugly filter in Previous saw films it's about dam time for proper Cinematography hired better cameras and made it look perfect it didn't look like a cheap film or cheap TV movie type it looked like film had a budget previous saw films I know it has low budget I forgive that but rest of franchise looked like movie made for TV cinematography crap. Story is simple it follows Det. Ezekiel ""Zeke"" Banks (Chris Rock) is who a is a cop who the film wants us to believe is a good cop, the best cop. He has a new case that their is a new copycat killer from Jigsaw is doing samething like what other Jigsaw has done making traps making people playing their game, An criminal mastermind unleashes a twisted form of justice in Spiral, wanted to make a terrifying new chapter from the book of Saw. So beciallsy it's copycat killer wannabe Jigsaw type. Marcus Banks (Samuel L Jackson) play's father of Chris Rocky character witch he wasn't in it much but he did fine in movie I liked scene with them 2 talking about life and their grandfather all that witch made scene more watchable I rather see that done in a better movie not in a saw film sadly it did happen. Cops are going around investigating about copycat killer. The traps weren't too special I liked trap from last scene of film but rest of others weren't too interesting, and thank god stop bringing back John Kramer/Jigsaw I got sick and tied of him he died one of saw films then they keep bringing him back and again and again for back and fourth just like with Jigsaw it made nothing different that's why my ass got saw from watching Saw III to Jigsaw witch it did my head in, thankfully he doesn't comeback in this movie of Crouse he did die in one of saw films. I don't really hate John Kramer (Tobin Bell) but I just get sick of seeing him when he already died in a saw film but it wants to show what happened before and to explain it witch they should kept him alive and kill him off in last saw movie that's it plain and simple. I always liked John Kramer's iconic voice I thought new voice of killer sounded like a sounds like he's reading lines for a documentary series it didn't sound terrifying at all like previous Saw films this one doesn't sound scary at all if your curious about if they use same voice that John Kramer sounds like terrifying voice they don't it's new voice, but I absolutely hated this new voiceover they chose for the killer, it sounded god awful like something they toke from parody film. This movie had potential They just need new writers for this film, it's same writers from previous Jigsaw film Predictable film in franchise which was easily predictable but less than this film somehow. Nothing has changed when main character tries to save people from traps inthis movie director or writers never make main character to save others character in this movie witch makes our lead character look weak and makes it look pointless it's samething all over again and again they end up dying in traps and our lead character just doesn't save no one they just ended up dying like all another Saw films witch makes it pointless can't just have 1 or 2 people to be saved and escaped from trap no one has ever been saved because they all characters gotta die. At least woman can't be saved?? In movie I liked her character and her bad attitude she didn't need to die, also it's main character not actually figuring out any clues and never saving anyone like I said before it's repeating samething like other saw films I am not kidding. I seen in many times in movies when main cop drives a muscle car I don't mind that at all I don't care it's movie not reality film I love it that way you don't see that in real life often but only movies fantastic love it. Also their is lazy writing very lazy writing, The traps make no sense at all, ifyour curious about creepy puppet even it's copycat killer wouldn't killer would use a creepy puppet or is it because it would been same without John Kramer Voice?? What got me into this movie is because when first trailer came out it reminded me of Seven (1995) film a lot like Seven but it's on it's in saw film sadly I wished this film could been on it's own rather just being in a saw movie just like other crime film called Resurrection (1999) they toke idea of Seven (1995) film director of Resurrection did it on his own he didn't want to do sequel of Seven call it Eight he did it on his own film doing this film could just taken idea of Saw mixed with Seven idea not make it a saw franchise is still great idea call it Spiral that's it not a saw film I wish it wasn't related film not call it saw call it just spiral that's it full stop it doesn't have to be a saw movie. I think this was originally going to be an original film called Spiral but they just want name recognition and just shoehorn in all the Saw nonsense into the script at the last minute because those movies make money, if I was in same shoes as same director I would make studio to take risk rather then just call this Spiral the book of saw witch it didn't make sense at all. The Saw franchise is just Predictable but this film is not that Predictable as other's but I thought it's one of those movies it's just time waster, just to kill time off I saw this movie for free with cinema voucher ticket, I was curious about film saw it, it was more of time waster this director Darren Lynn Bousman maybe had time off wanted to make a saw film like Seven (1995) toke idea but made it for Saw franchise he is director who did Saw II and III and Saw IV rest of other movies he did I wish they could got different director, different writers, just to be fresh and come up with better ideas. This film had idea but for my opinion it was average 4.10 IT'S NOT WORST SAW FILM like with other Saw films, it's one of those time waster films.

Although this movie was enjoyable poor Chris Rock was just not believable actor. Some parts he could act and others it was like he was forcing it.I love CR but he needs to stick with comedy or possibly do gangster movies. In the beginning he was undercover and completely believable as well as funny. But when he gave the dead captain mouth to mouth, or told one officer ""eff-uuuu"", or when Pete was visibly dead and CR hits him while he is hanging. These are all unbelievable actions and the acting felt made up.I almost passed this movie up, thinking it was a spin off for the 2019 Spiral, the covers are similar, and I didn't like that movie. The only actor who was above the rest was Jackson, I love him in anything he does. When he is acting, he is just a relatable person in general. Jackson was the reason I stuck it out.Also, I figure out the rooky was not dead as soon as they showed his tattoo, this scenario has been done before so no big shocker there. Then the end was laughable, the rooky gets away in a building surrounded with S. W. A. T, like I would ever believe this would happen.Although I did like the rooky, he was cute and his acting abilities, sad to say were better then CR's.

Director: Darren Lynn Bousman
Starring: Chris Rock, Samuel L Jackson, Max Minghella, Marisol Nichols etc
Overall rating 84/100Spiral from the book of saw is about a criminal mastermind believed to be a copycat of Jigsaw, and a police officer working in the shadow of his father. Him and His rookie partner take charge in a grisly investigation into murders eerily reminiscent of the cities gruesome past. Zeke (Chris Rock) finds himself at the centre of the killer's morbid game.I have to say I thought Spiral from the book of Saw was brilliant. I thought the cinematography was amazing and very creative. The camera work was really interesting and made the traps more effective. The gore was very effective, although I wouldn't advice eating much before seeing the film. I thought the movie had a nice amount of humour which made a nice change. With some great dialogue and a well constructed and thought out script. The set up for the main character was good. The performances from Chris Rock and Samuel L Jackson were great and they both had great chemistry together. I thought the jumpscares and building of tension was very effective. I loved the mystery and the mind games with the villain. With clear motivations set out, that despite being twisted you could kind of understand and see their reasoning behind their actions. The traps were very effective and creative, although some I admittedly struggled to watch. I liked all the connections between the victims. And the plot twists and final act was insane, I definitely want a sequel.The movie was flawed though, there was some lack of explanation into certain character conflict and some of the conflict felt unnecessary to me. I thought that there was some slight overusage of flashback and exposition in places, but I have heard the whole franchise does this. I also thought the film made it too predictable to find out who the killer was. And finally, I also thought the movie had a slight missed opportunity to go deeper with the themes of the corrupt police force and only touched the surface with highlighting some of the issues but didn't go deep enough.So overall, Spiral had some slightly annoying creative decisions. And made it slightly too obvious who the villain was, whilst also being about 10 minutes too short. But as a whole, was an extremely effective horror. With fantastic visuals, a very clever and well constructed plot and villain. That constantly has you stressed out and on the edge of your seat. Whilst also balancing its different tones well and still feeling like a saw movie but with a new twist.",Spiral
88,aastikhimta,Disgrace to Og saw,2,4 June 2021,The major disappointment in this movie is there's no audio of jigsaw like used to be in OG saw movies plus no jigsaw puppet and that thing really disappointed me. Though Chris rock was quite funny from starting . But the plot was weak from starting. And ending was below average. Samuel played a role like a cameo. This movie shouldn't be considered a part of saw series tbh. Trap scenes were also not upto the mark.,Spiral
89,bangel3322,Very average,5,17 May 2021,"While this had some good moments and good traps and a decent storyline, this isn't anything special or new, and should have been far more superior than it was. Chris Rock was better than I expected but I still think I'd like to have seen someone else in the role. Unfortunately though this was far too predictable as it's very obvious early on who the Jigsaw copycat is. Unlike other films there wasn't much subtlely. A shame as they had an opportunity here to make something really exciting.",Spiral
90,movieman6-413-929510,New Saw film by and for fans of the film series.,5,8 June 2021,"Spiral: From the Book of Saw is directed by Darren Lynn Bousman, who has previously directed other films in the film series.The film is about Detective Ezekiel ""Zeke"" Banks (Chris Rock), who, thanks to the success of his father Marcus (Samuel L. Jackson), as a valued police veteran, is himself taken less seriously as a cop. To prove himself, he teams up with his new inexperienced partner William Schenk (Max Minghella) to solve the case of a possible new Jigsaw copycat killer. To do this, they must work together to solve a bloody mystery before more people fall victim to the torture methods of this mysterious killer.The idea for this new Saw movie came from Chris Rock, who as a fan of the series went to the film studio with an idea and was eventually able to make a deal to make this movie. This is how this film was made by a fan for fans.The problem with the film is that it was directed and written by people who have worked on a Saw film before. This makes the film look familiar, but also familiar. The biggest change of this film is that it is mainly told from the point of view of the investigating detective and is supplemented by flashbacks. For example, for fans of the Saw movies, the aspect of how the people trapped in various dangerous jigsaws are lost is somewhat lost. While some of these new traps are creative, others look a bit familiar. In the earlier Saw films, the traps are more creatively conceived and also better explained. For fans there are some flashbacks in the film to previous Saw films, but unfortunately little is done with most of them.The film is also somewhat predictable. Guessing the identity of the Jigsaw copycat killer, even though they try to lead you astray, is still easy to guess. The copycat killer also uses more proprietary methods, losing use of familiar things from previous Saw films. This copycat also comes across as less fair than the original Jigsaw killer.With the casting of Chris Rock, an actor more known for roles in comedy films, it takes some getting used to seeing him as a serious detective in a gory horror film. Apart from a good start, his character does not come across as appropriate in the film. In addition to Chris Rock, Samuel L. Jackson also plays a fun, small role in the film. Despite the fact that he provides some fun moments in the film in his own way, he gets little else to work with.",Spiral

93,Darkjak007,This is neither Se7en nor Silence of the Lamb,5,14 June 2021,"Spiral: From the book of Saw The next chapter in the Saw Franchise. After a dead cop is found in a elaborate trap, the police began to suspect that a Jigsaw copycat is on the loose. Zeke Banks( Chris Rock) the black sheep of the department and Son of Marcus Banks renowned veteran officer. Take The case along with a new rookie( Max Minghella) trying to unravel the mystery of who the killer is and why their doing all this. I was quite surprised of the idea of them actually doing another movie after six years. Unfortunately this offer is really nothing all that new or fresh to a series. It's a horror movie that tries to mix a thriller aspect of a crime drama. It fall short in both these requirements no ,Chris rock wasn't the best choice. He tries and give an alright performance, but Chris is primarily a comedian his whole Career roster it's hard to buy him as a serious driven character. I don't believe in typecasting but drama isn't his field, It's can work with others like Jamie Foxx or Will Smith. It doesn't really help that what little to try to give a character most is withheld shown and a jumbled mess edits and flashbacks. Samuel L Jackson when on screen is entertaining but he's not as prevalent as you might think he still relevant to the story. If your expecting a big team up between Chris and Samuel you'll be disappoint. Everyone else is outright disposable it's caught on very quickly that the killer has a agenda towards corrupt cops given the fact that every single cop in this movie is an asshole, doesn't really drive you to worry about their safety when they're put into a death trap. They really serve as nothing but a list of suspects. The music's rather bland and the cinematography is a mess following the same blurry fast forward effect that all these movies share. Which makes it kind of difficult to see and appreciate the gore and effects when it's quickly jumping away from it. The traps with the exception of two are not that creative, it feels as though as the movie progresses the traps become less brutal. Overall Spiral is a mediocre film with a lack of interesting character's , creativity and Tension. It tried to offer something different but he just doesn't succeed, leaves you wondering what was the point.",Spiral

96,darkreignn,Spiral down the rabbit hole with this great thriller,7,15 May 2021,"Director Darren Lynn Bousman returns to reclaim his throne in ""Spiral: From the Book of Saw."" Technically the ninth film in the series, ""Spiral"" serves as a soft reboot that benefits from a clear dedication in both its technical prowess and main performance by Chris Rock, returning to its former dramatic, visceral, and cruel glory.Yes, ""Spiral"" is a crueler Saw film, one that is sure to leave you with a pit in your stomach by the time the credits roll. And that's thanks to Darren Lynn Bousman's frantic editing style - ""Spiral"" may have a new glossy veneer, foregoing the gritty, filmlike quality that the earlier films possessed, but it decides to keep Bousman's signature direction of the traps, and the film was better for it. I haven't cringed and felt so genuinely disgusted at a Saw film since I can't remember when; Bousman lingers on the torture, never shying away from the patented brutality that all Saw fans have come to expect. Certainly more disgusting than ""Jigsaw,"" ""Spiral"" has traps that are so vile I was honestly shocked at what I was witnessing.""Spiral's"" traps are sure to satisfy any gore hound, but they wouldn't be nearly as entertaining if the story wasn't up to snuff - luckily, ""Spiral"" has a pretty unique premise, made all the more interesting by Chris Rock's leading performance. It's evident that Chris Rock is a fan of the saw franchise, and he's clearly giving his all in the role of a police detective who is investigating a new string of murders that are eerily reminiscent of those performed by the Jigsaw Killer, John Kramer. Chris Rock flexes his dramatic chops here, and while he by no means gives an Oscar-worthy performance, it's highly entertaining to watch him shout, have aggressive outbursts, and all around act as if he was being consistently pumped with adrenaline. Chris Rock dials the notch up to 11 here, and it's genuinely fun to see his character investigate the goings on of the film.Unfortunately, ""Spiral"" does fall flat in a few areas. For one, it's clear that content was cut out of the film; while cohesive and coherent, the movie seems slightly disjointed, and the story almost moves along too quickly, without any time for characters, or the audience, to breathe. It was confirmed that one full trap was cut out of the film (why?); I wouldn't be surprised if more slower paced, character building moments were cut out as well. Additionally, I found the film's twist incredibly easy to predict, which is unfortunate, as the Saw films usually have a great track record of genuinely shocking their audience. Hopefully, the movie will manage to take you off guard - however, I found that the film choreographs things to such a degree that it clearly shows its hand before it plays it.That said, ""Spiral"" is a very fun Saw film, and just a good thriller in general. The traps are absolutely brutal, and will be sure to disgust. The plot is unique, taking a very unexpected, and even timely, approach that will be sure to keep audiences glued to their seat. Chris Rock is really good as a dramatic actor, and Darren Lynn Bousman once again shows that he is the premier Saw director. If only ""Spiral"" had an extra 20 minutes of character building (and just one more trap or two), I truly think it could've been my personal second best of the franchise. If you're a fan of Saw, you owe it to yourself to check this out!",Spiral
97,rehmankhilji,Damage to the Original,4,30 August 2021,"First of all Chris Rock, well throughout the movie don't know why but was expecting he would simply just jump out of the seriousness and crack one up.Too bad, it wasn't there, too bad he was way to serious, too bad that he was actually too bad doing so. Not your cup Chris. Even Samuel L. Jackson was just passing time on the screen.Rest, well the cast requires no review, they weren't any good.SAW was originally good, with new concept to horror but this one, just not keeping up with legacy. Disappointing on many placed.",Spiral
98,MikesIDhasbeentaken,truly awful,2,31 July 2021,"In my opinion although the Saw movies went downhill from the first, they were still always watchable,This just isn't, the twist... anyone will see coming a mile away, but the way it plays out is just down to pure chance, not creativity, the ending is ridiculous.Chris Rock is just awful, completely unbelievable every second he's on screen, which is early all of them.The traps were unimaginative (all 4 of them..), story predicable and boring, acting / casting awful. There was nothing to like about this.",Spiral
99,Jerique,"As with Jigsaw, it's underwhelming, but a good time-waster.",5,25 September 2021,"Initially when I heard Chris Rock was the showrunner here, I thought it was quite odd. Rock is known for comedy. I wanted to give this a chance, like I did with Jigsaw four years ago.So, this film gives off very Se7en vibes for a large majority of it's runtime. Through use of flashbacks and slight exposition, Chris Rock's character of Zeke is hated by the rest of his colleagues. His father is former police chief played by Samuel L. Jackson. Zeke's new partner is William, played by Max Minghella. Prior to this I really only remember Max from The Social Network. But he seems to stick out like a sore thumb.Traps themselves are a bit ramped up, I feel, than before. I think that they did a good job making the viewer feel uneasy and the sound mixing was really well done to really make you want to look away. Voiceover work for the Spiral killer (Jigsaw has been dead for over 10 years in this film too) was a bit lacking however. It almost felt silly and more like a parody when the killer claimed, ""I want to play a game.""Still if you're paying attention, the reveal of who is the mastermind is predictable. That's not to take away from the film, after the first three films and almost anything written by Leigh Whannell -- I've come to expect and look for plot twists. Goldfinger and Stolberg did an alright job with the writing, but it doesn't jump out at you like Saw used to before Saw 3D.I wanted to like it, but it still wasn't horrible and I didn't have high expectations but it was still pretty good. It didn't bore me and it kept my attention to the end -- which I felt might be the weakest of the entire franchise -- so, if they go back to basics and release a direct sequel to Jigsaw and bring back Tobin Bell, I may just be ready to do another dance with Saw.",Spiral

The script is 8thgrade level at bestChris Rock actually did a good job acting in a novel way to fit his role. Samuel L Jackson character felt like it was built off of near any of his other roles so he could just walk on set, say some lines and go to another taping for another project.The ""saw"" gadgets felt like copies of older movies rather than being relevant to the movie theme and also new deliveries . No bar raised here.So sad. So much hype and excitement for this new installation fall so flat. I am hoping Rock loses interest and another creative team takes over fir the next one.

The first, is the flashback of Garza with Marcus Banks, in the station's private office (in which Garza is pleading with Banks over the well-being of the police department). The second, is the punch-up between Schenk and Zeke at the climax of the movie (in which Sam L Jackson's plea for the police to not enter is the safety of audiences watching movies despite mental illness prevailing in reality).When Angie Garza is seen talking with Marcus, Sam L Jackson's franchise crisscross between Spiral and The Hitman's Wife's Bodyguard is the victimization of Detective Garza, because of the proof from Marcus, that he is not a jackass but a serious warrior leader.When Schenk fights Zeke, in the elevator space, the hidden youth of Zeke is in the crashing open. Somehow, it's important that Zeke and Schenk are perceived as the same age, even though they are definitely not.Could this be Chris Rock sacrificing his seniority to Jackson, the way Jackson does to Morgan Freeman, in THWB?One has to wonder - perhaps finally at least.",Spiral

106,TuesdayThe17th,Does Samuel L. age? Tell him to pass that fountain of youth drank he's sippin,3,22 July 2021,"Yikes...this movie was not good. Possibly in the bottom two worst movies in the franchise..and that's too bad because this movie was so hyped up and anticipated, it could have made for a major blockbuster. Honestly, the second i saw that Darren Lynn Bousman was directing I kinda knew it was doomed. Bowman has directed the three highest grossing saw films but all three are indie budgeted films. Bousman is more of a low to mid budget director and i don't think he' d know what to do with a tom of money for a film. Unfortunately, this is more than just a thought as it is apparent as we watch ""Spiral"" spiral out of control and not in a good way. The opening scene, although rushed feeling, seems to be setting the tone for the film but its actually probably the more vivid and upfront of the torture scenes. And that's just the thing; the torture scenes are weak and there are rather few of them. Most of them are not shown in full but instead through quick glimpses of a flashback. Most of the traps are stupid and vapid. Uninteresting to say the least. The story is too centered on these police officers that get a lot of screen time in the precinct but little elsewhere. Characters are kind of introduced and then are never seen again...like what? Lol, this is all a result of Chris Rock's involvement. It says everywhere that he wrote this movie but he is not credited as a writer in the credits. Regardless i think he had a very heavy hand in the production as he "" saw"" this as his unique baby and comeback performance and film. The story misses all these major obvious things that could have been fixed, some with as little as better dialogue. Like when Zeke tells all the cops to seal off the precinct and make sure no one gets out, then immediately decides he is going to find his old partner and talk to.him and rushes out of the building. Um ok, u just said nobody leaves...w.e. There were so many more, even more annoying, than this. Too much of the movie takes place in that unappealing precinct snd when other cool locations are used it is shown very briefly. This annoyed me greatly. Many will say Chris Rock overacted. How can u say this when he acts this same way in every movie he is in? But yes, as this was likely his ""comeback vehicle"", u will notice his acting is quite...bamfy...
Samuel L. Is also lackluster and, too, acts the same way in every movie. He seems to be reverse aging. He looks the same way he did 20 years ago. I just don't lile him very much. He is typical and every time hes im a movie im less likely to get truly immersed.The jigsaw killer was beyond obvious as to who it was and the twist SUCKED. They had so little to go back and reveal as prior easter eggs and clues because it was all just so lame.It did have a nice cinematic touch though. Some ok shots and some neat music and like one cool kill scene...thats about it. The gore was cheapish looking and too vague. I think the team behind it forgot they were making an ever loved Saw movie and thought they were making a cop crime thriller you'd see on TV. Saw movies are meant to be HORROR movies at their core, not some timid nonsense lacking blood and gore for the sake of being more intellectual and clean cut. Attempting to that is.",Spiral

108,PCC0921,"Very Good Performances, Good Story, Convincing Effects, No Frights Though",6,21 May 2021,"Released: May 14th, 2021
Viewed: May 19th, 2021Horror films these days have become something other than horror films. We have pushed the envelope so far on the serious violence subject that the movies themselves aren't really scary anymore, just kinda' gross. Because of TV shows like CSI (2000 - 2015), the Walking Dead (2010 - Present), the age of streaming services making it easier for access to R rated content and changing attitudes on violence in movies/TV shows, we have come to a point where we have seen everything. I mean really, how many different ways can you mutilate the human body? Plus, knowing that it is fake (not criticizing the effects in some of these films), and with all that Hollywood magic thrown in, also makes it easier not to be scared.We have come to a point where horror films need other angles to make them appealing today. So, for me, my angle was concentrating on the very interesting idea of seeing Chris Rock and Samuel L. Jackson being serious in a slasher/gore film. Of course, Samuel L. Has done plenty of serious work, but it was the idea of Chris Rock taking on a serious role, that I've never seen before. The closest, serious, dramatic role I've ever seen him in was probably, Lethal Weapon IV (1998). What is even more intriguing is the fact that Rock plays Jackson's son in this film.Rock plays Police Detective Zeke Banks, who's father once was a legendary Police Captain, who was busy hunting down Jigsaw during the old Saw days. On the day Banks gets a new partner (Max Minghella), fellow detectives of Bank's start disappearing and falling prey to a new copycat killer named Spiral. A pretty basic plot, but it does deliver a few surprises and turns.What it didn't do was scare me. I didn't flinch at all and this film had plenty of the cheap, flashed, jump-cuts for fright purposes and those weren't working either. As I said earlier, horror films are not scary anymore, just cartoonishly gross and silly. I am not criticizing the effects in this film, because they are good and convincing when looking at them from a creative and designed point of view. When it comes to frights, this one needed to use it's next best cards to make this film enjoyable.That card falls to the performances of Chris Rock and his supporting cast, who all do a pretty good, convincing job. In the case of Rock, it's almost weird watching him do a serious Chris Rock, but with a gritty edge that was very cool, fresh and likeable. He wanted to tell us that there was no time for comedy, only serious stuff. Samuel L. Jackson does what he does well. He executes the qualities and attributes of his character needed to sell it to an audience, And, he does it without over-doing it. What makes him so good is his ability to simplify the issue, because an energetic, amplified personality like him could fall prey to over-acting, but Jackson gets the job done again.The rest of the cast is a cast of virtual unknowns, who do a good job, but deflate some of the energy in the room being generated by Rock and Jackson. The next biggest cast member after Minghella, is Marisol Nichols, who plays the current Police Captain. She manages to feed on the emotions of the audience. It was her character that helped generate the second guessing of where this story ends up.Go into this movie looking for suspense, a good murder mystery, fresh performances and a psychological thriller. Try and take the gore as flashy make-up effects and try to remember its all fake, so it doesn't ruin the rest of the film for you. I still consider a film with a 6 IMDB a good film and worth seeing, but I'd save your money and go to $5 Tuesday night instead of the regular theater price. I will say this though, Chris Rock was pretty good. I like his serious side.6.1 (D+ Mygrade) = 6 IMDB.",Spiral

119,nebk,Spiral: From Chris Rock's Book Of Overacting.,1,3 June 2021,"This movie was seriously bad and by the end insulting to the viewers...it has numerous problems some of which are:No one ever answers their phone or can get in touch with anyone else when they need to. In fact phones are only useful when the killer wants to set up the protagonist. Almost all of the cops in the film are portrayed as corrupt to some extent. The acting is all over the place and goes from ok to rally bad in certain scenes. Chris Rock seems to think that shouting is equal to a serious dramatic performance. He is also in his mid 50s and feels about 15 years too old for this role.The traps set by the killer are impossible to escape and make no sense other than to terrify and torture. It also makes no sense how he sets them up in a brief period of time. The killer must also have teleportation abilities considering how quickly he goes from place to place. He also manages to kill not only the police chief but to get her predecessor killed as well. By the
S. W. A. T team no less. And no one recognised the legendary ex captain of police or wandered why a man hanging on strings looks like he is about to shoot at them while suspended in mid air. When the current chief of police is murdered no one hears gunshots in the police station. And the lack of logic goes on and on.The dialogue and line delivery between characters is atrocious at times as well...overall this is the worst movie in the saw franchise and that's saying something considering how many poor sequels there were. The name dropping of other movies in the film like Twilight, The Wire, New Jack City also feels unnecessary and dated as well. This is a badly written, poorly acted unnecessary and forgettable chapter in the Saw franchise.",Spiral
120,chandean-69762,Spiral: From the Book of Saw 2021 Review,5,15 May 2021,"""I ain't see Gump 2?!""
Personal Ancedote:
My first SAW film in theatres!I'm a huge SAW nerd. The original SAW is one of my favorite films ever. All of the films (the original through 7) I adore even though I can recognize that they're not the greatest, while Jigsaw was very meh and didn't really impress me or grip me like the first 7 did.So I think it's safe to say I went into this with low expectations especially after the lackluster Jigsaw. I was pretty skeptical all around, and i'm kind of sad to say I left this feeling pretty disappointed.Review:
Like I said, I went in with pretty low expectations and sadly left disappointed still.Spiral tends to feel like it's trying too hard to be culturally relevant with some of the current situations going on in the world - the main culprit being police brutality and police reform.There's even a quote ""John Kramer doesn't target cops."", which he does in BOTH Saw II and IV ... sooo ....
Now if this film came out 5 years ago I probably wouldn't have batted an eye about it to be completely honest. Just the way they implemented it into the story made it feel very very forced and I couldn't help but feel like ""okay we get it"" about it. Spiral felt like a film more about police brutality / reform with a touch of SAW in it, more than an actual SAW movie.I digress...Chris Rock did surprise me though, his acting definitely isn't Oscars level worthy, but he was a lot better than I was expecting.Some of the new traps were pretty interesting and wild (like the glass trap) but nothing as wild as Jill's dream trap in Saw: The Final Chapter.I think where this movie lacks the hardest is it's dialogue. Now the SAW franchise definitely isn't known for its great dialogue or anything, but I couldn't help but notice how awful the dialogue was, it's not even cheesy bad, it's just bad bad.There's even some odd editing choices like cutting away from trap scenes which I feel like the previous films never really did - or at least to this extent, it felt like it ruined the shock value of those scenes. Even stuff like a random shot of some kids playing in a leaking fire hydrant in the beginning of the film or a shot towards the end of the film that's just a staring at the ground all blurry?It's sad when the best part of the film is 21 Savage during the end credits. (thank you I definitely did download the song because it's a banger.)All in all Spiral definitely has its flaws, but it isn't the worst SAW movie out there.If you're trying to get your SAW fix it's worth seeing for sure, but i'd much rather watch any of the first 7 SAW movies over this one.",Spiral
121,ZeroCoolRO,Even better than I expected.,8,12 July 2021,"I watched the entire series of SAW like 2 times, and now that this one was released I needed to see if is good or not. Well, Id like to inform you that is still an amazing movie.You see, SAW series isnt 100% about story / acting / light / sound or whatever you look at other movies to have. Story is stretched now since there are so many movies, you should watch and rate it if you liked or found the ways he killed the victims ingenious.For me, the methods that Jigsaw found to kill the victims were the best and meant like 85% of the movie. I always looked forward too see how they will die now.I dont remember to write a review to previous SAW movies, because all would be the same. Every saw movie have some freakin' smart ways to kill the victims, and THIS you should appreciate about SAW.Don't be fooled by plebs that gave bad score, no everyone is fan of horror / gore movies. I dont know, some viewers look at what boxers the main actor wear or what shoes he have, they analyze the movie way too much and forget to enjoy the little things.Just ONE THING you need to remember, there is no movie that dont have stupid reviews and scros like 1-2-3, even good movies have these plebs.",Spiral

This movie had more potential with the cast, but didn't quite pull it off.Chris Rock shifting tone often doesn't help and some side casting just heighten the melodrama. But Samuel and Marisol are pretty decent.If the ending had more punch it could have been great. Cops as victims, especially right now, is more interesting than other choices. If it had just had better writing and probably directing...In its favour though, a few good actors and it's got fantastic sets. Looks great in 4K HDR too.

134,tresm87,"Chris Rock didn't ""wanna play a game"" with his failed attempt at a serious role, but a spiraling story, Darren Bousman's brutal directing makes this a passable spinoff.",6,13 May 2021,"When this was announced and I saw it was starring Chris Rock, I was very skeptical of him being attached, but the trailers still showed a great deal of grime and decent resemblance of the lengthy Saw franchise. Well now that I finally saw it, my fears of a failed attempt at a serious Chris Rock portrayal became all too real. His acting is absolutely atrocious and cannot be taken seriously especially in this grizzled franchise. There are times where you can literally see him almost laugh or crack a smile in the actual film. NOT ALL comedians can translate their comedy into versatile serious roles like certain legends. This trend of comedians trying to go serious is getting to be tiresome imo.Story wise, it's actually serviceable for the most part aside from forced biased propaganda that was inevitable with Rock involved, especially in this insane day and age. The plotting is rather predictable but there are still solid thriller aspects that are digestible and it has some vibrant suspense toward the end. Some twists and turns keep it interesting and familiar enough though I personally couldn't take the killer's disguised voice seriously either. Sam Jackson is always enjoyable and Max Mingella brings solid support.The real standout and somewhat saving grace for the film is the directing from Bousman who also directed Saw 2/3/4. He creates a visceral environment full of colorful settings, relentless brutality, and crisp camerawork overall. He's a director that has shown some serious potential and a keen eye for horror.Overall this is a passable spinoff that offers some new bloodshed in the franchise, yet suffers extremely from Rock forcing a serious role. I'd even go as far as saying if they got a more proper actor for the main role it would've elevated the film drastically. It doesn't break any new ground but has enough to keep fans intrigued and Bousman seems to have the ability to still keep the franchise going.",Spiral

137,BeanieCore,The downward spiral continues.,4,7 June 2021,"It's been 5 years since ""Jigsaw"", Lionsgate's attempt at bringing the ""Saw"" franchise back to life. That film in of itself was incredibly misguided and plainly mediocre, and if the franchise was to continue, it needed new life-blood. Something unique and fresh, instead of a film continuing from a convoluted plot-line that should've ended a decade ago. And despite my better judgement, I had hopes that ""Spiral"" could be that film. Being produced by Chris Rock, and starring a cast that is quite unusual for a Saw film, it promised to tell a completely new story, set in the same world as the original films, and directed by series veteran, Darren Lynn Bousman. No more resurrecting Tobin Bell to appear as John Kramer for a few split seconds, no more adding even further twists and turns to the incredibly complex existing mythology. This was to be a new start for one of the longest running horror franchises of the 21st century. And I had hope. Sadly, that hope was all for naught.I'm comfortable stating that ""Spiral"" is one of the worst films in the entire franchise. Which is no small feat. But it's so astonishingly inept that one wonders how a major studio greenlit it's release. Especially when connected to such a beloved property. I suppose I'll begin with the acting. If anyone other than Chris Rock had been cast as the lead character, I have a feeling that the film would've, at the very least, become infinitely less burdensome to watch. Rock simply cannot act to save his life. At no point does he seem to be truly immersed in his character. His endless, shrill shouting and poor attempts at injecting humor into the screenplay are purely annoying. None of the jokes land, and his several lengthy diatribes end up feeling like an embarrassing stand-up routine, completely out of rhythm with the film's tone. The supporting cast is equally hit-or-miss, with young Max Minghella being the only truly convincing performer in the bunch. Sadly, he's absent for half of the film.Furthermore, there is nothing the least bit frightening or suspenseful about this film. The ""Saw"" franchise, even at it's lowest points, has always delivered some sense of nail-biting tension. Here, even the traps themselves are devoid of any suspense. We know that every character must die to advance the plot, so there's no element of surprise. No hope that anyone might survive any of the given devices. Outside of these moments, the police procedural plot-line is incredibly dull, and thanks to the stunted performances and unusually sketchy direction, never picks up momentum. Most of the time, you're simply left waiting for the next trap to begin, to save you from the laughable dialogue and atrocious acting. This is the film's cardinal sin. At the end of the day, the one thing that no ""Saw"" film should ever be, is boring.The one seemingly unique aspect the film has up it's sleeve is it's narrative. The copy-cat killer in this installment is targeting a corrupt police precinct, and their traps are set to bring justice to the victims of police brutality and corruption. This is a prescient and timely topic, and the ""Saw"" franchise could've been a brilliant conduit through which to make some affecting social observations. Sadly, this plot-arc ends up dead in the water. It's as if the filmmakers thought they were saying something profound, but instead, fail to make a statement at all. The film simply ends, with a rushed denouement that leaves one just sitting there. There's no brilliant twist, because, honestly, I've no idea who wouldn't see the ending coming from a mile away. It's one of the most predictable films I've seen in some time. All together, this a huge mess, lacking in tension, creativity, and every other department possible. The only moments worth savoring are a few of the inventive traps, many of which fail to make an impact. It's long been time to let this franchise die, and I hope ""Spiral"" is the final nail in the coffin.",Spiral
138,edwardrevans,An Ok addition to the Saw Franchise,5,14 July 2021,"Not classic Saw movie as Jigsaw is such a iconic character to replace an offshoot of the Franchise and I am not sure it's really connected as there are only subtle references. Chris Rock in this is what can I say a bit Hammy and over acts too much. Now some say it's predictable where that in a sense is true however I thought it was someone completely different who was responsible for the Cop killings. The traps were not as elaborate as the other saw movies and the final trap but 1 i.e. Second to last was totally implausible I am afraid and me thinks someone really wanted that shoehorned in without thinking it through (Mr Rock ?) , and less time was dedicated to this part of the story.

Samuel L Jackson was perfect in his role. It was almost like Chris Rock thought he was in a different movie than the rest of the cast.

The only thing worse than the cliché-ridden plot is the totally uninspired traps. Chris Rock is shockingly bad in this film. He does fine with the shoehorned-in comedic moments, but his attempts at portraying fear, disgust, or anger are so off the mark that it's hard to imagine what the bad takes must've looked like. You can see the patented Saw plot twist coming from a mile away, and the movie still goes above and beyond to excessively, insultingly explain it to you as if you didn't predict it an hour ago.

143,hfreinoso,I like this film. I just wish I LOVED it.,7,17 May 2021,"After coming out of this film. This film is NOT better than the first Saw movie. BUT it is in fact better than any of it's sequel. This is my 2nd favorite Saw film. There was so many good things about this film ,yet has a lot of flaws. I am mix right now of this film. This was my most anticipate film of 2020 and when it got delayed to 2021, I was disappointed from this and I needed to wait longer and now it's here and I got some things to say about this film.The Goods: Chris Rock, was funny and amazing in the movie. I really thought he was gonna suck and take it too silly this Saw movie. But no he did a fantastic job. I can say with the other characters such as Samuel L Jackson (Even though he was like about 10 minutes in the movie) Max Minghella and Marisol Nichols did great as their roles. The traps are messed up and gruesome. It went step by step and the killer chose the right people for those traps. And it worked so well. And I like the ""killer's"" motive in this film. Going after dirty cops. It's a true real world situation for our time, and thank god they have done this for a film. We see how cops were and how much of a prick they can be. Just like when they kill Schenk dad by a dirty point, he chose a good reason to hunt down cops who love to abuse their power. I like that, cause there are true cops in this real world who would take advantage of this power. And overall it was just fun to watch for the film to go over and be a different take on a Saw movie. And it was lore before gore, which is a big plus in my book, cause I need more storytelling like the first movie and not so much gore like it's sequels.The Bad: It's true the twist is so bad, it was so predictable for a Saw movie. I saw it miles away when his ""partner"" died. I knew it would be Max Minghella character. I like his motive. BUT WHY does he choose John Kramer's method for this. I though there would be a cult following in this film, but no he was just mad that they killed his dad. But I NEED more than just that, I want to know why he would choose and do all this for his method. And I needed more development from these characters. I do like a good fast pace of a film. BUT NOT too fast. I wanted to at least settle down a bit with Zeke and his dad being father and son and how his life was for being a cop of his duty. And how life is like for them. I needed more from these characters and show why and how. Also I hate the department for hating on Zeke for snitching on a cop. I don't understand that and I don't think I ever will. Cause there should be no reason for them to hate on him just cause a cop abused his power. That was stupid to me.Overall this film was good and it was my 2nd favorite Saw movie, but fix these flaws and I would have LOVED this movie. 7/10.",Spiral
144,garethvk,Spiral: From The Book Of Saw Is A Fresh New Direction For The Franchise,7,12 May 2021,"Detective Zeke Banks (Chris Rock); is a man under stress. His decision to report a corrupt cop has made him enemies within his precinct and set him at odds with his father Marcus (Samuel L. Jackson); who also happens to be the former Chief of Police.This tension has caused Zeke to be shot in the line of duty when fellow officers refused to respond to his calls for backup which even further inflamed a tense situation and made Zeke a Lone Wolf who is hesitant to work with others and has cost him his marriage.Unfortunately for Zeke; a grisly murder happens and he is assigned a new partner named William Schenk (Max Minghella); to investigate what appears to be a copycat of the long-dead Jigsaw.The fact that the victim is a fellow cop inflames the office and when Zeke is sent a package from the killer which promises more killings to follow as the corruption within his department needs to be stopped.As the victims begin to mount; Zeke and William find themselves in a race against time to discover the identity of the killer and stop the killings.""Spiral: From The Book Of SAW""; is an interesting new entry into the franchise and in keeping with ""Jigsaw:' was more engaging than several of the last films in the main franchise as it gives audiences deeper characters and scenarios than normally shown in the series.While the traps are as clever and gruesome as fans of the series would expect; the decision to target cops is an interesting choice and in many ways reflects the growing cries for reforming the Police but does it in an extreme way and balances out that there are good cops in the mix who serve and protect.Chris Rock also served as a Producer was good in the role and it was refreshing to see him play a darker and more dramatic character. While he still has moments of clever riffs; they are appropriately placed within the film and do not take away from the fact that Zeke is a troubled and driven individual.The supporting cast is solid and while I was able to identify the individual behind the killings fairly early; there were enough Red Herrings along the way that may keep audiences guessing.Director Darren Lynn Bousman who directed the second to the fourth film in the series has made a solid return to the franchise and keeps the dark and dirty look of the film's trap sequences and while they are gory; there is a cleverness to them that should delight fans of the series.In the end ""Spiral"" has enough of what fans of the franchise expect and infuses some interesting new characters and scenarios to make one of the more complete and enjoyable entries in the series.",Spiral

He cannot act or portray emotion and especially can't look intimidating.Every stupid cop cliche you could think of was in here, he's the only honest cop, rest are corrupt, grassed on a bad cop, his partner was bad, he only works alone, best friend who he didn't recognise the badge number or ring etc but the guy was family, literally all there, then worse is in a world of equality you still get actors too focused on jokes based on colour, like the Jamaican nanny joke or two black guys in a mall, it's embarrassing, doesn't sound clever or original, it's the same stuff Eddie Murphy and tucker did 20-30 years ago! If it had of been a good actor who didn't want to get the MF word in 599 times and could actually act with the rest the same then I'd say this is a 6/10 film with promise, if you bring rock back this series will never work, get rid of him whilst you still have a chance of keeping the great series alive, even if you found a son or something to link to JS or a legitimately good reason for using his style then this would be a forever kinda franchise, with rock it's one more at best.Not enough gore to, cut off at good bits or just poor editing and filming missed what made saw great also showing people dead before their task was stupid as was the time, film felt rushed and tasks seemed to quick to actually ever succeed which was never the actual plan or what jigsaw wantsAlso why copy him other than the obvious reason for the film?

He will probably always stand for me as an action comedy actor, and not in a Horrorp *** movie.The story is far from complicated, and actually goes a bit in circles. It is extremely graphic. It has a twist that I like and surprised me. That is the great strength of the film.

As a huge fan of the franchise, this movie delivers everything that makes the saw movies great, and does away with everything that makes them bad. Unlike, other saw films, this is very story centered. The plot is quite easy to follow and making it more about plot then traps makes the traps more entertaining when they hit. Although the traps are not super gory, and they're not even the most graphic traps in the series, they are still very brutal and hard to watch. The acting is obviously much better than the other films and even the soundtrack hits well. The main thing that makes this work is by getting rid of jigsaw letting the movie be its own thing, with a saw style, than making it connect to John Kramer. Only real flaw is that its twist is incredibly predictable.",Spiral

162,thefendiprint,"Jigsaw says ""ACAB""",6,14 May 2021,"I have been a Saw fan since the early days and am always excited when another one is in the works, but I have very mixed feelings about this film. On one hand, there's a lot to like and also plenty to dislike about the final product. For starters, the best parts were obviously the traps and the ending, however, the film overall feels rather soulless. It doesn't particularly feel like a Saw film, though I guess at the same time Spiral is the most similar in structure and atmosphere to the first Saw film. But something still just felt off.I'm not particularly a fan of Chris Rock, so I wasn't super impressed by his performance per se but it wasn't as bad as I thought it may be. The rest of the cast does their parts fine, but nothing to write home about. The story is fine, emphasis on fine, but I will say that I do like that this killer is basically hunting bad cops, which is very politically relevant. But a lot of it still felt very forced and the ending, while it makes sense, isn't gratifying enough nor does it even really get resolved (now that they have Saw 10 on the way, I kind of expected the cliffhanger). Also I absolutely HATE this new voiceover they chose for the killer, it sounds AWFUL. Please just go back to the OG voice, I beg of you!Now this isn't to say the film is ""bad"", but it surely isn't very memorable. There are elements that work here, sure, but ultimately the sum of its parts leaves much to be desired. As much as I really wanted to enjoy the film more, I would go as far to say this is probably among the worst of the franchise, despite it technically being a spin-off(?) of sorts (or at least a departure from the John Kramer story). And maybe that's because the Kramer story was so intricate and intriguing, whereas this one is doing more of the same but with a less interesting version of Jigsaw. Hopefully it can be redeemed by the sequel, but I won't be holding my breath. The quality of the franchise has gradually decreased with every new movie, and it's obvious the end times may be near. But with all this said, I will always support Saw and any future films because she's an icon after all!",Spiral

You're basically left wondering what happens in the next few minutes after the ending, since it didn't really get resolved. Sure, you find out who the killer is as expected, but it almost seemed as though they were trying to leave things wide open for a sequel with a ""what the heck happens now?"" kind of conclusion.In any case, I liked most of the film and apart from the ending and the traps that were more brutal than clever, I'd say it was decently done.",Spiral

Part of it was the 'twist' only works because the screenplay lies to the audience, so the reveal felt flat this time around and less, 'omg how didn't I see that coming?'. The music, acting, and production quality wasn't too bad, but the story rushes along. This series feels more brief and small and less grand despite the decent actors. I wasn't very disappointed, just quite underwhelmed. They spent 40 million dollars on this? I never would've known. I really recommend seeing this for free instead of paying.

Samuel L. Jackson is just in few scenes, even being an awesome actor, his role isn't memorable. Chris Rock is good during a lot of sequences but he seems a bit exaggerated during the scenes where needs to be angry. But some actors are really horrible and sometimes they look amateurish.The body count is weak and we've seen better traps during the previous Saw installments. There are some gruesome parts, but not so intense or creative as we used to watch in Saw II, III, IV,...In my opinion, Lionsgate tried to ""reboot"" Saw in a very wrong way. The job was simple: they just needed to put some hateful and relatable characters trying to survive in a mansion/warehouse/whatever full of deadly traps, with few connections with the previous sequels (or even without any connection).

The acting itself was okay however, it was inconsistent. Sam Jackson and Max Minghella are the only cast members with any talent. Chris Rock had some decent deliveries but overall he, and the remaining cast were either over-acting or under-acting. The only good thing about the movie was they tried to focus more on story than gore, which is a good thing and the kills themselves got better as the film progressed.

Jackson is a distraction. You want to like Rock, because he's always so darn likable. Everybody Loves Chris. But here, despite obviously really trying hard to convince us he's a hardened cop, he unfortunately just isn't very good. And Jackson collects a paycheck, that's it.I do like the notion of expanding the franchise with Jigsaw-copycat villains, each with a new puppet (as in this film, which replaces Billy with an unnamed pig marionette).But I think what fans of the franchise expect beyond that is the elaborateness of the traps, the mystery and the story. What separates the ""Saw"" films from other, more exploitative torture porn like the ""Hostel"" and ""I Spit on Your Grave"" franchises is that they're smart chess games.

188,xmike-25541,New take on SAW doesnt work for die hard fans,4,1 June 2021,"This film isnt bad at all.. it has gore , it has surprise twist (sadly only one) , but the ultimate fail here is that Spiral movie is only simple revenge movie and if you would named it differently, you wouldnt notice any difference. Sadly , Spiral isnt on same level with SAW masterpiece films (1 , 2 and 3rd ) and more sadly, Spiral moved away from moral base - if you remember , John Kramer hated murderers , never do a trap where the killing was 100% sure thing .. Saw franchise was never about revenge in terms of ""you did bad to me, i will kill you.."" no ... Spiral sadly does that and final twist is hugely disappointing , making this film simple ""mystery killer"" one...
Oh yes and Spiral has political message too - about policemen killing people (armed or unarmed) without firstly think about consequences... Last scene was very political in that matter and sudden jump the ""THE END"" title highlights it..
Jigsaw movie was very good at the end, maybe little boring and repetitive but it was great restart/continuation of SAW franchise.. Making new guy a john´s successor.. And here is my biggest problem - i would name 2 - 4 characters who should made it to go back and you Spiral as grand returning to the scene and connect Jigsaw film with Spiral - nope , nothing of this happens and Spiral is standalone , spinoff movie with no SAW franchise framing or resemblance.For casual viewers its gonna be fun watching but for us - fans (or haters) of Kramer, Lawrence, Zepp, Matthews, Hoffmann, Strahm, Amanda and many more characters - Spiral is very disappointing in terms of connection, franchise revamping, morality and apolitical take ...",Spiral

The scary comes from the scenarios, a plausible way out for a questionably evil trapped person... but when the victim is unlikable and the choices are both just as bad, when it's always death or mutilation, that's not intense. The killer (no spoilers) is exactly who it has to be... ie there is no second guessing. I figured it out 30 min in because of lazy writing and editing that shows too much.

206,huntersmithx,A somewhat refreshing but disjointed affair.,7,19 May 2021,"The 2000s were a strange decade for Horror, and while there was no shortage of quality outings, standouts included increasingly preposterous sagas like Saw and Paranormal Activity. The little home-grown movies that could each grew into those Horror parodies you see in children's cartoons. The most unlikely of superstars, Chris Rock, has now collaborated with Lionsgate and director Darren Lynn Bousman to jumpstart Saw with a revival that has some back to basics thrown in. 'Spiral' is trying to be for this franchise like 'New Nightmare' was for A Nightmare on Elm Street in the 90s- and it halfway succeeds. It may just be on par with the original installment in terms of creativity and thematic links to David Fincher's 'Seven', and there's certainly no contest between this and the Red Bull fueled froth that came in between- but it's also ham-fisted to a fault.It should be no surprise nowadays when a comedic actor or creator reinvents themselves with Horror or Drama (Jordan Peele, Craig Mazin with 'Chernobyl'), so Rock delivers as Det. Zeke Banks with sincerity. With his manifesto from years back comes a slew of humor that appeals to a more diverse audience. Samuel L. Jackson as Zeke's father/retired police chief is entertaining and scene-chewing as always. He's however not in this film as much as you might be led to believe, giving more room for Rock to steal the show.Its injections of comedic relief are cringey at times, but certainly a cut above the worst moments in 'It: Chapter Two' and some of the Marvel installments. The direction and production values are also at times noteworthy; with the sepia-toned, heat wave induced big city and its urban atmosphere help breathe new life.However the direction also comes a good amount of the typical Saw schtick- high-pitched jump scares and gimmicky editing. Many trailers aren't as bad as a number of cinephiles make them out to be, but here's an exception. The first trailer show a level of nuance in maneuvering suspense much better than the final product: because much of the dialogue is clunky, shouty and almost incapable of understatement- save for the final twist that pays off many of the themes and imagery set up throughout. They also mirror our more socially conscious country, and the roles of good and bad cops (guess what the dead pigs that Jigsaw used to use is brought back as symbolism for). It's a very 2020 Horror film and probably not as clever as it could be, but the final twist and elements in between may just as well be the next best thing for this dinosaur franchise.Grade- 2.5 out of 4 stars.",Spiral

It starts with excitement and leaves you curious until about halfway through.Plot- No spoiler here (jigsaw has been dead since Saw 3) a copycat killer targets a specific precinct of police. The traps don't have any point to them whatsoever once you find out the motive of the killer.Characters/Acting- There were characters you are supposed to dislike, but yeah I didn't like Chris Rocks character too much. Love him as a comedian and I'm sure he can do better but he just always looks like he's trying not to laugh.Writing- The dialogue was pretty good, some funny banter, but the story wasn't as thrilling as previous installments.Quality- Honestly some of the best direction I've seen out of the Saw films. Combines the frantic editing and intense music with actually well shot scenes that make it feel like a ""big"" movie. Traps were lame. The Trap music cues were uncomfortably obsurd (21 Savage remixes the theme song)Overall I wouldn't recommend it but I can't say it's bad or no one will enjoy it.

By having the ""killer"" so obvious, it also pulls away from the twist that the Saw films are renowned for too. Sure, if you switch off and try not to figure it out (within the first 5 minutes or so), the pay off at the end is well done and could have been great had it been a surprise.Spiral is trying to be a Se7en style detective film but also fails at that in capturing what made Se7en so special.

Some claim to see the 'killer' before the reveal but in the end it's 'who is left ?' then the movie explains why it's that person.

223,S_dot_M_dot,Has Potential,6,23 August 2021,"Detective Zeke Banks (Chris Rock) gets partnered up with rookie Detective William Schenk (Max Minghella) when a Jigsaw copycat starts taking out cops. With a cast rounded out by Marisol Nicholas and Samuel L. Jackson, Spiral is director Darren Lynn Bousman's return to the saw franchise.This film sets itself in the same world as Jigsaw, where all the earlier films are common knowledge, yet it doesn't try to build on it. This is a good move to keep the franchise going and not get stale. The plot keeps everything contained within a small cast like earlier films and the production design will make you sweat right along with them. One of my favorite aspects of this will was the set design.When we get into the traps that the saw franchise is known for, this film takes a simple approach. The traps are creative but have the look that anyone could design them. And the new puppet used was a highlight for me.While on the subject of our killer, I was not a fan of the voice used on the tapes. Also, the franchise is known for the twist endings, and you can see this one coming from a mile away. They try to throw you off the trail, but the case solves itself.This film feels like it can't tell whether it's a thriller or a horror movie. Personally, I would have preferred if they stuck closer to a cop thriller as it has the bones to stand on it's own. The cast did a great job but Rock seemed forced at time. There were a few scenes he tries to sound serious but came off a bit comedic.Overall, Spiral is a decent effort that brought something fresh to the franchise. There are many directions the series could go in if they choose to continue. With some small adjustments, this could turn into a successful offshoot of an already successful franchise.",Spiral

232,Seb_3,"A ""funnier"" take on the Saw franchise",5,26 May 2021,"Spiral, a movie set in the same universe as the rest of the saw franchise, starts out great with a classic Saw-like trap, that pushed the series to the fan base it managed to achieve back in 2004 - The traps is what grabbed the audience back in the day and its what's grabbing the audience in 2021. The scene is tense and uses some of the key features that worked excellent in the older films, like the camera work, particularly the close zoom of the eyes and traps with the classic music being played over, everything taken to the next level.The scene afterwards keeps up the same energy and sends a great vibe from Chris Rock, whom I was not imagining this great in a franchise and movie as a Saw spinoff, but he was fairly great and had great chemistry with Samuel. L Jackson who as always delivers a fun and great performance, even with the small amount of screen time he has. Sadly though everything seemingly takes a step back after a great introduction back into the universe and with a pretty decent chemistry between Chris and Samuel. Too much exception with flash backs and scenes where they choose to tell instead of showing which just makes it boring as you as a viewer dont have to think for yourself. The most apparent of this is probably what is supposed to be the most intriguing part of the movie and the driving point for the story, the killer - the Jigsaw copycat. Whom, I think to many, will be obvious and quite apparent which is disappointing as this was supposed to be the driving factor of the movie.The story setup sadly isn't clever either and the story is told in a reacting scenario, where the characters go from one location to the next reacting to what is happening to the police as they slowly loose more and more cops. There isn't an immediate reaction and an act for action to try to find and stop this killer, instead there is a reaction from them that causes another killing somewhere else, then they move to that location, rense and repeat, just like a spiral. So you end up with a movie that becomes very one dimensional in its story telling, and not very intriguing as you already know who the copycat is at this point, now you're left waiting for that final punchline.I am glad that this take on the franchise and the direction it is seemingly heading after nine entries into the franchise exist. It takes a more ""comedic"" take, and I think it split the line between being serious and being ""funny"" Is well treated around and not really crossed at any point. This is a more lighthearted though still bloody and with intriguing traps. Even if this isn't a good or perfect film in any way, I would still like to see where they go from here. It would be nice to see them commit to this format and in the next entry get good writers and a compelling puppeteer, as the non existing acquisition of these things is what is holding new entries into the Saw franchise back from achieving the same heights as previous movies.5/10.",Spiral

It's the best looking Saw film, and it really makes you feel like your in this serious state of panic. Also the acting is surprisingly very good. Chris Rock was actually not too bad here. I didn't 100% believe him as a cold - hard cop, but he still have a good performance. The traps too are also pretty creative. And the blood is also very good. I admired how the movie tired to give time to more characters which was a nice change. And the whole concept is pretty cool.Unfortunately despite the cool concept, this movie just feels like another Saw movie. This movie still follows the same beats and doesn't do too much new. The movies pacing is way too fast. The short 90 minute runtime makes this movie feel like everything needs to move very quickly. The movie also has too many flashbacks that honestly just make the movie feel like they need exposition. Which drained some of the tension. And my final negative is that the twist was very obvious. It's a very poor twist, and halfway through something happens, and you can quickly tell who the killer is. Also the ending isn't very good. It just feels like they didn't know how to end this so they kinda just ended it like every other Saw movie.Overall despite ""Spiral"" not living up to its cool idea, and failing to provide a good twist, this is still one of the better Saw movies.

252,afrocut,Cop Tropes the movie!,4,14 May 2021,"""Spiral: from the book of Saw"" Is , for the lack of a better word, Terrible. It fails horribly on every front. It's mystery is obvious. It's scares are nonexistent. The directing is stale and generic. The acting is laughably forced and over the top. And the script, well, it's garbage. Chris Rock is a cop who the film wants us to believe is a good cop, the best cop even, so good in fact that he doesn't do anything by the rules. This includes touching evidence with bare hands, not recognizing his best friends wedding ring, watch, clothes, opening random packages delivered to the police station, plugging in random usb drives into police computers, not actually figuring out any clues and never saving anyone. He also is an over acting, one line spouting, cop movie stereotype to the point of embarrassment. He drives a muscle car, has a new partner, turned a dirty cop in, is hated by other cops, and he even has a father who was the chief of police. This is some lazy writing. It gets worse. The traps make no sense, there's no creepy puppet, there's no creepy voice... but luckily it has one thing going for it, the gore. When it's shown it's pretty good looking. It isn't enough to save this dud though. In fact, if I'm being honest, this is the worst of the franchise.",Spiral
253,miinty,I saw it for free and it was worth the price.,4,2 June 2021,"I had zero expectations with the movie.. well, I expected to be entertained and to see some traps; I saw some traps and I suppose I was entertained.. entertained-ish. I'm not sure if it's because I primarily know Chris Rock from stand up - but when he was telling his gritty stories, I feel like the ""effect"" was hitting the way it should. Also, I'm not sure why, but CB4 kept popping in my head and no really allowing me to believe him as a detective.Complaint #1: The characters where caricatures. They were like 'literal definitions' of these characters on paper.Complaint #2: Big story, small movie. I feel like the story had potential on it's own to be a movie and not tied in with Saw... but then when I think about it, there's been tons of movies like that before.I think the movie need to be longer - Delve into backstories and mysteries and beefs and make everyone a suspect and what not... don't ""tell me"" movie, ""show me.""Complaint #3: The traps were dumb. And the victims had NO TIME to complete or make their choices.. especially fingers - NO time at all. What'd he give him? 60 seconds - 90? I mean, at least Jigsaw (Based on the few saw movies I saw) gave them time to choose. (I think, who knows, maybe it was just filmed in a more suspenseful way... )Waxy - how much time did she have? 5 seconds after the tape! Also, and please keep in mind that I know NOTHING of how you would kill someone with wax - but why put the gauze there? (To protect the actor's face, probably.. But is it realistic to a killer and his trap?? Would a killer care? No.Complaint #4: The Killer. It was all very bland.I think the bobby pin joke was funny, but I don't think it landed.I did quite enjoy, ""No. I could've shot you."" I don't think anyone but Samuel L. Jackson could deliver that line :)If you can see this for under $5, you should, just to see it - but don't go changing any plans or anything and don't go in expecting a saw movie.",Spiral
254,jbathie,Watch paint dry instead.,2,21 June 2021,"I've watched every movie in the Saw franchise. I can't help it, I love the blood and gore of it all.This however, was by far the worst of the series. Sure, it's the 9th in the series and many would have difficulty making this work, but this is a special kind of 'worst of the series'.Why it's the worst isn't what you might think though. It's not the storyline, it's not the staged 'torture for truth' gore scenes. They were fine.Why? Because someone decided to cast Chris Rock as the lead. I love his previous work as a standup comedian, a recent season of Fargo, and several small bits in movies that were held high with established actors who've mastered dramatic roles. Chris isn't one of them.After the 1st scene where Chris is required to act as though he's now thrust into this new case, a time wherein he should sell his anger and contempt just trough a facial expression? Then he falls flat and looks somewhat like he's trying to squeeze one out on the toilet.In Fargo Chris played the protagonist rather well. Something I was surprised he was capable of pulling off. But this role just escaped him.Don't watch this, but know that I took one for the team just so I could advise you on how bad it was.",Spiral

261,ryanwesthamfan,Nice Addition To The Saw Films,7,24 May 2021,"The Good- Firstly, I really enjoyed the mystery element of this film, not really knowing what's going on or who is behind everything that's happening, that really intrigued me. I also thought that the film found very clever ways to show of the traps and situations that our characters are in. Chris Rock was very entertaining to watch in the main role, I didn't think I would enjoy seeing him as a detective but he really surprised me.The Mixed- Now Samuel L Jackson's character is very important to the film and script and he is connected to everything, however he doesn't have lots of screen time. If you are expecting lots from him, you'll probably be disappointed.The Bad- Straightaway we have seen these types of characters and films before, the rogue detective and charismatic villain has all been done before. Finally I thought the final twist was fairly predictable. There was one scene where the film was basically telling you what the final twist was going to be and that sort of cheapened the moment for me.Overall I'm going to give Spiral: From The Book Of Saw a 7/10.",Spiral

I sort of enjoyed this film. It's along the lines of Seven, but not as good. My main criticism was that it seemed entirely miscast to me. Chris Rock should never play another cop (although his thoughts on Forest Gump were funny). Samuel Jackson should never play another Chief of Police. If they were real, I'd be joining in the Defund the Police crusade. I can only think that BLM actually wrote this awful depiction of cops.

The traps are unwinnable, like the guy still got electrocuted even though he opted to have his fingers ripped off. The reveal on the killer is almost too obvious.

267,malice_o_conner,An attempt was made,5,18 June 2021,"After watching Jigsaw I didn't want to attempt another Saw series franchise but the only redeeming quality of this film was that it was better than Jigsaw was. However, not by much. The acting was not there, I didn't believe a single character or their background history. Hell, half of it doesn't even make sense for anyone to do, but they do it anyways.While the ""saw scenes"" are very reminiscent of the original movie series, it failed in it's understanding and in it's actual simplicity, it was more about profound gore/violence than the actual ""game"" that was being played. The whole thing missed the mark of the Saw series in fundamental ways. (Again, not as bad as Jigsaw did.)
The hallmark of the Saw series wasn't about the strange and awful contraptions, it wasn't about the gore, it was all about the game. And so far the only one to have portrayed the accuracy of that magic behind the original series was John Kramer (Tobin Bell). Everyone else plays their own twisted version of it, but the magic that was the actual movie is all dependent on the vision of Kramer. He believed in redemption, he just knew that most would fail to live up to it. That's what the original had, and these knock-offs don't. Doesn't matter if it's Amanda, or some newbie from no-where. John Kramer is and will always be the only Jigsaw.",Spiral

291,MsHoneyBee,"Ugh, where do I begin...",5,5 July 2021,"Lot's of spoilers here. I am a huge fan of Saw and I shelled out $20 to see this at home... I knew what I was getting into but I HAD to see this, just to know what it's like and if it was even possible to pull off a comedian led Saw film.The answer is no... Unfortunately, I have many complaints.This film is full of false drama. They give the lead on this case to a detective who wasn't first on scene just to create false drama, also, ""this could be a bomb"". Really? Cause that's just how jigsaw rolls right?This film is full of tropes starting with the loner detective and ending with the corrupt chief of police.This movie had highly predictable order of deaths. The first idiot to wonder off... dead. No one escapes.In the midst of my complaints, I will say I liked the traps. I loved the glass slinging one, simple yet effective. I think some people complained about the traps because they were so simple this time. Getting hung by your tongue and hit by a train, simple. Electrocuted, simple. Hot wax burns, simple. Drained of blood, simple and was kinda done before in another Saw film... but, they were still cool to me. I was wondering if the traps were actually being set up to kill the cops no matter what, which we've seen before, but I don't care to understand...Man, I have never seen more stupid cops. Cops doing things alone is a trope that I can't tolerate. As much of a brotherhood as cops run in, why do they pretend they like to do stuff alone in movies? I'm not a cop so I don't know for sure but I feel like back up is a high priority. Also, at the end... This man is tied to the ceiling, hanging from his limbs and SWAT pulls their weapons on him?? I must admit that rig was pretty smart with the guns, this knock off Jigsaw did a good job predicting the cops movements, but those SWAT officers literally just filled Sam Jackson's character full of lead without taking any assessment of the scene. They literally could have stepped to the side and been safe.I'm all for women being in charge but the lady in charge was not believable. She had no command over those men and she made dumb decisions left and right which then created more false drama. Like why even make that choice, knowing it's going to irritate people, just to be like never mind, change of plans. Also, when she's down in the basement with the killer, she pulls her gun when she sees the killer but doesn't shoot him?? And random thought... why the hell was the cold case room literally in a safe? Of all the rooms to be THAT secure...I was bothered from the beginning because so many cops could have been saved but everyone was so bumbling and moronic. The second spiral shows up in the morning and no one is curious about the missing detective? He's been missing since the night before so where was his partner who knew where he was going and knew the risk? They could have found him in the trap had she been a real partner and had this guys back.OMG, there was a HEAVY reliance on sound effects. I could barely hear the dialogue but when that pig person came out... ear splitting sounds for jump scares. So annoying.I predicted the killer pretty early on. What gave it away was Schenk's apartment. To me, it didn't look like a family home, much more like a bachelor pad. AND unfortunately the guy playing him didn't make me feel the same terror as the other copy cats in the series... he wasn't intimidating at all, he has an impressive resume as an actor but he just didn't have the swagger that a Jigsaw copy cat always seemed to have. He was just begging through the whole end of the movie for Zeke to be his friend. Are you gonna trust me??? Are you gonna work with me? Yuck, shut up.On the other hand, his reasoning for the murders align with the series. Avenging his fathers death and being a fan boy for Zeke, who did the right thing by turning in his partner, held true to the standard of the movie, but at the end I wasn't sure if he was really a fan of Zeke or not. Seemed like he was trying to punish him or didn't trust him? It was cute that he shushed him at the end though, like Zeke did to him as a child. Tied that up with a neat little bow...And man, that ending... longest 4 minutes ever, SWAT moving so slow. I am so glad it was only an hour and a half long movie.Now, all and all, I didn't hate it, but it was clumsy in every way. I don't think casting was great. It seemed more like good friends got the parts as opposed to the right person for the job. Even Chris Rock was not ideal. His dramatic skills are just too steeped in his goofy gestures and jokey nature. Then the lady chief was terrible. She would have only made it in that office if she was sleeping with the old chief, which she may have been... then the Jigsaw copy cat, he was just a pansy, not tough enough to fill the shoes and not convincing at all.I am going to watch this film again because I want to really take in the details, my family was interrupting, but I think that will only bolster my points.I would recommend this to anyone who's seen Saw so they can know what this was about, but anyone new to the franchise.... no. This movie is not a good representation of Saw or the Book of Saw, whatever that may come to be...",Spiral

Not with this one though.I felt like there was something big missing in this movie, plot-wise. Chris Rock was fine as the lead, but not great. And the protagonist was kind of random in my opinion. Even his masked voice throughout the movie was kind of weird I think, it wasn't intimidating or scary at all. I just feel like the whole story didn´t add up so good altogether.

The script could've used pretty much a complete overhaul. The dialogue consisted of continuous screaming and cussing for no apparent reason. The camera work was pretty chaotic, I think he used too much shaky cam and maintained a tone that made the movie unenjoyable. You could tell the movie was high budget due to the quality of its set pieces and effects, not to mention the two A list actors. The funny thing is, I think that they were both miscast. I'm sorry, but Chris Rock in this type of movie just didn't do it for me. He was whiny, angry, and his performance lacked the depth I was expecting. As for Samuel L. Jackson, I've never been a big fan of the majority of his performances (Except for Pulp Fiction of course). The kills were pretty inventive, with plenty of gore as Saw fans have come to expect. I probably won't ever watch this movie again, but it was fun being in the theatre. Overall, I'd say it's one of the weakest entries in the franchise.",Spiral

While that stuff did play a role in the story, it is easily the worst part of the Saw movies and yet it was done significantly better in the other ones.

Can't verbalize how disappointed I am now that I've seen it.Each and every overused cop movie trope and cliche was used. Some more than once. Chris Rock had one expression the entire movie, which was a confused/angry/squinty grimace. Unfortunately, his acting left a lot to be desired, and I half expected him to break into a comic bit. His precinct associates were overblown stereotypes. Way too many instances of ""that wouldn't ever happen that way"" that I could not ""suspend disbelief"" for very long.The supposed connection to the actions of Jigsaw was so loose that I'm pretty sure you could remove that aspect of the story and it wouldn't make a difference at all.Not to mention you could figure the identity of the perpetrator from a mile away despite the dozens of red herrings thrown around, and the traps set didn't hold a candle to the earlier movies.Best part of the experience was getting back into a real theater, but finding a movie funny that is supposed to be scary and suspenseful was definitely a downer.",Spiral

This was a respectful sequel to what came before, with plenty of nods fans can appreciate while making this its own. I mean... should it win the best picture of the year? Well, let's not get carried away now! But I think Chris Rock killed it in this serious role against typecasting. I definitely l appreciated the writer's decision to focus more on the detective's work rather than given the gory scenes an abundance of screen time. Oh, and yes, it features a cliche twist at the end, but at least it was a decent and believable one!Filmed and edited with elegance and lit with an eerie beauty that any film enthusiast could appreciate. Saw II, III & IV OG Darren Lynn Bousman also returns to direct and ensures the film remains grounded in the same universe. Spiral also features a solid mix of veteran actors that help crank up the believability of it all, along with a solid soundtrack so that never hurts!Don't get me wrong. I understand that for a Saw movie to be... well, a Saw movie, it has to rely on demented yet creative traps that have you sticking to the edge of your seat as you keep looking away and hoping they'll find a way to escape. But after its intelligent beginnings, chapters 1-3, this series quickly spiralled down into nothing more than a gore fest lacking substance. But Spiral finally injects some life into the Jigsaw universe that died a long time ago.Spiral might not please gorehounds hoping for a film that ups the ante of the over-the-top gruesome traps of earlier installments. It might also bum out die-hard horror genre fans of its lack of scares, but as a bloody and dark cop thriller, I think it was a breath of fresh air when comparing to most of the garbage that's coming out these days. As I said, this might not win picture of the year, but it certainly doesn't deserve the hate it's receiving. But don't take my word for it! Watch it and make your own decisions if you feel this was a flop or a bloody good time!PS: Did I mention Samual L. Jackson in this, and he drops f-bombs? That's always a win in my book!",Spiral

I think it's topical, and in different hands it could have sent a really powerful message - but unfortunately this movie ultimately falls flat.I think the biggest problem with this movie is that it's just too short. It's just over 90 minutes, and could have thoroughly benefitted from another 20 or 30 minutes to flesh out the characters more and build to the finale better. It honestly feels like a book adaptation, where you can tell that things are missing but they trimmed the story to the bone to fit it into a movie. It also has just about the most predictable twist I've ever seen.In reading other reviews, I think your enjoyment of this movie will largely come down to Chris Rock. I didn't hate him, but I definitely don't think he was the right person for the role. Some of his dialogue is delivered pretty poorly but for the most part he's watchable. Everyone else ranges from fine to iffy. Like the other Saw movies, this definitely won't win any awards for its acting.Do I regret watching the movie? No. Will I ever watch it again?

One of which is the grungy, deep, coldly authoritative voice of Jigsaw, when I heard the soft, lame, childish voice of the Jigsaw new copycat I almost vomitted! WTF is this amateur!Chris Rock was trying to play the dark (character, not skin), complex, hard ass yet puriterian cop, just trying! His performance was a turn off from moment zero, but I decided to give it a try, until Max Minghella showed up, this is when the movie really went downhill on a skateboard!Max's performance was so bad and ruined everything that might be ""good"" in the movie!

I didn't think this would be really bad or really amazing. It's just what I'd thought it would be, like any other Saw movie. Gory traps, killer revealed, constant flashbacks, predictable story. Ya know, the same ole, same ole.Chris Rock is not too bad in this. Although there are moments where I thought his acting was just stale, plain. I don't know, like he was trying too hard to be serious at some moments and I couldn't help but just smirk and chuckle a little. Doesn't mean he did a terrible job throughout the whole movie. He does manage to carry it as the film does progress. At the same time, I do really wish I could've seen someone else play this role. Maybe Denzel Washington, Will Smith or possibly Daniel Kaluuya from Get Out. One of these three would've done an amazing job. Again, love Chris Rock, but he's 50% bad and 50% good in this.Samuel L Jackson on the other hand. Don't get me wrong, he's great in a lot of movies and I like watching him, but this movie just wasn't for him. It just didn't suit him well at all. I really didn't care about his character. He was just being himself rather than stepping into another persons shoes. Just no.The story is predictable. That's basically one of my main problems with this. I wasn't surprised or pulled in. I wish I could've been guessing what was going to happen most of the time. But you already know and that's not as fun.The traps are great! However one of them I thought was really lame and you'll find out which one that is. They always do a great job with gore and making it look grisly as possible.Do I think Spiral is a bad movie? Of course not. It's kind of entertaining and interesting for what it is on its own aside from all the other Saws. But I do think there needs to be tiny improvements. Go check it out for yourself.

330,CinderFall,I have thoughts.,6,12 June 2021,"OK so I just want to preface this review by saying that I'm not a huge Saw fan. I really like some of the movies but I wouldn't say I'm a huge fan of the franchise. I would also like to say that I'm glad the Demon Slayer movie was my first film back to cinemas or else I would've been underwhelmed.Now. I want to start with my biggest problems with the movie being the traps themselves. They're not winnable. Even if you do fulfill the requested action, it's nigh impossible to successfully beat the trap. Because they're not winnable, my enjoyment for the movie as a whole dropped dramatically.Next, I've seen a lot of people talk about Chris Rock's acting in this. I think he did a fairly good job at the position but I think the biggest issue there was the fact that the script borders on garbage at times. There were a few scenes that felt impactful but for the most part it was bleh. I don't blame Rock for a less than stellar performance, I blame the script.Speaking of script, this one is super predictable. You can tell who the killer is well before the final act even begins. The thing that seals the deal is when we see the ""skinning trap"" or the lack-thereof with the WORST reasoning to have someone in a trap. Not only that but we didn't see him in it which was a huge reveal.And here's the detriment of this movie. It falls apart when you start to think about it in-depth. I'd been so mad about this movie for the past few weeks that I've been ranting to my family about it. I'm sure they're tired of hearing about it but I'm not OK.As a movie in the Saw franchise, this one is massively OK. I put it below Saw IV and above Saw VII but that is such a low bar to cover. Saw VII is a waste of film reel. Should you watch this? If you really like Saw movies, it might be best to avoid this one. If you are OK with Saw movies, you might enjoy this one a little more.If this movie is a 5.3/10 then Saw VII is definitely in the 4s because that movie is a mess and just awful. I'm putting this as a 6 because of the potential and the enjoyment I had but it's closer to a 5.5/10. I rounded up.",Spiral

He's not a tattoo artist and would have had horrible skills to do it but instead the tattoo is perfectHow does Schenk have access to such elaborate materials for the finger trap and the tongue trap?How is Schenk able to construct an elaborate trap in the cold case room where he'd need boiling hot wax to be dropped on a body? How did he get access to those things and how did he get it down to the cold case room unnoticed?For the bottle shooting trap, you can simply knock away all the bottles and they won't get crushed and shoot at PeteHow is Schenk who presumably has no prior surgical knowledge, able to set up the tongue trap as well as the finger trap AND cut the skin with surgical precision?The severed body parts are delivered through a courier. The first time they receive the tongue, it should have raised a red flag for the courier company. The next time, if the same guy (presumably Schenk) is getting it couriered in the same type of box, the courier company would open it and find the fingers leading to an immediate arrest.They never bother contacting the courier company for the details of WHO has sent the packages. Had they contacted the company, it would have led to them checking CCTV footage or getting a sender's address atleastThey never run prints on the bodies/body parts. With the current technology being used, they would have managed to find a trace of Schenk's DNAA quick DNA test on ""Schenk's' body would have also revealed that it wasn't SchenkSchenk isn't a mechanic or expert engineer to be able to design an elaborate pulley system that falls to the floor when a target is shot but lifts a body back up when a sensor is triggered nor is he a doctor to understand how to get needles inserted in Zeke's father's body to drain bloodAt the end of the movie, although Zeke's father is dead, Zeke himself is alive and now knows who the killer is and can most likely put an end to Schenk.",Spiral

Most of the characters are also purely obnoxious to the level that nobody cares about them if they die or not. That's not good for a movie. There must be likeble characters, it creates a stronger feeling and the viewer makes a bond. The plot is like from a B movie, the execution is a little more than that but it never goes above mediocre. The dialogs are a mix of random talks, cliches and unnecessary jokes.

The latter turned out to be true however this movie, although it felt like Saw, it had a lot of wasted potential. Chris Rock and Samuel L. Jackson gave great performances but their father and son relationship in the movie is noticeably absent. While the cinematography is excellent, the characters stories weren't. I only found myself caring about Zeke Chris Rock's character) and his partner's (dude from Handmaid's Tale) arc which is somewhat of a problem when the movie doesn't have as many traps as previous movies. All the traps on display were cool but there could've been more. In classic Saw fashion we get flashbacks, some worked while others felt like a cheap way to explain certain events that shaped our characters. Spiral felt a little bit different compared to other Saw movies in the sense that it was more story driven and less about the traps but sadly the story/twists. Unfortunately it had many similar issues too. The killer's reveal became apparent earlier than you would hope and the connection to John Kramer/Jigsaw may disappoint a ton of fans especially when you consider the setup and marketing of the movie. The ending felt abrupt, anticlimactic, and more nonsensical than other Saw movies. However it was an enjoyable watch if you can look past Spiral's flaws.",Spiral

Spiral has pretty good acting, traps, visual work, and comedic relief. The only minus's I have is that it can get a little corny and the twist is a bit obvious, and you might be asking how would that make it a 6.5 out of 10.

1) All the characters that took Jigsaw's mission were tested. This one didn't
2) All the idea was give mercy and the chance to change your life. This tests were too fast, they were more motivated by revenge and with few time to solve them (this two things are part of the book of the gospel of Kramer)
3) The time was messed up in the movie, changing from past to present randomly, or at least, I felt that way
4) The story was so well done using the James Wan formula that if you are a fan of the original saga, you may find the new Jigsaw copycatBy the way, I liked the character of Zeke.

Just because the lead actor is Chris Rock doesn't necessarily mean that the movie is guaranteed to suck.I've been a fan of the entire series, and I enjoyed the Jigsaw continuation as well. What you need to keep in mind is this: Spiral is NOT Saw. The culprit this time is not Jigsaw himself; he has his own way of exacting justice. So he is not going to do things the same way Jigsaw would have.I for one like how this signals the return of the Saw franchise.

I felt a little disappointed, and then I forgot about it. This movie has some great ideas in where the franchise should go, and the performances from Chris Rock and Samuel L Jackson where great. The traps were pretty good as well, albeit, not as good as the best saw movies. My biggest problem is the story. From the first half hour I was able to tell exactly where it was going to go. There were no surprises in this movie whatsoever, and the twist ending was the worst out of the entire franchise. If your not a fan of the saw movies, this one won't sway you.

A whole new spinoff from the originals.Chris Rock was fantastic and I did laugh unironically, but that's not why I went to see this. I REALLY did not want to go to theaters, but as a ride or die-type fan, I wanted to support the filmmakers and I was genuinely excited for this. It was predictable. It wasn't a horror movie. I wasn't attached to many of the characters cause there was no real character development with the exception of Chris Rock's character. I don't understand how this is being rated so well, everyone in the theater seemed disappointed.I guess my final thought are that I wish I would've just waited for it to be on VOD and watched it from the comfort of my own bed - I would've enjoyed it more and my expectations would've been lower. Forcing us to go to the theaters to see it seemed to subliminally overhype it, at least in my opinion. And don't go in thinking this is gonna be like ANY of the other Saw movies cause it's just.. not. At all.

372,CronenbergsMonster,Wasted Potential,5,26 July 2021,"I'll start this review off by saying that I am not a Saw fan. I gave up halfway through the 3rd film and never looked back. And honestly, given the fact that even fans admit they're mostly in it just for the death traps and the actual plots of these films are irrelevant, I don't feel like I've missed much.What intrigued me about this film were two things: the prospects of seeing Chris Rock, a legendary comedian, take on a serious role - and the idea of the Saw franchise taking a turn towards a more serious, Se7en-esque premise.It turns out that the whole thing was pretty much a dud. The direction is erratic, with quick cuts and ADHD editing, and the color palette of the whole film is nauseating. The plot moves at such a break-neck speed that we never get to actually sit with any of the characters and understand them beyond a surface level.The acting is sub-par. I could tell Chris Rock was really trying, but he just wasn't convincing as a no-nonsense detective. The rest of the actors, especially Samuel L. Jackson, seemed to just be phoning it in.The biggest sin of all, and this seems to be a sentiment shared by even hardcore Saw fans, is that the traps are lame. There was maybe ONE (involving the ripping of fingers) that was actually gruesomely compelling and creative.Mostly I'm just bummed that this wasn't as cool as it could've been. I've always liked the premise behind the series; a killer passing violent moral judgement on victims, yet still offering them a chance for some sort of ""redemption."" If this film had really taken the time to set the tone properly, flesh out characters properly, and shy away from some of the series' gimmicky hallmarks (the speed-up cam during trap scenes has always been obnoxious to me) this could have been a cool soft reboot for the series.

It's like each time they make a Saw movie, they torture the original series, 1-2-3. If Leigh Whannell and/or James Wan won't return for the series, just don't make anymore sequels/reboots, please!

To truly enjoy this movie you must be a legitimate Saw Movie Fan, if anything else then you're definitely not it and will probably go on claiming how horrible it is when that's actually not the case and the movie is actually really bloody fantastic in reality. I believe a lot of movie fanatics get complacent and therefore start to nitpick every aspect of a movie when they find or see something wrong and that's just wrong on every level, you're forgetting the whole point and idea of it which is to enjoy someone's art and someone's tall tale visually. The real one reason this movie falls a little short is because the saw voice for Spiral was definitely terrible, felt last minute, and didn't make much sense, kinda ruining the movie a bit dragging you out of the story that is supposed to draw you in but at the end of the day it's still another movie and that''s what they chose to go with so it was tolerable. I think it would have been better if they retained the original or tweaked it somewhat to live on with the actual Saw Legacy moreso as such. It just really doesn't go with the movie as good in my opinion. I loved all of the saw movies and I feel this strongly makes a good addition to the series and as I've said before I would watch 10 more saw movies without a hitch and I'm very sure each and everyone of them in my own opinion will be amazing.

380,rnpauls,"Similar to the rest of them, but it's nice that they're trying something new",6,16 May 2021,"I'm just going to state some differences between this and early SAW.-Focus on cop drama instead of elaborate traps-You won't be rooting for the people to escape the traps-More comedic relief, some of which is actually pretty funny-New villain is kind of lame-Production quality is way betterWhat's the same:-people constantly being easily captured, not being cautious even though they know they are SPECIFICALLY being targeted-Traps are still pretty cool, although very short-overly dramatic during traps-jump scares are only jarring because of loud noises, which don't actually exist to the characters. Just added in for the audience. Lots of pigs mask showing up and a loud pig squeal which isn't actually there-villains master plan is only made possible through a series of unbelievable/convenient events, but of course that was their plan all alongOverall, if you want to watch a saw movie you can't go wrong with this, although there is a lot less emphasis on the parts where people wake up in traps. The focus is on the detective work. There are plenty of elaborate killing contraptions, but you will find you don't care much about the people that are subjected to them, and the scenes are quite simple, going quickly from ""oh god how did i get here"" to them dying or escaping.

I come from a place of real admiration for the series so far though we all know Saw 3D and Saw V were real horrible.Anyway I was overall disappointed with this film overall. The big positive for me are the traps... and if I ranked them they would probably be in the order they appear in the film - from the first one being the best and the last one being the worst. I don't know if that is generally the order they were striving for but it is a high point of the film. Mostly creative, satisfyingly shot and specific to the characters being tested. The intensity is also turned up for me to 11 throughout the film.. especially being a Saw film. You're on the edge of your seat because you know the type of stuff you are in for in these films. Ultimately I was disappointed in what we got out of it... but I was engaged throughout. I have less of an issue with the acting than most people. The acting in the traps is on point, Chris Rock was a solid enough protagonist and the ensemble cast is adequate.I posed the following question to the person I saw the film with and I will to you .. if you took out the traps, you took out the Saw lore.. would you still have a good movie? My answer is an absolute ""No."" It is at best a police drama you would find on cable like NYPD BlueX A combination of poor dialogue, pacing concerns and an predictable ending has me believing without the ""Saw"" name this movie would never have gotten made. The characters outside of the main 4 in the billing are completely one sided and cardboard.

Helmed by Darren Lynn Bousman once again, bringing us the gritty style that made the previous entries so unique, plus an engaging lead performance from Chris Rock, make this film a great companion piece to its predecessors. Story is fresh, kept me guessing and is very, very dark. It was a thrill to see another Saw film and I'm looking forward to more! In 'Spiral' the ""Saw twist"" was well conceived and the killer's motive is intriguing because it revolves around a few themes, mainly that of making sacrifices.

The only thing is, the story is very bare bones and is very predictable all the way around. So it does have enjoyable moments, but at times feels lacking.In a story driven movie, they could have done a lot more developing the STORY.

Unfortunately neither Wan nor director Bousman are on the same level with Nolan.Then, the joker (well, comedian per se) came in. Please note that Chris Rock is one of the executive producers (so does Wan) of SPIRAL (2021). It means Rock was not picked up by casting official, but he chose to be the leading man hence this movie got made. A lifetime joker/comedian decides to take on the challenge playing a serious role resembles dark knight in a brutal crime/horror thriller. I added one more star to my rating because Rock, out of his comfort zone, has tried to be an ACTOR, although the result is not very satisfactory.Much criticism on internet about this movie is on plot, acting and directing, even music.

These are my thoughts of spiral from the book of saw I thought it was a really good film and I thought it didn't have to rely on the past films too much but it had a few good references to the other films. I like that it did it's own thing. I really loved to characters especially Chris rocks character. He could be emotional he could be funny and that really made me relate to his character. I loved all the twists and turns. They really had me guessing who the new jigsaw was. Ian's the reveal was great I wasn't expecting it at all. I liked the traps in this one more than a lot of the other films I kinda wished there were more. The gore was not over the top but there was a lot of it. The ending set up for a sequel and I hope there is going to be one. I could nitpick and find some faults but there wasn't really that many. So I'm going to give spiral from the book of saw a 8.5/10.",Spiral

394,jpq-89332,6/3/21 - Avid Saw Fan,6,4 June 2021,"Before I begin I must say that Saw is one of my favorite movie series. So I am a little biased with this review.Cons: doesn't follow previous Saw films (direction, traps, plot), the pacing is off, the twist is not as clearly hidden as the directors might've thought it was, the voices were a little distorted.Pros: there's tons of avenues for the series to continue in now, Samuel Jackson was great, it is politically relevant, the storyline while not being Saw is able to stand on its own.Overall: the movie would've been a lot more enjoyable if they just labeled it Spiral. When you mention Saw people get a particular thought in mind. They look for little details, they're looking for John Kramer or his disciples, they're looking for gore and sadistic traps; however, this is what you expect from Saw. This movie should be treated as it's own standalone film and I think the ratings would've been better overall. It would get a higher rating for opening the Saw franchise back up but I'm interested to see where this new direction will take it.",Spiral

They quickly find themselves in a bloodbath mess as more cops get killed by the minute. The clock is ticking and they need to find the identity of the killer before its too late.As a huge fan of the saw series, I must admit spiral was a pleasant surprise for me. Chris Rock does a fantastic job as the damaged detective even though i am not a fan of his high pitched voice. The movie has the same premise as the saw movies and bares a huge resemblance to the first one. I can't say that it will blow your mind but it will entertain you. The murders are quite gruesome and some traps are brutally clever. The only low point for me is that is very predictable since you can find who the killer without too much effort because the hints were not subtle. Overall if you loved the saw movies then you will like spiral.",Spiral

I gave them a 30 sec brief on what it is about before going into the theatres and they loved it. The comedy chris rock brought to the screen fit well with the tone of the film. It could have been better but entertaining. Felt the traps sequences were short and not as elaborate like previous films but still made me squirm and gasp.

Before the film, I was not truly convinced I could take Chris Rock seriously in a role like this, but I think he did a great job! He was still funny but when he had to be serious he did that well, too. He had great chemistry with Sam Jackson and as far as the traps, I didn't think they were any better or worse than the other films in the series. In fact, the plot was a bit more developed in this one than most so it made the traps more exciting. (Is exciting the right word? Idk) Anyway, well worth a visit to your local theater to keep those guys in business. I would waste $20 on a home rental cause that's just silly.",Spiral

405,kyleherbertz,Best SAW film since the original,10,15 May 2021,"FINALLY!!! Something new & different!!!!I've been a fan of the SAW franchise ever since seeing the first film back in 8th grade. And as each passing year brought a new film, I continued watching them, even though the quality of the films dropped off considerably after the 3rd film. After that, the films ended up being all the same: random people we don't care about trying to survive the crazy traps set up by Jigsaw, while also following the side plot of Jigsaw's partner(s) who decided to continue his work because they believed so much in his cause (ummm.....sure, whatever). Honestly, the only interesting part about films 4-8 were the crazy traps set up for the victims to try & get out of. The fact that the filmmakers were able to come up with so many creative & crazy traps in such a short period of time, since a new film was released every year, was very impressive. I just wish they'd spent a little more time developing an interesting storyline, but hey, we can't get everything we want I guess. But after that HORRIBLE Jigsaw film that came out a couple years ago, I was ready to give up on this series, it had jumped the shark so far to the point where it wasn't believable at all anymore.So when I saw the plot of this new film, a Jigsaw copycat targeting dirty cops, THAT intrigued me. Even though it's slightly recycling the plot of the 2nd film where Detective Eric Matthews was put through a test for being a dirty cop, but so what. I don't really care if storylines are recycled as long as the film is good, AND THIS FILM WAS AWESOME!!! I'm so happy they deviated from the plot repetition of having the traps/murders be carried out by John Kramer or one of his partners. This film centers around a Jigsaw copycat, someone with no connection to Jigsaw but who is using his methods & techniques to shine light on the issue of police corruption. And while some may be uncomfortable with the political undertones of the film regarding police reform, remember that SAW 6 was centered around our crappy US healthcare system when Jigsaw put an evil, careless health insurance CEO through a series of brutal tests, so it's not like the SAW films haven't had a political message in the past.In SPIRAL, Chris Rock plays the lead detective on the case, who the entire police department hates because he reported his former partner for murdering a witness without justification. So the entire police force sees him as a rat. So he has to track down the Jigsaw copycat who is targeting & killing his colleagues, while getting almost no help from his colleagues because they have no respect for him. Chris Rock strikes a very delicate balance of being funny in certain scenes, but not being too over the top to the point where the scary moments don't have an impact. This is a very difficult thing for a comedic actor to accomplish and he does it very well. Sam L Jackson plays his father, a retired police captain who was responsible for a lot of the corruption in the police department. Honestly, Sam L Jackson is just being Sam L Jackson, no different than anything else we've seen from him a million times at this point.This film keeps you on the edge of your seat the entire time. Definitely the best SAW film since the original. It's funny, it's suspenseful, it's bloody, the traps are awesome & creative. It has all the familiar elements of the previous SAW films, while also feeling fresh & original. Definitely a sequel/spin-off worthy of your time!I WANT TO PLAY A GAME!! Sorry, I had to do it LOL.",Spiral

It was my first time watching him in a serious role and he couldn't do it. This completely spoiled the intense scenes and you would half expect a punch line.I would not get into the script and direction as both were awful and not worth spending time on.If you are a Saw fan, just remember those few bad ones in the series and avoid this one if you can.Finally I am downgrading my review from 2 to one star because of what they did to the killers voice.

409,avadams,Adds nothing to the Saw franchise...,4,6 June 2021,"Two things that don't belong in a Saw movie? Chris Rock and rap/hip-hop music. This movie has pacing issues, an over-reliance on jump cuts that are mistaken for being stylish, poor casting choices and a lack of any redeeming characters. You know what you're getting with a Saw movie (even the 'bad' ones), but at least the meta-narrative is fairly consistent. This movie wants to be much more than it is and it doesn't work. It's like taking ""Se7en"" and adding pratfalls to the mix.And it has that wonderful murky yellowish-orange color palette for the scenes that aren't already poorly lit. As formulaic, maybe pretentious as the other films were, they still had more to offer than an obvious live/die red herring. They could have just saved the money that they paid Chris Rock and the other planks of wood in this movie, resurrected any one of the past survivors in the franchise and paid Tobin Bell to do some voiceovers.",Spiral

Are there any sane producers that thought: ""yes, casting a guy renown for comedy is a splendid idea."" Is it the connected Hollywood machine rearing its ugly head? It's hard to take the actor serious, despite him trying very hard. Even bolstered with comedic script lines. The real comedy is that Saw of all franchises is greedy enough to do stunts like that. Using the original saw music and homage does not do anything. The Emperor's New Clothes come to mind.

Rock is unconvincing as a 'tough' cop. Flashbacks are done by just adding facial hair to the actors. And the flashbacks are largely pointless.

417,scragglywags101,Go In With an Open Mind...,8,14 May 2021,"Let's be clear, this is NOT the Saw of old. The torture scenes take a backseat to the police procedurals in this one; there's maybe 5 minutes worth of trap scenes and nothing is terribly bloody. Chris Rock actually did a really good job in this role. I think the trailer made it seem like he was overacting the whole time, but that wasn't the case. It was funny at times, but also a decent mystery. It was more of a slow burn that culminated into an epic finale. The final 10 minutes were super intense and exactly what you would expect from a Saw movie. Sure, you'll probably know who the killer is by the halfway point, but I don't think that's the only twist. There's so much more going on here that will be explained in future movies.**SPOILERS** like when the wife of the first cop that was killed said that there was a black SUV sitting outside of their house before he was abducted. And then when Rock goes to the church to investigate that one dude there's the black SUV sitting out front when they get in their car. I'm going to see it again to check out more things that I missed, but I think there are lots in motion that this first movie wasn't able to touch up on. And the only real problem I had was that the traps were more based on revenge than redemption. Go see it, but know that it's a different beast this time. It's a whole new story and you won't see any old characters return. For the best. I mean, Kramer's been dead since 2006, let it go and move on. Bring on the next 10!",Spiral
418,Rclarke115,A New Chapter Begins...,9,3 June 2021,"After a long, long, long wait, the newest installment in the ever growing Saw franchise is finally here. After 2017's Jigsaw revived the series, bringing it back to it's roots, and earning the usual $100 million milestone as usual, there's no question that the story won't continue. Unexpectedly though, a new story was pitched to the studio by none other than famous comedian; Chris Rock. After the story was pitched, everything quickly came into motion.On an even more unexpected note, the film casted all around acting all star; Samuel L. Jackson. At this point, this makes it seem like it'll bring the franchise to a newer height in mainstream. After a long delay due to *obvious* reasons, the movie is finally here.The story is rather really easy to follow and piece together. While it doesn't exactly pick up where Jigsaw left off, it does indeed take place in the same universe as that film and the original 7 films that came before. It doesn't reference the prior films events and characters in every scene the film includes, but the story is simple and engaging enough that I'm sure even long time fans of the series would find something to appreciate in it.Surprisingly, in terms of acting, I believe this entry is where the acting's at it's best. Chris Rock does a stellar job as his character; Ezekiel ""Zeke"" Banks. He's interesting, entertaining and in a sense, pretty sympathetic. I actually felt his character's struggle when things go from bad to very bad.Every character was interesting in this one. Max Minghella as William Schenk, Samuel L. Jackson as Zeke's father, Marcus Banks, Marisol Nichols as Capt. Angie Garza. Everyone played their character to the best of their strengths in my opinion.What I admire most about this movie is it's cinematography and editing. For a horror movie, this one is very pleasing to the eye. It takes Jigsaw's beautiful shot composition and lighting methods and combines it with the classic Saw style of filming where a trap sequence occasionally has a sped up sequence where it showcases how gnarly and twisted the scenario is. That right there is best of both worlds.In conclusion, Spiral does a better job than Jigsaw when it came to breathing new life into the series. While I do like Jigsaw, I came to grow more interested in Spiral and the story it's trying to tell. I really hope Spiral 2 gets made in the future along with a direct follow-up to Jigsaw. In my opinion, the future of this franchise is looking pretty bright with the amount of directions it can go.Rating: 9.2/10.",Spiral

He was not believable in ANY of the scenes. I heard this went ahead cause he's a fan so he directed/produced (?) it. Solid proof money/status can really buy you anything because this was like watching something college students made for a project. The script was also AWFUL, no one talks like that.

Because if he would try to do so he would find out Schenk doesn't have a wife.Or the whole nobody notices their police chief is missing, or basically anything else (like someone hacking security footage or setting up a murder room? ) because ONE cop got a minor knife wound on a street corner...What I love about the Saw franchise (and yes even the bad ones) was that the ending was a total plot twist.Sadly this one was so obvious it ruined the whole second half.They tried to do this cheap imitation of it by doing flashbacks to things Schenk said but it didn't make me go ""Ooooooh!!"" because it all seemed obvious...I'm giving it a 5 because I really do like Chris Rock and it was nice to see him act again.",Spiral

434,thefoxzzwlgames,a good continuation of the cult franchise,8,4 June 2021,"The ninth Saw was very pleased in comparison with the last part, here the plot is much more interesting
and there is no idiotic understatement. The narrative itself is built very competently and the whole film I was building theories and by the end of the film I was already completely sure that the follower of the designer is the father of the main character but here there is such a plot twist from which I was stunned to put it mildly
so to confuse the plot and build a chain of false evidence you still need to be able, respect to the screenwriter.About the protagonist: he is interesting and charismatic
and what I love very much in the movies, he is not ambiguous and the campaign of the tape we learn about him that he is still an egoist.But at one point he is locked in a room with his work colleague who treated him with disregard and in one flashback we are shown even when he is attacked by a bandit and the main character calls for help three times he ignores his call and during the shootout the detective was wounded but this did not happen if he did not ignore his request for help. But back to the room, when the detective realizes that he has fallen into the game of the follower of the Saw, he quickly frees himself and sees the one I was just talking about, he listens to the player in the tradition of the franchise and the test begins, he is given a choice: do nothing and commit a kind of revenge or help him get out of the trap, he decides to still help him, he frees him from the trap, but it turns out too late. But the very fact that he is trying to help him can characterize him as a person with shortcomings and advantages, which is of course a plus for the film. Although the movie left behind a feeling of a very good detective thriller that keeps in suspense, there are disadvantages in it, as in everything ( where without them). For example, I almost did not remember a single name in the film, this is most likely due to the short timing of the tape, although in the process of watching the film, I remembered the name of the main character then when writing this review, his name flew out of my head, so in this echo I so often use pronouns.At the end of the film, there is a small misunderstanding due to the confusion of events and after the end of the picture, the viewer thinks about what is happening and there is room for imagination, which is certainly a good scenario solution.I want to say a few words about the music at the end of the review, it is not bad here and in the subject of what is happening, you can listen to some songs even just like that.Conclusion: It turned out to be a very good continuation of the franchise about a cruel but fair constructor which is not without minor drawbacks but the general impression about the film is such that you can understand this continuation was not made for a stupid continuation but tried to shoot in general and in general this movie gets an 8.0 rating from me.",Spiral

This was such a tragedy that I needed to know who directed it after I watched it, and honestly, it all made sense. This is the same director who did REPO: Genetic rock opera, years ago. That movie was just as offensively terrible. I rated this film a 2 because it at least was a film, technically. In my heart and mind, it's a -10.",Spiral
441,chessboss,i'd SAW my own leg off rather than re-watch this.,3,6 June 2021,"I have watched all the other SAW movies, (and yes they all weren't that great), but most of them at least had a protagonist you could watch, a twist or two that got you and some good old fashioned blood and gore. Spiral has none of the above. The plot (Hah) was so cliched as to be almost a parody of a saw movie, it was peopled with a bunch of characters you couldn't care less about. Twists that never rang true and more gore on the Disney channel. Save your money and time and avoid this at all costs.",Spiral
442,buffyth,Rushed,5,22 May 2021,Extremely rushed. They did little back stories as they went threw. It was like death and then bomb another death and another before there is even police work or guesses on what's going on. Chris rocks loudness and comedy facial expressions also wrecked this for me. It leaves it open for more. The originals were so much better. I like the choice of killer and why but the rush made little desired.,Spiral
443,KatarBlade,Just doesn't work,4,31 August 2021,"Chris Rock just doesn't work in the role. Can't see him as a tough guy. His acting is so wooden, his character should have been called Detective Floorboard.Movie just didn't seem right. It felt rather then a flowing movie. Just seemed like a series of scenes. Serious step down in quality.Chris Rock said this isn't a vanity project. Yeah sure. This is vanity at its worst. Rock felt he could add his own brand to something that didn't need his brand.",Spiral
444,debrecenisrac38,Still not getting the point,7,3 June 2021,"Despite the gratuitous torture porn thought up in-universe by sadistic characters, the Saw franchise in the original 7 movies had a gritty realism to it, exploring the reason why Kramer was never captured alive: police corruption in the local force, and interdepartmental spat with the feds later on.That is the part this movie got right... to a point. Because here where it has failed, and miserably so: in real life, cops aren't just protected by qualified immunity, in some districts so-called gypsy cops have sealed records of their previous activities, in others the same department that has armored vehicles and tactical gear, accidentally doesn't have a fully functioning database keeping track. Over the years a few judges and district attorneys have gone to prison for covering up crime committed by cops, so while the move has a moment of realism in acknowledging young cops and detectives can't just willy-nilly, choose where they are assigned, it lost me when he just had unfettered access to what really happened and who else was involved. We know from real life court cases that when a cop is being accused of killing an unarmed person on whom they plant a weapon to look as credible in self-defense, after they report it in, per custom their next call is to the union rep to lawyer up and right there, there's already coordination on what will ever become public knowledge. The movie hinted at this by making Rock's character a second Serpico, going down just like the original real life person. Thus, the killer would have never gotten past the two cops he saw as a kid. Similarly, Policy 8... police departments are very well aware that local councilors, state representatives/senators and above can and do inquiries into their activities, so it would have been written in legalese to defer guilt from anyone and still be very legal.Last but not least, boy oh boy... I get the killers motivations by himself, except the writers should have remembered that Hoffman's guilt was evident by the last movie and he was on the run. They wasted a huge opportunity by forgetting about Cary Elwes's character who is the genuine successor. This is the second movie where a Hoffman like sadist killer gets away, despite Hoffman getting his comeuppance as per John's last wishes.The movie failed in showing us how this young man had the facilities to become a mechanical engineer, or to explore the bag of psychological tricks John had used to lure victims exactly where he wanted them to be. So many things could have gone wrong by working alone, not to mention he lacked the good doctor's help that John had to determine how much tranquilizer a person needs.",Spiral

454,wiemerscarson,I am shocked,8,21 May 2021,"A little over a year ago me and my friend sat down to watch the classic horror film Saw. I liked it a lot and he enjoyed it as well so we decided we had to watch all of them. Come less then a year later we had watched Saw 1-4 and Spiral was announced. We continued to finished all the movies (which felt like a saw trap of its own) and went to see this movie expecting it to be the same poorly plotted, poorly paced excuse of a story to torture as many people as possible. We came out of the theater shocked. This is the best written movie of all 9. The story begins with an inciting incident immediately setting off the plot and the tension and excitement continues to raise constantly through this fun filled 90 minute ride. The film slaps you in the face because its the first Saw movie that doesn't just kill strangers, it develops each character just enough that you really feel each and every kill. You feel like you are the main character and everyone around you is getting murdered and you are failing to stop it from happening. The pacing of this movie is so perfect, especially for a saw movie. The plot just keeps thickening and thickening. I wish I could rate it higher but the ending was confusing and rushed. I still don't fully understand and will probably go see the movie again to figure it out but as of right now this is undoubtedly the best Saw movie since #1. I really hope they keep this up.",Spiral

I was going to say Chris Rock can't act & should stick to comedy; but he just can't act *well*. (However, his makeup & hair was well done.) Max Minghella's acting was mostly NOT. But he's always been like that. It's as if someone told him emoting is a liability. I've seen better acting from people without his familial pedigree who have never acted (for money) before. And, while I don't expect the script to win awards, it could've been better. Even the gore was not compelling, as in previous ""Saw"" movies. I wasn't on the edge of my seat with anticipation, but I did cringe at some of the deaths...so they entertained, sort of. It's an okay movie as maybe...part of a ""Saw""-themed binge party.

I've heard a lot of people say the first one was amazing, and while it was filmed quite well, I didn't think it was great either. So many traps that were simpler from the first 4-5 movies had so much more of an impact. I'll skip over discussing a lot of the details of the film and just get to the ending, which had major Saw IV vibes, and left me feeling pretty empty. I'm not one of these people that claims to have seen the twist coming...I didn't, but it didn't make my jaw drop or fascinate me at all.

486,SleepyMaya,Can't believe I'm rating a Saw related movie so low,1,24 July 2021,"As a huge fan of the Saw series, one who usually rates 10 even the not-so-great episodes in the series, I honestly can't believe I'm rating a spin-off of Saw so low, but this movie was such an offense to the word Saw in the title that I can't even rate it 2 out of 10.This movie isn't really considered a part of the series, it's not about the same killer and barely relates to the original movies at all, at most this is a sad attempt for a spin-off that just happens on the same universe, but of course that isn't going to stop people from counting it as a Saw movie when they talk about the franchise.Sadly, it is poorly written, the story is SO boring that I could barely keep myself focused in it and kept having to remind myself that I'm watching a movie (and not just any movie, but literally one related to my favorite horror franchise of all time). Story is about the cops themselves more than it is about the killer, it's very predictable, the traps and their stories are as minimal as it can get (even the worst trap in the worst out of the other movies, had more intelligence than all of the traps in this movie combined), literally they just threw in a few traps just for the sake of it and even the gore wasn't good. And the twist, which is supposed to be THE best part of every Saw movie, was so lame and prediactable and boring that you could barely even notice there was a twist there.At the end of the day, what I hate most about this movie is that it's so shameful to the Saw title that it's going to ruin the reputation of the whole franchise because people will include it in it even though it doesn't belong, and it will be in my way every time I try to explain to new people why I think the Saw franchise is genius.",Spiral

Just not a well executed take.It was really hard to watch Chris Rock in this. I've always been a huge fan and I get he's a comedic actor by trade, I just hope he learns from Spiral because I would really like to see him succeed in this genre.The plot holes were unbearable at times but I almost expect that from the series now. All the traps are either completely inescapable, or easily escapable. The tongue trap in the intro to me was the best one in the entire film. They also should have kept the same voice modulation from the all of the other Saw films, felt like a not needed change and was pretty annoying at times.The ending was so awful I almost regretted watching the entire thing, I would recommend it only if you are a die hard Saw fan purely because it's weird to skip one of a series.I also missed the classic Jigsaw doll very much.",Spiral

499,axfan64,Spiral: The original Saw you remember and Saw like you've never seen,10,14 May 2021,"First off, I've been a fan of the Saw franchise since 2009. Ever since I've probably seen each one of them at least a few times. So when I heard about this film in February 2020 I got super pumped for Spiral. That was until it's inevitable delay to May 2021. I still did not give up hope. I knew they would come up with an amazing story that would satisfy Saw fans and possibly invite new fans to the franchise.That's brings up to May 13th, 2021. One year later. Was it worth the wait? The short answer: HELL YES!!It is one of the best Saw movies in the franchise. Top 3 easily in my opinion. Darren Lynn Bousman did an amazing job directing this one after Saw II, III, and IV. The atmosphere in this film was great with the shades of yellows and blues in the frame were a nice change in pace from what we're used to. The story was fantastic. Chris Rock holds his own in a horror/thriller movie so hopefully that kills any doubt you had that a comedic actor such as himself couldn't make this work.Don't get me wrong, while this movie looks and feels like a Saw movie, it stands apart in many ways. This is very much inspired by Se7en especially when dealing with the aftermath of the victims. The buddy cop element is present as well giving a new way for the franchise to add some depth to its characters. Chris Rock and Max Minghella play well together as Zeke and William respectively, bouncing banter off each other making for some funny comedic moments.The traps were simple and brutal just the way the original Saw was although much more bloody and graphic. Not over the top like some of the last few Saw movies. The concepts behind them were very inventive and added more purpose to the story even. So if you're a gore fan there's plenty for you to marvel at.There's plenty more I can say about how great this movie was. It is Saw like you remember with an extra Se7en-inspired heart. I cannot recommend this movie more. Congratulations to Chris Rock, Max Minghella, Samuel Jackson, Marisa Nichols, and Darren Lynn Bousman. Can't wait to see it again soon!",Spiral
500,muchblunt-534-683983,This movie should've been called Contrived.,2,20 May 2021,"I'm really not sure what movie the good reviews saw but it wasn't this one. The editing and cinematography was so contrived(everything about this movie was contrived actually) that it took me out of the film, an awkward camera motion or angle later and I was left wondering if I was watching a fan film. The script was either butchered by producers and/or the editor or the writer should quit, nothing about this movie seemed complete to me and it was poorly executed. I knew from the second the killer showed up on screen that he/she was going to be the killer at the end, no surprises really. And finally, Chris Rock, ugh. This is why you don't let producers act in their own films. He was stiff and calculated, and not in a good way. His constant ""I am brooding and angry"" squint the entire movie just took me completely out of the experience. Every emotion he showed felt forced and rehearsed, not to mention the squinting again for every emotion he had. I like Chris Rock as a comedian but maybe horror or serious isn't his thing. Maybe he needs to be directed better or at all? Who knows but he was horrible in this film and by far dragged the movie down with him. Everyone else acted well by comparison. Finally, Samual L Jackson was wasted in this role, he was barely in the film at all and it could've been any actor in this role. I love him but there was no reason he needed to be in this movie. I gave this a 2 because I didn't want to completely trash the rating because of the actors that tried their best despite the producer/actor.",Spiral

If I was that bad at my job, I'd be kicked out in no time.I had to pause the film more than once and do something else, because I was tired of rolling my eyes at the bad jokes and bad actors.Watching the original Saw, I felt as if I was going deeper and deeper into a rabbit hole, intrigued by the story. I was always left craving for more.

Disgrace to the saw franchise.,Spiral

The acting, the scenery, the setting is all very familiar and within the SAW universe; however, the story arc is more of a typical detective movie similar in vain to Se7en. This isn't a bad thing. The movie plays out well. The traps are there. The twist is there (albeit seen from a mile away). Chris Rock is surprisingly good with some comedic relief but believable as a down on his luck detective. Samuel L Jackson barely has 15 minutes of screen time but fits the part just fine. 7/10.

510,Farshnoshket,Not worth anyone's time,5,16 May 2021,"You would have figured this long from the last Saw film (4 years?) someone would've come up with a good story that might have what most of the prior films lacked, but none of this has happened with the newest version, Spiral. After reading a lot of the reviews here I think many have forgotten what made the first film so great, and it was all the torture scenes. Creating the torture scenes is the easy part. Give yourself 10 minutes and you can create a good one yourself. On the other hand the twist? The twist in the first film was genius and they've been trying ever since to come up with something close, but they failed big time with this one. Yeah the film was really gory. Like we didn't expect that. Not only was this film missing the best element it also veered too far off the path for my taste. We all knew there would have to be a new killer, but why is he killing? Is he killing for a similar reason that Jigsaw did? Instead this film is more like your typical revenge flick. Not only that but it was waaaaay too easy to figure out waaaaay before we were supposed to. They totally underutilized Sam Jackson in the film and should have instead to find a way for him to have more time on screen. Big mistake. The acting was slightly better than most of the sequels, but definitely not any better to make any difference. The entire film felt lazy to me.I think that worst part might come near the end when the killer reveals all. If you think about what the person said you should realize that they could have accomplished the same a lot easier than the round about way it was designed. Like Nike say 'Just do it!'.Somewhere out there there's someone who could write a great new version of Saw, but Josh Stolberg & Pete Goldfinger aren't 2 of them.Of course the film ends where the viewer is left thinking there could be another, but I guarantee that won't be happening.",Spiral
511,ejones3157,Get new writers.,2,14 May 2021,"Predictable from the very beginning. These were the same writers who wrote Jigsaw which was easily predictable but less than this film somehow. It was so easy to tell that Chris Rock's rookie partner was behind everything, it was almost laughable. Soon as he showed up on screen and begin talking I could tell it was him. I kept hoping to be thrown off but in the end that wasn't the case. With Saw X just being announced, the studio needs to go with new writers or bring back the old ones. The way this one ends, where the hell do you go now? Chris Rock's character knows who this guy is. I felt they kind of botched the ending. The strings holding Sam Jackson should have ripped him apart as SWAT was entering the room and then they should have shot Chris Rock while he ran in from the side. The rookie shuts the door to the elevator and laughs ""Game over"". The rest of the movie was fine. The traps weren't that interesting and it's different not having the presence of you know who and his puppet.",Spiral

I'm a day one fan of the franchise and after the ratings on Jigsaw - I knew this film was going to be great. I was hoping for a sequel for Jigsaw when it released years ago. I love the idea of a 'new' Jigsaw copycat carrying on the work. I would really love to see Chris Rock give chase to the new killer in a sequel but I'm not counting on it. This film plays out much like a cop drama in the set up but its raunchy and hilarious so I wasnt mad at it. I think the gore and kills deliver - plenty of blood and new games. It's been a rough couple years on the horror movie scene, I feel like Spiral was well worth it and I will definitely watch again.",Spiral

The first trap was incredible, but the rest didn't didn't hold up to the intensity and gruesomeness of the first one. I appreciate that this movie focused more on story than other films in the franchise, but the flash backs were super cheesy and lazy story telling IMO. I had a hard time taking Chris Rock seriously at first but he grew on me. Most of the performances were solid.

And I still came out disappointed.Chris Rock is a decent actor and comedian, but this role was not for him. Seemed like they wanted to incorporate some comedy for his character, but it completely fell short. There is zero character development. People are brought into a scene and you think they'll stick around but they never do, and no real backstory has been given on anyone, or it is so minimal that it goes on one ear and right out the other.The puppet voice is laughable and has zero scare factor to it. Death scenes are decent (and literally the only reason why I give it three stars and not zero), and a few cheap jump scares that were meh.The only way I would recommend this to someone is if they've never seen any of the previous Saw movies and can watch it for free. Otherwise, just skip it.",Spiral
524,mari1992,Spiral of nonsense and bad acting,3,17 July 2021,"Well, where to start...I really really wanted to love this movie and I tried so hard to do so, but within 20 minutes or so, I knew where it was going and that this would not be the case. I am a SAW fan. Obviously the best one was part one, but I thought that even JIGSAW was somehow watchable and cool, although it got lots of hate. But this one? It does not even come close to JIGSAW. So if you are expecting that this movie comes close...it does not! The acting I am afraid was bad...from EVERYONE. I did not buy it, overall it felt as if you could tell the actors were trying to act as real as possible and it was so forced. Then there is the story...just bland, predictable, obvious with no real suspense and stupid decisions. And on top of that I thought that the effects sometimes could not even come close to the last SAW parts, e.g. The scene with the dead pig in the car...compare that to part 3 (the pig trap). It does not even come close....

527,mrs-moo-dude,Well crafted in terms of cinematography and visual storytelling - but don't expect the same depth from the early Saw films,7,17 May 2021,"Saw this tonight and was pleasantly entertained.This film definitely did what it set out to do - stand itself apart from the Saw series.A self contained story that kept all the original elements of Saw whilst taking steps to create a different experience.Cinematically this film definitely has a tighter feel to it, introducing more visually appealing shots, playing around with dramatic colour tones and lighting.Story wise - yes - it's predictable - but if you're going to watch the 9th film in the series expecting to be blown away like with the first instalment, then you're wasting your time. Needless to say, it didn't need complex layers of depth to be entertaining - and that brings me onto Chris Rock.Elements of humour were much more present in this film than ever before - but the way in which the humour was implemented through the whole renegade cop/new trainee partner was written very naturally and never felt like it overshadowed the dramatic tone of the film. It gave some much needed laughs and definitely adds something new to the series.Chris arock performed admirably, as did Samuel L Jackson and Max Minghella.Is this a mind blowing new chapter? No. Will you get the same gore fest, dark tones and overall grimness we've come to know and love? Yes.I would definitely recommend this for a watch, it brings something new to the table.",Spiral

This, on the other hand, had me checking my phone, pausing it to walk the dog, just not... caring. The acting by the supporting cast was subpar, by Rock, Minghella and Jackson were disappointing.

The minor downsides were that there was some overacting every once in a while and it wasn't too hard to figure out who the killer was. It doesn't take away from enjoying the movie though.

I like the twist and characters, I can't believe they got Samuel Jackson in this film. The only character that I don't like is the protagonist. Chris rock just doesn't fit in this type of movie even though he tried his best. But thankfully Chris rock was one of the main reason why this movie exists, he pushed this movie to greenlight.

Mind games will keep you on your toes, questioning everyone and everything, constantly.Thoroughly impressed by this take on the series. The pace and writing kept it compelling throughout.

Like the last one, this sequel is mid/low ranking of the sequels.The acting is kinda mediocre, Chris Rock have bad acting expressions and can't have lines in a movie w/o his OK comedy but being the main character he has to do way better but hey at least he tried, the other characters are very irrelevant and Samuel Jackson brings his cold ass lines which I guess is good but in overall the acting is MEDIOCRE.The Directing is weird sometimes with some shakes in the camera but is nothing new in the franchise and overall is GOODThe Script is OK/MEDIOCRE againThe only PERFECT in this movie is THE TRAPS!!Starting off with Train/Tongue trap this movie sets the tone about what is about to come. It follows up with the Bathtub/Fingers trap which is good. Then, the Wax Melting trap which is WOW and it finishes with Glass Trap and the Marcus Banks trap which are both good.This movie has the best and probably the most sadistic traps in a movie in all the SAW franchise and saves the movie.The Final and the ""plot twist"" (the thing SAW is most famous for aside for the gore) was really weird bc the final of the Father gettin killed and Charlie escaping was alright but the revelation of Charlie was very mediocre to say the least and then trying to recruit Zeke in the most formal way possible??? What?To finish off Imma give it a 5.5/6 just because is really hard to ""reboot"" a franchise as established as SAW so imma give it points for trying it and for the Traps which were the highlight of this film.",Spiral

WIth swift precision the opening quickly establishes the tone and style of this movie, A more toned and mature refinery of the previous saw films before it, this opening perfectly conveys what this film is, a saw film, through and through. With illustriousGore and a thirst for blood we are truly prepared for what is coming. After the opening we meet our protagonist, Chris Rock's character Ezekiel Banks, A new name for the saw series and we are immediately told: although this is a saw film, it still has its own sense of style and a story not parented by the preceding 8 films. We are also told that this film's major production value is somewhat lacking, while the story and characters drive the film's engines. I firmly believe that the editing, cinematography and sound design have nothing too noteworthy which holds Spiral back slightly from what it could be. In addition, although the characters as previously stated are the fuel for the story, the few that aren't primaries in the story have much left to desire. Every side character has barely any characterization, and is boiled down into 2d caricatures, With the two center stage characters Ezekiel, and his partner, William Schenk being the only characters to receive the proper writing and attention of real people, with even William getting the shorter half of the stick in terms of characterization. As our story continues we can see our paper thin characters be killed off in increasingly visceral ways whilst the story takes a turn downhill. The latter half of Spiral completely delves into a mess of conflicting story beats, a predictable twist and the return of poor characterization seeping into Zeke as he himself turns into a 2d husk of the man he once was. The story takes a complete back seat in order to make the twist and characters the primary focus of the conclusion to this story, I see this as a diversion of the film's strengths to make room for this film's weaknesses. In conclusion the things this film gets right are nearly weighed out by the things it gets wrong. Nearly.",Spiral

I like that the audience is thrown right into the thrilling action at the very start! The comedy was just enough and not too obnoxious. The jigsaw traps were not as gory as past films but was enough to make you cringe. I wish the movie was a bit longer and spent more time on the backstory of the other officers.

Somewhere it's slow acting and dialogue, and at other moments it's underconfident or ill-prepared delivery. Any attempt at any dark humor is a failed one.But most of it really is the writing; that's the most absurd part in the foundation of this film. There's no real purpose, no real intelligence that's been put in, and it's an overall very disbalanced, and then an abrupt, very raw and unfinished ending that just takes you nowhere.In general, no character development, no happy or sad emotions, no mystery or suspense that immerses you in any way, and no excitement or thrill. Adrenaline rush? They wish. It feels so fake and just, directed.This movie pays no homage to the Saw legacy, and honestly, if it's going to be like that, I'd rather suggest wrapping up the franchise and just leaving it at that.I've seen some reviews, and they're in earnest. Ones that say this is meh - those ones.I've watched all the Saw movies and this is simply the worst. Only reason I carried on and continued watching was because of the legacy of the franchise - if it were a non-Saw movie, I'd quite half way.I will not recall watching this movie or relating it to the Saw franchise.

I read that Chris Rock is a fan too, which led to him getting this spin-off made. Aside from them actually referring to Jigsaw there's no correlation to how the movie was basically about a (VERY easily guessed early on) copycat killer creating weak traps that the REAL Jigsaw killer would find offensive. I didn't watch this expecting it to be like another Saw movie. It's not supposed to be, but it IS supposed to be inspired by the franchise. Spiral is about revenge. Not justice. Jigsaws traps were designed to atone. In Spiral- they were about suffering to exact revenge. Chris Rock- stick to what you know because horror is not the genre you belong in. You're too jaded as a black man in Hollywood to pull off being an angry cop. Samuel L. Jackson- Mother***cer! This wasn't Shaft! What's your excuse for participating in this abomination?

Honestly, sometimes it even made me wonder if that was the goal: to make a terrible film (?). We'll never know, but that's definitely what they've achieved.Chris Rock's acting can be painful to watch in this one. There's a close-up shot where we're supposed to feel his fear, his emotions. That, for me, was the real horror here. I was terrified... at how worse it was getting. But that award for terrible acting goes to the whole cast.What a wasted potential for a somehow cool concept.Are we, the audience, in a Jigsaw trap where we have to suffer by watching this?

580,edwincervantes70,"Formulaic, predictable, yet nevertheless a welcoming entry to the Saw franchise.",7,19 May 2021,"The first Saw was a great film that featured a nice balance between mystery and suspense, and the blood and gore which I felt was overused in the franchise. What I enjoyed about this particular film was how it partially returned to the mystery detective roots of the first two ones. Spiral is not only a good addition to the Saw franchise for toning down the gore in exchange for mystery and suspense.The film is also a great satire on the modern problem of police brutality. Chris Rock's Zeke Banks was someone I could easily root for in the entire film. Despite delivering his usual comedic chops, Rock's Zeke was likeable from the start for being a dedicated officer willing to uphold the law, which made him my third favorite cop after Agent Peter Strahm and Detective David Tapp. The ending I definitely enjoyed. In keeping tradition with the last minute plot twists that come with the franchise, making Samuel L. Jackson's Chief Banks as a tritagonist was a nice touch.His character was someone I almost rooted for, for apparently being a crusader for justice like Zeke and being protective of his son. What I didn't expect was him being the one who encouraged his officers to break the laws they were supposed to upheld. The ending was a nice touch and homage to the first film. Watching Zeke feel helpless when a SWAT team accidentally gun down his father (as revenge by Zeke's partner for the death of his own) was a nice callback to the first film when Adam could only scream helplessly after losing the game.Overall Spiral is a welcoming addition to the Saw franchise and managed to concoct a good plot twist of tritagonists which Jigsaw (2017) was trying to pull.",Spiral

Once i got over that i found his performance quite impressive.There was a disappointing amount of traps, and while the traps were interesting i felt them to be tame in comparison to previous movies, and the victims to be less desperate to get out of said traps. I was massively disappointed in the use of a new puppet and new voice over but I guess i can understand why it was changed. It was also rather disappointing that within the first 20 minutes guessed who Jigsaw was.Overall it was quite a good movie in itself, the intrigue was there, the loose ends were tied, will there be another one?

That was a misstep on my part; I absolutely loved the film. I'd even go as far as to call it my favorite Saw movie.One thing to rave about in particular is the film's signature ending twist; the way they set it up was incredible. When it came, my friend and I were squeezing each others hands, aghast at what we'd just seen. We didn't see it coming at all! It was the first time that the franchise had EVER surprised me, and keep in mind, it's over a decade old.The traps were tasteful and creative, serving crude justice like they'd intended. The ending in particular was just perfect; without spoiling anything, depending on how you looked at it, Jigsaw could have been the hero all along and the cops could have been the villains.

Also the last bit was a bit forced, it's unbelievable that what was suggested in the last second could happen considering all the factors present I think. I would be interested in a continuation of this if they swap Chris rock with somebody else or if he takes some serious acting classes cause he constantly fell short as I've explained before except perhaps when comic relief was needed, if it wasn't for him I could really get into other things about the movie with more detail maybe. The only thing that felt tired to me was abductions since they didn't switch that up at all, everything else, even the story I think it works in today's society.

A drama/thriller about an outsider cop being against corruption in the department or a part of the big Saw universe. In the end it none of the two options. Too less for a story about corruption and too less for being a Saw movie. Chris Rock is playing the outsider in his department because he was against corruption in it. In a flashback scene we even can see him being shot down and no one came to help. Does anyone else feel reminded of Serpico? 😉 When you watch a movie dealing with Saw, you want to see creative torture machines and not a uncreative built background story of a cop. That's not what Saw is about. After all Spiral is a movie you can easily skip.",Spiral
609,NuikopeaDemon,Bloody Amazing and Worth The Watch,10,13 May 2021,Spiral: From the Book of SAW isn't like the previous SAW films so don't expect to hear the iconic JIGSAW voice as seeing this is a copycat killer who's targeting corrupt cops and unlike other SAW films this movie has a decent amount of comedic moments which some might find annoying or hilarious depends on how open your mind is but as this movie is a Spinoff.But if you're a true fan of the series then you will definitely enjoy this movie like even with the funny moments there is a lot of moments where it was very violent and I can't complain about it the gore was realistic good and also the traps were so beautiful and sick as with every other SAW filmThe music oh yes the music was also very good and Charlie Clouser did come back to help with the iconic music.So I definitely rate this movie a 10/10 I do recommend it for sure and I hope you all enjoy the movie.,Spiral

619,Toddangel,It's enough just to watch the trailers.,5,4 June 2021,"Spoiler Alert
(Without revealing who the killer is / killers are)Let me start with the ending. A lot of people say the ending is awful but I actually like it. The second twist made me thrilled especially combined with previous dialogues like ""cops shoot first"". The puppet trap is my favorite in Spiral, which highlights the continuity of the plot. Other SAW movies have powerful plot twists or strong ending sequences, but the ending of Spiral is revealed incrementally which has no specific turning point. I don't think the effort to set the stage for the end is futile though it's totally understandable that many people argue this endling is lame because Spiral is way too predictable.Secondly, get back to the story. A Jigsaw copycat sets up traps to exact revenge on a group of corrupt cops. As I mentioned in the last part, it's easy to point out the killer halfway through the movie because the red herrings are extremely obvious. To be frank, I think there is nothing much to talk about the story. It's simple, and contains less suspense than previous SAW movies. I expected to see the bathroom trap again with high hopes, but Zeke managed to escape in five minutes without a single bruise? Such an insult to SAW, SAW III and SAW 3D. Perhaps it's enough just to watch the trailers.The following part is about the direction. I still cannot believe Darren Lynn Bousman did poorly in Spiral. I keep asking myself what went wrong. Many of the shooting styles and editing were used repeatedly in previous movies. In SAW 2004, they were stunning. In SAW V, they were mediocre. In Spiral, they are boring. In contrast to the incredibly great cross-cutting in SAW II and Jigsaw, the cross-cutting in Spiral is lack of quality. Sometimes I fail to distinguish a series of flashbacks from what's happening at present. In summary, the shots in Spiral tried to duplicate shots in previous movies but in vain.Next, I want to say I like seeing corrupt cops in horror movies, but SAW II already talked about corrupt cops and there is even a corrupt cop that turned into one of the major antagonists. From 2005 to 2021, the corrupt cops have never changed a bit: broken marriage, rebellious teen/adult son, PTSD, etc. Maybe these are typical of cops, but as far as I can judge, decent storytelling and noticeable character arcs never seem to appear in the movie. Eric treated his suspects violently and aggressively but he loved his son deeply; Hoffman did many dirty things in the department but he did care for his sister and once rejected to see how the victims were tortured; Halloran let many criminals free and his confession further proved the degree of his corruption. What about Zeke? Where is the depth of his character? Honestly, I see nothing.Since I mentioned Zeke, I feel it's necessary to comment on Chris Rock's performance. One word: cringey. Zeke is definitely not a likeable character and there is no character development of him at all. I don't like Bobby Dagen in SAW 3D, but at least Bobby is part of the movie and the actor knows how to act. Chris Rock acts like a ten-year-old boy who just learnt how to swear therefore he says every F-word deliberately. What's worse, Zeke looks like a random guy who comes from a cop comedy. However, other actors and actresses are really good. They remind me of what SAW franchise used to be. I guess being an executive producer does give a person some privileges.As for the original score, I suppose Charlie Clouser is as much tired as I am. While watching, I didn't even notice whether there was something new. Though the good old Zepp is always awesome.In conclusion, Spiral is bad. For average audience, Spiral is not worth watching. For SAW fans, Spiral is a huge let-down. I won't recommend other people to watch it. Bur for those who are interested in the ending or like corrupt cop movies, it's not a bad idea to give it a shot.5 out of 10.",Spiral
620,anorexicpickle,A Different Approach,4,1 June 2021,"This is a pretty decent Saw movie. I mean it's not bad but not good either. Story is just decent. Twist was pretty predictable tho. But i don't really understand why Chris Rock was yelling like a 60 year old on a phonecall? He is a different approach to a Saw character, I really get it. And it was fun time to time, but, please if there is going to be a sequel, don't make him yelling all the time. It's frustrating. Other than that it's okay. You can kill your time watching this. On the other hand, more clever devices and traps compared to other Saw sequels, sometimes funny but never scary. And at least you hear Samuel L. Jackson when he says the m word.Anyways, ending feels like its a bit rushed and movie really feels like it should be at least 2 hour long to complete the story and finish it well.",Spiral

The traps had a good amount of gore and blood, for those who has a weak stomach don't watch this or other saw movies, generally ignore the critics because this is a great movie. This really sends out that being a dirty cop is something schenk hate and despite his father getting murdered for being a witness for a cop who threw someone off a roof, and the copycat's motive being dirty cops is an new motive because jigsaw/john kramar (tobin bell) is not in the movie only killed people who done bad things.

636,ollieharrison-76586,A love letter to the fans of Saw! Invest in your fans!,8,22 May 2021,"If you're going to see this movie because you heard Samuel. L. Jackson is in it or for some reason you want to see the voice of Marty from Madagascar in what looks like a cop drama; this isn't the movie for you. This is a movie made for the original fans of the films and when I say that I mean the viewing experience between those who haven't seen the originals, those who have seen the originals but don't like Saw and those who love Saw will be drastically different.Which is why I suggest that if you're going to see Spiral, watch the originals first. Story wise it doesn't really connect at all with the original other then the occasional reference to John Kramer and the fact he was the original Jigsaw killer but other then that this is it's own movie. The reason I suggest you watch it because of the way the narrative is written and how it unfolds. I would say Spiral is a Saw movie, but clearly as the description shows; it's a revival of the series.The traps still unfold the same way thematically throughout the film somewhat but it's the films final 10 mins or so where it really shines as a Saw film. Yes, the plot twist was predictable and the supporting characters were 2D and unimaginative but the story does well to really make you side with the villains in this. Just like 10 years ago when Saw fans low key understood John Kramer's reasoning and respected his art.Now for the cons of the film: Chris Rock's acting is subpar at best and I could not stop seeing Marty from Madagascar throughout the film.The plot twist was predictable although I liked it all the same.There were one or two scenes from a narrative perspective that I would've changed to different points in the movie to to make the plot more interesting.Finally, the 21 Savage theme 'Spiral' is god awful and It's stuck in my head. It tries to remix the original theme and just does a woefully terrible job.All in all though regardless of the above I praise this movie because I could clearly see they made it for the fans, not for all audiences. Yes, it's rough around the edges but what Hollywood needs during covid now is to invest in their fan base and not satisfy all audiences. Companies like WB in particular need to look at this and learn otherwise their Fantastic Beasts franchise is going to flop worse then their Justice League franchise did.I would really like to see this story continue in someway as I'm really invested in the villain and his motives. I also think that baring some things this film was written and story boarded well and it was nice to see some enjoyable comedy in a Saw film for a fresh change.",Spiral

There was no other suggestion they were close)Idiotic decision making (I'm no expert, but if you can't reach a person who is in danger, maybe try one of the other 50 cops in the building? And the captain, presented with the choice between shooting the killer or trying to batter down a heavy metal door chooses the latter)No imagination with the traps (cables pulling stuff, and a bit of wax. The finger one even looked like the cop could have just climbed out)And a really odd performance by Chris Rock. I don't know what he was going for, 'moody and tortured' maybe, but what we got was 'can't act'.And the time it took Rock to work out the killer's riddle wasn't talking about his actual ""head""!

If you bring it back to the center of it all, It's all about the messed up people being in these messed up traps and watching the person leading to find any motives for each body and do something about it in this universe, it's all fun and games.

And there were moments in the movie Chris's comedy background appeared causing me to chuckle a little.We have to remember this is a sequel, it would take a miracle to do something different to the previous movies.On that note it's almost imposable to come up with a new story all together because everything has been thought of.

It were all separate people, even the cops and the son and father too.I don't know if it is normal in the US for police to shoot a victim, but I found this very unbelieveble. To just start shooting a random person when entering a building. Even with corrupt policemen it feels like this would not happen.It just didn't feel like a saw movie. Also the music. Vaguely you would hear saw sounds. It felt like it was not John Kramer so the sounds are not allowed to be used as of it was him.It just should have been John Kramer and not a (bad) copycat.I understand it is not a 'saw' movie and therefore the title was chosen as it is.

726,rheap-47304,NO BIG IDEAS,5,15 May 2021,"When Chris Rock announced that he came up with a great way to revive the franchise, I was intrigued. A great idea to bring it back to life means that someone finally thought of an awesome premise to keep Lionsgate's cash cow grazing away as I'm sure all Lionsgate execs have been trying to think of ways since Saw VII.OK so let's imagine that the execs have been trying for 10 years to think of a good enough reason to dust off the traps. It obviously can't be something predictable. It wouldn't be the most predictable and over-used reason for reviving similar series, would it? I mean ""copycat killer"" must have been suggested around the writers' room ever since Saw VI and luckily we never got that in such a simple unimaginative way... until now.So let's try to look at it as the fresh take that Chris Rock intended and pretend that a copycat killer is a clever hook... Now the challenge is to create a few Saw-esque reveals and surprises to really essentially make you want to re-watch the movie. The only ""shocking"" reveal in the movie was extremely predictable - especially to torture porn Saw fans. This movie had very brief trap scenes which led to Zeke being sent body parts. Didn't they think that a body part being sent to Zeke without the viewer seeing the scenario play out for that victim would make Saw fans realise that they didn't actually see the death then ultimately assume that there must be a reason for that (otherwise why not show it?) and what better reason than because the victim never actually died? It just made it glaringly obvious who the killer was from that moment!Ultimately I can't see how anyone thought Spiral was a good enough idea to reboot the franchise. Although they wanted something fresh (I get it) I feel like they could have tied into the franchise further by using more than familiar music. Familiar sets or a motive linked back to the original movies would have been great. Why keep talking about 12 years ago if you're not going to link any of the story to events we've seen previously? The only clever nod we got was Zeke waking up handcuffed with a saw nearby and the the familiar Saw theme playing for the first time in the movie followed by him suspecting the victim in the middle of the room. With more nods like that, they'd have intrigued me more as a viewer whilst not alienating anyone who hasn't seen a previous Saw instalment.I just can't see how anyone thought this idea was amazing enough to justify flogging this dead horse! It's not a bad movie when compared to something like Seven but doesn't really hit the mark as a Saw movie. At all!",Spiral

734,MrDB84,Starts strong but spirals downhill rapidly,5,6 June 2021,"Here's a movie I was greatly looking forward to and was left greatly dissapointed.It starts off strong enough and has a urban city undertone and backdrop to it brought to life with the dialogue of the funny Chris Rock and Samuel L Jackson etc which was fine by me and gave the film a fresh Saw feel. The opening scene was shot nicely even if the trap was lackluster.There's a good few jokes thrown in the dialogue that I laughed at and there's a decent hip hop soundtrack. I was invested and excited to see the direction it would go in, how the traps would play out and what twists would happen. I was hoping so much for this to be a good movie and a new fresh take on a stale Saw franchise.The first quarter of the movie was the better part, it feels fresh and the opening scene was ok. I started to realise after getting to the 2nd trap that the gore seems to be toned down a a considerable amount compared to previous saw films. The traps feel a bit meh and lackluster. Leaves you with a feeling of i hope this will get better.By the time we got to the middle of the movie things had dipped enough for me to realise this wasn't going to be a good as I thought by a long shot. The dialogues fine but the scenes jump harshly and starts to give off a rushed feeling. At this point I was hoping for a brilliant final to pull it back but it only plunged it further.The ending felt like it came to fast and once again felt to rushed failing to deliver the killer blow it should have. I was honestly saying ""Are we at the end of the movie already?""This movie had promise at the beginning and spiralled downhill rapidly. Its definitely not a film I could watch again. The worst thing is it could have been great if it held itself together and was more creative with the traps, story and ending.The beginning has a good cinema type feel but by midway through it has that straight to DVD feeling. A dissapointing shame.",Spiral

The film felt like it was cut to be a 90 minute trailer of what they WANT to make a new Saw movie about.

But it's also very easy to say that Spiral is a refreshing new chapter in the gory series of Saw. There is undoubtedly a few head scratching moments in the film that might make you scratch your head and ask ""really?"", but at the end of the day, since the disappointing Saw 8 came out 4 years ago, I must say -- THIS is the Saw sequel we've been patiently waiting for since the release of the original film in 2004.

Like Logan Nelson, this Jigsaw/copycat isn't entirely following Kramer's rules, but using his methods to tackle corruption. For Kramer, it was getting people to understand the value of life, of survival.You may be wondering why I named this review ""Spiral - not just the film's title."" It's because this Jigsaw copycat defines what the spiral means to him, and use that meaning to justify why he's battling - in this story (and perhaps more to follow) - corruption.

But this movie isn't smart enough to be making a statement. Some of the ""cop dialogue"" sounds like it came from one of the cutaways on Family Guy-cops who are loose cannons and (they literally say this in the film) are ""too close to this."" Rock can't resist riffing at points, which absolutely does not fit the tone of the film. Samuel L. Jackson isn't much more than an extended cameo. The traps lack any of the poetry of the better Saw installments, and the punishments done always seem in line with the crimes. The acting is actually pretty terrible-like knock off Law & Order on budget cable. Even the cinematography is flat and dull. I had hoped this was going to breathe new life into the franchise, and normally I'll sit through just about every half baked sequel to a horror film, but this is so bad I hope they just stop making Saw films.

He can literally pull himself free cutting off the tongue, but save his life, or to be smashed into a mash by a subway train.

Zeke is not particularly well-liked in the Department because of internal ""misunderstandings"" of the past.

There is absolutely zero tension. There is no action. The plot is completely predictable almost from the very beginning. Characters just drive from one place to another doing absolutely nothing.

You should have watched the movie with no attention at all, not to get all ""twists"" and ""unpredictable"" moments.There are couple good moments like timing and Samuel L. Jackson. An hour and a half is a good timing for such movies. Honestly, I wasn't bored watching ""Spiral"". Samuel L. Jackson's actor play is an exceptional as always.

Stellar acting by the entire cast, with special notes of how impressed I was by how I began to forget that Chris Rock was ""Chris Rock"", and that Sam Jackson's portrayal was subdued in a pleasant way that allowed him to be his character and not a caricature. The story was a bit more linear that I would have expected, but it didn't detract from the overall narrative. And the traps, oh the traps. I can confirm that several of them had me wincing in my seat. Overall, a killer ride and a fresh new take.",Spiral

Spiral feels like more than just a return to form for a franchise, it feels like a horror movie being made by masters of their craft, that want to remind you
that this genre can stir you up like no other, and it really does leave you with... feelings.The traps are disgusting - they left me
more uncomfortable than previous traps, but that's not just because of what they did but the amazing performances leading up to them, especially Chris Rock, who I quickly forgot was Chris Rock. That's not something I expected, and nor was a great supporting cast around him. There's no dead wood here, and that's also true of the pacing, which is smart and slick and modern. You won't find many horror cliches here, and it's all the better for it, feeling fresh, and confident. This movie reminded me why I love horror.",Spiral

Over time, the sequels devolved into over the top gore, overly complicated and often unbeatable traps and increasingly tenuous connections to the original.. I mean, how many ""secret apprentices"" did we really need? With Spiral, we finally get a much needed face-lift. The formula is changed, while keeping enough familiarity with the previous entries to believably inhabit the same world. Actually, in some ways, this looks more like a Saw movie than several of the others.As I said, I'm not trying to hype this as a top tier film... but as a fan of the series, I endorse this as a solid revival for a floundering series.

814,meddakkak,Just finished watching this amazing movie,10,3 June 2021,"Hey guys, I just finished an employee screening of Spiral (the perks of working in a movie theater!) and I wanted to give you something to chew on until the movie is released. No spoilers -- I want y'all to enjoy this and be as surprised as you can be.First of all, I would say temper your expectations and don't let glowing reviews or extremely negative ones push you to one side of the scale. Spiral is a Saw film at the end of the day and that title naturally comes with baggage. It's a good Saw film. It's even a good standalone film for those that are new to the series. The most noticeable things about the film is that the gritty and grimy look has been polished a bit and modernized but still retains Saw's signature look, spliced throughout. The iconic editing that defined the film for years has returned after being scrubbed out of Jigsaw, an obvious atonement for past mistakes. The script -- infinitely better than Jigsaw. Stolberg & Goldfinger seemed to have largely learned from their mistakes and sought to mold a better story out of what they started with. Those worried about comedy possibly overtaking or diluting the horror can rest easy, it's balanced and natural, Rock delivers without it ever feeling shoehorned in.Let's get to the gore! I would put it on the level of Saw II. CGI is still used but has been extremely dialed back in comparison to Jigsaw which felt like everything was shot in front of a green screen. Practical effects are highlighted throughout with a nice blend of VFX to tie it together when necessary. We see mostly everything here and very little is left to the imagination.All the actors are utilized well and compliment there respective characters. Chris Rock is just irresistibly likable (that might be good or bad, it's up to you) and elevates a character that likely would have been weaker given a different casting choice. I really loved Max's youthful, doe-eyed portrayal of Schenck -- he has a great on-screen chemistry with Chris which makes us attached to these two detectives fairly quickly. The supporting cast are all naturals and fit very well into the story. Great casting choices.The not so good: Some may be disappointed with the overall screentime of SLJ. I feel like they definitely used him more in promotion to draw a bigger audience. It's not as heinous as Joker in Suicide Squad but he becomes more of a background character as the story reaches its peak. Those who are worried about the twist or ending not being satisfying, let me just say this one thing without spoiling anything: I will reiterate, it's a Saw film. Don't expect a Se7en or Memento level twist or even anything Shyamalan-esque. You likely won't be shocked unless you're a casual viewer who's not very invested. I will say though: miles better than Logan's wooden delivery and that atrocious laser trap CGI. There's something hidden in plain sight, something really clever that the writers put in to mark the killer to the audience while also retaining plausible deniability -- see if you can figure it out!I wanna wrap this up by saying that this was clearly a labor of love from all involved. It isn't by any means perfect and you might be left with more to be desired when the credits start, but from what I've seen so far, Lionsgate has the potential to keep the franchise going in a big way if the response and box office are there. As a fan of the the series, I felt really happy to see it on the big screen early without being too spoiled going in. Spiral is, in my opinion, a return to form after disappointment many felt with the past few films.You can ask me anything that doesn't involve major spoilers (twist, killer identity, ending) but I won't be ruining the best parts for anyone. I wouldn't want it done to me!",Spiral
815,cindyxie-78638,Just not a great experience story wise.,4,16 May 2021,"Note: I haven't watched any other saw movies, so take this with a grain of salt.Off the bat some of the dialogue was just clunky and some camera work and sound effects were just downright funny. I am not very knowledgeable in horror or gore oriented films but I had no problem with most of the puzzle scenes. I took the most issue with the movie's message since it's weirdly both pro and anti cop and didn't leave me with any meaningful experience. Overall, just felt kind of devoid of message, which could be fine but the traps and suspense weren't good enough to make up for its lack of intent.",Spiral
816,missrachaelferrito,Omg what a joke!!!! I think even giving it a 2 star rating from me is being generous.,2,16 July 2021,"Ok so before I went and rented this film, which I had been waiting in much anticipation for, I came here to IMDB to check out its star rating and other user reviews. I was shocked to see such an average rating and even less than average from the users, a lot of 1,2 and 3's. I thought surely it can't be as bad as they say and there are a small amount of people who said don't listen to those low ratings, it's not as bad as they say. Well you're right...it's worse. I can't believe what I watched tonight. I don't understand the R rating either, the gore and scare factor was not there at all. The story itself was good but not written well. And yes, it was rather predictable too. You can never be sure until the end but I too had picked up on who this spiral master could be.If they had only been more creative with what the spiral master concocted, this movie may have been able to redeem itself. But those scenes were the least exciting during this movie.The best part...probably the only best part for me was the humour that Chris Rock throws in there, but that didn't last through out the whole movie. I then began laughing at how lack lustre the movie was becoming and how the bad acting was from every actor and then I become rather angry with disappointment with this film. It truly was not what I was expecting. I say this firmly for those who have not watched it yet. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS!!! Wait until it airs on free tv or someone burns or downloads a copy.If this movie gets funded for its sequel, I'll be very very surprised. They should stop and try again.

Se7en was given longer to develop. This movie RACED through with little time to let things develop. Movie probably should've been 2-2 1/2 hours, which I know is long, but it was too fast paced. Actually, where it really could have hit the e Mark would've been as a mini series on Netflix. If you're a Saw fan you will want to see it, but if you never viewed Saw, you'd still enjoy it. Definitely worth a watch as it had a good concept. Not completely original but a fresh enough spin on things to jumpstart the series with a fresh perspective.",Spiral
829,lionvanslion,Spiral retreads over same dull path.,1,15 May 2021,"So I've been into Saw since the very first film released when I rented it at my local Blockbuster Since then, I've seen every film in theaters.Despite being swept away by the current hype of each film, and my younger less developed mind, I claimed each subsequent sequel as the best entry in the series.After the series ended, and by the time 2017's 'Jigsaw' rolled around, my firm stance was that the first two Saw films are the only truly good ones through and through.Nonetheless, I went into Spiral really looking forward to it. There were many reasons to expect it to be promising... bringing Darren Bousman back as director, a great cast, promising teaser back in 2020 and I was very stoked.After seeing the movie last night, I was severely let down, mainly due to the writing.Before I talk about my negative feelings with Spiral, I do acknowledge that it's better than the past few Saw sequels... yet that's not really a high bar at all, thus the problem.The story was so paint by numbers, and the ending twist should have been so much more... just like ""Jigsaw"", even more so actually, because Spiral had a complete fresh slate to do whatever they wanted, and they chose a twist ending that was so bland and anti-climactic...Spiral ignored like Twist-Ending 101 --- there was no subverting of expectations, no multi-layered twists (a la Saw 2), no surprise reveals, misdirection etc...
Instead of having William as the killer, they should've had him be a red-herring , and do something like simultaneously revealing that William was just a pawn like Zepp or blackmailed maybe, introduce the real killer while having a time twist be revealed...They should have executed the twist in a clever way that pleases fans of the early Saw films like Saw 1 and 2, while also pleasing newcomers.For example, the killer is targeting cops, they could have found a way to have Daniel Mathews (Erik Knudsen) be the killer... or maybe the drill chair test survivor from the first Saw... maybe Daniel is targeting corrupt cops because he hated his dad and the emotional neglect he put him through, and they could execute it in an epic way that would be like epic on its own if you've never seen any Saw movies, but twice the epic-ness if you know who Daniel Mathews is!And then an epic time twist or something, reveal the bathroom or the Saw 2 house in an epic way. I really thought this film was going to take place around the time Saw 2 took place or something, or have some connection to the first two films.They should really loosely follow the blueprint of the original Saw for the main story, like two (or three) people trapped in a room and that's the main plot of the story like the Bathroom in Saw 1, and have a twist ending like Saw 2 - misdirection, time twist, unexpected killer etc.And just the overall story was terrible, Josh Stolberg (the writer), holy smokes... why the studios didn't think to look elsewhere for a new writer/s is beyond me. Jigsaw was dogsh**, so they cleaned house and got a new director and cast, studio wanted a new direction with the story along with Chris Rocks idea, so it's dumbfounding that they kept the same writers as 'Jigsaw'. Horrendously insulting story and dialogue, and twist.",Spiral

I felt the focus wasn't as much ""who is behind this"" as it was ""what's going to happen next and can we stop it"" - which took away some of the mystery of Saw (which I see some reviewers are upset about), but it made me care about the story and wonder what was going to happen next instead of just waiting for the kills like I usually do with Saw sequels.

The first kill is the one and only kill that felt true to the series while the others just felt like filler kills. Personally I felt insulted as a saw fan with only the little easter eggs being the only thing connecting this movie to the others. I feel bad for those who see it as their first saw movie because it takes away from the original charm and gore that saw fans know and love, leaving them in disappointment.

And I'd love to see if if they can connect them more than just mentioning John Kramer. Maybe they could tie in the Jigsaw movie because that movie connects to the other movies because that movies Protagonist/Antagonist was Kramer's apprentice so it would be pretty cool if this new Jigsaw was the apprentice from the movie before.

It could've been something better, only if it hadn't present itself as a spinoff of a beloved franchise and instead tried to do its own thing. The 'Twilight jokes' and writing were awful (we get it Chris Rock, you're a real comedian), not to mention the plot twist which was obvious. Traps were quite underwhelming as well, so this movie doesn't have much going for it...

857,t-49474-74527,Everything is cyclical,9,5 June 2021,"So - we've been waiting for this for so long... and it happened! The pandemic is slowly receding and all the postponed movie premieres of 2020 are slowly returning to the cinema distribution system.Before us is the return of the cult thriller, a story that fascinates the spirit, and scares with its cruelty and openness. A maniac who has lost everything, the child's family, and his own life, takes revenge on others and all those responsible for what is happening. But today's story is quite different, many years have passed since that time, but the handwriting of the famous killer is still alive today. A new series of murders, completely repeats the handwriting of a maniac, and in the hands of an agent (played by comedian Chris Rock), a case that can change his entire life, either raise him to heaven, or take his life. But will his impulsive and explosive nature help him in his search for clues, or will it lead him into a new trap?I waited, hoped, and believed... But alas, everything is very predictable and obviously understandable. Perhaps the writers were looking for fresh branches, but the final twist was not quite successful, but something was still there. Thank you so much for the test traps, they are very meaningful and correctly played, merciful cruelty goes to a new level, believe me. As a big fan of this franchise, I was pleased with what I saw. Yes, there are mistakes, but there are small inconsistencies (apparently without them anywhere!) and there are incomprehensible moments. .. (especially at the end). I hope everything will be explained.The acting ensemble is good, the entourage and locations are not bad, classical music is present, there is a semantic motivator - but there is no zest in the image of the antagonist and the whole image of the 'great merciful punisher' + the rapid transience of events, all this together pulls only 7 points. Yes, the picture does not claim to be the grand debut of 2004 and the furor that it made, but for fans of the franchise, it is worth the time spent, believe me.P. S. There are no scenes after the credits.",Spiral

862,mxnvft,A Big Missed Opportunity,5,6 June 2021,"I was barely on board with the storyline of Saw: the Final Chapter revealing a third Jigsaw apprentice and a thinly distinguished past/present timeline to justify its existence. That film also continued to water down John's character in a way that increasingly made him look sloppy and plagued by self-interest and poor judgement. But, I think people got on board. It left room for the games would continue whether by the ""good"" or ""evil"" remaining protégés - or perhaps a potential battle between the two.Spiral would have been less disappointing had it not been connected to the main Saw cannon as a supposed continuation. The idea of bringing the games out with a broader scope to target systems was great. But John had already done that with the insurance company and the building demolition. Lacking acknowledgement of that further made John's character retrospectively look more myopic and self-interested. It would have been cool to connect multiple systems like the police, health care, buildings/development, insurance/banks together to expose a broader message about the city/town/society John may have been trying to send.Instead, this is another Saw movie exposing police corruption but without a strong Jigsaw character to really carry it.I think it would have been cool to have Gideon be the new Jigsaw. Perhaps he had never died and Jill was raising him secretly to keep him away from his father's disturbing behavior.",Spiral

Now, some of you might say it was random blood spatter, I would have agreed with you however, I saw that there were more than 2 (at least three) distinct markings of the name on the pig. Now you might say it was a coincidence however, is it really a coincidence if all three times, the same letters were used. If I had the ability to take whoever was responsible to court, I would.

It's sad to think so much time, money and talent was wasted on this.The original premise (kid's father is gunned down by a corrupt cop, kid grows up wanting revenge on all corrupt cops and uses Jigsaw's twisted philosophy to justify his killings) is not bad (as far as Saw murderous plots go). This could've worked as a decent (but certainly not the best) addition to the Saw franchise in the hands of a competent screenwriter and director (none to be found in this thing they tried to pass off as a movie).There are too many problems with it, starting with the dialogue which is absolutely ridiculous, like having characters scream at each other and burst into fits of anger for no reason on 50% of the scenes.The characters' actions, motivations and decision-making make no sense and go beyond the realm of studid. Like when a courier delivers what is clearly a package from the killer to the detectives on the case, and despite them all suspecting this thing could be a bomb, what do they do? Instead of calling the bomb squad, 3 of them just decide to get their faces in it, open the package and handle its contents (which is clearly a mix of some kind of animal or human skin, meat and blood) with zero regard for the fact its evidence. No gloves. No sense. It's like the writer wants us to think the characters forgot they had brains for a few minutes. And this is not even the most stupid decision in the movie - I give it a 5 out of 10 on the scale of stupid, 0 being stupid and 10 being something so idiotic there's not even a word for it yet. And trust me, there are many 10s in this movie.The plot plays out in a very predictable manner, and the killer's identity can easily be guessed within the first 25min. They don't even try to make that bit hard for the audience to guess. It's insulting.The only thing good about this was the cinematography. The movie didn't look cheap and it fits well with others in the franchise.

That was enough for me to find joy in this film. The story was fantastic with the use of flashbacks in order to immerse the audience in what the characters feel in modern day/. Pretty heavy acting. The film felt like an expansion of David Tapp's investigation in Saw 1. Chris Rock's 1 or 2 jokes in the film were welcomed and really built up the story.Technical stuff: Camera cuts were awesome.

911,cmartineziv,Would rather die in a Saw trap instead of watching this film!!!,1,15 May 2021,"***Possible Spoilers ahead***Overall the film was terrible. Nothing related to Jigsaw franchise film. They just slapped about maybe 10 minutes altogether Saw related actions. I miss hearing the Jigsaw. They could have worked something related to the voice. Billy was gone, but the pig puppet was just as scary. Kudos. I miss the original Saw score. That intense music makes your adrenaline rush. The film was lagging throughout. The story is extremely predictable in the first 20 minutes. The film did not hide any twists. I was hoping the film would trick me in not thinking how obvious the story will go. Sure enough everything happened that I thought would happen. The story is a classic horror/suspense cliché instead of a Saw original story. The only thing I like me was some Saw traps. Most were typical kills as seen in other horror films. Boo!!! The beginning started strong then leaves you in a bathroom to rot with no tools in the dark. Most of the film takes place in one setting. It felt like an Law & Order episode to be honest.I do not know why they call the film ""Book of Saw."" I was hoping a connected story in the franchise where Pig face was using a book of Saw traps or just a book of something original. Maybe a book of ""what if"" victims survived that turned into a new Jigsaw. Now this new Jigsaw has a deep story with new games with a major twist. How much torture would a person go through to live without a timer? What if Jigsaw gives his victims more time, but more pain in the process? New Jigsaw characters that tie into other parts of the story. So much potential I was hoping in the title. I have comments on the acting, but that is private.Loved the gore fest. That was spot on in the 4DX experience. The moving seats, water effects, lighting, etc made the traps intense. Well done.I give it 1 Star out of 10 Stars. Too predictable, not a Saw feeling, outdone story, & no need to produce a sequel to this story. There was no Jigsaw. I'm surprised this film was released due to the fact of all the police shenanigans. Too heavy on anti-police actions. I would wait to see YouTube video of the Saw traps. The rest of the film is a waste.",Spiral

However, it felt rushed! Had this movie been at least 2 hours I think it would've been a lot better. Some of the decisions the characters made were poorly written.SPOILERS
Example 1: Captain Angie is placed in her trap, she leaves without her phone or doesn't bother answering it. Chris Rock goes to look for knowing she's in danger, and him and this other cop lady are taking their sweet sweet time walking down the hallway ????Example 2: At least three times a character tries calling someone else and nobody ever answers or has their phone on them? It's like cellphones are completely useless.Lastly the twist was predictable, and it just happens. There's no suspense at all, either as the viewer or the characters themselves. There's no red herrings at all. It becomes obvious that Max/Will is the killer and you can suspect that he faked his death but they never even try to point you to another character as the possible killer. I would've really liked it for it to be either a completely random character or anybody else. Regardless it was good, but it's a one time watch type of movie.",Spiral

I watched this movie without looking at reviews or a summary hoping to be pleasently surprised. There are some things that surprised me that are beter then expected. Chris Rock did do a good job trying to be a little funny but otherwise a serious person. The pace of the movie was decent to good for me. However the movie felt like a b-movie while having a high budget for a horror movie and not being a funny or a good b-movie. The other performances seemed comical at points can't really tell if this was meant to be the case or not. The twist who the killer was way to easy to figure out. For a saw spinoff/franchise I found the traps to ber lackluster and not gory enough (although I prefer that normally but in a saw film it is expected to be just that).Spoilers:
Hated the nonclosure for certain characters like o'brien, Kraus, Drury and others and then there is the ending you didn't here from them the last part of the movie. How can the swat team that arrived not see that he was a former police chief especially the ones that came in before the lights went on the could have warned the other not to shoot at that time. Even if they didn't warn the others could they not have seen that the person they are shooting was hanging on wires. Last but not least how did the killer actually get away they could still see him in the elevator maybe should him in a place like the leg where he would be wounded but not killed or warn the team downstaits to circle the building and catch him to arrest him even if they didn't know he was the killers they should want to interrogate him.",Spiral

The eternal angry demeanor was expected, and over-delivered.Sam Jackson ... it would have been nice to see him present a more subdued character, but, Samuel L Jackson can only play Samuel L Jackson.Max Minghella ... by far the best performance of the entire cast. A very controlled and fitting performance to the franchise. Max's role and performance is the only part that was truly worthy of the franchise.Script - extremely poorly written. ""From the book of SAW?!?"" No. Sadly this garbage script was a complete misfire, and should have been scrapped from the start. The only character to develop was Max Minghella's.This movie had no thrill or development of the mystery of the copycat Jigsaw (the voice used was laughable). Instead, we follow constantly angry and wise cracking, down-trodden, and shunned Chris Rock's character.... ZEKE ?!? Seriously?Direction and production - again, shameful from the green light.Sadly, should this franchise continue, this movie will serve as a miserable interlude into its progression.

953,jamesturner-86241,Ignore the negative reviews - well done Chris Rock!!,9,29 June 2021,"I personally really enjoyed this film, as much as I enjoyed watching Saw 1,2,3,4 & 6 for the first time.This type of movie always tends to get negative reviews so if you are a fan of the franchise just ignore those, watch it and have a lot of fun!There are a lot of similarities and things you'd expect, but done in a slightly different way which made it feel fresh. The traps were there for a reason, the storyline worked on it's own rather than being forced just to make another version of what we've seen many times before.The fresh take meant they didn't have to think of yet more ways to tie in previous movies and charachters, again it just worked without beiong too over-complicated. Just don;t go in expecting it to be exactly the same as the first 7, it's not, but it's far better than Jigsaw - a movie I want so much to like too but it's clearly lacking.Chris was great as the lead, and I thought Sam did a great job too, certainly beat my expectations!If you are like me, you are scrolling through these reviews ahead of watching it for yourself tonight, and hopefully skipping over any with spoilers. The one thing I noticed by doing that, were a lot of comments about it being predictable who was behind it within the first 30 minutes. I think in a strange way this actually added to my enjoyment! I kind of felt like I should be able to work out who it was early on, but that in turn made me suspect three people rather than just one because I didn;t want to get it wrong! I did get it right (the clues are definitely there), but afterwards I thought I quite liked that it made sense who it was, rather than being impossible to guess to hide a rediculously tricky reveal at the end. It didnt make the ending any less enjoyable, as there were other elements brought in which haven't been done before.I remember seeing Jigsaw and being disapointed with the blatant lack of gore. Spiral gets this perfect in my opinion. Its much more similar to the saw of old, but holds back just enough to make it meaningful and not purely to gross people out as much as possible. It's exactly the level of gore I'd love to see in sequals, and I really hope they make a sequal to this very soon.Hats of to Chris Rock, I hope more people leave realistic reviews, and I'm going to watch it again tonight before my 48 hour rental runs out :)",Spiral

Spiral is a fresh reboot to a much loved series of films that gives comeuppance to shady and downright bad people.Its the same saw I've come to know and love, with a new twist.. it doesn't harp on about John Kraemer still being alive... its a copycat killer.The traps are simple, believable and something that could indeed be put together in a weekend.. not like some of the past traps featured in the later saw films.Chris Rock delivers a good performance and his partner is a likeable fellow.. and I felt really bad for him halfway through.. and I love how they freshened up Billy the puppet and turned it into the pig, but a puppet pig.. I mean, come on... thats an amazing collaboration right there.And the final act.. with Sam L Jackson was amazing.. and how it ties into the reference to the puppet, is great.Overall.. the traps were believableand simple, but grizzly.. and made me squirm.. the acting was good from the leads, but the secondary characters, like the other cops was ""meh""... the twist.. yeh kinda ""saw"" that coming.. the ending... very clever and had me grinning with sheer ""saw"" delightfulness..Definitely worth a watch.. must be like marmite with some of yall.. you'll either love it or hate it.. being a true saw fan, I loved it. :)",Spiral
