0,bkoganbing,A Garden of Eden just built for two with nothing to mar their joy,7,28 March 2020,"This third version of The Blue Lagoon is beautifully shot in the South Seas where the story actually takes place and that adds a lot to the telling of the
story. A couple of young beauties of the time Brooke Shields and Christopher
Atkins complete the picture.Brooke Shields was well into her career when Blue Lagoon came out, but for
Christopher Atkins this was his debut film. In a novel Hollywood success
story picked from a group of unknowns to star in this film. I well remember
Atkins as the great Hollywood 'it' boy of the early 80s. He had a great following with both women and gay men at the time.Both Brooke and Chris carry the innocence look off very well. The story is
that while bound for San Francisco on a schooner the ship catches fire and
the children are herded into a lifeboat by gruff sailor Leo McKern. They make it to the island and soon enough McKern is killed off.The kids are left to their own devices and grow up to be Brooke and Chris.
And like in the Irving Berlin song soon are doing what comes naturally. Well
maybe not that soon.The film holds up well for 40 years at this point. Stays just this side of soft
core porn as well. Not exactly G or PG rated though.",The Blue Lagoon
1,Leofwine_draca,Robinson Crusoe for adolescents,5,21 July 2013,"THE BLUE LAGOON enjoys something of a cult reputation these days after proving an enormous success on first release and recuperating its own budget many times over. It's a simple enough story about a young boy and girl who are stranded on a tropical island, but instead of the usual survival elements of the story the focus is on their developing sexual relationship.I admit it's not particularly the type of film I find interesting but the stunning Fijian locations were enough to keep me watching. Unfortunately the acting from the clearly inexperienced leads is less than impressive and wooden in places and seasoned performers such as the ever delightful Leo McKern have all too little screen time. Sure, Brooke Shields and Christopher Atkins may be superficially beautiful but they're able to reveal little below the surface.Instead of getting more gripping as the story progresses, I found that this film actually got less interesting as it focuses more deeply on the relationship between the characters. The so-called sexual tension is handled in a rather twee and dated fashion and the ending feels tacked-on instead of a natural development of the plot - you think they're either incredibly lucky or wonder why they didn't try it long before.After directing the hugely successful GREASE Randal Kleiser saw his star gradually waning with the final inevitability of making TV movies and straight-to-DVD releases. THE BLUE LAGOON reveals him to be a workmanlike character rather than a real auteur with a love of his material so it's no surprise that he faded into obscurity after one brief blast of fame.",The Blue Lagoon
2,SnoopyStyle,hormone cinema,6,17 January 2016,"It's late 19th century. Young Richard Lestrange, his widowed father and orphaned cousin Emmeline Lestrange are on a clipper to San Francisco. Fire engulfs the ship and the cook Paddy Button (Leo McKern) takes the kids into a lifeboat. They get separated from the other lifeboat by the fog and land on a tropic island in the Pacific. They find skulls, signs of natives, and a cast of rum. Paddy drowns after a drunken binge. Richard (Christopher Atkins) and Emmeline (Brooke Shields) move to an isolated beach building a new home.This is hormone cinema wrapped in a Swiss Family Robinson adventure. The hormone cinema is cringe-worthy. This is not a subtle movie. It is deliberately pushing out the young flesh for public consumption. However as a young boy, this was a guilty pleasure. I can't complain about the sincerity of the young actors. This is generally a bad movie but everybody can like a few of those.",The Blue Lagoon
3,mark.waltz,"""Funny thoughts about you and me."" Okay, kissin' cousins.",4,12 March 2021,"You get 25 minutes of Leo McKern barking at the series of child actors playing Richard and Emmeline until he is found dead and Brooke Shields and Christopher Atkins step into the part, having found a different island apparently where there apparently aren't sleeping berries or natives having human sacrifices followed by human steak tar-tar.Shields is an orphan taken in by uncle William Daniels, Atkins' father, and they end up with ship's cook Leo McKern on the deserted island when the ship catches fire. Before he kicks his rum barrel, McKern conveniently teaches them how to survive so they are soon able to build shelter, create fire and make coverings for their growing anatomy. The one thing that he doesn't warn them about is natural feelings that grow between young men and women, and that dominates the film from the time these two attractive teens take over the roles.A better British version starring Jean Simmons and Donald Houston was made out of the novel in 1949 and barely deals with the lustful themes, focusing more on the two teen's efforts to survive. This version is more sexual in nature, and it certainly easy to see why the two attractive young people would go from childhood playmates to lovers. There's more to what this should have been about then just shots of their barely covered bodies, and the focus on survival is basically a supporting plot element.Still, this is a gorgeous film, filled with beautiful landscapes, exotic animals and a few frightening moments involving the unknown going on around them. The photography by Nestor Almendros is exquiset, and the musical score by Basil Poledouris is lush and beautiful. Atkins is a more natural actor than Shields, but occasional squeaks in his voice adds unintentional laughter. It's easy to see why this was a critical bomb yet a box office hit, and that has lead it to having a cult following even though in retrospect, it's often silly and juvenile.",The Blue Lagoon
4,jboothmillard,The Blue Lagoon,5,15 April 2013,"I had heard about this film so many times, particularly about the young leading actress, and I had seen a few clips, it was absolutely one of those films I knew I had to see to satisfy my curiosity and see what the fuss was about, from director Randal Kleiser (Grease, Honey I Blew Up the Kid). Basically on a ship journeying to San Francisco are Young Richard (Glenn Kohan) and his cousin Young Emmeline (Elva Josephson), when the ship is about to explode they escape in a lifeboat with galley cook Paddy Button (The Omen's Leo McKern), while the boy's father Arthur Lestrange (William Daniels) disappears in another lifeboat. The two children and the man find themselves stuck in the middle of nowhere with no food or drink, until they come across on an uncharted tropical paradise island, filled with forest, waterfalls and edible fruits and plants. Paddy teaches young Richard and young Emmeline to fish, hunt and build, but after a month or two of doing nothing but drinking from the barrel of rum he ends up too drunk and is found drowned, and scared of what will happen to them the two young friends move and build a new life on the island. Many years pass, and now young teenage adolescents Richard (Golden Globe nominated Christopher Atkins) and Emmeline (Brooke Shields) have made a life for themselves on the island, with plenty of nourishment and shelter, but of course their knowledge or all worldly things are somewhat limited. They are very good friends and look after each other, but in the process of growing their hormones kick in, and they start gaining feelings and experiencing changes they never knew before, and this may in fact put some strain on their friendship. There comes a point when Richard and Emmeline have a big argument when she does not signal a ship to come and rescue them, because she has developed loving feelings for him and does not want to separate on the outside world, so she leaves him to make her own life. He realises how he really feels for her however when finding her hurt and supposedly dying, but he manages to save her, and nature finally runs its course and they finally make love, losing their virginities, having come to terms with their true emotions. This was of course the first time Richard and Emmeline learnt the facts of life, but they had no idea that they would have a child together, when after some time she is in severe pain and gives birth to a baby boy, but they manage to raise it well. In the end, with their child Paddy grown into a toddler they one day go out in a lifeboat and are nearly attacked by a shark, but after surviving it they for days drift out to see, and the three are eventually found by Arthur to be taken back to civilisation. Also starring Alan Hopgood as Captain, Gus Mercurio as Officer, Bradley Pryce as Little Paddy and Chad Timmerman as Infant Paddy. Shields is absolutely beautiful and plays the innocent girl well, I don't know why she was nominated a Razzie, of course the controversy at the time was that she became a sex symbol, and she was only fourteen years old, but thankfully her nude scenes were doubled, and her breasts covered with her hair, so it wasn't graphic, Atkins is alright as the male lead as well. This is a pretty simple story, two children grow up naive virgins, fall in love and learn the facts of life, it is a good look at teenage innocence and purity, and the emotion element is nice, of course the location is magnificent as well, so while it might not be everyone's cup of tea I personally found it a likable romantic adventure. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Cinematography. Brooke Shields was number 98 on 100 Greatest Sex Symbols. Worth watching!",The Blue Lagoon
5,ccthemovieman-1,For Teen Girls Only,4,3 October 2007,"If you are anything other than a 11-16-year-old girl, you are advised to skip this film. Chances are, it won't do much for you. This is strictly a teen girls movie, pure and simple.Brooke Shields {""Emmeline"") and Christopher Atkins (""Richard"") swim half naked in the beautiful waters of some South Pacific Island and both are young, ""beautiful people."" The girls will swoon at Atkins and admire Shields, wishing they were her. It's kind of an early two-person ""Survivor"" show before there was a hit TV series as the kids, er, young adults, learn to cook and do other things after being shipwrecked on this island and then having the ship's cook die. In the meantime, they learn about sex and other exciting topics. If you're a guy and you think you might be titillated by watching a pretty teen girl naked, forget it. Brooke's chest, which isn't much to start with, is covered up with her long hair and she's replaced by doubles on other scenes, so go elsewhere for your soft porn. It's not that kind of movie.Overall, I found it fairly boring, empty story with only the beautiful island scenery appealing. The two stars are lackluster. The fact that neither one, particularly Atkins, ever became a star in the business tells you something about their acting ability. Once the young looks were gone, so was their brief and over-inflated ""career"" from this movie. If you think I'm being a little too rough on them, check out their film resumes - there isn't much there in the way of impressive films or anything you've even heard about.",The Blue Lagoon
6,moonspinner55,"""Only God knows everything."" .. ""He can't find us any better than Santa Claus.""",4,22 January 2005,"Despite gleaming Oscar-nominated cinematography by no less an auteur than Nestor Almendros and an epic-sized music score from Basil Poledouris that seems ready to sound a romantic Second Coming, this screen-adaptation of Henry De Vere Stacpoole's novel (following a 1949 version starring Jean Simmons) became a preposterous success. To whom is it intended to appeal: budding teenage romanticists or prurient grown-up voyeurs? Two Victorian-age youngsters, prepubescent cousins on a high seas voyage, abandon ship after a fire and seek refuge on a tropical island with their elderly guardian, who soon dies. Marooned and alone (save for some drum beats in the distance), the two quickly mature and become curious about their own bodies and each other's. Muscles! Menstruation! Director Randal Kleiser makes an attempt early on to keep the mood light; however, this version seems even more naïve than the original (ridiculous as well, with two plot threads--a hostile tribe on the other side of the island and a threat of poisonous red berries--left dangling). Brooke Shields (or, rather, her body double) and Christopher Atkins show us lots of skin, but barely a trace of acting talent. Infuriating movie has water on the brain. Followed by a sequel/remake in 1991, in which we're told the characters from this film didn't simply ""fall asleep"" after eating those ominous berries, but perished in their boat on the water. At least the turtles made out all right. ** from ****",The Blue Lagoon
7,sunwarrior13,All About Discovering Sex And Ignorance Of Two People In The Island,5,6 January 2012,"This 1980 version of the oft-filmed Henry Devere Stackpoole novel The Blue Lagoon was the first to be stamped with an ""R"" rating. The basic story remains unchanged. Two very small children, a boy and a girl, are shipwrecked on a lush tropical island. They are cared for by fellow castaway.When he dies, the kids have no one but each other. When they grow into teen-hood, they also fall madly in love.Anyway,The Blue Lagoon is a American romance and adventure film directed by Randal Kleiser. The screenplay by Douglas Day Stewart was based on the novel by De Vere Stacpoole. It stars Brooke Shields and Christopher Atkins. The original music score was composed by Basil Poledouris and the cinematography was by Néstor Almendros.The basic premise of the story is about two young children marooned on a tropical island paradise in the South Pacific.The romance between the two people left in the island is enhanced by Nestor Almendros' exquisite photography and Basil Poledouris' score, as is the stunning beauty of the Fiji island where it was filmed.But the positives end right there.According to film critic Roger Ebert,""The Blue Lagoon is the dumbest movie of the year"" during the time it was released.I definitely agree with him.This movie's story could have been made as a tale of wilderness survival or about an epic adventure but it focused on the discovery of sex and romance or better yet ignorance between the two people left in the island.It capitalized on the appeal of the leads particularly Brooke Shields whose long hair is so carefully draped to conceal her breasts and her genitals covered by palms.It simply was a witless movie that should be avoided at all cost.",The Blue Lagoon
8,Doylenf,Picture postcard sort of romance on a deserted island...,5,10 October 2006,"If you have to watch a film about a couple shipwrecked on a tropical island among gorgeous blue waters and palm trees, it might as well have a couple as attractive as BROOKE SHIELDS and CHRIS ATKINS are here.The story follows what happens when they're shipwrecked as children with only the ship's cook for an adult to teach them how to cook food. How convenient. When he dies, they're left to struggle on their own for survival--and, of course, they do.The years pass and long the way they fish and swim and not much else--until they discover what mutual attraction leads to. Eventually they even bring a child into the world. There's not much more to the plot than that, it's mostly a matter of marveling at how well Shields and Atkins photograph in their brief costumes, sometimes swimming nude through the lagoon (with a body double subbing for underage Brooke).Obviously the film had a certain fascination for female fans who fantasized being shipwrecked on a desert island with hunky Atkins--or guys who found Brooke the girl of their dreams. But it coasts along for an hour and forty-five minutes in very shallow waters, very pretty to look at, very tranquil with soft music in the background, but, when it's all over, it's about as empty as a sea shell.For a better version of THE BLUE LAGOON, try the 1949 British film, also in gorgeous Technicolor, starring JEAN SIMMONS and DONALD HOUSTON. A much better version of the story.",The Blue Lagoon
9,preppy-3,Kiddie porn,7,10 February 2004,"A young girl and young man are shipwrecked on a remote island when their ship burns down.  An old man Paddy (Leo McKern) takes care of them teaching them how to survive in the wilds.  He dies soon after and they are left by themselves.  Years later they grow into Brooke Shields and Christopher Atkins.  They ""discover"" each other, have sex, a kid etc etc etc. 
Silly movie.  When it came out in 1980 it was trashed by critics worldwide. They called it ""kiddie porn"" (due to the frequent nude shots of Atkins and Shields' double) and lashed out at the stars and director Randal Kleiser. However, the public LOVED this and it was a huge box office smash.  My guess is people just went in to see handsome, buff Atkins and Shields' double nude (there's a LOT of frontal nudity here), and maybe the cinematography. There's nothing else here!The story is virtually nonexistent and, to be nice, Shields and Atkins can't ACT!  Atkins is actually worse than Shields--hard to believe but true.  Also their constant whining and bickering got annoying.  Also they look suspiciously healthy and in GREAT shape after being abandoned for so long. It gets really silly when they discover sex leading to some hilarious soft-core sequences.  However, nothing is really shown.  My favorite scene has got to be when Shields has the baby.  She goes into a dark forest, screams a few times...and they carry out a clean, dry, healthy baby. SHEEESH!!!!  They also make bringing up a baby look like loads of fun.  This movie was risky at the time for dealing with sex between teenagers (Shields was 15, Atkins was 19) but it's so far from reality nobody took this too seriously.The cinematography (a deserved Oscar nominee) by Nestor Almendros is just gorgeous.  THAT'S what kept me watching--some of the shots take your breath away.  Also there's a pretty good (if monotomous ) score by Basil Poledouris.  But director Kleiser's only concern seems to be to show as much nudity as he possibly can get in an R rated film.  This got by with it because most of the nudity is very casual and the two of them DO have great bodies!So, if you're not offended by that and you want to see some truly beautiful scenery, tune in. Just ignore the ""acting"" and hilarious leaps of reality. In the right frame of mind, you could probably find this all a laugh a minute.  I'd love to know what Atkins and Shields think of this now.",The Blue Lagoon
10,utgard14,"""It ain't proper to be running 'round naked all the time!""",3,31 August 2015,"Two kids (cousins!) become stranded on an island with a fat old drunk who yells a lot. Eventually the drunk dies and they're left to fend for themselves. As the kids become teenagers, they turn into Christopher Atkins and Brooke Shields. It's at this point that the movie becomes what it's famous for being: two attractive teens discovering sex in the wild. Most people are either going to think this is a story of innocent love unhindered by societal conventions or they'll see it as a cheap piece of exploitation. I'm trying my best to view it as the former but the cynic in me finds it hard to deny that the latter is probably the only reason this was green-lit in the first place. For the record, if you haven't seen it, the nudity does not only come from Atkins and Shields (or her adult body double in some scenes) but from the pre-teen children playing the younger versions of their characters as well.Judging the movie on its technical merits, it's pretty hard to deny that the gorgeous island scenery and the nice score are big pluses. But the story is paper thin and the acting is atrocious. There is potential for a good movie here, if it were treated as a realistic story of two kids struggling to survive while also dealing with growing into puberty with no adults around to guide them. But director Randal Kleiser is more focused on flesh peddling and the single most insipid romance to ever hit the screen. As it is, we're left with a curiosity that isn't a good film at all but will hold a salacious appeal for some viewers.",The Blue Lagoon

13,JamesHitchcock,The only film to have made a greater contribution to herpetology than than to culture,4,19 October 2012,"Ever since at least the eighteenth century, the ""desert island"", the uninhabited tropical island with golden beaches fringed with palm trees, has frequently been depicted in Western culture as the nearest one can get to paradise on earth, in literature, the cinema and even in advertising campaigns. (The makers of the ""Bounty"" chocolate bar have for decades centred their entire marketing strategy around this concept). In the twentieth century writers, such as William Golding in ""Lord of the Flies"", Alex Garland in ""The Beach"" and J G Ballard in ""Rushing to Paradise"", started to subvert this idea, but ""The Blue Lagoon"", based on a novel from 1908, is a film which takes it largely at face value. The film is set in the late Victorian period. Two young children, Richard and Emmeline, survive a shipwreck in the South Pacific and are stranded on a lush tropical island along with a seaman named Paddy Button. Paddy dies not long afterwards, but not before he has taught the children the skills they need to survive on the island. Richard and Emmeline grow up and turn into beautiful teenagers, fall in love, and have a child of their own. At which point Well, you'll have to watch the film to find out what happens at this point. An earlier version of the story was filmed in 1949. It is a long time since I last saw that film, but I recall that (as one might expect of a film from the forties) it contains far less nudity and sexual activity than does the 1980 version. The 1980 film was, in fact, quite controversial, largely because the actress playing Emmeline, Brooke Shields, was only 14 years old at the time of filming. (Two years earlier, Shields had starred in the even more controversial ""Pretty Baby"" about a child prostitute). It was later revealed that body doubles were used in the sex scenes, but even so many people were shocked by the film's sexual frankness and especially by nude scenes which appeared to feature a girl so young. (One thing which aroused surprisingly little comment is the fact that Richard and Emmeline are first cousins, even though cousin marriage is illegal in many American states). The film was a success at the box office, probably because of its sexual explicitness and the good looks of its two young stars, but today it has a very dated feel. Much of the problem lies in the fact that its stars appear to have been cast on the basis of their looks alone, without regard to acting activity. Shields, in fact, had the dubious honour of winning the first ever ""Worst Actress"" Razzie. It may have been cruel to give such an award to a teenage girl (Farrah Fawcett-Majors probably deserved it more for ""Saturn Three""), but it has to be admitted that Shields is not very good here. She had given a good performance in ""Pretty Baby"", but the transition from child star to teenage star can be a difficult one, and here she seems horribly embarrassed and self- conscious and, moreover, does not always speak her lines clearly. It might have been better if an older actress aged about 18 or 19 had been cast in the role. Richard and Emmeline are supposed to be around the same age, but Shields is in fact four years younger than her co-star Christopher Atkins, and it shows. Casting an actress in her late teens would also have removed any controversy about underage nudity. As for Atkins, this was his first film. He has, apparently, gone on to enjoy a long acting career, although I do not recall seeing any of his later films; the only subsequent part I remember him in was as Sue- Ellen's toyboy in ""Dallas"". His career has been much longer, I suspect, than many would have predicted for him on the basis of ""The Blue Lagoon"", where he is very stiff and wooden, with little chemistry between him and Shields. The best acting performance comes from the veteran Leo McKern as Paddy, playing him as a mixture of kindly father- figure and drunken old reprobate; the film loses a lot of interest after his death relatively early on. There are a few holes in the plot. It appears that the island is inhabited by, or at least regularly visited by, a tribe of people (portrayed here, in the best politically incorrect fashion, as bloodthirsty cannibals), but it is never explained how these inhabitants manage to go at least ten years without discovering two strangers living on their island. It might have been more plausible if Paddy had remained alive for longer; the small children we see in the early scenes seem too young to be capable of surviving on their own. And how does Richard manage to stay so clean-shaven throughout? (Presumably the film-makers felt that a bearded Atkins would have seemed much less cute to the teenage girls who made up a large part of the film's intended audience). Visually, the film is an attractive one, with some striking photography of the island and its wildlife. The cinematographer Néstor Almendros was nominated for a ""Best Cinematography"" Oscar, the only nomination the film achieved. Overall, however, ""The Blue Lagoon"" is really no more than yet another sentimental teenage romance movie with an exotic setting and two miscast stars. Its only distinction lies in being possibly the only feature film to have made a greater contribution to science than to the arts. Some scenes were shot on a small island in Fiji, and a herpetologist watching the film realised that the iguanas featured were a species hitherto unknown to science. Today it is classified as the Fiji Crested Iguana (Brachylophus vitiensis); they should have called it Brachylophus bluelagoonii. 4/10",The Blue Lagoon

The engine on the ship catches fire and all must abandon ship. In the confusion, the children are separated from Arthur and wind up in a life boat with ship's cook Paddy Button (Leo McKern) .The lifeboat drifts out to sea until it comes to an unchartered group of tropical islands. Paddy and the children set up shop on one of the islands where Paddy teaches them hoe to survive in the wilderness. Unfortunately, Paddy gets drunk one night on a keg of rum they found on the island and drowns trying to get to a nearby island. The children are left all alone.Several years pass and the children grow up to become Brooke Shields (Emmeline) and Christopher Atkins (Richard). They have survived using the skills learned from Paddy and have built themselves an elaborate hut learned to feed themselves while having time to frolic on the beach and explore the underwater areas near their home.But as the years pass the two now teenagers begin to feel their oats and become sexually attracted to each other. A baby boy results and the new parents are forced to learn how to raise a baby. A couple of years later, a ship appears. Unbeknownst to Emmeline and Richard.

The baby tosses one of the oars overboard. Emmeline calls out to Richard who come to the rescue but is unable to retrieve the lost oar and loses the other one fending off a shark. The small boat then drifts aimlessly out to sea and............................................................................I eliminated any reference to the cannibals and their human sacrifice ritual because it really doesn't fit the story. How could the cannibals not posed a danger to the youngsters. Surely they would have detected them at some point over the years.There's plenty of colorful photography to enjoy as well as exotic birds, lizards and sea creatures. However there are no fearsome creatures that would normally be on such a location such as venomous snakes, bears and the like. But there's plenty of youthful nudity with a body double standing in for the 14 year old Shields.For what it's worth, ""The Blue Lagoon"" is an enjoyable if not unbelievable yarn.",The Blue Lagoon
17,thinker1691,""" From the Sea world springs life and love eternal """,7,25 April 2010,"There are many stories about the sea and shipwrecks. Here is one of the more controversial, due in part because of censors, not the beautiful drama. It is the story of two children who experience a violent storm and ship disaster which culminates in their being stranded, shipwrecked and given up for dead. However their luck is not all bad, they happen to be fortunate enough to have an experienced seaman named Paddy Button (Leo McKern) who deems it necessary to teach the two kids, Richard (Christopher Atkins) and Emmeline (Brooke Shields) how to survive on a deserted island. When their teacher is no longer able to continue their education, the two children grow up alone. The story is honest and allows much lea-way into what might happen as they learn to exist without adult guidance. Safe to say, director Randal Kleiser creates a wonderful and idea world for them allowing them to self-discover who and what they are. Writer Henry Stacpoole's dialog is simple and uncomplicated and together they created a stirring memory in the hearts and minds of anyone who longs to be stranded on an equally Blue island location. ****",The Blue Lagoon

If I had rated Blue Lagoon solely for its visual beauty (both of its young actors and its lush setting), then it surely would've scored 8 stars, no questions asked.But.... No. I couldn't have possibly rated Blue Lagoon on its beauty factor alone. No way, Jose. There were (most definitely) certain other factors to consider here. And 2 of these all-important factors were -(1) The unbelievably wooden and self-conscious performances of both Christopher Atkins and, especially, Brooke Shields.(2) The incredibly dumb dialog that took place between these 2 beautiful, but virtually talentless, young actors.Set in Victorian times, Blue Lagoon's story was, needless to say, very simple, almost to the extreme.After being shipwrecked on an exotic South Seas island for several years, 2 children (who actually manage to survive) grow to maturity, and, at this crucial point, become very-very-very sexually aware of each other.It could easily be said that, at times, the brief scenes of nudity and overt sexual-tension that inevitably builds between Em and Richard almost teeters on the point of being considered soft core cinema.

They had intelligence to their appearance that only literate people has.For what's supposed to be a B movie, this movie is well known, and I think that shows the fact that this is a sensational movie, and maybe even well liked by many people.Brooke Shields certainly showed that she's not a fluke, and went on to be a good actress. A feat that not too many child actors are able to do. Jody Foster and her are about the only child actors who were also successful academically.I would like this movie a lot more if Christopher Atkins' part was played by another actor. I liked Wllie Aames who played a similar character in ""Paradise"" better,I like this sort of escapism, and if the male lead were another actor, this might have been my favorite movie too.",The Blue Lagoon
20,mattkratz,Ok at best,7,8 September 2021,"The real star here was the cinematography. It was panned by critics. I could see why it wasn't considered a classic, but it wasn't too bad either. Two children survive a shipwreck and grow on their own on a tropical paradise without adult supervision. Physically they were becoming adults but mentally and emotionally they were still children. That just about sums it up. I felt like the movie was ok with decent performances.** out of ****",The Blue Lagoon
21,davispittman,Classic teenage film,6,24 November 2015,"The Blue Lagoon (1980) starring Brooke Shields and Christopher Atkins is a classic teenage movie. The acting by both of the lead actors certainly isn't Oscar winning by any means, in fact at some moments it's really bad. They were young actors at the time and weren't all that experienced, so I'll take it easy on them. At least they were attractive, as many audience members commented. I know all the ladies and gay guys really enjoyed seeing Christopher Atkins shirtless and seeing his bare backside. And I'm sure the straight guys enjoyed Brooke Shields. A lot of teens in 1980 said that it was the sexiest thing they had ever seen, which is hard for our generation to understand I'm sure. But yes, it's true, the blue lagoon is sexy. So if you want a movie with eye candy actors, mild sexual scenes that aren't graphic in nature, this might be for you. The film's plot is pretty good, but the script lacks intelligence. The movie just really suffers when it comes to the dialogue and the acting by the leads. Yes, the scenery is beautiful and yes, it's sexy. Although, other than its sexiness and pretty scenery, it's just not all that much to see. I'm giving The Blue Lagoon 6/10 stars for its sexiness, pretty scenery, and it's interesting plot.",The Blue Lagoon

24,Sherazade,Very poor!,4,12 May 2006,"Brooke Shields won a Razzie for worst actress for her role in this film. Who can blame them. Having watched the life story of Miss Shields on the Biography channel, it's no wonder at all. This is the same woman whose typical Hollywood mum let her star in a soft-porn flick, do Calvin Klein commercials that had they aired in this day an age, the government might have gone after them for enticing pedophiles, and paraded herself around as this virginal role-model without a clue. At one point in her life, she even chased after Michael Jackson to be her boyfriend. Pathetic!But anyways, this film is about two kids who after getting shipwrecked on an uncharted Island are forced to fend for themselves when their parents die. They go through all sorts of stages in life, including puberty, sex and incestuous child-bearing that is cringe-worthy at best. I don't understand why people laud this crap!

Also, as it turned out, the culminating make-out was unforgivably dull and badly photographed.I finally let this film catch up with me on cable while I was coming to with a hang-over. I was convinced I had blacked-out, died, and gone to hell. Leo McKern's hideous over-acting was the first intelligible impression I could make out, and it certainly was my idea of Satan on a blood binge.In effect, the film saved my life - I vowed to remain sober and never to see another Brooke Shields film again.Anybody who says there's a story in this mess is probably lying; anyone who actually believes there's a story here clearly needs rehab.Is there anything remotely 'real' in any of this?

26,tim-764-291856,Disney meets 9 and a half weeks,7,1 February 2011,"OK - I've not actually seen 9 1/2 weeks. But I wanted a suitable summary title. When I first saw this romantic fantasy, aged 16 and I was 'undecided' and, frankly fancied both the grown-up girl and boy castaways as they naturally, but reluctantly fell into love. Natural, unforced nudity is clean and pure and to witness these two heavenly creatures being human mermaids was - and frankly is, still a joy. I strongly felt at the time that Brooke Shields was the most perfect creature on God's Earth, because of her part in this film. The storyline to this oft derided tale of Castaway romance is straight out of a Disney feature. All it needs is a shaggy dog (or is that the story itself?) to complete it. You know, shipwrecked as a couple of young kids, an Ooh-arghh of a pirate like uncle to raise them and somehow they grow up in perfect health and when the old man snuffs it they still have perfect health and an idyllic life together. An ever-present mysterious enemy never really causes more than the odd bad dream. And no one ever gets sunburned. Viewing again after a decade, I find the trite dialogue painful, the ridiculousness of the scenarios gaping and obvious. In mid-winter Britain, now, however, this tropical paradise fable is a perfect antidote to real life. Nostalgically, The Blue Lagoon will always have a special, but seldom spoken of place in my heart. Those of who ""do"", will and those who ""don't"" will never. And I totally understand why. Whichever camp someone is in.",The Blue Lagoon
27,TOMASBBloodhound,"A silly effort, but not without its merits.",5,16 December 2007,"Thank goodness for the late Nestor Almendros and his wonderful cinematography. Because without it, and the fine musical score, there would be little to rave about with The Blue Lagoon. Director Randal Kleiser, most known for Grease, attempts to tell us the story of two children who grow up together stranded on a tropical island. But rather than explore the trials and tribulations of such a predicament like Castaway did, the film is mostly a study of the blossoming sexuality the two experience by the end of the first hour. There are other ideas touched on here and there, but most of all this film is just a piece of exploitation. The folks that made it had the last laugh though, as this thing made an absolute fortune! It even spawned a kind of sequel/remake in 1991.Brooke Shields plays the young lady, and Christopher Atkins is the young man. Shields was quite a sight to see in those days, but any nude images of her character were of course body doubles. She was only in her early teens when this was made. Atkins probably made some ladies swoon with his ""white man's afro"" that was such a popular style back then. Just ask Willie Ames. There are plenty of shots of Atkins in a state of ""full-frontal nudity"", as well. Neither of these two could act their way out of a wet paper bag, but in their defense, they were playing two people that would have grown up without any formal education. Whomever wrote the ridiculous dialog can use that as his excuse, I suppose.The film contains some gorgeous shots of nature from a by-gone master of camera work. Anyone who has seen Days of Heaven will also get a great feel for Nestor Almendros. A man whose life was tragically cut short by AIDS. Since the film takes place in the South Pacific, there are all kinds of beautiful things to film between shots of soft-core sexuality. There are some good actors with brief parts. William Daniels plays the boy's father who keeps searching the seas for the two kids throughout the length of the story. Leo McKern also washes ashore with the kids, but he only lasts long enough to teach them a few survival techniques. Also nearby, sometimes on the same island, are a group of cannibals. It is truly a sign of contempt for the audience that the filmmakers would have us believe that the protagonists would never be discovered by them and eaten.Do the kids ever get rescued? Well.... the film kind of cops out with its ending. We are not really sure what happens, and this is really not a film worth debating the particulars. At least not at the same time No Country for Old Men is still playing in theaters. 5 of 10 stars.The Hound.",The Blue Lagoon

I was quite surprised, this movie was good. The landscape in the film was beautiful and had a lot of incredible footage. This was the first movie, I've ever seen Brooke Shields in and I thought she did a pretty good job for a 14 year old. Although the acting was pretty corny, it never seized to entertain you. I actually liked most of the actors in the film. What really hit me, was the character development and how the story was approached. How the two young kids grew up into young adults that started to show passion for each other was greatly written out. The music was also good, as well as the cinematography.

31,MovieCriticOnline,I actually cried at the end of this movie...,5,30 May 2021,"I don't know how I ended up crying at the end of this movie, but I did. I had heard of this movie my whole life but never bothered to watch it because it was always like a corny kids movie nude on a deserted island. But I was wrong. Yes, it has some bad acting, mainly due to the bad voice dubbing, and the premise is very simple, but somehow it worked. It is a true coming-of-age movie albeit unrealistic I nevertheless found it interesting.I never expected the ending, and despite what some people think that it was ambiguous. It wasn't. They all ate the berries and weren't going to wake up. So very much like a modern-day Romeo and Juliet story. For the naysayers, the sequel book (Garden of God) by Henry De Vere Stacpoole who wrote Blue Lagoon literally starts out saying ""No, they are dead"", and the reader is told that they have stopped breathing. Arthur Lestrange then says he is glad they died in the boat and didn't return to the savage.Quote from the book: ""He had glimpsed the faces of the dead people. Clasping his head with both hands and staring at the forms before him, mad, distracted by the blow that Fate had suddenly dealt him, his voice rang out across the sea: ""My children! These were the children they had come in search of, grown, mated and-dead.""Brooke is stunningly beautiful here. There is a LOT of nudity in this film. Perhaps a bit too much. Nothing hardcore, but I think they could have done a bit less.For some reason, I mix Endless Love and this together.Anyway, I know it got a lot of hate from critics, but it is worthwhile seeing.

The script stinks, with way too much time spent on them discovering their bodily maturations. And the acting... UGH! Yes, I know they are developmentally and intellectually stunted by growing up on an island by themselves - so, no I wasn't expecting earth shattering dialogue. But what dialog was there, I expected to be delivered with some semblance of true feeling and genuine emotion. Instead, you have 2 stiffs acting ridiculous.And who let's their 14 year old daughter act in a movie with the themes and nudity in here. Utterly disgusting.

34,Thrashman88,Great Entertainment!,9,19 December 2004,"I was a young kid when I saw THE BLUE LAGOON and yes, I remember all the hoopla about the ""nude"" scenes with Brooke Shields and all that jazz. I must confess that, being in my early teens at the time I saw this, there was an inherent morbidity which compelled me to watch Brooke Shields in the nude. After all, she was probably THE hottest ""teen"" actress of the early 80's (and damn, she DID look terrific!). But now I'm in my late 30's and I have recently seen the film once again and I must confess, BLUE LAGOON is a darn good movie. Yeah, it might be corny in some parts, but so what?!?! It's a cute love story that's very well done and done in a very realistic and believable way. It's the story of two kids who are stranded on a supposedly deserted island in the middle of the pacific ocean and that they have to grow up and learn the things of life by themselves. Yes, there's plenty of nudity but that's not the charm of this movie (which I recall, was nominated for best cinematography in 1981). The real deal is the story of these 2 kids growing up and reaching adulthood on their own primitive terms. The soundtrack is rich and heartfelt (by maestro Basil Poledouris) and only enhances the overall grandeur of this film. I think Chirs Atkins did a great acting job and I have to wonder why his acting career has faded into near obscurity. And Brooke Shields looks like a total goddess; she is REALLY beautiful in this movie and I doubt she's looked better elsewhere. I fully recommend this movie, especially to young couples, the recently married or just plain love birds. younger audiences might find it a bit corny, but like I said, this movie is pure entertainment and despite not being an action flick, it never bores.

On the downside I think this story would have been a challenge for any director to successfully pull off. Director Randal Kleiser does his best but it just doesn't quite work. I think it it had been handled a bit more soberly, naturalistic it could have worked but it always seems to be trying just a little to hard to elicit from the audience.

The lush beauty and splendor of the South Pacific paradise is captured in this version of Henry Devore Stacpoole's 1903 novel. This was a strange movie because it opens with a large ship on the ocean with Richard and Emmeline with there Uncle Arthur who together was on there way to San Francisco. While on the ship the passengers and crew were informed that a usage storm was coming there way. After a fire breaks out everyone is put into small boats including Richard, Emmeline, and the cook Paddy Button. This is where I loss interest because Richard, Emmeline and Mr. Button are floating around in a boat in the middle of nowhere. Suddenly the trio fines land and realize that there now ship wrecked. Later in the picture, Mr. Button dies and Richard and Emmeline leave the one tropical island for another in order to erase the memories of Paddy Button. The kids learn to cope with the bewildering variety of physical and emotional challenges that go along with growing up. Here are some fun facts about the movie before I give you my rating. All the nude scenes depicting Emmeline include a body double. Brooke always had to have hair glued to her chest for the other scenes. The director had to fine another actress because Brooke's original body double broke her back, The replacement body double for Brooke Shields was originally hired to catch or train dolphins, she was the right body-type, so she was used as a nude double. Kelly Preston auditioned for the role of Emmeline. 'Matt Dillon (I)' was the original choice for Richard but turned the role down. Lori Loughlin was offered the lead role but turned it down. I bought this movie because it had Brooke Shields in it and I was disappointed. May main disappoint the fact that you had to watch the children grow up from kids to adults. To me this movie didn't have any suspense or plot to keep you interested.

I had been wanting to see it for awhile and finally I got my hands on it. When I first put it in, I was immediately interested. When the film was over, I was in complete shock because I was not expecting what I got. I loved how they lost Paddy at a very early age and as the years went on, had to survive by themselves with the little knowledge they knew. This movie is also an excellent coming of age film. I loved how Em and Richard grew up and the film showed how they were discovering themselves in different ways and in the end fell absolutely in love with each other. The acting from Brooke Shields and Christopher Atkins is to die for and spot on (this is not bad acting folks), and of course if you didn't enjoy the movie, there's always the nude scenes and shots to look forward to and keep you interested, which I have to admit I thought were very tasteful. This movie also manages to completely entertain, which is very difficult to do when there are only two main characters throughout most of the film. Also, it was so heart-wrenching how they both ate those berries so they could die peacefully with their baby. I was so upset because if they would've just held on a bit longer, they would've been rescued, which that of course pulled a few tears from my eyes.In the end, The Blue Lagoon is positively excellent and so beautifully touching. The scenery is beautiful, the whole story is beautiful, Brooke Shields and Christopher Atkins are beautifully beautiful and at the very end, I actually wanted to watch it all over again.

44,blazesnakes9,One of the most dumbest movies I've ever seen,1,26 April 2014,"Sure, I don't mind a movie that has a lot of adventure or little of adventure in it. In fact, I like movies that are smart. Smart movies make me an better movie-goer. On the other hand, however, dumb movies make me look a lot slower and less interested as a movie-goer. It is almost like when you are driving your car and your car gets stuck in a pothole. That means there's trouble.Yet, The Blue Lagoon is probably, in my opinion, one of the most dumbest and stupidest movies I have ever seen. How dumb is it? Well, considered the story to be stupid. The movie takes place during the Victorian Period, where two young children who's names are Richard and Emmeline and a galley cook named Paddy, (Leo McKern),are shipwrecked on a South Pacific island. Paddy becomes their parental guidance in the beginning of the movie and advises the young kids to stay away from the other side of the island because the bogeyman lives there. He also establishes an ""law"" by saying that what goes on on the other side is forbidden since he knows that there's human sacrifices going on. Anyway, Paddy soon dies of a drunken binge and that leaves the two kids alone with no one to take care of them. Years past, and the two kids grow up and becomes young adults (or at least what they think are ""young adults"".)As the movie progresses, the young man and the young woman, (both played by Christopher Atkins and Brooke Shields.), start to love each other and participates in a series of sexual activities on the island. Emmeline starts to experienced her menstrual period. On the other hand, Richard is rejected by Emmeline and therefore, he goes off and masturbates by himself.The only question that I have for this movie is this: ""Why would anybody thought this material would work?"" While watching this turkey, I started to care more about the photography more than the actors themselves. Of course, Atkins and Shields are likable movie stars, but to have them take the starring roles in this movie is really regrettable.I never found any of the love scenes to be erotic. Instead, I found those to be very immature and very laughable. I think that when Atkins' character gets rejected by Shields' character, I thought that what he did after he was rejected was very ridiculous and it also look like the movie was trying to get us to maybe laugh at his rejection.The Blue Lagoon is one of those movies where you are taken away by the beautiful cinematography, but you just can't stand the amount of stupidity being made in front of you. The dialogue is so flimsy and at certain times during this entire movie, I thought that the movie would turn into a serious comedy because I couldn't believe anything these two characters said. One fine example of just how really stupid this script is is when Emmeline discovers she's pregnant. ""But, if you touch my tummy right now, you can feel it."" she says. ""Feel what?"" Richard says. Very immature, indeed. It's really humiliating, I think, to put Atkins and Shields into this mess. Fortunately, the two stars were able to brush off this turkey and move on to bigger and better things. But, The Blue Lagoon is one that, I think, would be best forgotten, in my opinion. 0.5 stars",The Blue Lagoon
45,mik-19,Just imagine how they would handle it today?,6,18 April 2005,"Often while watching this movie I asked myself, How would filmmakers tackle this or that scene today, 25 years later? And while I am certainly not going to applaud 'The Blue Lagoon' as an overlooked masterpiece, CERTAINLY not!, it is still a far cry better than the standard teenage soft-porn that is on offer today.Basically, 'The Blue Lagoon' is about two horny teenagers finding their own path towards sexual fulfillment and adulthood, and it strives to point the way for its multitudes of teenage audiences with some dignity and even fearlessness. Today footage of completely naked infants as well as pre-teens and teens would simply never be realized or even permitted in mainstream OR art cinema, God forbid! Brooke Shields' frank alluding to Christopher Atkins' masturbatory habits could, in a movie today, only be filmed amidst a sea of giggles, whereas in 1980 they did it very deadpan and honestly.The film is full of quite touching scenes and gently, if not exactly marvelously acted. I liked Atkins' prayer that the sick Shields be saved, and he doesn't remember how a prayer goes: ""Our Father who art in Heaven ... Kingdom come ... Liberty and justice for all. Amen"". They don't lead terribly eventful lives on that desert island, but their everyday rituals are beautifully filmed, and the underwater sequences are memorable.",The Blue Lagoon
46,stebird,"Ageless, timeless and beautiful",10,5 August 2017,"It may be old, but due to its nature it hasn't aged, The Blue Lagoon is set in the Victorian era, but you wouldn't know it for most of the film's duration.A boy and a girl get stranded on a tropical island where they spend many years, from childhood, through their teenage years and into young adulthood, eventually producing a child that neither knew they were going to have until it popped out. The Blue Lagoon is one of those very rare films that you could easily describe as being practically perfect, the way it handled the couples development as they both grew up was brilliant..., naturally Richard and Emmeline, played by a very young Brooke Shields and Christopher Atkins, begin to experience natural urges, only they don't know what they are and don't understand what's happening to them, they begin experimenting with sexual activity, and as I mentioned earlier, they eventually have a child together.The way The Blue Lagoon handles the sexual nature of the film is subtle and isn't overly exploited like a modern film would, it's raw and it's realistic. I like how the film isn't turned into a fight for survival, there are plenty of provisions and natural resources to keep the couple going indefinitely, therefore instead of being about survival, it's about development and growing up, showing how two youngsters would realistically live in this situation. For his brief stint in the film at the beginning, the ships chef Paddy, who also gets stranded provides some comic relief and the character is superbly acted by the late Leo McKern, but the film isn't about Paddy and he is swiftly killed off before the film truly gets going. For it's day (1980), the beautiful scenery and vivid bright pictures and framing are excellent, I was really impressed how production and filming took place on location in Fiji, rather than an artificial set like most of the films of the era were, this made the whole feel of the film so much better and added something special to the overall finished product.The Blue Lagoon was special then, and even more special now, a lovely picture that deserves to be watched and enjoyed, it may indeed contain its fair share of faults, but the film is so good these faults can easily be overlooked and ignored.",The Blue Lagoon
47,tracywinters-44332,The Yellow Lagoon,1,27 April 2016,"You'll think someone pee'd in the lagoon turning the water yellow in this stinky film about young teens discovering their bodies and the importance of building their outhouse down-wind.Brooke Shields is pretty and Chris Atkins looks at least as good as she does. The two island lovebirds have sex until Brooke gets knocked up. Oh no! All of a sudden, the jungle drums they've been hearing are getting louder, but who the hell cares, because Brooke is giving birth! Holy Coconuts! What to do?! Well, they'll think of something.Popular coming-of-age film has been over-rated for decades. Tune in if you must, but don't go near Atkins' other sea-going adventure, 'The Pirate Movie'.

49,ehoshaw,"Always enjoyable, sweet and moving film",7,12 January 2001,"I have always liked this film, and don't like it when it is criticized so much. Brooke Shields and Christopher Atkins did a wonderful job, they were excellent. Brooke is a beautiful, talented actress. The scenery was just gorgeous, it makes you want to fly off to Fiji where they filmed most of the movie to see what it is really like. The music is also very good. The story starts out with a ship which catches fire, and everyone is forced to abandon ship. Two young children, Richard and Emmeline, as well as a drunken cook named Paddy, get on a lifeboat together and drift on the sea for many days, until they discover land, a bunch of little remote tropical islands. They build a home there. Time passes, and Paddy passes away, but Richard and Emmeline continue growing up together. They get older, and new feelings come over them. They discover many things about adolescence and sex. This is a great love story, sweet and lovable. Brooke and Chris make a great onscreen couple. The sex/nudity scenes are not really that bad at all, they're rather mild. There is more nudity in the underwater swimming sequences, but mostly all of that was done by Brooke's stand-in, a professional diver. I really like this movie, and even though there are a few logic loopholes, it is still enjoyable. My only complaint: I think this film could've gone on for about 5 more mins. or so and explained things a little bit better.",The Blue Lagoon
50,Raptorclaw155,A Film with a Lot of Unrealized Potential,5,14 June 2020,"This film is a bit confusing regarding the direction it wants to take. The Blue Lagoon feels like a film that has certain ambitions that are irreconcilable that it is trying to make a compromise between and it suffers as a result.Some of the cinematography suggests that it wants to be a more explicit film but the editing blatantly contradicts that. This has especially to do with the series of love scenes that take place around half way into the film or so. I don't see the point in showing them if they are just going to be implied most of the time anyway. It seems that the short shots of these scenes that involve the two characters that do exist are there to drum up controversy. The short of it is, those scenes are best left not shown.There are some visually jarring moments in this film. Most particularly, there is a scene where Richard watches Emmeline swim at night and the water has blue animated accents applied to it, which gives the scene a comparatively jarring visual style compared to the rest of the film.There are many swimming sequences in The Blue Lagoon, and while the look of these sequences is very rich, a lot of the time it was used felt like it was being treated as stock footage to transition to another scene.One of the other issues I had with this was the plot point of the people making the drum beat. There is never any real conflict that arises from this, yet we are still led to believe that it is supposed to be some point of tension despite it being dropped from the film once the truth behind it is revealed. Maybe it was too far to go into greater depth with it, and by no means did there need to be a big action sequence or anything, but everything involving the drum beat ends up feeling hollow when it is constantly forgotten about except for in cases where it is convenient to push things along.As far as performances go, Shields' was fine, but Atkins' was not so much. Atkins wasn't bad, but there were moments where anger on his part was more akin to the anger displayed by Johnny at the end of The Room, very nonchalant and offhand. His delivery was also sometimes very monotone and made me wonder at points if he was trying to sabotage the film. His performance throughout the film, as a whole, isn't bad all the way through, but there are moments in this film that left me scratching my head wondering why there wasn't another take done of that line delivery.It has already been complimented in various other reviews but it begs repeating that this soundtrack is excellent. What helps give the soundtrack life is the surprising attention to the audio engineering of it. It is very clear, and rich in a way that I haven't noticed in many other films. I think this film would sound amazing with a good audio setup and this aspect of the film is, by far, its strongest point.The ending, I did not like very much and it was what brought my score down the most, probably. I don't want to spoil anything so I'll keepit vague by saying this, in my opinion, a film where its characters have a bleak outlook requires a bleak outcome. This film could have gone many directions but ultimately the one it decided to go in was disappointing and it's what makes this film feel as middling as it does.This is no masterpiece, nor is it the worst film ever made. It's a film that shows it's only willing to go so far before it has to tone things down. This is part of the reason why I have to say that this film almost feels like a family film, even without the edits. There's never a real sense of tension or danger with the characters despite their predicament. I also felt that this film relied too much on expository dialogue to explain things that could have been communicated better if there was more emphasis on the visual aspect of storytelling- for example we don't need a line where Richard verbally questions why there are ""funny hairs"" appearing on him because it feels like it is trying to spoonfeed to the viewer how it wants them to understand it. It's too explicit in those ways and I think it could have benefited from the power of suggestion. As it stands, it feels like a potentially dark film adapted in a Hallmark-esque way and it's kind of hurt by that in the long run.",The Blue Lagoon
51,deickos,So much beauty,8,18 August 2017,There is so much beauty in this supposedly naive and simple story that is beyond description. Or you can see it as another version of the Garden of Eden from the Bible. I think this is the simplest way to talk about our world: two children living outside it.

52,walkingwithprimeval,Were the critics expecting another Citizen Kane? This grossly underrated film deserves way more respect,7,7 July 2020,"From acclaimed Grease (1978) director, Randal Kleiser, comes without a doubt the most pure-hearted film ever to be made featuring two of the most innocent-minded adolescent characters ever put on screen (that statement also goes for their simplistic childish dialogue, which is only to be expected when they've basically grown up away from civilisation, so it's no wonder they have such immature conversations with each other). Of course, this wasn't the first time The Blue Lagoon novel got turned into a feature-legnth film. There's the 1949 version from the olden black-and-white days, which is very tame when compared with this one's slightly more risqué content.The big allure (and selling point) of a romantic adventure film such as this would obviously be the wildlife cinematography, which at times clearly makes it feel more like a nature documentary than an actual movie with a plot (sort of like how Steve Irwin's 2002 Crocodile Hunter movie worked out, but not quite). The gorgeous scenery alone is enough to entice anyone into wanting to give this a watch (if that's to your liking, as it is mine, then I'm pretty sure you'll end up enjoying it). In fact, it's so serene that I bet the lucky director of photography must've had an absolute blast capturing all this exotic nature footage. Featuring the many tranquil sounds of Fiji's native wildlife intermixed with the soothingly melodic background music, orchestrated by famed conductor Basil Poledouris, it sure makes for some harmoniously peaceful viewing.With a measly 9% rating score on the aggregate review site Rotten Tomatoes, I honestly don't understand why professional critics hated this film and judged it so harshly upon its initial release (guess it was way ahead of it's time for them). This may not be the absolute greatest film ever made, but to seriously hate on it that much? Jeez! I suppose it'll always remain a complete mystery to me (perhaps I'm a little biased towards this movie as I used to watch it whenever it would play on telly, so it left a fairly big impression on me from seeing it at a young age).I'm only going to assume that the public were outraged over the controversial casting of underage actors, Brooke Shields in-particular (who was 14-years-old at the time). It was more so about her, I think, than her older co-star Christopher Atkins (who was 18-years-old at the time). But here's the thing... none of it was overly sexualised! It was all tastefully done in a beautifully natural way, as we saw our two compelling leads fall in love with each other away from the interfering constraints of societal life (and beside that, Shields herself had a 33-year-old woman serve as her body-double for all the scenes briefly requiring some partial nudity... so there's no need to fret!).My only real gripe with the film overall is that the characters look a little too perfect, with their cleaned-up ""glitz & glamour"" Hollywood-type looks (they could be passed off as being fashion models on the front cover of clothing magazines). I mean, they should at least be in a more scruffier condition than what they appeared to be in while living on that deserted island for so many years (but seeing as though this is a fictionalised, and highly romanticised, portrayal of what the idyllic fantasy lifestyle of inhabiting a ""tropical island paradise"" would be like, it's excusable).The Blue Lagoon's legacy lived on; in 1982, there was a hilarious rip-off called Paradise (acting debut of Gremlins starlet Phoebe Cates) which was made to cash-in on The Blue Lagoon's success at the box-office. Then in 1991, a belated sequel titled Return to the Blue Lagoon (starring future Resident Evil actress Milla Jovovich) was released which, although unnecessary, is actually not all that bad and a pretty decent follow-up in its own right. I never even bothered with the pointless 2012 made-for-TV remake, Blue Lagoon: The Awakening (starring former Home and Away actress Indiana Evans), as I figured they'd play it too safe by toning down some of the more exciting elements what made the original so memorable and beloved by just about every generation that sees it.",The Blue Lagoon
53,larrysmile1,NOT A CHILDREN'S MOVIE - FOR YOUNG ADULTS AND OLDER,8,5 February 2002,"The Blue Lagoon (1980) is so very close to the book, Blue Lagoon: A Romance, written in 1907 by H. de Vere Stacpoole and published in January 1908.  The actual book is on the Internet and the dialog in the movie is faithful to the book.  Some dismiss the movie as trivial.  However, consider this.  Brooke Christa Shields was 14 years old (born 1966) when she played Emmeline LeStrange. She had already appeared in 12 prior films.  Christopher Atkins was making his movie debut at the age of 18 years (born 1962) playing Emmeline's cousin, Richard LeStrange (referred in the book by the diminutive name, Dicky LeStrange).  In the book, Emmeline is 8 years old and Dicky is 8 years ""and a bit"" when the story starts.  Emmeline's father died before she was born.  Two years later her mother died.  Her uncle and father's brother, Arthur LeStrange, (veteran actor William Daniels) took guardianship of Emmeline in Boston.  Mr. LeStrange purchased a small estate in Los Angeles and was in route by clipper ship to San Francisco around South America.  The ship, named Northcumberland, had departed from New Orleans bound for San Francisco.  Having rounded the Cape of South America and going off course during a calm, a fire breaks out in the hull of the ship. The cook, Paddy Button, played expertly by veteran Australian actor Leo McKern took Emmeline and Dicky aboard a dinghy launch and attempted to row a safe distance away from the ship before it exploded from gunpowder stored on board.  Mr. LeStrange and ships' compliment were separated in the fog from Paddy, Emmeline, and Dicky after the ship blew up.  Mr. Button and the children drifted in the South Pacific Ocean for about three days and nights until they were brought by the tide to an island named in the book as Palm Tree Island somewhere in the ocean southeast of the Marquesas Islands.  In the movie we see a Boston newspaper with a date that appears to be 1893 floating in the water.  The children and Paddy Button are saved and set up housekeeping as shipwrecked survivors.  For the first 45 minutes of the movie, child actors Elva Josephson and Glenn Kohan play Emmeline and Dicky.  Elva only acted in three movies and two TV appearances while Glenn appeared in this film only and acted no more.  However, they did a good job playing themselves as eight-year-olds.  On the island Paddy tries to be father and mother to the children.  He teaches them the basics of survival, gathering fresh water, harvesting bananas from trees, catching fresh ocean fish, capturing small rabbits, knot tying, hut building, making a signal fire, making a tree calendar to mark the days, and exploring the flora and fauna and caves of the island.  They had rescued a trunk of clothes that the children use as dress up and play items.  Also, there were three-dimension view photos of the day of adults in social activities.  These photos would be useful to educate Emmeline and Dicky in some social graces of civilized people. 
Emmeline had found a keg of rum and a skeleton of another shipwrecked sailor when they first arrived on the island.  After two years on the island, Paddy, drinks himself to death.  It is curious that this small keg would have lasted for two years being the rummy that Paddy was as he tells the children that he has many children in ports around the world.  However, the children discover Paddy's dead body and conduct a burial ceremony as best as they could.  Don't look for this on the TBS ""edited for content"" version, as it's not there.  TBS spoils the movie by cutting out what they feel are ""sensitive"" parts of the movie, albeit, necessary for continuity of the story to retain its TV 14 rating.  (This is not a children's movie.  This is a young adult's movie.  The rudimentary scenes are necessary to be faithful to the book!  If the rating ends up being ""R"", so be it.  Also, this is far from being a ""soft porn"" movie as some reviewers suggest.  This is a story about how people can survive in the late 1800s on a deserted South Pacific Island without the niceties of the then civilized western world.)Enter teens Brooke Shields and Christopher Atkins at about the age of 14 years.  The story picks up as the children have entered into puberty. Brooke (Emmeline) begins to become aware of her changing body turning her into a woman and she experiences these changes alone and confused without another woman to help educate her.  Likewise, Chris (Dicky) is becoming a man and Brooke, although the same age in the story is more mature than Chris and is becoming sexually attracted to Chris' emerging manhood.  What was once child's play and tickle-touch between children, is now, sexually sensitive to young emerging teens.  Critics -- this is Nature at work!  The moviemakers did a wonderful job of portraying this on film. 
Of course, they discover sex.  But, they do not know that it produces children.  Emmeline and Dicky marry each other in a ceremony they devise to show that they are ""civilized.""  They begin to live together as husband and wife.  Ultimately, Emmeline becomes pregnant and finally is aware that there is something growing within her.  Fast forward to the ""Bogeymen"" on the other side of the island.  A tribe of natives had, from time to time, come by boat to the other side of the island.  Here they had a stone idol and sacrificial alter.  At least six times during the film, even when Paddy was still alive, the survivors heard distant drumbeats.  Paddy knew the danger and passed a ""law"" warning the children never to go to the other side of the island.  After Paddy's death, Emmeline and Dicky do go to the other side and discover the idol.  Emmeline thinks it is God.  The edited version leaves out the night spying and confrontation of Dicky with a native.  Get the full version for this ""humane"" meeting of East meets West.  Oh, these are not African peoples. This is a South Pacific movie.  The natives are supposed to be ""Polynesians.""In the book, Emmeline has her child all alone on the floor of the forest while Dicky is returning from spying on the Natives.  In the movie, Dicky returns, ""in the nick of time,"" to witness the child's birth.  No matter. That's Hollywood's movie license.Of course, Uncle Richard has continued to pursue finding his son and niece. The book explains how he comes to know where the children might be.  He hires a ship to search the area of the Palm Tree Island.  Ultimately, Emmeline, Dicky, and baby Paddy (now about 2 years old  -- in the book she names the boy child a girls name, Hannah because she likes the name) put out to sea in the dinghy that is still seaworthy after being shipwrecked for eight years and five months.  After losing their oars during a shark attack, the survivors, without food or water, drift in the ocean for three days before Uncle Richard discovers them.  The movie ends as faithful to the book ending.  The trio is rescued.  When the rescue boat rows out to intercept the dinghy, Mr. LeStrange asks, ""Are they dead?""  The ship's crewman replies, ""No, they're asleep.""Beautiful Brooke and handsome Chris are not to be made fun of.   They acted remarkably well portraying children with limited education and vocabulary. The island scenery is beautifully photographed.  There is a wonderful special effect when Brooke baths in the ocean.  Get the video as TBS took a hatchet to these frames.  If you were living in that era and shipwrecked and survived, you would want your eight plus years on the island to be like Brooke and Chris spent in this film.  Get the video and enjoy.  It's an adult film for mature teens and older adults.",The Blue Lagoon

The only other character of note in the mnovie was Paddy (Leo McKern) although he dies early in the piece.If you took out the wonderful scenery and score to this movie, and then deduct the nudity and beauty of the young Brooke Shields (this movie must have been a pedophiles delight, then you are left with a pretty ordinary movie and script to go with it.I am not sure what ""feedback"" this movie got on release, but it must have been riske for its time given the age of the actors.That aside, viewing the movie late in the 90's the shock factor of nudity is long since gone.

But, unfortunately they are very bad actors (maybe still too young in this movie) Brooke Shields is 14-15 (while filming for this movie)!!!Still, bad acting gets better, and is almost acceptable by the end of the movie.The scenery in this movie is beautiful.And the story is between a boy and a girl , stranded on a beautiful island and coming of age.. probably at around 15, they for the first time in their lives become attracted one to another..The natural relationship and family creation and interpersonal arguing and smiling, and attraction and love and lust and frustration and health and sickness and clashing opinions and trying to figure each other out. etc.. Is again beautiful. Just a classic, that makes a strong impact on the viewer! I also like the ambivalent ending. I believe they got saved. I hope they did.BUT, it is soooooo frustrating! Why?

58,ShadySovereign,Such a sweet film,8,20 August 2005,"For some reason, the rating of this movie is very low-rated. I don't really see much to hate about this movie. It's such a sweet movie.""The Blue Lagoon"" takes place in the early 1900's. It's about a boy named Richard (Christopher Atkins), a girl named Emmeline(Brooke Shields), and a cook who become stranded on an island after the ship was on fire (they got separated from the crew after that).As they are on the island, the cook teaches them how to make fire, tie knots for making shelter, cooking, etc. But later on, the cook dies and Richard & Emmeline have to live on their own.Years later they grow very beautifully. But as their bodies change, their emotions change too. They have fights sometimes, but later they fall in love. And they also have a child later on.The thing I like about this movie is the way a boy & a girl are portrayed when they are alone on an island together. It was nice to see how both of them develop in their teenage years; both of them have noticeable bodily changes and they start to react differently to one another. They eventually discover the secret of love and finally have a child, not knowing how they made the child.Some of the highlights of the movie are the various scenes of Richard & Emmeline swimming naked in the ocean. I think it represents the freedom that nature can provide. Women viewers will especially love seeing Christopher Atkins naked in various scene. Brooke Shields, however, was only 14 years old at the time so a lovely body double (Kathy Troutt) acted in the nude scenes instead. Nevertheless, Kathy is a beautiful body double and I loved every moment of her nude scenes.And finally, if you love sea life, then you will love this film. There are many beautiful underwater camera shots that show lots of sea creatures (even an octopus!).The only bad thing about the movie is that there are some scenes that are very slow-moving, especially the scenes showing wildlife by itself without the actors. But if you love nature, then that won't bother you. Also, there is a slight plot hole in the scene after Emmeline gives birth to the child, since nothing is said about how the baby's umbilical cord was cut off.To sum it all up, this is such a sweet movie. Christopher Atkins & Brooke Shields played their parts well, and the filming location is beautiful. The nude scenes were very natural-looking and gave me a feeling of peace in my mind.

I sort of half-expected a ""Lolita meets Swiss Family Robinson"" with giggles, but that wasn't what I walked away with. Instead I experienced the same sort of feelings of when I first read the book Flowers In the Attic, where young children are imprisoned against their will and grew up with very little adult supervision or normal guidance. They (like the children in the movie) were left to their own devices and budding intellect to figure things out. In truth, Blue Lagoon was a lot more like Robinson Crusoe in that they had very little material things to make do with. Just the simple little things left in a boat were all they had.

This movie is beyond words, and no other movie needs to be made to outrank this or remake this, it's a perfect movie.It's not action, or slasher, or comedy, It's the genre of life.It's just a beautiful picture and you have to see it.

70,markjayaweera,Blue Lagoon one of the best films,8,2 April 2017,"****Contains Spoilers*** First of I have to say Blue Lagoon is one of the best films I have seen in my life. It is now one of my favorites. Because once in a while a rare movie comes along that deals with the human condition, relationships between men and women, desire to raise a family. Their child like innocence is endearing in a harsh world. Yet they survive against the odds. Few movies deal with real issues like this. A movie about the human condition.IMDb's rating is far too low. This movie deserves a solid 8. The very least 7.5. Outstanding movies with a outstanding story like the Blue Lagoon deserve a much higher rating on IMDb.Rarely does a film comes a long and you invest so deeply in their characters. You have to see the movie yourself to know what I mean. While the movie is outstanding, my only complaint if there is, is the movie could have gone for another 10 minutes. To give us some details about what became of Richard, Emmeline and their son at the end.No I don't think they died at the end. However the movie forces us to draw our own conclusions. They probably survived. Was re-united with their father and moved back to San Francisco or Boston. It would have been nice if the made a proper movie sequel. Where after they are rescued they show a bit about Richard, Emmeline and their son their life back in America. After returning did they get married. You want this family to live happily ever after because you emotionally invested so much in their lives and this very moving story. How did they re-integrate after so many years living on a desert island. I would hate to think our innocent hero's, Richard and Emmeline died after all they have been through. A great film. Congrats to all involved in making this movie, 37 years after it was made. This timeless movie with a timeless story has lost none of its resonance or emotional impact.",The Blue Lagoon

72,qubit01,Moviegoers sure have changed,8,14 April 2013,"I was born in '76, and by the time I was ten this movie was already considered a classic. One of the best 'coming of age' stories, not to mention survival stories, ever put to screen. I knew it was a great movie at ten years of age, even though I did find it somewhat boring (most kids aren't into dramas like this). And it gets a lowly five stars on IMDb?? While Prometheus and the Star Trek reboot, etc. have like eight stars???? Maybe modern Hollywood is right to sacrifice good writing and storytelling for pretty pictures- today's audience doesn't seem to be able to appreciate anything but explosions and CGI and 3D and cursing. Eh, but my granddad probably said the same things about my generation, too. But still, five stars??? My lord...If you are considering watching this movie, please ignore the IMDb rating and just see it. If you have the IQ of anyone over twenty, you will most likely enjoy this movie immensely. It IS a classic, plain and simple, so if anything, watch it for that reason, then make up your own mind.",The Blue Lagoon
73,Red66,Critically underrated film that resonates with global audience,8,18 February 2001,"I've never understood the critical slam this film has received. Then I saw the widescreen dvd version and understood; everyone has been watching it in pan and scan! The film is a visual poem. So much of the story telling is done through visual information. The impact of this is lost when the cinematography is altered. Remember that Nestor Almendros received an Academy Award nomination for his work on this film. The film has resonated with global audiences for so long for this very reason. I suggest people watch the dvd commentary with Randal Kleiser and Brooke Shields to get a better understanding of why this film is still such a popular one.
People attack the acting, but these are children left alone with no one to guide them into adult sophistication. Their interaction and reactions to situations are very consistent with this scenario. Yes, the birth scene is a little rushed, but do we really need to see the umbilical cord? Not all films need to be about gritty reality, ala ""Taxi Driver."" No one asks to see the bloody guts of the smashed witch in ""The Wizard of Oz.""It is a beautiful, romantic film that speaks to millions of people. It seems that only the most skeptical cynics cannot embrace this film.",The Blue Lagoon
74,Brian_,Softcore porn masquerading as a movie,3,30 October 2019,"What exactly is some people's obsession with wanting to escape to a deserted island with a beautiful woman? Perhaps they have a fantasy of nonstop, mind-blowing sex. Maybe they want to escape their dreary, boring lives. Whatever the case, that's who Blue Lagoon tries to appeal to. It must have worked when it was released in 1980, as it performed surprisingly well at the box office, but in the era of free, online porn, it feels horribly dated.The focus of this story isn't Emma's and Richard's struggle to survive on their own. The focus is on the underwater shots of naked young people of multiple ages, not just those who are at least 18. Now there is some beautiful imagery of Richard (Christopher Atkins) and Emma's body double, who was needed since Brooke Shields was only 14 at the time of filming. Makes you think twice about wishing that her hair, which strategically covers her boobs for most of the film, were shorter!The realism is woefully bad. The couple eventually has sex off-camera, to the disappointment of many, but they can't figure out why Emma gets pregnant? They build a cabin from just the materials available to them on the island, yet they can't even craft basic shoes to keep them safe from spiny fish? Their diet consists of nothing but the same seafood and fruits day after day, yet they look like models? Come on.But none of this compares to the worst part of Blue Lagoon, which is the natives. There is simply nothing positive to say about this story arc at all. It relies on badly antiquated stereotypes of nonwhite, primitive people who sacrifice each other and pose a clear and present danger to our white protagonists. Worse, this story arc completely disappears at the end of the movie! There is this whole buildup for nothing! That's right, all the foreshadowing that there is going to be a violent confrontation comes to nothing. I don't care if the original screenplay had the natives or not. This story arc is a complete cluster, and the film would have been better had this story arc been removed entirely.I simply can't recommend Blue Lagoon. It's just not good. It's not even campy. The plot is mediocre at best, and some of the characters are just bad. The shots of adult nudity aren't anything you can't find in an average porn. Watch something else unless you have to watch Blue Lagoon for a film class.",The Blue Lagoon
75,stephenmogg,See it again for the nostalgia but expect to be let down.,3,8 July 2002,It was interesting to watch this movie again recently after so many years. I originally saw it in 1981 on release in London at the age of 17. I can remember the almost mythical status the film had generated for itself and the anticipation that the ways of the world were about to be revealed to group of over sexed adolescents. Time has not been a friend to this film and it reveals itself as a real clunker with wooden performances from Atkins and Shields. The only redeeming feature is the cinematography which shows an ability probably not given free reign here. See it again for the nostalgia but expect to be let down.,The Blue Lagoon

Brooke Shields was only 14 years old at the time (and looks it) so you feel a bit weird looking at a naked teenager, but on Wikipedia I learned that all of Brooke's nude shots were done by a body double who was 32 years old at the time.

I was fourteen years old at the time, and am forty-one now. I recently showed it to my niece (15 yo) and my nephew (17 yo). They both enjoyed it. When I told my niece that some people had complained that ""they talk like they're eight years old,"" she remarked, ""Well duh!"" I have to agree: well duh. How else were Richard and Emmeline going to talk? They'd been alone together on that island since they were eight years old. To answer a few common questions: Yes, the movie has a lot of nudity. More than I had remembered. It's so natural and not in any way vulgar or tawdry. It's just as it should be. No, they are not brother and sister. Seeing as how Richard refers to Mr. Lestrange as ""Father"" and Em calls him ""Uncle Arthur,"" I don't see where this sibling idea came from. Yes, they are (probably) cousins. First, second, or kissing cousins we don't know. It's possible they aren't actually related at all. And here's the big spoiler, not just for this movie but for the sequel... NO, they do not die at the end. Lestrange asks ""Are they dead?"" and is told ""No sir, they are asleep."" This is the same as the book. However, in _Return to the Blue Lagoon_, they are in fact dead and only the baby survives. This is also the same as the (second) book.

It's honestly at it's best during the beginning when they still have Paddy (an adult who briefly survived with them and taught them the basics of survival), a salty old sailor that injects some much needed personality into the proceedings and goes downhill from there, which is a shame as there are some themes they could have explored more thoroughly to make it more exciting (such as the native tribe they skirt around for the film's runtime).",The Blue Lagoon
83,donnabarr,The First Time Can Still Be The Best Time,10,29 January 2009,"We (myself and the Nearest) remember when this movie was made, but we never got around to seeing it. This year, 2009, we finally grabbed a DVD from the library. We fully expected the movie to be faded and rather silly. We remembered the controversy about the nude scenes (hello, America and its infernal touchiness about hairless monkey bodies). But the price was right. And we had popcorn.We were pleasantly surprised to discover the DVD print was absolutely pristine. Camera Director Almendros's work was a delight; can you really fault what turns out to be a lovely travel film? And don't we all want to go and live on a tropical island? Discovering Leo McKearn in a major supporting role was a happy surprise. Can anybody go wrong with this gruff old silver-back of an actor? The only nude scene that made us cover our eyes was when McKearn's old cook (ex-pirate?) happily floats on his back in the water. Leo, we love you but you're the reason we WEAR clothes as a species. McKearn's struggling along the beach after the sprinting, giggling children in all their innocent bareness, gasping, ""Come back here! You can't go naked ALL the time!"" was a hoot. It was the emphasis on ""all"" that made it even funnier.Half the fun was watching these two young people build a life based on Tahitian crafts. It's almost a how-to on How To Survive On A Desert Island.We'd only ever seen Brooke Shields in her insanely funny role as the obsessed fan in an episode of ""Friends."" We had no idea she was possessed of such perfect comic timing. The kid can mug with the best of them. Why isn't Shields still acting in comedies? She's got the chops.Nearest said, ""Well, this is going to be soft porn."" But it didn't have the archness of porn. These two kids didn't even have any grown-up words for what they were doing. They seemed like they were having such fun, even when all they were doing was throwing coconuts at each other, or swimming with the baby.Don't watch this for deep messages or social commentary. Watch it for the fun of it. And think about the beach.Note: the Makah tribe up here in Neah Bay (www.makah.com) does a ""Lightning Snake"" dance that feels like the one the men do around the sacrificial rock. Makah whalers would sometimes disappear one year, trapped on outer Pacific islands by the ocean currents, and return when the next season's currents turned homeward. The Lightning Snake they carry in their dance looks oddly like the sacrificial clubs in the movie. I'm not saying there's a relationship anywhere there, but in our publish-or-perish world, an anthropological student scraping for a thesis might look into this to his or her benefit.",The Blue Lagoon

85,superferb,Simple premise well executed,8,14 April 2014,"This is a very simple movie based on a very simple premise taken from a novel. I haven't read the novel but i guess it is probably much more complex and gives much more detail than this flick. But, i absolutely don't think this makes the movie oversimplified. I'd rather call it ""focused"". I usually prefer something little well done over something big screwed up, and this movie is really well done. You can criticize so many things about it: Who cut the umbilical cord? Why are their teeth so perfect? Why is Em's hair always covering her boobs? Why are they wearing cloths at all? It goes on forever. But hey, it's a friggin movie. At the end of the day, the pictures do have the power to stick with you, and there are some moments that are indeed thought inducing. It's just not meant to be realistic, it's an allegory, and an allegory is allowed to pimp up the beauty as long as it gets the meaning across. It may be realistic, but it doesn't have to. And since a) it's an allegory an b) nobody knows how one would behave and speak in such a situation 'in real life', i can't see why the acting would be bad or ""unrealistic"". It is theater play, but a good one. Focused on what this tale is about, courageous to be corny at times, and tight in terms of not dropping out of character. Cinematography is great, the editing flawless and the score, though a little overly sweet at times, beautiful. And i do think that pretty much everyone in western civilization can in some way relate to the story; i don't think anyone will be totally indifferent towards this movie, it will do something with you.

The setting was beautiful, and the cinematography is very well done.  The underwater shots were breathtaking, and the cinematographer has a brilliant sense for the use of light and shadow.  I can easily see why the cinematography was nominated for an Academy Award.  The film's score is also well done.Two crucial elements fell far short, however.  First, the script was horribly done.  The dialogue sounds completely awkward.  The other major element that fell short was the acting skills of the lead players. Certainly, they are both very attractive to look at.  It's too bad that neither one of them knew how to act.  Brooke Shield's Razzie for this movie is well deserved.  Had both of the actors been given extensive acting lessons, or perhaps if the director were fired and replaced by one who could develop the acting abilities of the stars, this could have been a great film.  Unfortunately, despite the beautiful cinematography and musical score, the horrible acting prevents this film from even being a good film.",The Blue Lagoon

The acting was over-the-top for the first hour, but for the rest of the movie I thought it felt more genuine and considerated for the most part. I think it worked particularly well at the sequence when Emmeline has just had the baby and they have no idea _why_ she has had it and tries to feed it fruit. I'm thinking perhaps their acting was meant to be a bit exaggerated to emphasize how they sort of remain children since all they have is each other with no other contact with other people or impacts, apart from their memories. However, the dialogue came off as clumsy at times though.Further I would've thought it would be interesting to see Emmeline and Richard in ""the real world"", the civilisation, because surely these crucial years on the island affected them in many ways. How would they differ from other young adults? How would they perceive a world that they were never really part of? Maybe that was what they ending was trying to tell – that Emmeline and Richard would never be able to fully adapt to the society, considering it was so far from what they knew. As viewers we actually don't know know if they do die, if the berries are _that_ poisonous, although that is what we can assume, but still – the last lines are: ""are they dead?"", ""no sir, they are asleep"".

Emmeline and Richard, cousins (I think?), become lost on a tropical island after something strange involving fire happens to their ship (this is never really made clear).Along with them is the ship's robust old cook, Paddy. Paddy's character is not really clear, but he sort of just conforms to what the script calls for at any time. He is a father-figure, a raging drunk, a pervert (he chases the young Emmeline and Richard down the beach telling them to take their clothes off), and an architect all in one. But, tragically, Paddy dies of something-or-other involving a barrel and a spider and another island and some unfortunate sleep-walking, and the kids are left to fend for themselves in a wilderness suspiciously devoid of any wildlife besides mangoes.Of course, our young protagonists do a bang-bang job of surviving after the loss of their dear Paddy. They manage to build a three-story, weather proof house, complete with numerous front porches. Richard hunts for fruit and Emmeline twiddles her thumbs as she waits for puberty. Perhaps she does the housework, though one can't really be sure.They spend their free time swimming nude in the ocean and, lo and behold, grow into lustful teenagers; Richard a strapping young lad of unnaturally large biceps, and Emmeline a beautiful, scantily-clad young woman. Emmeline, somehow, without the conveniences of modern bathrooms, manages to maintain meticulously-groomed fingernails and silky-smooth legs. Her hair, however, remains thoroughly uncombed. As Emmeline and Richard grow, they find that they are having ""funny"" feelings for each other. The budding teenagers can't explain their feelings, and neither, really, can the audience. Emmeline, in some of the worst imitations of teenager flirting ever recorded in America, tells Richard that she's been having weird feelings for him. But, bashfully, she tells him that they are just feelings, and don't mean anything.Richard is having similar feelings for Emmeline, but refuses to admit it and, instead, hurls into unexplainable fits of adolescent rage, throwing things and yelling and even managing both at the same time. Here's where the real comedy comes in. Christopher Atkins struggles mightily in the role of a socially underdeveloped 13-year-old. It is physically clear that the real Atkins is at least seventeen, and the only support that he has for his being a shipwrecked adolescent is his voice cracking.And... on and on the movie plods. Never stopping but never really getting anywhere, either.

(I am 35, I wouldn't be able to make such an object within my whole life). The parody in ""Top secret"" movie was very clear. Than, I can accept that 8 years old kids hadn't seen pregnant woman ever before and that they know nothing about pregnancy, but I CAN'T accept the same kids perfectly know how to cut the umbilical cord of a newborn child. At the same time, they'd never heard of or seen mothers suckle their babies! Ridiculous! Than, it is also pretty impossible to share such a small island with savages and never to be seen by them for several years. These few examples are enough for me to consider this movie a peace of crap. I gave 2/10 only for some really nice scenes of nature and two young beautiful people. And yes, I'm not sure whether the parrots have been credited, but they should have been!",The Blue Lagoon
98,galocke,Kiddie-porn goes mainstream,2,4 September 2014,"Wow. Gorgeous island photography. A lush music score designed to generate two full hours of spine-shivers. A pair of absolute hunks attracting more audience jealousy than a Clark Gable or a Grace Kelly could ever hope for. Dialogue cleverly scripted to suggest a truncated childhood education. And all of this for one purpose only: To wrap a huge dose of titillating kiddie-porn inside a package with enough pretenses of respectability to survive in mainstream movie theaters. And, judging from all the rave reviews I'm seeing on IMDb, the perpetrators of this ""love story"" achieved just what they desired. Likewise, the vast majority of the movie's audience got exactly what they expected and wanted -- and anybody who denies they ""wanted"" it is fooling him- or herself.",The Blue Lagoon
99,lonecastle,Not such a nostalgic trip,4,11 March 2020,"I loved this movie when I was younger, but can't understand why.
It has very little of interest beyond, ""oh look puberty"".
The scenes between the two are painful. I understand their language would be childlike as there was no one around to improve it. But why are their mannerisms still infantile? Humans mature naturally, that's why adults don't behave like toddlers. It has nothing to do with learned behaviours.
Also, why on earth do these two not understand that they'd grow up to look like adults. They lived among children, teenagers and adults for 8 years, how can they not understand that they wouldn't stay as children forever?
I also don't believe they'd have sexual feelings for each other. They've lived as brother and sister for half their lives, they wouldn't see each other that way. Step-siblings don't start shagging just because there is no one else around to knock boots with.
And why do they bath in the drinking water when they have an entire ocean?
I should have left it in the past.",The Blue Lagoon

101,djson1,THIS IS NOT BAD ACTING!! Please remember this...,8,23 December 2000,"After reading all the critiques and reviews, there's just one thing that all of you have to remember: THE ACTORS WERE SUPPOSED TO BE PORTRAYING TEENS WITH THE SOCIAL MENTALITY OF 7 OR 8 YEAR OLDS.  Many critics were saying that the dialogue and the acting was bad, but in actuality, the acting is very good for what the plot called for.  Brooke Shields and Christopher Atkins were supposed to portray young adults who were 'cut off' from the rest of the world at a very young age.  That's why they were supposed to portray two people with the limited education, mentality, vocabulary and speech of 7 or 8 year olds.  It would really have been unrealistic if they had more developed dialogue, since they had nobody to further their speech skills on an island with only two people...who were still both mentally children!  That is why they show scenes where they sing very incomplete songs, refer to San Francisco as ""Sanfarisco"", and forget their daily prayers.In light of all this, I think they did a very good job of acting and the writers did a very decent job of limiting the dialogue to the speech abilities of young children.However, there are some unbelievable and unexplained scenes, such as the giving birth scene.  How do they cut the umbilical chord off?? And some other minor details should have been explained, but overall: A very beautiful and romantic story with a happy ending.An 8 out of 10.",The Blue Lagoon
102,SLKneeland,"This movie is, above all, HONEST",10,11 January 2009,"I adored this movie. I thought it was stunningly honest, above all else.About the nudity: Would I have liked this film half as much without the nudity? Of course not- it all goes back to what I said about honesty. What would you do if you were alone on a desert island with your best friend for years? I loved that the director wasn't afraid or ashamed to portray the most believable scenario, the one we all know is likely. It didn't even feel like a movie- it felt like a private glimpse into their story. It wouldn't have been the same if they had been covered up and ashamed AS IF SOMEONE WERE WATCHING.About the birth: Um, humans have been having children unassisted for thousands of years. It is not too far-fetched to believe that these kids could take care of the situation. Nor is it far-fetched to think that two Victorian-era children were uninformed about pregnancy and nursing.The acting: Of course it was awkward! Don't you remember what middle school was like? Don't you remember the secrets you thought you had to keep, and the confusion and the self-consciousness? I thought the film was brilliant at portraying this.I loved that the characters reverted to their vague childhood memories of civilization. The 'dud n' berries' were a cute return to their early education, as is the prayer ""Oh father who art in heaven, kingdom come, with liberty and justice for all"" that Richard says when Em gets sick.I hope this movie is never abused for the nudity of children, but I think that anyone who obsessed over it as critically sexual didn't watch the movie as it should have been watched.",The Blue Lagoon

I cannot believe the rubbish and stupid nieve reviews I've read about how inappropriate the nudity is. Grow up for christ sake.

104,gfreeman4,Not Bad!,6,12 January 2019,"So, I for one was not around when this movie came out originally, but I ended up watching it the other day for the first time. To be honest the movie in the beginning didn't appeal to me. I felt like the acting was horrible and I didn't understand the plot at first. But as the movie went on and the kids got older I really ended up liking the movie. The events that occur and the way these kids act upon them is pretty accurate to how a teen would react to living on an island, cut off from civilization, for almost their entire lives. As for the acting: it's different from the generation of actors I've seen most of my life, so I guess I could have had a tiny bias toward it. Other than that the movie is good and is definitely a movie I'd recommend.",The Blue Lagoon
105,workshyslacker,Endearing romance,9,2 April 2010,"*SPOILERS AHEAD*I must admit that I only watched this film because it was one of those films I was banned from watching as a child when it came on television. I wasn't even born when it first came out but I had heard of the criticism, controversy and numerous bad reviews for the poor acting and infantile dialogue, the only saving graces being the music and cinematography.I was very surprised to find that I enjoyed it immensely. It was one of those films I couldn't stop watching for a whole week and that's why I'm rating it a 9/10. It was romantic, tender, and heart-breaking. True, there are many flaws so I'll list the Good and the Bad.The Good 1. Storyline; Those who are looking for action will be disappointed; the film is a leisurely romance that examines the human condition if children were raised isolated from the rest of civilisation and how they would react to the many different themes of love, sexual wakening, coming of age, survival, parenthood, and death. The use of the old black and white pictures was a good way to show the different stages of the two main protagonists Richard (Atkins) and Emmeline (Shields) as they grew up. 2. The Music underscored their emotions effectively e.g. the mournful reprise when they both committed suicide after they thought their child had died. 3. The Cinematography; the underwater scenes and island are lush and beautiful; perfect for a rainy day and recalling that last holiday. 4. The Editing; I loved the way it cut from Richard looking at the bleached bones of Paddy (McKern), their mentor, and looking at his own hands, his ribcage and then cutting to him examining his newborn son's hands and feet. It had a message for all audiences; a father's love and the cycle of life and death. 5. The Acting; (also see the Bad). I'm in two camps about this. The reviewers that criticise the dialogue have clearly failed to grasp that the characters have a mental age of eight and stopped receiving education since they were shipwrecked! The best acting was the facial expressions from both Shields and Atkins when they were going through difficult stages or realising a life-changing epiphany; Shields when she went through menarche and Atkins when he failed to hail down the ship for their second chance of rescue because he did not want to go back to civilisation, now being content with his life on the island. The best acting was from Atkins who had the most varied facial expressions than Shields. Although he won many Razzies for his later performances, people forget he was nominated for a Golden Globe for this film! 6. The Ambiguous Ending; It stuck to the source novel and was very brave. Okay, it was ambiguous but that's how the author intended. And it allows everyone to assume that they lived/died according to their preferences. Personally, I think they died because the sequel (the book sequel not the inferior film sequel) states that they died. And I think they would never have survived in Victorian civilisation after their experiences on the island. 7. The Romance was handled sensitively. The characters went through the confusion and antagonism of puberty realistically and very amusing at times (especially the implied masturbation scene). The love scenes have been labelled as ""soft-core"" but that implies it was for cheap titillation. Personally, I think they were beautiful and tender. And please, enough with the criticism that they were first cousins (see the original book). The history of Monarchy in all cultures is built on consanguineous marriages, it was legal in Victorian times and still legal in Europe today. Finally, this is not ""kiddie-porn"" as Atkins was 18 and the nude scenes with Shields was a body double. She also had her hair glued to her chest in the topless scenes. The male nudity seemed appropriate as they thought they were the only people on the island and would you go swimming in the sea with your clothes on ALL the time? The Bad 1. Plot inconsistencies; too many (a) how did they build that magnificent hut/condo? (b) where did they get those tools e.g. the saw/axe Richard carries? (c) how come they looked so healthy with perfect teeth and clean nails? (d) who cut the umbilical cord? (e) and why didn't Emmeline just jump off the boat and grab that stupid oar? Just shut your eyes and ignore these inconsistencies and chalk it up to a romantic fantasy :-)2. The Acting; (See the Good) A good proportion of the way the lines were delivered were unconvincing, flat and in Shields' case more than a little whiny (but perhaps these were in context with their mental age). Perhaps if this was a silent film it would have fared better. So give the Blue Lagoon a try before you write this film off. It is a classic.",The Blue Lagoon
106,Reebiebaby64,A pretty Island but...,1,29 December 2019,"Absolutely the worse acting I'd ever seen, until ""Endless Love"" and the Shields version of ""Saraha."" Why they chose the worst actress in the galaxy to act in this teenage skin flick is beyond me. Atkins isn't much better, but he does show a bit more emotion that Shields, who I christened ""the stick"" many years ago.I saw this turkey when it first came out. I was sixteen.

Whatever one wants of a movie is very personal I quess, as for me, I want to be transported away, and this movie did that.

112,reviewdvd,Flawed but Moving,8,8 August 2003,"Have you ever purchased a DVD, saying to yourself, `I always loved this movie when I was..' If you fill in the blank with something along the lines of `a kid,' or `in high school,' or `growing up,' you have just purchased something based on an evaluation of a child, albeit the child being you! Occasionally, we still enjoy the movie. It may be that you had extraordinary taste when you were a child, or more likely, you got lucky. Most times, these movies from our memory lanes seem `just OK,' now that you are viewing the film through the eyes of an adult--with life experience comes a more critical mind--the same jokes aren't as funny and the melodrama seem unreal and unrelated to you.So when the anamorphic widescreen DVD of the Blue Lagoon was released in the fall of 1999, I was hesitant (having been burned by so many 80's movies that I just can't enjoy any longer). I am glad that I rented this. Even after 23 years, I found the Blue Lagoon to be a wonderfully poignant film. The movie is not a flawless masterpiece. The stand-in for Brook Shields looks like she's 30-years old. I'm not sure if there were new laws after Pretty Baby which prevented Shields' nudity or the decision was due to the negative criticism of her nudity in Pretty Baby, but every nude shot of our heroine is that of a body double who indeed looks much older.Whenever the audience can detect a `trick' it pulls them away from the movie, reminding the audience that they are indeed watching just a movie. This is not always undesirable. Some films succeed at an artistic level, establishing a dialogue between film-maker and audience through the very conscious awareness by both parties that this is indeed nothing more than a film. Most movies, however, desire to draw the audience in with a moving story and characters about whom we care deeply. Blue Lagoon has a great story to tell and through very interesting characters. The cinematography is just as fresh as it was in 1980, and the director makes very interesting choices. I got lucky with the Blue Lagoon which impressed me deeply when I initially experienced it as a pubescent boy of 12-years, and it still resonates in my adult mind. A beautiful film! A heartfelt recommendation!For those who commented that the movie could have been better if they dealt with more...When adopting a book, you choose the element(s) that moves you the most. Douglas Stewart's script focuses on the sexual awakening of adolescents whose only guides are their instincts. Stacpoole's novel deals with a lot more, but if you tried to make the entire novel into a movie, it would be 40 hours long!",The Blue Lagoon

After reading some of the comments here I'd like to see it again on wide screen.The only real fault I have with the movie and I guess even with the book's plot is that the storyline assumes that the kids don't know about sex. They've been living in the wild 24/7 for what, six years! They had plenty of animals to observe. After living with all of the animals around them I tend to think that they would put two and two together, or I guess I should say one plus one equals three...I'll have to look into who the book's author was.

This movie is a gem - I missed out on seeing it in the theater as I didn't start high school until 1983.It is a skillfully woven tale of survival, friendship, love and the human condition. For my tastes there are a few scenes that are over the top goody-goody, but given the nature of the film I just let them slide.In typical US moronic fashion, the film was panned by critics and considered to risqué for teens to watch given partial nudity in scenes throughout the movie. I guess its better to read National Geographic in the school library. Sure, I'm male, and Brooke Shields is easy on the eyes, but any mainstream internet selfie is more likely to be considered more perverse than anything in this film.",The Blue Lagoon
116,cjmg85,"Despite loving it, kind of wish I had never seen it",10,18 September 2010,"Warning, will contain spoilers: If only life could be so kind and perfect as the kids in this movie had it. Growing up on a deserted island after their ship catches fire, they spend the first couple of years (from age 8 or so) learning how to survive and live off the land from Paddy Button. He teaches them how to catch and cook food, how to tie knots and build things, how to make fire, etc.Paddy dies however after a couple of years (possibly less, not sure), and the two children are left to grow and survive on their own. With absolutely no influence from modern society, with no further adult guidance, they learn everything else about life and love on their own. They develop a powerful love and passion for one another, have built a home together, discover sex and eventually had a child (though having no former knowledge of sex or where babies come from, how the child came about is a mystery to them), but they become very great and attentive parents and to young Paddy, named after their old mentor. Natural parents indeed.They live life totally undistracted and undisturbed from anything modern, and have nothing but love and attention for each other and their baby. Completely unspoiled by anything or anyone else. Real. Pure. True. Who wouldn't want the life that they lived? Their love for each other, and for their child, is so deep that when they fear young Paddy is dying, they do what is necessary to see to it that they can all die together, peacefully, after becoming lost from their island in their rowboat. They are found at the end by Richard's father / Em's uncle, but I believe close to death, too close to save them, and if not, I feel great sorrow for them, because they'd probably never see their island, their home, ever again.The reason I say I kind of wish I had never seen the movie is because it kind of gives you a depressing feeling. At least to me. Wishing that could have been my life. So pure and unspoiled by anything. To never have a feeling of shame or guilt. To feel true, raw love and passion unimpeded by anything, or anyone. Having to work hard, yet never having to worry about things like money and a work schedule. Never having to worry about childcare, because they could do it themselves 24/7. Things like that. In a next life, if there is one, I would totally live their life if I could have the choice to. They certainly had a true paradise. In every meaning of the word, and were certainly able to life life to its fullest, with all that it has to offer. The way life was meant to be.",The Blue Lagoon

Appearance of Brooke Shields was really wonderful. Though nudity revealed a bit more than need but never crossed the limit. Costumes of Brooke required more logical thought. It could be made more realistic minimizing nudity. Availability of modern cloths after years of their survival looked a bit odd. Location of the movie really suited with the original novel's plot and script. Dialogues were well articulated.

118,ryanhogg1994,Love in its natural form,10,26 September 2014,This film had a pure feel to it with actors that wonderfully played anti social teens; not by choice might I add. The constant struggle to maintain their human selves were slowly destroyed by the crippling instincts of biology. The film makes aware the role that society has on our lives. The separation from society and lack of influence of society is why this film has created purity because without expectations and rules what is left to guide us and control us. The purity is further shown in the characters through the child like behaviour they have which made me think innocence of a child perhaps. Lastly Randal Kleiser has created what I can only call a pure love story.,The Blue Lagoon

126,biloveyo,"sigh, it will take me a while to get over this fascinating film.",10,12 December 2006,"What a beautiful, heart stirring film. It stands to quench a thirst in all of us, a fantasy our physce prays for. Such raw love, real love, virginity. Most people lack this gift and amazing power to create such pure love. We just don't realize that sex is more then pleasure... it's intertwined with love. In this movie two innocent young people have the chance to experience love in its purest sense. They literally don't know any one else to distract them from one another,to distort their loves focus. They place all their love solely on the one person they ""ever knew"" and ever loved. Living together, working together, playing together, crying together, laughing together, for as long as they can remember. Whether Richard and Em would have been attracted to each other in the real world makes no difference. Here their souls were tied together. Here all alone on this tropical island they really experienced life.Em's decision not to light the warning flare was disgusting, horrifying and completely selfish. She knew quite well how much Richard was dying to return to San Ferisco. I mean just look at the evil guilty look pinned to her face as she decides to sit idly on the steps of her hut watching the ship go by. Can you blame her though? not really. She was so happy there,so peaceful. Although she never ""experienced the real world"" she sensed that her serene, happy, paradise life would be completely dissolved and crushed if they were to return to civilization. As angry as Richard was she knew it was the best thing for him to. Indeed the love they created and the short pure happy lives they soon led is breath taking. I'm thrilled that the film ended where it did, because quite frankly I had no interest in seeing their pure beautiful life shattered as they would soon be forced to partake in the crazy hectic world we all exist in. Interestingly enough They do have a glimpse of some of the world's pain and insanity. Richard watches as a helpless man is killed and his confusion is not much different then ours as we ponder the many wars, genocides, and killings occurring now or in our past. I was forced to watch parts of this film over and over again and must part with it. I must face the fact that even in a dozen lifetimes my life will never come close to the pure love, romance, happiness and serenity that these two individuals partook of. This truly makes me depressed and I sort of wish I had never seen the film. On a happier note I can still try and emulate the concept of pure love displayed in the film. To discover an individual whom I could love, and focus on as if we were both ""stranded on an island, and pay no attention to the fact that there are other attractive people out there constantly tempting me. Because the two of us are alone, and we love each other and our love will only grow as we partake in life's many circumstances. This also makes you think... could there love ever have faltered? I mean many people in ""love"" after a bunch of years discover that they aren't ""attracted"" to their mate ""anymore."" They lose interest and move on,sometimes successfully but lets be real.. usually not. They only find the same cycle occurring again and again. I firmly believe, on the same note discussed above that Richard and Em's love would have been complete and unfaltering. With no other options, with not other obstacles they would not be blinded as so many of us are into thinking there's always someone better. Richard and Em would have grown old together, happy and content with their love never faltering. ( that is if one of them didn't die of disease.... well lets be realistic, this is just a movie and being out there in the wild with out any form of medication and knowledge in that field can easily pave the way to disease and death. Hey perhaps it could happen, but I'm surprised one of them didn't come down with some life threatening fever or cold before there adolescence and died, well movies are movies) again I must part with this beautiful film and try and take those happy feelings inside and utilize them in privative way. sigh, it will take me a while get over this fascinating film.",The Blue Lagoon
127,dramacutie09,i was wondering,10,8 January 2007,OK so im young to be watchin R movies legally but i was wondering how old are all of the other people who take time to comment the movie. i am in love with this movie even tho i was born in 1990 if i was Brooke Shields in that movie i would LOVE it not only does the movie have this sensual out look on life of 2 kids coming into adulthood and finding them selves in a situation they have never been in before and as well as having the most gorgeous co-star of the 80's it would be a dream come true but then again i am an aspiring actress but any ways i was just wonderin how old people here are to see if im jus out of my mind for being in love wit this movie at my age or to know if im one of many,The Blue Lagoon
128,katiekutie1234,Beautiful comming of age story!,10,7 February 2002,"One of the best movies I have seen in a long time! This movie, I think, beautifully portrayed how two children/ teenagers with no outside interference would handle their physical and mental maturing. While this movie had its flaws, it also stayed basically true to the amount of verbal knowledge and social graces which would have been acquired by the time they were 7 or 8. This movie also had humorous moments interspersed throughout the plot. I highly recommend this movie if you are looking for a film which speaks to primal naivety.",The Blue Lagoon

I saw the movie and i was fallen in love on Brooke Shields. At that time (i was 14 years) i liked the movie verry much, i still love the movie verry much. Now i have as a moviebuff enough knowledge what i can see as a masterpiece and a real dissapointment. I am  someone what have another meaning than others.

130,angie-265,Lovely beach film of love,8,24 January 2011,"We watched this over and over again when it first came out and we were quite young. Last night I watched it with our teenage daughter. It has lost none of its simple appeal. The story has stood the test of time.While there are some flaws in continuity and such, it is still a joy to watch. The film possesses a story and carries out through to completion. Great explanations of details are not gone into but they way the screenplay was written allows one to understand all that is necessary for the story to flow nicely. For a film with few actors the dialogue is rich enough and at times even funny. I think it is a classic from the 1980s.",The Blue Lagoon
131,wizvikz,a nice watch,7,20 November 2007,"cast aside the geographical and choreographic mistakes. its a very sweet movie with a charming love story. the boy and the girl are sundered from the known world. its very interesting to notice how they respond to the call of life instinctively. not only physical but the psychological development of two teenagers have been portrayed quite soundly. i did not see any disproportional projection of their sex life ahead of this exploration in mentality. the score, situational, is well done. only weak point is the excessive showcase of wildlife, which often makes it look like a discovery documentary. another thing i didn't understand is that why the savages never come to the other part of the island. overall, perfect acting renders the theme worthwhile. cheers for the blue lagoon.",The Blue Lagoon

I saw it for the first time last night, and when it was over I was speech-less. For the first time in my life!. I just lied there and thought of how wonderfull it must have been to be there and feel that closenes! Shore they didn't have so much knowledge of the world, like when she got here piriot, or why they was growing so much hair on Richard. Or the time that she became pregnant and they didn't know that. But still, bein there and have those feelings. Just havin someone that take cares of you and who allways will be there. It was romantic and so sweet! I sat there and wished that it was me that were there, they went trow some hard times but that life you know. Lovin each other like that is one of a kind, I think everyone at some point wants that kind of lovin. I know I want it! I still have the same fellings as last night after the movie, it really makes you think, doesn it?. And the ending, it was perfect. Diein in each others arms, that just so beatiful! I love this movie and I recommend it to everyone who want's to feel loved only for just a moment. 'Cause thats what this film does, you can actually feel the love throw the tv!!

134,joshcarter1991,The blue Lagoon is awesome!!!,10,7 April 2008,"I watch all the top movies such as Die Hard 4, all the James Bond's and more importantly, Castaway and i still rate this film 10 out of 10 considering the time period it was made in. Apart from the pointless Special Effects which i know have a meaning, i think this is definitely a film worth watching whatever the age. Also, i have read that people are criticising the bad continuity and obvious problems that would occur such as the umbilical cord (excuse the bad spelling)i think they did a great job as going into too much detail would spoil the film and perhaps put off the viewer plus who wants to see the cutting of the umbilical cord anyway...? i know i don't!

135,fender_string,"""Everything Patti told us was a lie""",9,3 June 2008,"Towards the end of the movie when Richard and Emmeline are older they think about what Paddy told them when they were younger. Richard quotes ""everything Paddy told us was a lie"", I believe this is foreshadowing of the end. Rewind to the beginning of the movie, Emmeline almost eats a berry off a bush but Paddy warns that she'll end up ""dead and buried"" if she swallows one of those. Now put it all together, at the end they still have Paddy's knowledge ingrained in themselves and believe the berries will work for suicide. ""everything Paddy told us was a lie"". I thought it was a good find and cool concept, watch the movie again and try to catch the significance.",The Blue Lagoon
136,xoxocheerdancegirl,My all time favorite movie!!!!,10,17 August 2008,"WOW, the blue lagoon where do I even start with that movie. First of all I absolutely adore this movie. It is my all time favorite movie. This movie is about Richard and Emmeline who are both young at first. They are traveling at sea to San Francisco with Richards father but their ship catches on fire so they have to get off it immediately.Richard and Em are separated from Richards Uncle and they are both in a boat with Paddy (the ships cook). Eventually they find an island to stay on. Paddy teaches them how to survive on the island. but one day paddy dies and the two children are left alone. They both travel to a different island and grow up their.they make themselves a shelter,etc.They both are starting to have strange feelings about one another while their bodies are changing.Thir childhood affections lead to a more profound love.People may think this movie is corny but I love it. May I add that Christopher Atkins was gorgeous in that movie!!! I am a teenager and I own this movie. I have owned for only a couple of weeks and i already have watched it like 60 times. Yes, their is nudity in this movie and yes it is rated R but I think it is such a natural story about love. Whenever I watch the end of the movie it makes me cry and people who have seen it would know why.People who have yet to watch it will find out. I love this movie and I suggest it to anyone who likes love stories.",The Blue Lagoon
137,red_wine44,plain magical,10,13 March 2009,"When I first saw this movie I was just a little child, maybe 7-8 and it was pure magic. so beautiful and inspiring. Today I'm 25 and I just saw this movie again yesterday on TV and it blew me away. I did not remember this movie at all, it went somewhere to the back of my head and stayed there for 18 years. Seeing it from a grownup perspective is totally different. The acting is horrible and sometimes the story doesn't make sense but all that doesn't matter.The movie is still beautiful and naive and just makes you feel good. During the whole movie I had a funny feeling in my stomach and a smile on my face.. the emotions and nostalgic feelings this movie had brought to me after all those years makes it worth a 10 star score to me.",The Blue Lagoon
138,maddy-art,best romance I've seen so far.,10,17 October 2009,"I saw this movie when I was eight (I'm 14 now). I thought it was going to be one of mum's 'yawn' movies me and my dad put it. So at the beginning it was 'ok so it's an old movie, set in an old time' so I saw Em and Richard get on the boat with Paddy and they sail of. So it started them as children living on an island and Paddy teaches them to live of the land, find food, fish, build a hut and behave. But he finds rum or something and goes swimming after getting drunk. Of course he dies which leaves Em and Richard to fend for themselves with the knowledge they know from civilization and Paddy and decide to move to another island nearby. They both grow strong and beautiful. Now i was reading comments and they were being prissy about that saying ' They live on a island for gods sake shouldn't they have died'. I see what your getting at. The movie was first a book written in 1908, the author,Henry De Vere Stacpoole, based his book on Adam and Eve. Two adults/late teens, living in a paradise with a rule not to eat a certain fruit. Bible apple, movie Berrie. Anyway, Paddy taught them to find food, build huts and other stuff. They were young when they were stranded, so they don't know about sex or puberty which they find strange, especially about babies's being born as they only know the cabbage patch story and after the decide to stop fighting and realize they love each other they accidentally create a baby. Now the other question is how is the baby so healthy, my theory is that because of how his parents are so healthy from eating healthy foods and much exercise. So stop complaining that it's impossible to be that fit from living on an island, look at the city, we are fat with pimples, while they live on a island that grows only fruit and they swim and play as fun. The reason I love this movie is because how they find pure and natural love that is not seen anymore because we are into money, looks and people great at sex. Not passion, or the innocent way's can be sexy in someone else's eyes, or the beauty of someones soul. The acting was fine, the story was memorizing and the love of them was captivating. If your confused by the ending then i'll put it straight. If you hate spoilers stop right here and go o the next comment and believe what you think happened.Em and Richard decided to welcome death as baby Paddy to what the thought was dying. They took the berries, kissed and waited, only to be found hours later. They were breathing but minutes later they succumbed to death and Baby Paddy became an orphan but was adopted by a woman named Sarah and wound back onto the island. And I'm gonna leave it there so I hoped this will make you see that The Blue Lagoon is the best romance movie so far. God I wish/hope they remake it with the same beauty. Hope this explains.",The Blue Lagoon
139,KCost82,GREAT MOVIE!!!,10,18 January 2004,"This is one of the most touching movies I've ever seen. It makes you look at life in a whole other way, if only for a few hours after watching it. This movie is humbling to watch. It makes you care less about money, expensive things and every other material item. I am partial to these types of movies though. The whole idea of growing up away from society with all it's problems with the simplest of things being important to you. To catch all your food that you eat and pick it from the endless fruit trees. To be with only one other person that you will love unconditionally  as much as you do yourself. I can't even put most of the feelings I get from watching this movie into words. Except that I find myself wishing that it had happened to me. I think I could be the happiest person in the world. It seems so peaceful.",The Blue Lagoon
140,fallenangel3,simply wonderful,8,5 April 2004,"This movie is simple, it captures what life is really about. Without the many special effects that is used in movies now and even in the past it is a absolutely wonderful movie.A young romance blossoming between two kids who have known nobody else but themselves. They discover everything in life without all the interference of the rest of the world.The low rating on this movie is unjust, it deserves a lot more then it is given, this is possibly one of the best movies I have ever seen.It is absolutely wonderful for a romantic night just you and the television. And the nudity? it was exciting when I was younger, it becomes a bit too much as I am getting older, but it does not bother me. It fits the movie, the pure soul of the movie.",The Blue Lagoon

It has been 20 odd years and now we both know why. Our expectations were shuttered as well as the distant romantic view we thought we had for this ""movie"". I think that it became a hot in the 80s just because of the nudity. Cant seem to find a single other reason. I have become 8% less intelligent after this. Seriously!

142,mrsdhunter5242004,Great movie!!!!!,10,9 October 2004,This was a really good movie and it seems very realistic....I mean how many kids growing on on an island practically alone could do what they did? They did their best for being uneducated and young in love. I know it would be hard for any woman to go through everything she went through and he stayed right by her which is more than I can say most. It was a good love story and showed really maturity of the teenagers in a very scary environment.This movie may have been made before my time but I could watch it over and over again. The Blue Lagoon should definitely be on a list of good ones. Despite a few minor inappropriate scenes it was well thought out and very well scripted and casted.,The Blue Lagoon
143,Etooze,So much more than a movie,10,25 December 2004,"Last year I watched The Blue Lagoon for the first time and thought it was absolutely amazing. When I tell people this they usually laugh in my face and say that I only like it because of Chris Atkin's sex appeal, but that is not the only reason. This movie epitomizes Freud's theories of the id, ego and super ego- explaining these three branches of the human mind very effectively and creatively. It actually raised my interest in the subject of human psychology and sociology so much that I am considering it as a major in college. And who would have ever thought a buff man running around in a loin cloth could have given me direction in life?",The Blue Lagoon
144,MakingAKilling,Too many complaints about sex...,7,12 April 2005,"First off, I was not alive when this movie came out, and although some parts are cheesy and rather amusing, I found this movie enjoyable to say the least. I think the fact that the two main characters, Richard (Atkins) and Emmaline (Shields), have been alone for a good majority of their life without any parental guidance is what sets the movie apart from others. The two children were left with the little knowledge they had gained and each other. They had to discover every hardship alone. Some people have complained that the fact they were cousins was disturbing. But, one must remember that there was no one there to teach them the difference between right and wrong. No one was there to tell them they should where clothes around other people. I think it was important for the audience to see them discover sex by themselves and to experiment with the pleasures it holds. So, if you're not into the whole cousin/nudity thing, then this movie isn't for you. But, if you enjoy movies that make you enjoy the little things in life and appreciate everything you know, then this is a good movie to watch.",The Blue Lagoon

Of course it is however...a bit graphic for younger teenagers but for mid-to older teens like me who understand romance and love, its a truly amazing movie. Its a very simple movie, but its very much appreciated because of its simplicity. You really know what its a good movie when it makes you cry...especially at the end...you'll find out why soon enough!! A MUST see for those romance movie watchers...you will never be disappointed i promise you. and by the way, Christopher Atkins is very, very adorable in this!!! :-)",The Blue Lagoon
146,utah71sky,Is Blue Lagoon censored like Pretty Baby?,7,26 February 2005,"Can't believe it has been 25 years!! This was the film to get into when growing up!!What really makes it awesome is having an 11yr old girlfriend while 12 in the Upper FL Keys. You are at the age where you can take a walk away from the adults but not too old where they chaperone. Nest Key in Florida Bay is great for that romantic picnic!!Anyway--I rented Blue Lagoon the other day, and thought I saw a different scene. When the kids are running on the beach, and told to put their clothes on. Emmeline breaks to the left away from the camera. I thought I remembered from the original and even HBO and Encore at both of them coming directly at the camera until the scene changes. In ""Pretty Baby"" the camera is now obviously zoomed in so areas below Brooke's navel are cut out. But the Original and the VHS show quite a bit more. Just curious if Hollywood is systematically re-editing movies that previously were not censored. If so, who is directing DVD directors to do so before a mass release?Now readers of this post may call people who notice these things perverts, but then I ask what about the people at Paramount or Tri-Star who noticed scenes like these first?",The Blue Lagoon
147,kristian-engl,Great entertainment and romantic-ish comedy.,9,14 February 2015,"This DVD review was sponsored by www.DaaVeeDee.com - This is one of those movies that is perfectly entertaining, especially for teenagers or couples who are up for a different twist on romantic comedy. In a way it's good for reflecting on the basic wants and needs in every person's life, without all the clutter of our sheltered society. It's also a good film to view with your kids as they enter teenage hood, helps understand some of the mood changes and different emotions that one goes through, as much boys as girls. The setting of the film is on a remote island, so it really brings things down to basics. All in all, the film is probably very under-rated and well worth the affordable price!

I especially love the scenes after they have grown up and mature. It really moves me. this movie has everything that a person could want in a movie a little comedy, a lot of drama, a lot of romance, and action. i don't see how anyone could not like this movie or think it was racy, i think all the love scenes are very tastefully done.",The Blue Lagoon
149,adrianbonds,A perfect description of one true side of love,8,21 January 2017,"I had looked forward to see this movie for a long time before I today made the choice and watched it. What I had in mind was a beautiful nature film with pure natural love, just as I saw it in Green Mansions (1959) and the outcome was exactly what I wanted. This movie contains a lot of nature, a lot of love but not a lot of unnecessary words that would just have filled it with nonsense. ""The Blue Lagoon"" is the perfect rejection of two false love visions, both of love as something purely idealistic and platonic and of love and something you do just to satisfy your physical ego. It's liberating to watch The Blue Lagoon because it is so different from what we are used to see nowadays. When i watch this movie I feel comfortable and happy.And to my rating. Perhaps I wish I had learned more about the characters and I had loved to see what happened after the story ends but I will remember the movie and if a friend asked me about a good love film, this would be one of the movies I'd mentioned.",The Blue Lagoon

You wouldn't want your pre-teens watchin it, but i think any slightly older audiences would really enjoy it. Saying that though i think any half intelligent young girl would understand the story and content well, as a bloke, i don't think the young males would get it as much, and although it hurts to dog on my own sex, unfortunately, if i'd seen this film at a young age, my appreciation would only have been focused on a few scenes and i think that those scenes would bear the same appreciation for any young male!
