0,SnoopyStyle,Megan has done worst,6,8 July 2021,"Emma (Megan Fox) breaks up with Tom. She's married to controlling husband Mark. She had been brutalized in a robbery a decade earlier and hates her husband's job as an amoral defense lawyer. He brings her to an isolated vacation home. He handcuffs her to him and shoots himself in the head. She's stuck with his dead body.The setup is too convoluted. The premise is that Mark had planned an elaborate scheme to set her up. It's way too elaborate when all he has to do is to handcuff her other hand to the bed. It's too much work for too little effect. Like Emma says, just call the cops and let them figure it out. It wouldn't make sense that she handcuffs herself to her husband without the key and then shoot him. No cop would even arrest her with that situation plus all the clue that Mark left. So the only good reason to Mark is to trap her with a dead body until she dies. A better way to achieve that would be to tie her down. (see Gerald's Game)Then the story has a lot of conveniences, some of which are kind of funny like lying down in the snow. Despite all the different problems, this is a fun little thriller. Megan Fox has done worst. It's unbelievable that she would let the bad guy live when she knocked him out with the golf club. Sometimes, weaker thrillers have the women do girlie stuff like that or tripping over their own feet. It's a weak move but it's not unexpected. This is fine.",Till Death
1,nogodnomasters,It's my anniversary,6,17 July 2021,"Developing plot spoilers.Mark and Emma Webster (Eoin Macken + Megan Fox) are celebrating their wedding anniversary at their remote home. They met while he was the assistant DA who prosecuted the man (Callan Mulvey) who accosted her. He is now a rich lawyer and she has been having an affair (Aml Ameen). This set up goes rather quickly. Mark is in trouble and decides suicide is the only way out while handcuffed to his cheating wife. Two men show up at the request of Mark and Megan must hide and fight them off while handcuffed to a her heavy dead husband leaving a wide trail of blood behind as they go.

2,Tweekums,A taut little thriller,7,1 October 2021,"It is Emma and Mark's eleventh wedding anniversary. Things haven't been going for them lately but he takes her out to dinner, gives her a necklace then drives her to the remote lakeside house where they had happy times before. It looks as if he intends to try to rekindle their romance... until the next morning when she finds herself chained to him. Moments later he shoot himself in the head! She is miles from anywhere, the temperature is well below freezing and Mark has made sure there are no obvious means of breaking the chain or driving away. To make matters worse Mark has contacted a couple of brothers, one of whom has just served ten years for attacking Emma, and told them she holds the key to a fortune. It won't be easy for her to get away from them and avoid freezing to death.This might not be a great film but if you are looking for a taut ninety minute thriller you could do a lot worse. It starts off well and once we are at the lake house the tension rises nicely and peaks impressively towards the end. The frozen setting creates a great atmosphere and having Emma chained to Mark makes things more exhausting for her. The arrival of the brothers isn't much of a surprise and it must be said Emma makes some odd choices; it is a film cliché that people being attacked don't finish the job when they first turn the tables on their attacker. The acting was solid; nothing to worry the Oscar committee but far from terrible. Overall I'd say this is well worth watching if you want a ninety minute thriller.",Till Death
3,paul_haakonsen,Entertaining thriller...,6,28 August 2021,"The 2021 movie ""Till Death"" definitely felt like a good old fashioned thriller, for better or worse. So if you enjoyed the thrillers from back then, then chances are you'll also like ""Till Death"".Sure, the storyline was predictable, but still it proved to be an entertaining movie to watch, as writer Jason Carvey managed to put together a wholesome movie. I was definitely entertained by what transpired in the movie, from the beginning to the end, despite of having figured out the ending of the movie well before due time.Megan Fox was pretty good in this movie, proving that there is more to her than just being a pretty face that stars in mindless action movies. Her portrayal of Emma in ""Till Death"" was spot on. And it was definitely a treat to have actor Callan Mulvey in the movie as well, because he always adds something enjoyable to the movies that he stars in, and he was rather nicely cast for the role of Bobby Ray.""Till Death"" does have some good and exciting moments throughout the course of the movie, despite being a somewhat predictable story.Director S. K. Dale's 2021 thriller is a movie that has contents to watch a single time, and that is about it. Yeah, I have to admit that, for me at least, then the storyline in ""Till Death"" just doesn't have any replay value.I was certainly was adequately entertained by what ""Till Death"" delivered.My rating of ""Till Death"" lands on a six out of ten stars.",Till Death

5,zardoz-13,Dead Ringer,8,19 August 2021,"Wives, imagine celebrating another wedding anniversary with your husband at a swanky restaurant. After you have dined on savory cuisine and sipped elegant wine, he walks behind your chair and drapes an exotic necklace at your throat. Later, he persuades you to don a blindfold because he has a surprise in store. You endure a tiresome drive into the middle of nowhere. The romantic lake house is straight out of Disney's ""Frozen."" Powdery white snow is heaped high everywhere, and the lake is iced over. Eventually, you follow a trail of rose petals lit by flickering candlelight to the upstairs boudoir. Awakening refreshed and contented the next morning, you watch in mute horror as your husband puts a gun to his head, pulls the trigger, and blood-splattered brain particles shower you! Of course, nothing like this would ever happen to you!Nevertheless, the ill-fated wife in this thriller, Emma (Megan Fox of ""Jennifer's Body""), is devastated by her husband's suicide. Freshman director Scott Dale's ""Till Death"" (*** OUT OF ****) qualifies as a nimbly wrought nail-biter that conjures up suspense and intrigue galore throughout its gripping 83-minutes. Scenarist Jason Carvey, who wrote ""A New Wave"" (2006), has penned an atmospheric thriller that confines most of its action to a remote lake house after a brooding opening gambit in New York City. Emma's husband Mark (Eoin Macken of ""Close"") kills himself 23 minutes into ""Till Death"" and traps his woebegone wife in a house where she cannot find anything to remove her shackles. Before he killed himself, Mark admitted their marriage had fallen apart long. He admitted his philandering ways had driven Emma into the arms of another lover. At the same time, Mark had forsaken all sense of morality and steeped himself in corruption enough to prompt authorities to raid and ransack his offices.Mark is a 'piece of work.' Not only does he kill himself without a qualm, but he also leaves his unfaithful wife in a tight spot. The night they dined out, Emma had told her lover, one of Mark's colleagues, Tom Gorman (Aml Ameen of ""Red Tails""), that she could no longer continue an affair behind Mark's back.Ironically, Mark qualifies as the ""ball and chain"" in their flawed marriage. Typically, this term applies to females. Here, the act of Emma dragging Mark everywhere gives new meaning to this phrase. Moreover, when she awoke, Emma had on a skimpy satin negligée, and the loss of heat in the lake house has put a chill in her marrow. Towing Mark's corpse around the house like a mule takes a toll on Emma. Her bruised wrist aches from the pain of her exertions. Later, she sprawls Mark on her wedding gown and finds it easier to haul him around the premises.Dale and Carvey have done an admirable job of painting our heroine into a corner. She is secluded in the middle of nowhere. Emma drags Mark's body outside and into the garage. She spots a hose sticking out of their SUV gas tank where Mark had drained off the gas! Earlier, she had struggled to use a soaked cell phone she found submerged in a flower vase. Mark's revolver held only one bullet, so she cannot obliterate the handcuffs. She curses Mark for the dastard that he is and this dire turn of events has her stymied. She is surprised when her former lover Tom shows up at the front door. Tom talks about the authorities ransacking Mark's office. Tom is stunned when he looks Mark's corpse on the wedding dress. While they are talking, an unknown vehicle wheels up in the driveway. Tom and Emma exchange suspicious glances.If Emma thought she was stuck between a rock and a hard place, she is alarmed by what happens next. Before they dined out, she spotted a dossier on Mark's desk about a low-life hoodlum, Bobby Ray (Callan Mulvey of ""Shadow in the Cloud""), who had stabbed her in a street robbery years ago. Ray landed in prison for ten years. This happened before Emma, an amateur photographer, married Mark. Since he is no longer incarcerated, Bobby Ray has a score to settle with Emma. Mark has promised him $200 thousand in diamonds. Moreover, it also turns out this ex-convict gutted Tom fatally when he tried to run them off. Emma relies on her wits to elude Bobby Ray and his timid, safe-cracking brother, Jimmy (Jack Roth of ""Brimstone""), and director Scott Dale stages a tense game of cat & mouse.Of course, Megan Fox is no Meryl Streep. Nevertheless, the ""Transformers"" actress has gotten older, and Emma is no idiot. Happily, she is an ordinary, down-to-earth, but troubled wife. She lacks the knack to unlock her shackles. Later, Emma musters unheard of ferocity when she clobbers Bobby Ray with a golf club and then locks Jimmy up. The dreadful predicament of our heroine inclines you to feel more sympathetic to her plight. Fox doesn't let her tantrums get out of hand during her moments of hysteria. Now, she faces a fate worse than death from wicked Bobby Ray. Callan Mulvey steals the last half-hour of ""Till Death"" with his electrifying performance as a pugnacious ruffian who wields a knife like a butcher. Ultimately, the villains catch Emma and stab her. Television lenser Jamie Cairney captures the action from a variety of angles. Although the setting is upstate New York, the producers filmed ""Till Death"" on location in Bulgaria. Altogether, this occasionally exasperating, often white-knuckled exercise in suspense will keep you on edge.",Till Death
6,Calicodreamin,Actually pretty good,6,5 October 2021,"For a suspense thriller this was actually pretty good. There were definitely a few ""what are you doing moments?!"" and Megan's perfect makeup was distracting, but overall more good than bad. The thrills kept up throughout and the acting was decent. The storyline was unique and had a few cool moments.",Till Death
7,trashgang,"even as it is a simple story, it's full of suspense",7,8 July 2021,"Remember the time that Megan Fox would be the next big thing. And sshe was on the way to become it until she made some fatal errors. From there on her Hollywood career was over but the horror genre picked her up. Jennifer's Body (2009) was her first entry in the genre and by a lot of geeks she became a new scream queen.Now she's back with Till Death. Starts off very slowly until minute 22. From there the troubles get in for Fox and she has to solve her situation.I can't say a lot because I would spoil it all. I found it an above mediocre flick, can't say it's a real horror but it do has some elements of it in it.The effects were also okay only the end is a bit exaggerated. Still, it's worth picking up. For me she Megan did a fine job. And the flick wasn't that bad after all, a lot of things I coudn't see coming.If you like suspense with some gory shots, pick it up.Gore 1,5/5
Nudity 0/5
Effects 3/5
Story 3/5
Comedy 0/5.",Till Death
8,deloudelouvain,"Some suspense, some mediocre acting.",5,17 July 2021,"The thing with Till Death is that Megan Fox is just not a good actress. She gets roles because of her looks, which in my humble opinion are not that great like everybody else seems to think. The movie starts slow, borderline boring, but gets a kick in the second half, where there's actually some decent suspense. The story is not to be taken too seriously as there's no way a fragile woman like her could drag a dead weight like that without getting noticed. But there's some suspense, I'll give them that, but that's about it. Good enough to watch once, but you will forget everything about it the next day.",Till Death
9,nairtejas,Will Keep You Hooked,7,31 July 2021,"I went in with very low expectations but Till Death and its leader Megan Fox surprised me. The mystery of a woman handcuffed to the corpse of her dead husband is interesting, but it gets more as the story unfolds. Kept me hooked till the end with some clever writing in the final act and excellent action overall.",Till Death
10,UniqueParticle,"Daunting, suspenseful and under appreciated!",8,6 October 2021,I don't understand the hate at all Till Death is pretty solid. This is fun thriller that I crave especially during the Halloween season and I'm glad I don't have to pay because of Netflix which I rarely use. Sure there's a few dumb parts but that doesn't make it as bad as some say not by a long shot! Megan Fox is great in horror she should do it more.,Till Death
11,Floated2,Highly entertaining thriller,8,30 August 2021,"There seems to be much backlash over this film and the character of Megan Fox due to her not cutting off her husband's hand using the vase or sharp edges from the picture frame. Where people rate the film low simply due to that.Otherwise Till Death was a lot better than expected and is far better than the current 5.8 IMDB rating.This film is carried by Megan Fox (one of her better performances- these are the type of roles she should be doing). What makes this film good is that it is quite simple and gets straight to the point. It isn't long and it doesn't drag. Also It is shot very nicely and the outside scenery is great to look at. Although somewhat of a predictable ending, it gets the job done.",Till Death
12,Tweetienator,Okay,4,22 July 2021,"Well, like many reviewers stated, there would be a lot of ways to get rid of the husband's arm/hand, if needed. Anyway, Till Death reminds me of Gerald's Game, a story written by the almighty Mr. King. Whereas the reading of the for mentioned book was a suspenseful pleasure, Till Death was rather an okayish experience. The second part (after our heroin got rid of her husband's body) I liked a little more. Anyway, the body of Megan Fox is still in pretty good shape, so my recommendation: read the book if you want suspense, watch the movie if you wanna watch Megan Fox.",Till Death
13,lisafordeay,A suspense thriller,7,26 October 2021,Megan Fox stars in this thriller directed by SK Dale. A young woman who's been married for 11 years is handcuffed to her dead husband who seeks revenge after finding out about his wife's affair to one of his employees. Will Emma(Fox) be able to find a way out of all of this and set herself free from her bad husband Mark(Eoin Mulvan).There is alot of twists and turns in this film especially with Emma's deceased husband (who I forgot to mention shot himself while handcuffed to his wife)hiring hitmen to kill Emma over a crime involving Emma and a guy who assaulted her.Megan Fox is a great actress yet she gets alot of hate. Here in Till Death she showcased what she can do.,Till Death
14,jtindahouse,Good premise but a very formulaic run out,7,28 July 2021,"As I was watching 'Till Death' I kept thinking how I wished this wasn't an American film. With an American film you pretty much know what you're going to get going forward. There's a very specific formula they have to use otherwise their audiences simply don't accept it. It's one of the reasons the majority of films are so bland and forgettable these days. The sad thing is that 'Till Death' has a great concept and if the Europeans or the Koreans for examples had come up with the idea they could have done something special with it.Even considering how formulaic this film is, it is still a decent watch. Megan Fox does her best in the lead role. Her face doesn't move these days unfortunately, but we can still tell which emotion she is trying to portray most of the time. The pacing of the film is also very good. It moves at a good click and always has enough going on to keep us glued to the screen.I was just very disappointed with how the movie wrapped up. I won't spoil it at all, but it was just a very predictable and disappointing conclusion. I had a particular way in my head that I was hoping it would play out, and had it done so I would've been highly recommending this one. As it is I'll just say watch it with low expectations and you'll likely have a decent time.",Till Death
15,JoBloTheMovieCritic,Till Death,7,1 September 2021,"7/10 - usually these kind of home invasion direct-to-DVD flicks are not worth the watch, however, positive reviews about this Megan Fox horror thriller got me to tune in and it frankly had a lot to enjoy with an admirable amount of suspense (something modern horror lacks a lot of the time)",Till Death

Avoid at all cost!",1,14 July 2021,"This film start with a woman ""Emma"" driving in the car, and she thinking about a guy ""Tom"" scene! As turnout, this film is about Emma need to survive from the killing of two men(Bobby, and Jimmy), who target the diamond in her necklace! Entire film full of boring conversation, and annoying overuse scene! Such as, overuse of the driving scene, overuse of the walking scene, overuse of the searching scene, overuse of the calling names scene, overuse of the arguing scene, overuse of the hiding scene, overuse of the dragging dead body scene, overuse of the tripping scene, overuse of the playing recorder scene, overuse of the flashbacks scene, and overuse of the opening door scene! Make the film unwatchable! All the action scene have blood at certain point, but overall portray by sideways, and occur in too short of time! Make the film frustrated to watch!

17,Pairic,Enjoyable Horror-Thriller,7,11 October 2021,"Till Death: What's worse than waking up to find that you're chained to a corpse? Maybe waking up handcuffed to your husband, he tells you that he knows about your affair, then shoots himself in the head. That's what happens to Emma (Megan Fox). She's in an isolated cabin, no sharp knives, no phone coverage, car not working. The guy she was having the affair with is tricked into coming to the cabin but a crazed man who had previously tried to kill her also arrives (with a sidekick) and kills her lover. The fun begins. She finds her ex a bit of drag as she tries to evade the killers. Tension is maintained as the chase/battle continues within the house, in sheds and on a frozen lake. Some savage stabbings and shootings. Nothing extraordinary about it but this is an enjoyable horror/thriller. Directed by S. K. Dale, written by Jason Carvey. On Netflix. 7/10.",Till Death

He gives her some weird necklace. She's uncomfortable throughout the whole evening. On the way back he blindfolds her and tells her he has a surprise.He takes her to their summer vacation house by a lake. It's winter and it's snowing. He makes it all romantic for her and it looks like they will reconcile.Next morning she wakes up handcuffed...to him. He has one last surprise for her. Then he blows his brains out. Now she's attached to his corpse and has to drag him around the house and elsewhere. There are no tools or useful objects anywhere in the house/garage/boathouse. The car has been emptied of gasoline and she has no phone.Then her lover shows up and freaks out. Then suddenly two guys show up to repair something but act all weird. When the lover won't let them in, one of the guys kills him. Megan hides. That guy is of course the guy who attacked her years ago. We learn there is a safe in the house and these guys want diamonds that are in there. They need the combination and the husbands finger. What follows next is a cat and mouse game of Megan having to hide/escape/go on the offensive from these guys while dragging the husbands corpse around.Till Death is pretty unique, interesting, occasionally tense and funny as well. It is a well-made horror thriller centered around this odd scenario and the mystery of why the husband did what he did. The role is well-suited for Fox. Her character is pretty tense herself and uncomfortable and doesn't open up a whole lot. She has to use facial expressions more than words. Overall, I enjoyed this quirky movie quite a bit.",Till Death

22,arungeorge13,An okayish thriller that somewhat achieves its only task of reviving Megan Fox's career! [+52%],5,3 July 2021,"Till Death doesn't come close to achieving the psychological payoffs of a Gerald's Game but what it holds good on is offering Megan Fox (once stereotyped in generic ""hot girl"" roles) something worthwhile. The horror here is only in the form of blood-spill, so let's get that out of the way. The entirety of the first act feels like an exercise in blandness - every actor including Fox simply goes through the motions without making us feel strongly for their respective characters. We have the by-now-clichéd terrible husband (Eoin Macken), the wife (Fox) and her boyfriend (Aml Ameen), and finally, an ex-convict (Callan Mulvey) with a grudge. It only gets interesting around the 25-minute mark, however, even the second act is just Fox bumping around the house and its surrounding icy landscape with a corpse handcuffed to her.The third act thankfully features a few well-packaged, sufficiently gory thrills. When Fox gets into action-hero mode, she elevates the film to a fair extent. On the flip side, the climax plays out exactly the way you expect it to. It isn't a difficult film to sit through at all - to its advantage, the better parts arrive towards its grisly finale. Jason Carvey's writing is both clever and lacklustre at the same time: the deceptive cat-and-mouse bits intrigue while the overall predictability cannot be ignored. If nothing else, this is a perfectly serviceable comeback vehicle for Fox.",Till Death

Equal parts bloody and stupid with every horror/thriller trope thrown in like they are making a bad movie potluck dinner. I wish that I could have been there at the meeting when they decided to give this story a greenlight. You have to wonder about what they rejected to push this into production: half a Siamese twin you have to drag around? How about a 160-pound tumor? She can't remove the leash from her pet wolverine?

My problem with this movie was the idea was a version of ""Gerald's Game"", yes the second half was different but more than a little ridiculous and the less said about the ending the better.

25,gedikreverdi,Till death do us handcuffed,6,4 July 2021,"It reminded me of Stephen King's Gerald's Game a lot in the beginning but it took a very different path afterwards. After her husband shot himself in the head handcuffed to his wife, Megan Fox tried to find a way to get rid of the dead body attached to herself. She was grunting, panting and heavily breathing all the time while dragging him around the entire house and that made me feel uncomfortable after a certain point. His husband left a Jigsaw-like game behind and her boyfriend showed up at the door of the lake house in the middle of nowhere. He was stabbed to death by the criminal brothers one of whom was stabbed in the eye when he attacked Megan Fox in the past. She finally got rid of the body with the anchor in the boat. It was awesome when she attacked one of them in the attic and he fell down when the floor of the attic collapsed and she drove the car into the lake somehow and couldn't drive away. She gave the combination to the safe but there was only a saw and the diamonds were in the necklace she was wearing. He didn't wanted them to cut the necklace, he wanted them to cut the neck. Again an homage to Saw. The younger brother died while they were fighting over beheading her or not and she managed to run and ended up on the frozen lake. The criminal with the handcuffed dead husband cracked the ice and fell into the water and he dragged her into the lake with himself. She stabbed him in his other eye and cracked a way out with the knife and the police sirens were wailing while she was lying on the frozen lake. It was a lot better than I expected but the only problem was the constant panting and grunting. Megan Fox isn't one of the best actors but she's enchanting.",Till Death

27,Movi3DO,Pretty entertaining,7,6 July 2021,"Gerald's Game?The set up of this movie was interesting because I went in knowing nothing about the synopsis. When thing started to hit, the movie revealed itself to be an one-day survival thriller. Similar to movies like Panic Room, Don't Breathe, or You're Next, our main character had to fight against people who wanted to hunt her.Megan Fox returned and she did a pretty good job. Her character had a decent amount of background that I could care about. She captured the frustration and panic that her character was in.As for the thriller itself, besides the surprising rising action, there wasn't much to be surprised about. Certain twists in the movie were predictable, as the movie didn't deviate from its survival genre. However, the smart and excellent parallel camera shots created good amount of tension that I wanted. For a supposedly simple-looking movie, the cinematography made it look slicker.As a survival thriller that wasn't too original, there were still many genre's popular cliches. ""Don't just hit them once and then run, you gotta either really knock them out or kill them,"" is what I wanted to say to these main characters. Also, some characters were clearly made to be dumber than in real life.Overall, it's still a fun and intense thriller. 6.5/10.",Till Death

Why didn't her character break the big glass vase on the table and cut her husbands thumb of (when she 1st went downstairs) I do not understand. ""There's nothing sharp"" in a whole house full of windows and mirrors and a giant vase. Make something sharp! A lots of frustrating dumb decision making by all of the characters. Way too many lucky breaks for Megan Fox character too. The brother had a knife and sliced the wheels on the car, then much later she drives it with the wheels OK. How?

I noticed one little thing that annoyed me, the guy she was cheating with didn't have any stab holes in his clothes even though he was stabbed like 10 times. Some things were a tad too predictable to like the villains brother dying. It also really annoys me how she literally smacked the guy through the ceiling and didn't give him any follow up strikes.

30,apryla-58795,Her makeup looks perfect throughout,4,1 October 2021,"Here's all you need to know about this...Fox is married to a dirty DA. She has an affair...he finds out. He gets back at her by taking her to their remote lake house handcuffing himself to her and then shooting himself in the head. Before he did that he made sure to remove anything from the house that she could use to cut herself free from him. Just in case she managed to get that far he also siphoned all the gas from the car so she couldn't leave. And just to make sure she didn't somehow survive otherwise he hires two goons to kill her. She manages to elude them throughout the whole movie until help finally arrives. And she does all of it in perfect makeup. She went to bed in her makeup the night before this happened and when a woman does that she wakes up with most of it off or really smeared. But nope still perfect. Then when her husband killed himself his blood splatters all over her face. She washes it off and still perfect makeup. She runs around and gets beat up and thrown around and even gets dragged into ice water but still managed to retain that perfectly applied makeup look all the way to the end. I get that Fox is only utilized because she's pretty (it's not for her acting...fight me) but things need to be slightly realistic. This isn't the worst thing I've ever seen even though watching Fox try to act is painful but it sure isn't something that needs to be on the ""top 100 movies you must see before you die"" list.",Till Death
31,jmbovan-47-160173,Decent film for Megan Fox,6,29 August 2021,"Megan Fox deserves more films that let her act. This is a decent attempt of a film, providing some opportunities for Ms. Fox to show her abilities. The rest of the film falters and falls short in multiple ways. The plot is a bit too bizarre. Motions for the characters around her character are capricious or insipid. The overall sense of the film leaves logic largely absent, and plot points seem to be only for propelling the film toward the end. Directed decently and with a certain vision evident.

32,Stanlee107,Tears us apart!,5,11 July 2021,I don't understand why Megan Fox gets so much grief for her performance here. She does her best as the main protagonist. The script does not offer her scope for any development. She is the cheating wife that ends her affair and her husband planned a weekend that she will never forget... Think Gerald's game & Leon ...The plots and sub-plots are very Hollywood. It is generic and follows the predictable beaten path. There are moments of tension & OTT wft unbelievable scenes that beggars belief (Film logic that furthers the plot that no ordinary person would have chosen or survived in real life) it is watchable but it's nothing special or terribly awful about it.People may say she rely too much on her looks but it is a nice that she is expanding her acting range. One may say it was Bread Pitt faced years ago... He succeeded but will she?? It is not quite the level of Jennifer's body.,Till Death
33,johannes2000-1,"Amusing, if you don't take it seriously.",6,26 September 2021,"It's obviously meant to be a nerve-racking thriller, and if you overlook the (abundant) flaws, it actually comes pretty close. So I have to admit: I didn't get bored. But as a sound-minded viewer it's pretty hard to overlook all the silliness and lack of logic.The two brothers are so simpleminded that their chase of Emma (Megan Fox) at many times turned into Home Alone'ish slapstick. Emma constantly leaves obvious trails in the snow, but the brothers seem to be blind as bats, they never look out of any window when Emma yet again drags herself and the chained-to-her-wrist dead husband in full daylight over the snow-covered premise. Most ludicrous instant was when Emma lets herself fall backwards in the snow and the dopey brother walks right by her and mysteriously succeeds in NOT noticing the bloodstained figure conspicuously spread out in the white snow like a fallen Jesus. Why did the brothers drag the dead body upstairs to the safe for its fingerprint, when they could have sufficed with chopping a finger off? Why dragging the dead body chained to your wrist along with you over the ice, when you all the time have clenched a huge knife between your lips that you could have used to simply chop the hand off?!?I could go on and on like that, it made the movie at least amusing to watch.And then there's of course Megan Fox. She looks in the first half hour as a painted porcelain doll and behaves like a frozen ice-queen, and in the rest of the movie she succeeds in keeping her make-up spotless throughout all her ordeals. It's hard to judge her acting, it consists mainly of endlessly dragging herself through the house and the snow. Well, that she did convincingly.",Till Death

Good story, made you wonder what would happen next. I was on the edge of my seat just waiting to see what hell she would be put through. Reading the other reviews and I think ppl should not be so closed minded when it comes to what all goes into making a movie now a days.

In this, Fox is married to a controlling rich guy, who discovers that Fox is having an affair with a business associate. His solution to mend his marital problems, is to take his wife to a lake house in the middle of the winter, handcuff them together, and eat a bullet.The rest of the film is Fox dragging her dead husband around (the husband removed all the knives from the house preventing her the quick and easy solution of hacking off his hand).Her fling shows up as does a pair of goofy thugs looking for diamonds.

director: S. K Dale
starring: Megan Fox, Eoin Macken, Callan Mulvey, Jack Roth, Aml Ameen.A woman is left handcuffed to her dead husband as part of a sick revenge plot. Unable to unshackle, she has to survive as two killers arrive to finish her off. I thought Till death was excellent and a very well-made film.My first few positives would be the interesting idea, the dark set up and tone. As well as the great cinematography and set locations, also with great performances. I think that the idea of the film itself is unique and interesting, being chained to a dead body especially in the conditions of the movie was an inventive and fun premise. I also thought the set up was very dark, it was shocking to have the contrast of the main characters relationship possibly being on the mend to have him suddenly be dead, it was very well executed and took the film in a dark and fun new direction, the film itself had a pretty dark tone, especially with its humour and not being afraid to have some very unsettling and uncomfortable scenes. I also thought the cinematography and set locations were great. This film was visually creative, it would use the surroundings and incorporate it into the shots when Emma (Megan Fox) was hiding from the robbers to really increase the tension. And there were some amazing shots in general, especially within the final act with the lake. I also think the film used the set location of the house well. It was in the middle of nowhere so Emma couldn't escape, and the film used every room in the house well as great hiding spots. I also thought the performances were great. The whole cast did a great job, but it was great to see Megan Fox. She was committed to the role, and it really showed when she was on screen, she bought the intensity and passion required for the role and it was nice to see her acting again.My next few positives would be the character background and development to the relationship. The tense tone and building of tension. As well as the use of gore, sound design, and the development to the plot. I really appreciated the amount of time the film took to develop the relationship between Emma and her partner, we got to see how their relationship worked and how controlling he was to gain sympathy for Emma as a character, as well as good character background to understand her dark past and how its linked to the main antagonists. I also thought the tense tone and building of tension was excellent, the films tension was set up well and it was never lost. The film got slowly more and more intense as the stakes for the characters increased. I was on edge for a good majority of the film and the situations that the film put Emma in were scary. I also thought the use of gore and the sound design was great. The movie was not afraid to get fairly bloody which definitely made the film had a lot more impact, with Emma dragging the dead body of her husband that was dripping blood being pretty gruesome and the imagery really stuck with me, I also thought the sound design was used very effectively to increase the tension, the sudden startling noises to distract the characters or the repeated noises of the characters footsteps getting closer to Emma really increased the tension of the scenes well. Finally, I also thought the film's plot developed well, it was structured in a way where it didn't overstay its welcome and ran smoothly. Going from Emma trying to find a way to break free of her husband and escape, to the antagonists being hired to kill her, they changed the plot up enough times to keep you engaged and it made it a fun experience to watch.I did have a few issues with the film, the beginning felt rushed and unneeded. The film fell into some genre tropes, and the logic of the plot wore thin in parts. I did find the beginning to be fairly rushed, Emma was with a different man due to her husband being a player, however it all felt underdeveloped and rushed, it only lasted a small amount of time, and they didn't really develop their relationship enough for me to care about his character. I also thought the film did fall into some genre tropes. There were moments where there would do a predictable change to a scene where Emma would nearly be caught but then suddenly something would happen, or a noise would be heard that was slightly generic. My final criticism would the logic of the plot waring thin in parts. There were particularly scenes that were a bit silly and too over the top, and moments where if it happened in real life the situation would be different, and that did take me out of the film in parts.My final few positives would be the strong script, good character depth and strong villains with good motivations. As well as the dark twists and intense final act. The script was well written, its self awareness and dark humour was witty and sharp and always hit the mark and did its job. I also thought the character depth for Emma was strong. Her dark past involving her attack and the man hired to kill her being the same person gave the character a lot of emotional depth, and slowly learning about her relationship with her husband and what she has been through over the years was a welcome addition to the film. I also thought the villains and their motivations was strong. Callan Mulvey delivered a very intense and intimidating performance, and he was a strong antagonist, he was mentally unstable and willing to do anything to get what he wanted. I also think his motivation for doing what he did because of his past with Emma was strong motivation for his character which was well explained which isn't always the case with films in this genre. I also thought the dark twists and the final act were very well executed. The twists were unexpected and very dark, everything that Emma's husband gave her that you thought was a sweet gift turned out to be something to punish her in a big mind game and it kept the film intense and fresh. The final act was also incredibly intense. As it was unclear Whether Emma would escape or not, the stakes were incredibly high, and the intensity was at its max and I was thoroughly entertained.Overall, despite the plausibility of the fun premise waring thin in places and falling into some genre tropes. Till death is elevated by the fantastic direction from S. K Dale this was his debut feature film. Also, by the committed performance from Megan Fox, and the dark premise that never lost its intensity.Overall score 87/100.",Till Death

I love the revenge plot and the little details such as the wedding clothes, emptying the house, texting her lover, the necklace/safe, etc. Even so, it was still lacking some intrigue and depth. The characters were a bit bland and unfortunately Megan Fox is not the most talented actress so she didn't really pull this off unfortunately.

It doesn't really leave anything to remember. It's like Liam nilson monotone voice only he still manages to express and give a performance. The movie Itself is one of those hide and seek style films that are slowly become more common such as Don't breathe or You're Next. It Also share a similarly to Gerald games the stephen king story, But while those movies have more going for them. This film suffers a bit While the scenario does grab your attention and they do manage to answer questions of why she doesn't do certain things. There's still questionable moments of okay your not getting back up from that or why aren't you moving. The movie doesn't really get interesting until 30 minutes in, seeing the trailer you know where it's leading to, so it feels like padding.

I think had this really embraced those hints and gone full dark comedy, it could be as rewatchable as Heathers or Very Bad Things. As it currently is, I wouldn't go out of my way to see it again. But I also wouldn't turn it off if it were playing in the background.I also liked how her character survives by her wits, not by physically beating the guys.The ending also has one tiny little open-ended part that sold this for me.

The plot is simplistic and could have been decent had we cared about Megan's character but, at the end of the day, she had an affair and dumped the guy to go running back to her rich husband. There's very little to like about her and that could have been fixed with showing why she could have had the affair, why she ran back to her partner etc. But, all of the characters are very 2D with basic acting on display from all.It's not a terrible film.

As the synopsis eludes to, Megan's character finds herself handcuffed to her dead ex-husband in a remote location...this is Saw-level crazy. It was interesting to see how she dealt with the lack of tools in the house, her phone being bricked and the car being siphoned.However, when we later find out this was all part of a bigger plan of cheating a guy out of his cash, we see this turn into a House of Horrors where Megan is having to hide away while the invaders move through the house. It was great camera work and it felt incredibly tense at times. However, she is eventually found and it forms part of a plan to kill her to get their payment - again, the messages felt a bit of a Saw-rehash, but nonetheless clever. It was interesting to see how she went into stark survival-mode, when she started the movie as someone you would know as a party girl with air between her ears.The ending was satisfying, but not in a way one would wholly expect. Two invaders become one...become two. I won't say much more!All in all, this is 90 minutes I am glad I spent and that is something I never thought I would say.A couple of plot points I felt a bit confused by:Her boyfriend drives to the location in a car which I guess had enough to do a round-trip...why did she feel the need to try and re-fuel the car she came in instead, when the other car was open and ready to go?I am a doctor and there is no way that body would have been floppy for that long, especially in cold conditions.

So the film relied on the actors to tell the story but Megan Fox taking the lead along with no named extras was never going to be any good.Once again, I have to point out that wokeness is now so overdone its comical. I watch every movie with a mental countdown of when the first black actor comes on screen. The black actor appears in literally the first minute and is her love interest.

Also, I honestly cannot say I've noticed anything wrong with how characters think, speak, or act. Including the main character. Again, this is a very fun movie to watch, I would rate it 7/10 but seeing how many people gave it unrealistically low scores, I rose it up to 8/10.(Now the spoilers)I see many said ""Just use the glass and cut his arm"". I was thinking the same, sure. But cutting an arm of an adult man (you know, with bones and all) is not easy AT ALL. It is also disgusting, so obviously, this wasn't her first idea. She has - at first, tried all things that make much more sense - she looked for knives, tools, she tried to run by a car, she wanted to call someone. Had she have more time (you know, BEFORE THE BAD GUYS WANTED HER DEAD), she probably would eventually try the glass. Also, it seems that this ""plot hole"" is the only one anyone has mentioned.

*** You may Jump to the bottom for a Hot-Take.***Film's premise presents an interesting twist to the Husband/Wife revenge story. Megan Fails to deliver in the very beginning scene of the movie. Which is crucial to the story. That could have been the anchor. Hardly encouraging viewer to proceed. But if one does muster the interest to venture on, you can find the decent stunt choreography rewarding. The film is held together by standout performances by the three foreign male leads. Two of them deliver a quite decent New England Accent. It is decently suspenseful. It's an ok thriller romp. Tim Roth's son's performance is quite good. Sadly I found Megan Fox's 'I am too cool to fully immerse myself in the role' attitude, distracting and tiresome. However Megan is able to give a fair physical performance.************Hot Take ******************Pros : Decent stunt choreography. Decently suspenseful. Standout performances by three cast members. Good smooth pacing. Doesn't let the viewer yawn. Good direction on Megan's physical performance.Cons : Megan's performance.

The film spends a good 50 minutes with Emma dragging around her dead husband who is cuffed to her her entering rooms with him and then she realises that her abusive/toxic husband knows she is cheating on him. Then enter the 'hitmen' with one of the men being the man Emma stabbed in the eye(?) (as shown in a flashback) and he has been paid to kill her and his storyline doesn't make much sence as its never revealed why he stabbed Emma and why she stabbed him (just that he has a vendetta against her because he spent 10 years in jail for stabbing her). I could go on but the film just drags on. Overall the acting isn't great the storyline feels a bit lost. And i only gave this a 3 because Megan Fox was in this.

So when everyone went off on her looks in Transformers, I had nothing really to judge her by, except this sex symbol she was being pushed as, as as her character was written with nothing else, it was hard not to give her not another thought. But when she came out against being sexualized i thought maybe there was at least a bit more going on, but man did Hollywood went after her she was destroyed by a press that 10 years later would have praised her, but at that time, she was too far ahead of the curve and instead she was cruxified by some of the same people who pretend to have always been on the side of the #metoo movement.Then she did Jennifer's Body and I realized this girl has a damn lot more going on then she was allowed to show under the direction of shallow directors like Michael Bay. Since then I think she has still struggled having had her name basically black listed, and now people won't question why, it just remains that way, and hollywood rarely takes a second chance on a star. They did for Robert Downey Jr, and that helped build the biggest ip franchise ever. And I think if a director was smart they would realize just how good an actress Megan Fox actually is, and what is capable of.Besides which, wow, I have to also say the Cinematography on this movie, hitting well well above it's pay grade. From the opening show with the color only on the one street, what a beautiful take on a very otherwise boring and overdone shot now. To the rest of the color and lighting, all very well done.

Question: is this film in any way groundbreaking? The short answer is no. But this is a watchable home invasion thriller that's quite silly but has enough suspense to hold your attention for a breezy 80 minutes; and Fox, much to anyone's surprise, holds her own with a physically impressive performance, in a film with a small cast and an even smaller budget.So yeah...a good Megan Fox film.

Megan Fox's character should be angry at what her husband has done, instead she can barely muster up enough rage to scream believably. I don't want to rag on her, but she gives nothing to her performance. I wanted her to make it, but toward the end, I really didn't want that anymore.

Megan Fox is barefoot the entire runtime. That has to be some kind of record, so if that is your thing, you'll be in heaven.For everyone else... your enjoyment will depend on your motivation to suspend disbelief. As the trailer has shown, Megan Fox is handcuffed to her dead husband for nearly the entire movie, while bad men are coming to steal a valuable MacGuffin.Megan drags the corpse up and down stairs and for some stupid reason is unable to pry herself loose. In reality, it would take about 10 seconds to free yourself in that situation simply by stomping the hand and pulling the cuffs over them. Or worst case breaking the forearm off over a chair or step or with a door. A forearm is pretty fragile.With the premise of the movie already illogical, everything that follows becomes an exercise in ridiculousness.In the movie's defense, this exercise is moderately entertaining, well acted and towards the end even somewhat suspenseful. The winter environment is put to good use, the action is competently staged; compared to the average Liam Neeson, Bruce Willis or Nicolas Cage offering these days, it's Oscar worthy material.In summary: Dumb but watchable on a rainy day.

A downtrodden wife, a guilt-ridden mistress, and a traumatized survivor. That's it. Fighting for survival isn't a personality trait.

From the get go the main character is clearly is in an emotionally abusive relationship and I was screaming ""get out"". But we all know it's not that simple.The twists and turns had me screaming ""WTF?!""
The generic tense moments where the heroine hits the bad guy once and assumes she's safe had me screaming ""THATS NOT ENOUGH SMASH HIS HEAD IN WITH THE GOLF CLUB"".And the ending had me screaming ""STAB THROUGH THE ICE PLEASE TELL ME SHE SURVIVES""
Sure it wasn't Oscar worthy. But the emotion that this movie made me scream at the screen is worth the 8/10.

I can't really blame the direction on that one, because the other actors were very good. Especially the two bad guys. So I hope she gets better in her next movies.

245,pjochim,In the dead of winter no less,3,31 October 2021,"The most glaring problem with this movie, right from the start is the acting, or should I say, the lack of it. Megan fox (Emma, the leading female character) is beautiful but her acting performance is stiff and shallow; I've never seen her in a film before but based on this showing I'd say she's a bit short of talent and charisma. Eoin Macken (Mark) her husband and the rest of the cast don't do much better---I see no stellar acting going on in this flick. Basically, this is what I call a ""situation"" movie; in this case its's one where most of the story revolves around a situation where Emma finds herself handcuffed to her husband's dead body and unable to free herself she spends a good deal of on-screen time just dragging him around. Mark had discovered his wife was having an affair and on their eleventh wedding anniversary he took Emma to their secluded lake house in the middle of winter, supposedly to celebrate but instead of celebrating he had a darker, more nefarious plan for her, a plan in which he would chain himself to her and then commit suicide, leaving his wife to die afterwards alongside him. This slow-moving scenario is tedious enough to watch but then to complicate things (and make a horror movie out of it), two men previously known to the couple show up at the house believing there are diamonds in the house safe and plan to steal them. So, there you have it, the basic elements of this story; a bad husband with malicious intent towards his wife, a cheating wife who ends up handcuffed to her dead husband, two thieves looking to steal diamonds from their lake house---and all of this is happening in the dead of winter---! Combine these elements together in a poorly written screen play with a lousy script and you have the makings for another waste-of-time movie. I give it a 3.5 rating.",Till Death

There is about enough plot here for an hour or so of screen time, but this is stretched out very thinly indeed.The main reason anyone would watch this, I would guess, is the presence of Megan Fox in the lead role. She is also one of the film's main problems. There are plenty of mediocre actors in the world, so I don't want to slam her especially for her lack of acting ability, but my goodness, she gives such a bland, flat performance in this film! This may not matter very much in, say, a Transformers movie, but this is supposed to be a thriller, and Fox's lack of emotional range really undercuts any potential thrills. I mean, you wake up handcuffed to your husband, who promptly blows his own brains out, and you react as if he has done nothing worse than broken wind in bed?So, a better actor might have elevated this somewhat.

271,Mr-Topshotta,"""TILL DEATH"" REVIEW",9,27 October 2021,"Directed by S. K. Dale. Starring Megan Fox as Emma. A woman full of loneliness and misery because of her terrible loveless marriage to a high class Lawyer ""Mark"" played by Eion Macken. Now ""Emma"" a shell of her past self is cheating with ""Tom"" played by Aml Ameen a fellow lawyer in her husbands firm.Now on ""Emma's"" Megan Fox Character and ""Mark"" her husbands anniversary. They enjoy a bland Anniversary night that takes them to there old lake house which was meant to maybe rekindle their love, or so ""Emma"" thought. But the next morning all hell breaks lose and now ""Emma"" is handcuffed to her dead husband. In a sick and twisted revenge plot her husband is unleashing on her. With even more twist thrown her way when a familiar face ""Bobby Ray"" played Callan Mulvey and his little brother ""Jimmy"" played by Jack Roth are sent by her now dead husband to kill and rob her.Now frantic from all the events that have happened she has to try to get free from the shackles of her marriage Figuratively and physically. While on top of trying not to get caught by an old familiar face.The movie started off ok. Megan Fox was very bland. I didn't know how I was going to like the movie because she was so lifeless and lackluster. She was just a pretty face with no range but as you watch further you see that was done on purpose and she actually does have personality and range. That marriage drained it all out of her but once she was in a Dire situation how she was prior to her marriage I'm assuming, came out.It was a thrilling, and very entertaining movie. The Story line was unique and I enjoyed seeing something different from Megan Fox. I've noticed she's in a few things lately. I think she's back acting on a more consistent basis. If she's going to be doing films like this I'm definitely going to check them out. It was a cool Netflix movie that didn't disappoint. I give it four more fires 🔥🔥🔥🔥

273,Carro101,I don't understand,1,4 October 2021,There's sooo many flaws in this movie I don't understand the lugging the body around when there would be so much to use to cut his hand off and how she stayed so intact and perfect looking is beyond me! The clothes on the body dint make sense either! Gerald's game is soooooo much better!,Till Death

277,squir-98045,Entertaining/ Fox/ Thriller,6,6 October 2021,"First of I only saw this movie because of Megan Fox .... I know.... Just like most of you did. I liked her acting better in Jennifer's Body. She didn't do a bad job, it got a lot better once the two (hit)-men showed up to the house but she could have AT LEAST tried to be a bit more scared and shaken up after her HUSBAND blew his brains off right in-front of her ! She seemed more annoyed then anything else. Even if she didn't love the man anymore some better facial expressions and crying would've made it more believable- that being said her good looks compensate for what she couldn't deliver in the beginning and she did a good Job with the stunts ... ya know where she wasn't talking much. Aside from that I was rooting for her and the two men who were sent to kill her did a great job on delivering their part! Really liked the brother played by Jack Roth and the story line was twisted! I enjoyed myself for most of the movie!",Till Death
278,michelle-saunders,Cold and icy...,5,10 October 2021,"The critic reviews with a green metascore of 66 is surprising. User reviews at 5.8 likely more realistic.The storyline is fantastic! So much....""you go girl!"". She (Megan Fox) is sooo pretty and unassuming, but she is one tough woman who does herself proud!.However, this film.could have been so much better, believable and realistic, if it was raw, blemished and untouched. The actors make-up (Fox) was impeccable throughout, in every scene, eg perfect lip gloss (even after being in the water) which, in these set of circumstances, is utterly impossible thus rendering most of this film implausible to the viewer.Callan Mulvey (a fello Aussie to myself - thus slightly biased) is the star piece of this film. He literally walks in, takes control and shows us who is boss, with his raw/aggressive performance. He is relentless and fierce, thus he makes this film stand out.However the aforementioned impeccable make up on Fox, keeps this light. It could almost be over censored.Still worth a watch for some light entertainment.",Till Death
279,val-kalinic,Outstandingly crafted thriller - massively underrated.,9,6 September 2021,One of the best thrillers I've seen in years. The story is consistent in keeping you interested and unfolding the story. No outlandish details that pull you out of the plot.

Yes she should have cut a vase and cut her husband's hand off, but she didn't. So who cares? Also cutting someone's hand off with a broken vase probably would have taken her hours and also cut her hand up really bad so why is everyone stuck on that? Like why do people think too much into it?

302,veselkokelava,Lot of hate for no reason,8,2 October 2021,"OK, so this movie got a lot of really bad reviews. First, because it's Megan Fox. Are you really gonna rate the movie 1/10 because you have some personal issues about Megan Fox? Grow up. Is it because she can't act? She did just fine in this movie.Second, people give it 1/10 stars because she could easily get out of the cuffs. Because, apparently you can cut off an arm with a little piece of a glass. Try cutting an apple with a piece of glass. You did it? Great. Now you've made it to the bone. And regardless, ever heard of suspension of disbelief?This movie has a great premise. A life or death game set up by a vengeful husband, filled with careful plans and symbolism. After the game is set, the wife explores all the different ways she could try to get out of current situation, only to find out that the husband sabotaged all means of escape.After that, the two antagonists are introduced, which leads to a game of cat and mouse, that's always shifting and changing. Couple of moments were a bit overdone for suspense, but mostly it was exciting and interesting, even funny in a few scenes.The final showdown was ok, nothing too exciting. CGI was the weakest point. Fake breath in the cold was working half the time and was very light. I don't think anyone working on this movie ever experienced winter outside the house.Overall, very fun movie, premise is excellent and intriguing, and the meat of the chase was entertaining. Yeah, it's not gonna win Oscars, but can you watch a movie for fun? This one is good fun.",Till Death
303,vasesm,The movie about the most stupid people,3,19 July 2021,I can't add something but there are a lot of stupid people and a lot of stupid decisions.But if you are drunk you can have a fun!Enjoy!,Till Death
304,zhygos,Turned out to be quite entertaining,6,2 July 2021,"Watching the trailer I had very low expectations for this movie but as I started watching the movie, I got slightly more and more into it as it went on. Far from a great film, it lacks development in most areas. For instance the relationship between the main characters was presented in out of the blue manner just like most of the scenes up until the second half of the movie. In the first half of the movie It was hard to follow what's really happening between the main characters apart from the few key details, - wanted far more story development, history than what was presented. Later on it sort of gave the vibes of the Gerald's Game movie, with the main idea narrowing towards more of an action type of thriller direction. Despite all the not so good things in this film, I still enjoyed watching it. I was pleased to see Megan Fox as the leading actor. I feel like she has uplifted my rating for this movie with her quite charming and at times mysterious acting. She sort of helped the heavily pitted storyline a little bit by having the skills to grab the audience's focus more towards her than the storyline itself (though I know that's usually not a good thing for most of people). I would give this film a 5.9 out of 10.",Till Death

Despite being outdoors in a snow covered winter area aside from the one time she lays outside no steam blows out of anyone's mouth. Story line is fairly bland predictable and overall acting is subpar as can be expected from a B list of actors.,Till Death
310,bilingavais,The bloopers...,2,11 October 2021,"Out of boredom while waiting for a ride this morning, I thought I'd check this out. Aside from the gawd awful acting...can someone explain how Megan""s character was able to get her husband's shirt on while handcuffed to him? I mean, unless it has removable sleeves, she shouldn't be able to put it on! Also, why was she carrying around two dozen white roses everywhere...they don't have vases in their building? It goes on and on. I couldn't finish watching it when I got home. You might enjoy the movie if you're a Megan Fox fan, but other than that, forget it.",Till Death

All the way through. Lots of 'as if' moments. How did she get the shirt on whilst she was handcuffed to him? Why was there no blood on her hair? How did her lipstick stay on all the way through? How did the car remote work from so far away? How did they not manage to find her in the house??? She was leaving blood trails, not to mention sitting with her dead lover for 5 minutes. How did the car get so far with just a dribble of gas? The list could go on.The plot of the film was very clever and it was played out well (especially the necklace) Just such a shame the acting and execution was so dire.",Till Death

I'm glad that - after a lot of hesitation and reading reviews - I decided to go and see it. The suspense was maintained well throughout the film, I personally found Megan's performance good, and I liked the way the film was shot and edited. With a small cast, a short running time and events largely taking place at a single location on a single day, the movie isn't overly ambitious and just does what it does very well. Anyway, I was entertained, would recommend :)",Till Death
319,amber_s00,Surprisingly not bad.. a few flaws.,7,6 August 2021,"I was really surprised at the storyline and how suspenseful it was, definitely keeps you watching. But unfortunately I agree with other reviews that Megan Fox's acting could have been better, or at least the director could have directed her better? It almost seemed like her husband shooting himself while handcuffed to her was an inconvenience, she almost just acted annoyed like when someone doesn't clean up after themselves or something. Also when her lover is being stabbed right in front of her, she was watching on like it was nothing..? Would have preferred some shivering fear and crying.And yes the perfect makeup all the way through wasn't her fault but also very noticeable and unbelievable. A few parts were a bit silly too but you can ignore those parts, really not a bad movie at all for an easy Friday night at home.",Till Death

When you watch a movie knowing too much about it you end up not liking it because there will be no surprises. Many plots of many movies tells too much and this is terrible.

351,stephaniedrenk-25837,Biggest waste of money,1,30 August 2021,Created an account just to leave this review. The whole movie can be watched in the trailer. She had so many times to cut her husband off of her but didn't. He did this to hurt her but she just dragged him around. Then you have 2 guys trying to kill her. When she gets away what happens. Bam the guy she just knocked out magically is okay and right behind her. Then she's under water with a huge knife.. but doesn't use it. This was the most predictable movie I've watch in 15 years. How this got any good reviews is beyond me. Dumb.,Till Death
352,vvictoriann,Good movie to watch!,8,10 September 2021,"For me, the thing with thrillers is that they usually make it too long. Don't get me wrong there are extremely good thrillers that are quite long, but you'll loose your attention to the story, and after half of the film is gone, you'll get it back, because the last half is full of action, excitement and surprises. Although this movie had it's ups and downs, it got my full attention. It was full of action even in the scenes, where she was dragging the body. The acting was great, especially on Megan Fox's side. She is really an underrated actress, she has the talent people not just the beautiful face! She may not be Meryl Streep, but I was hooked with her performance! ( as always )
In summary, I'm very surprised that some people didn't like this movie. It is enjoyable, suspenseful and it has a grip on your attention. So if you're really wondering if you should watch it or not...TURN IT ON! I can reassure you it'll be worth it!",Till Death
353,idanilovqa,"Fun, but why does color palette jumps like crazy?",6,7 November 2021,"What is wrong with the constantly shifting color palette in this movie?My wife and I watched it on Netflix and in second half of the movie almost every scene/camera angle has a different color palette from one another. Sometimes they change with the scene, and sometimes just in the middle of the scene, which is so jarring. We saw neutral palette, cold one, warm one, blueish, violet, green, very green, very bright. The most terrible thing is that these color palette switches happen during action scenes at the end where camera changes quite rapidly, so good heavens none of us are epileptic. It cannot be a choice, but I wonder if everyone saw this montage and didn't think anything about this issue? Or is this solely Netflix version problem? It even jumps to pinkish color one split second before cut to black at the end of the movie - I mean, what a **** up for an editor. Jeez.The movie itself we liked, fun survival one. Had problem with the shirt and her not breaking husband's thumb too.",Till Death

355,becciweightman,Don't waste your time!,1,2 October 2021,"If the story story line wasn't bad enough and also just unrealistic megan fox's acting is worse, she seems to care more about her makeup and look being perfect to care about actual continuity, the blood on her face comes and goes with each scene and her lipstick seems to stay perfectly topped up through out, and the annoying pout she does throughout makes it unwatchable just itself. Just a terrible badly written and badly acted movie all round. Don't waste your time!",Till Death
356,caifengforever,I mean... its watchable barely,3,3 October 2021,"I watched this movie strictly for megan fox. Shes gotten a bad shake so I wanted to watch one of her first starring roles in awhile. Girl.. wtf. Like I know she can act, but maybe she just wasn't ""feeling it""?Spoilers below:
I'm aware she's supposed to hate her husband so I wasn't expecting any real sadness, totally believable. But she seemed pretty blasé about everything. It made her character not very likeable so it was hard to ""root for her"" at all. I never felt emotionally invested. There are a TON of plot holes and you needing to pretend you don't know how things work for the movie to be enjoyable. The main character and almost everyone but her husband make a ton of really dumb decisions, it doesn't seem like anyone is acting logically. I think the main character was really underestimated for someone who we had to believe could do so many different things. Really you only need to break a few thin bones to remove cuffs and blood is a fairly good lubricant. She could have easily broken his hand with a chair or even a door. But to make the premise work she needed to be stuck and idk. I spent the majority of the movie rolling my eyes and yelling at the TV. And the ending ... that just isn't how that works. That's nit how any of that would go. The ice. The water. How 911 works. None of itI really wanted to like this movie but I just didn't. It is watchable I guess if you have literally nothing else to do for an hour and a half. It is full of physical feats if you're into that I guess.My opinion: poorly acted, not even vaguely believable, but was a good idea in theory. If u wanna see a good movie about a dead husband and a girl handcuffed watch geralds game 🤷‍♀️",Till Death

But, to my surprise I got into it after the first say 5 minutes. I will have t watch it again to see if any information was given early in the movie about what would be happening in the plot. I thought this was a good movie, suspenseful, scare factor and build up to action was great. I had no idea where plot was going until it got there. The end was totally awesome.

I love the fact that she (Megan Fox) gets booted in the face by a size 13 boot and still comes up looking like a barby doll which is very much like her acting ability. The baddie not only gets smacked around the head with a shovel...and gets up, but then gets smacked around the head with a monster monkey wrench...and gets up! There were sounds of rejoicing when she got dragged down in to the lake but we were all gutted when she managed to hack through thick ice...with a knife? And drag herself out? Utter rubbish.

364,lvozar,So much lazy writing,4,6 July 2021,"A decent suspense movie surprisingly not dragged down by Megan Fox's acting as much bad writing. Where to begin? Early on, you will start to question many things - like a bad horror movie (""let's hide behind those chain saws!""). Would she really stay blindfolded that long? How did he remove everything from the house in whatever short time she slept? Or are we meant to believe that she would be that oblivious? As another review said, I'm spending all this time watching her drag around a corpse more than she likely could ever physically do, while thinking ""just break his thumb or hand already! "". Or, break the vase and use the glass? And, of course, the boyfriend conveniently (for the nonsensical writing, that is) leaves his phone charging in the car, after what we already know was a long drive to get there! Yet, not charged enough to take? Is there ANYONE in the real world that would not take it with them? Then, after she convinces him that he was setup, he decides the best thing to do is to confront the two guys outside who he noticed hanging out in their truck up the road when he drove by, with her locked inside the house. Finally, she thought washing up her face to look pretty was worth lugging the corpse up and down more stairs even when she should have been completely exhausted at that point, because I guess you don't do that in a kitchen sink? With just a little attention to the script with some easy cleanup, this might had been watchable without constantly focusing on those annoyances!",Till Death

A good plot twist would be: dead Mark transforms into a yellow saw and she cuts her own head off.Hey Megan, this proves good looks do not equate to talent (I know, that cold mirror tells you, as time passes, despite what your agents say, give it up-please listen); so, you should pursue those opportunities in Oak Ridge coffee shops, tell Shia and Maxim stories the locals would listen affectionately forever ...or wait better yet perhaps pursue a marriage with any ""Mark"" you choose, and let's eventually see if you can hold your breath for more than 20 seconds in frozen water. Doubt it. Yay!SK Dale, from first to worst --so please...just stop and spare us all. You are not talented and funding doesn't mean so or justify continuing. Perhaps head back to Melbourne then down to Torquay or Great Ocean Road for some failed surfing attempts?

Congrats, more than a writer, you're an amazing con man. Perhaps run for office? This wreaks of other even more pathetic and poor horror films, like grabbing various tinker toys and putting them together saying ""new film"", like Saw, Very Bad Things, etc. Come on man, that cold mirror when no one else is around can't possibly be reaffirming for you. What's next? A lego horror movie? Your potential audience there won't see the talent flaws.Screen Media - where do I start? I amazed you'd put money into this or well anyone would. Literally. I have a few bridges for you too in northern Siberia, perfect for you and your execs. Gambling is fun when its with other people's money, I guess. But fiduciary duty has a significant meaning at some point. Enjoy the losses on this one. I can't wait to see another few masterpieces lose millions with hundreds back in sales.

Where to begin...Megan Fox is usually a great actress, but this felt like she never acted in her life before. Her skills were lacking from the beginning of the movie. The plot line was there, but the acting killed it. Her makeup was never smudged or worn off, her hair was always perfect, nothing like real life. There were picture frames with glass, she could have easily broken a piece and cut her husband's hand off. Pulling her dead husband's body around the house while 2 other people were in there, how they didn't hear it..who knows. Being in freezing cold temperature, but somehow only wearing a pair of slacks and a button down shirt, she barely for cold... meanwhile the other guys show up in big heavy coats.

I have no problem calling something good if it deserves it but this was just BAD! Watching it to the end is not only a waste of time but it's physically and mentally excruciating! To the person who said Megan Fox is a mannequin that breathes is giving her way to much credit. Mannequins.have more facial movement than she exhibits in this movie. I'm normally not this negative. I actually watched this hopping to like it but the acting is just horrible by everybody except maybe the main killer and they take what can be and interesting plot and make it completely nonsensical. If you are going to watch this because the plot does sound interesting then I would recommend ""Geralds Game"" by Stephen King.

377,jarrettstearns,What did I watch......a magic show!,1,19 August 2021,Ok my wife loves Megan Fox and begged me to watch. Starts out good until the main plot. First thing I couldn't get over was the shirt. Let's start off with she's handcuffed to her now dead husband. Let me repeat that... She is HANDCUFFED TO HER DEAD HUSBAND. How in the heck does she get dressed with the shirt he was wearing without ripping the shirt? She somehow gets the shirt off him and puts it on in one scene and it is a dress shirt button down. She gets his body and her body through the sleeve without a single rip...... Amazing! She needs to perform for emperor's and kings because not even Houdini could do that!

I felt this was crying out for a Jennifer Lawrence performance to be more believable.It watches as though the direction was to maintain Fox's makeup as opposed to her delivering a believable performance.Her makeup doesn't appear to budge despite sleeping, waking up and getting covered in blood and gore, WASHING, getting roughed up, falling in a lake, the list goes on.

To feel the suspense in scenes where the lead is in a bad situation there needs to be an empathetic relationship between the character and the viewer.
