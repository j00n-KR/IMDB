0,Leofwine_draca,"Not a bad premise, but the plot lets it down",5,17 October 2017,"In case you were wondering what McG was up to these days, he's directing films like THE BABYSITTER for Netflix. This is a pitch-black comedy with plenty of explicit horror touches and a deliberately '80s throwback vibe, with retro stylings and the like. The story is about an annoying kid who soon learns a dark secret about his 'hot' blonde babysitter. The story is set over the course of a single night and contains all manner of cat-and-mouse mayhem, with regular gore scenes that are played for laughs. I enjoyed it to a degree - it's my kind of film, after all - but the unfunny script really lets it down and makes the first half of the movie in particular a chore to sit through. The acting isn't up to much either.",The Babysitter
1,SnoopyStyle,surprised to like this,8,26 February 2018,"Cole (Judah Lewis) is a 12 year old bullied pushover. His parents are often away. Bee (Samara Weaving) is his beloved, ultra-sexy, ultra-tough, and ultra-cool babysitter. His best friend Melanie claims that all babysitters have sex with their boyfriends after the kids go to sleep. Cole decides to stay up and sneak downstairs to spy on Bee. He finds that she's doing much more than having sex.I am pleasantly surprised that I actually liked this movie. I expected something stupid but this is loads of fun. It's a comedy action horror from McG. It has some of his silly fast-cut comedy style. It's not overwhelming while keeping his sensibilities which helps a lot. The writing has plenty of knowing comedy without the excesses of his silliness. I love Weaving and this kid Lewis. Maybe the lowered expectations got me but I quite enjoyed this.",The Babysitter
2,kosmasp,Kids these days,7,30 March 2018,"Well I reckon that's something some people may say. Also: when is the appropriate age to stop having a babysitter? But then again, this doesn't care about logic or too much story. It's a fun ride ... that has quite some violence and blood in it too. Not for the faint hearted or those that cannot stomache brutal images.But they are also funny - some may not like this at all actually. Some do like their movies to be serious and not wink at the audience most of the time. McG is known for style over substance. So you should not be surprised by this. There is no nudity, but there are some sensual situations/predicaments. I'm putting this out there, because some may care one way or the other. The ""Home Alone"" reference is not without validation - but way more mature and some may argue at least as entertaining if you are into that sort of stuff. The overacting is on purpose and works quite nice ...",The Babysitter
3,Sleepin_Dragon,The slasher genre is not finished yet.,8,2 February 2018,"I think it's fair to say the slasher genre hasn't been at its best for a few years, the norm has been disappointment after disappointment, my initial hopes for The Babysitter were low, the realisation was fortunately a positive one.The film is clever, funny, slick, and manages to cause a few minor jumps, ultimately without being scary. The fantasy of many a teen boy, having a drop dead gorgeous Baby Sitter turn to a Nightmare when she wants his blood, it's such a clever premise for a film, kind of like Home Alone does minor horror.Samara Weaving is absolutely glorious, she's a stunning girl, and one that can act, I thought she was terrific, young Judah Lewis (Cole) was good, as was Robbie Amell (Max) who got to show off his pex.Exciting and funny is equal measures, the characters certainly play on their own stereotypes to the max, Weaving steals every scene though.",The Babysitter
4,gavin6942,"Perfect Companion to ""Better Watch Out""",7,22 October 2017,"The events of one evening take an unexpected turn for the worst for a young boy trying to spy on his babysitter.Earlier in 2017, I watched ""Better Watch Out"", which has some of the same dynamics of a kid versus his babysitter. Both have the theme of the kid being a bit too old and having a crush on his sitter before things turn dark. Coincidence? Most likely, but still makes for an interesting pair.McG blends the humor and gore perfectly here... this may be his best film yet. Samara Weaving is cast perfectly, and the rest of the team is not bad, either. A few unpredictable moments make this more than your paint-by-numbers horror film (or horror-comedy)!",The Babysitter
5,Tweekums,A better than expected horror movie,8,1 July 2021,"Twelve year old Cole is bullied at school and is the only child he knows of his age who still has a babysitter... but what a babysitter! Babysitter Bee is a gorgeous blonde who is kind to Cole and treats him with respect. When his parents go away for the night Bee is called in again; we know something isn't quite right when she gives him a shot of whisky. He doesn't drink it as he wants to know what she does when he has gone to sleep. Sneaking out of bed he finds out... she invites friends round for a night of satanic fun that includes a human sacrifice and requires some of Cole's blood! When they realise he is awake and saw them commit a murder his life is in grave danger... he'll be lucky to get out of the house alive. If he is to survive he will have to toughen up fast.I didn't expect too much of this but ended up pleasantly surprised. It took its time introducing the main characters making both Cole and Bee likeable before the gore gets underway. The first death came as quite a surprise despite knowing it was only a matter of time before characters started dying. While it is never terrifying there are plenty of good tense moments and some original kills, some of which are impressively gory. There are also lots of laughs to be had; often during the more gruesome moments. The cast did a fine job; most obviously Judah Lewis, as Cole, and Samara Weaving as Bee. Horror movies frequently look fairly cheap but this never does. Overall I'd recommend this to horror fans.",The Babysitter
6,BA_Harrison,McG is back.,7,15 October 2017,"Music video director McG's first feature, Charlie's Angels, received a fair amount of critical backlash, but I found it to be pretty entertaining in an inconsequential and undemanding way; however, the subsequent stinker of a sequel and the abysmal Terminator Salvation had me writing the director off as a no-hoper. Now, Netflix original The Babysitter, a tongue-in-cheek tween horror, sees McG bouncing back, delivering a film that, while short on logic and heavy on the gimmicky music video style editing, guarantees a lot of mindless fun.Judah Lewis plays timid twelve-year-old Cole, the target of local bullies; Cole's only friends are pretty neighbour Melanie (Emily Alyn Lind), and his sexy babysitter Bee (Samara Weaving). When Cole's parents leave for the weekend, leaving him in the care of Bee, Melanie dares the boy to stay awake to see what his babysitter gets up to after he is in bed. Spying from the landing, Cole sees Bee and several friends playing spin the bottle followed by a spot of ritualistic murder and some dabbling in the occult. Panicking, Cole tries to make his escape, but in doing so, alerts Bee and her pals, who give chase. What follows is like a demented version of Home Alone, Cole using household items and cunning to prevent himself from becoming the next victim of Bee and her friends.Admittedly, it all gets a bit far fetched at times, particularly with the surrounding neighbours seemingly oblivious to the explosions, gunshots and general mayhem occurring across the street, but solid performances, the fast pace, and the creative and gory death scenes all go to making this a very enjoyable time-waster.",The Babysitter
7,paul_haakonsen,"Cute and pretty outside, cold and evil inside...",6,30 December 2018,"I was browsing through the library of movies on Netflix when I came across ""The Babysitter"". I read the synopsis and instantly had to watch the movie. So I did...And I was in for a blast. This was a funny movie.""The Babysitter"" had a good cast and they individually performed quite well with their given characters and roles.I will say that the story was genuinely entertaining, although somewhat generic and predictable. But with that in mind, it was a story that is full of laughs, action, thrills and drama. So there is something for just about everyone here.""The Babysitter"" seems like a very adequate semi-horror movie for a younger audience, or an audience being introduced to the horror genre. There is a very light-hearted feel to the movie, despite it having some heavy horror elements to it.This movie is somewhat similar to the movie ""Better Watch Out"", so if you enjoyed that movie, then you will definitely also like ""The Babysitter"", no doubt about that.I was genuinely entertained with this movie and found it to be a pleasant surprise, actually much better than I had initially thought or hoped for. If you haven't already seen ""The Babysitter"", and if you do get the chance, jump at it, because it is well worth it.",The Babysitter
8,Quinoa1984,This got on the Blacklist(?),3,12 February 2018,"The Babysitter sees the most effort from the young cast. Or, I should be more specific, Judah Lewis as the 12-year old Cole, who is an average nerdy kid who gets picked on and maybe rightfully so (he dresses like the squarest Mormon this side of Orgazmo), and Samara Weaving as the babysitter of the title, Bee. They have great chemistry together on screen - not romantic, obviously, just that they get along together so well up until, well, the Dumb Horror Movie Plot kicks in. I have to give credit to them because they say everything they're given with total conviction and they're having fun playing these people. The rest around them... more hit or miss, and that's being kind.But the main problem here is that The Babysitter is really stupid and pretty bad. It's like a would-be/Wannabe school cafeteria version of Joss Whedon meatloaf, or Kevin Williamson on a bad/hit-head-and-concussed day writing Home Alone (or for that matter John Hughes in the same situation writing Scream), and either way McG and screenwriter Brian Duffield think they're clever (Dufffield wrote the not terrible but unremarkable Jane Got a Gun, also abandoned from its original release schedule). They're not. A lot of this is obnoxious, and possibly 15 to 20% is genuine fun and subversive and a turn of the screws on the genre, whatever this 80's pastiche is.And yet this is one of the handful of Netflix movies I would have dug seeing in a theater with a packed crowd - tellingly, it was originally meant for release in 2015 before being shelved and picked up by Netflix. Try as everyone does - some far too much and loudly, it's that kind of laughably bad horror which is usually full of wretched dialog but also some good lines and a lot of WTF kills. In other words, the fatal sin is that The Babysitter is smug. It goes by quickly and has way way WAY too much style to burn. McG Unchained.",The Babysitter
9,Calicodreamin,A solid teen horror film,7,11 October 2020,"Actually a lot better than I thought it would be, the first kill was unexpected and the storyline was well developed. The acting was pretty good and solid effects on the kills. An enjoyable teen horror film.",The Babysitter
10,morrison-dylan-fan,The Sitter.,7,6 October 2018,"In the final months of IMDb's Horror board (RIP) I saw a number of posters mention about being surprised by director ""McG"" doing a good Horror flick! Wanting this year to view more titles featured on Netflix,I decided to sit in with the babysitter.View on the film:Filmed in 2015 but left sitting on the shelf for years, the delay actually now works to the advantage of the movie, due to it now joining the run of Horrors inspired by 1980's flicks. Finding a genre where his flashy styling actually fits, director McG & cinematographer 
Shane Hurlbut charge up a bubblegum Power-Pop atmosphere of gliding shots round Cole's house, and covering the screen in candy colour yellows, pinks and reds that gives the satanic cult an animated baddies appearance. Cutting away Bee's cuteness, McG is surprisingly giddy in going full-on for the splatter, which is wonderfully slanted towards the comedic, as the home alone kid Cole creates explosive plans to get the gang out of the house.Keeping Bee's devilish plans out of sight for the opening 30 minutes, the screenplay by Brian Duffield (whose films all have a woman as the lead) sweetly builds the puppy love Cole has for Bee. Stabbing Cole's romance dreams out, Duffield gives Bee and each of her pals a punky bite, springing from high school cheerleader drama queen Allison and psychotic jock Max, to the one-line spitting, shot-gun welding Bee. Catching Cole (and the viewers) eyes, sexy Samara Weaving gives a delicious performance as Bee, whose cheerful, happy go lucky look Weaving hilariously turns into a blood-thirsty psycho. Starring in fellow 80's Horror tribute Summer of 84 (2018), Judah Lewis gives a very good turning in expressing the innocent love Cole has for Bee,which Lewis twists into jumpy fear, as Cole tries to run away from the babysitter.",The Babysitter
11,kannibalcorpsegrinder,One of the finer genre efforts,9,25 November 2017,"Stuck at home with his babysitter, a bullied teen initially trying to spy on her extracurricular activities finds that she's part of a pack of individuals looking to offer a sacrifice for a satanic being and must try to outwit her and her friends as they try to carry out their evil plans.This here was quite the exceptionally enjoyable effort. One of the finest aspects of this one is the fact that there's such a fun atmosphere at the core of the film as there's plenty of good times to be had. The off-beat humor at the heart of this one allows plenty of laughs, from surprise quips and one-liners that pop out at the most unexpected moments to continually harping on a rather useless point to the absurd situations present here with the idea of the group coming to the house in order to engage in a satanic sacrifice that's going to occur after everybody's fallen asleep which really helps to make this one so much fun during the initial setup of the first half. Since that goes hand-in-hand with their relationship during the sleepover and how they are together which not only has the fun relationship at the center of this one as well as the enhancement of some of that fun from the fine antics they engage in which makes for a fine start to this one by being played up throughout the rest of the film. The film really hits it's stride once it turns into a horror effort, as the whole affair is a lot of fun with the explosive and wholly shocking sacrifice scene that comes at the tail end of the titillating seduction scene which is the start of it all. That leads into the dark and twisted yet still somewhat comical scenes of the group getting their plans interrupted as well as the frantic interaction with the investigative officers that really kicks the film up with some intense action of the group getting the upper hand. With the series of fun, intense chases here that keep this one moving forward with a sense of humor amongst the thrills generated here of the encounter in the crawlspace, the battle in the dilapidated treehouse or the chase through the backyard, this keeps up a fine energy with plenty of stellar humor and a chilling atmosphere. With the finale turning into a chilling stalking scene in the neighbors' house with plenty of tense moments and a lack of humor, it makes for a fine time here that gives this an appropriately suspenseful time here with plenty to like about it as this fully ties in the themes of self-reliance and being a grown- up that had been a part of this one from the start. Alongside the fine gore for the inventive kills, these here really make this one exceptionally enjoyable while holding it up over it's few minor flaws. The main issue is the constant pop-ups that appear here which are an annoyance and don't really mean much of anything so its inclusion is rather confusing. The other problem is the pacing in the finale which seems to go on a little too long with so many false endings that it saps some of the energy out of the finale. These here are all that hold this one down.Rated Unrated/R: Graphic Violence, Graphic Language and children-in- jeopardy.",The Babysitter
12,phd_travel,Horrible not a comedy at all,1,15 October 2017,This movie is so bad. it's not a comedy at all. A bunch of teens terrorizing a young boy - how can that be funny? The cast is fine it's the story that's bad. Bella Thorne only has a small supporting role. It's mainly Samara Weaving as the babysitter. Not much explanation for her craziness. Even Robbie Amell is too good for this material.Not good enough for Netflix.,The Babysitter
13,trashgang,bad beginning and on the edge of boredom but kicks it when the sun goes down,7,14 November 2017,"i didn't know what to expect from this so-called horror combined with comedy. I've been so afraid of those kind of movies because 90% doesn't work out or aren't funny. And the first 20 minutes I thought, where is the horror and where is the fun?Because those first minutes it's all about a boy being pranked and being bullied because he'""s twelve years old and still has a babysitter. But it's when his neighbour girlfriend tells him to go see what she is doing once he's asleep that it becomes worth seeing. From there on, this rather boring start turns into a soft horror but the red stuff flows and makes it sometimes a bit funny. It works but it still has it flows and so at the end it wasn't a mediocre flick for me. I did have my laughter especially with the booby situations of the cheerleader. Of course the splatter being added makes it worth watching but you have to wait until the sun goes down before the babysitter reveals her dark secret.Gore 1/5 Nudity 0/5 Effects 3/5 Story 2,5/5 Comedy 1/5",The Babysitter
14,Hellmant,"Probably giving this film a little too overly generous of a review, but ...!",9,20 October 2017,"'THE BABYSITTER': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five) A horror-comedy directed by McG, and released by Netflix (through their online streaming service). It's about a young teenager with a crush on his very attractive babysitter, who then learns that she's part of a satanic cult that wants to kill him. The movie stars Judah Lewis, Samara Weaving, Bella Thorne, Robbie Amell, Andrew Bachelor, Hana Mae Lee, Emily Alyn Lind, Leslie Bibb and Ken Marino. It was written by Brian Duffield, and it's gotten mixed reviews from critics (but viewers have been much more appreciative of it). I had a complete blast watching it.Cole (Lewis) is 13-years-old, and he's also the only kid in his class that still has a babysitter. He's constantly bullied for it, and also for being excessively passive in almost every way. Cole feels like he's in love with his babysitter though, who's named Bee (Weaving), because she's incredibly beautiful, excessively cool, and extremely nice to him (as well as other nerdy outsiders). So he stays up late one night, past his bedtime, and spies on Bee to see what she's doing. It's then that he discovers that she's in a satanic cult, with her other popular friends, and they're planning to steal his blood. Cole must then learn to defend himself, for the very first time, and survive this murderous maniacal teenage cult.I'm probably giving this film a little too overly generous of a review, but I do love movies that remind me of my childhood (I really appreciate nostalgia). I grew up on kid adventure films (like 'GOONIES' and 'THE LOST BOYS'), and this bloody horror flick is really an awesome kids movie at heart (a gruesomely violent one at that though). It's highly reminiscent of the type of violent kids movies that I cherished as a pre-teen (the new 'IT' remake is a lot like that as well). So I really enjoyed this film for that reason. It's a lot of fun, funny at times, and it's just a badass awesome kids adventure flick!Watch an episode of our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/oV2G3RUT234",The Babysitter
15,thesar-2,Not Exactly Home Alone,9,6 November 2017,"McG: Pussy No More!What starts off as a hilarious and touching coming-of-age, light-hearted film quickly reminds you: ""Yeah. This is still a horror movie.""To be fair, it's probably 70/30, comedy/horror, but it's still scary at times. And this is surprising from Director Charlie Angel. And even more shocking: it's smart.Scaredy-cat Cole has one thing going for him: the hottest babysitter who really gets him. In fact, when things go wrong in his life, he still has her to lean on. Well, until she reveals herself as the Devil's Candy. This movie, I swear to the opposite of worship, is as close to The Final Girls as a movie can be. It's well shot, absolutely hilarious and intelligent with the situations these characters are put in. As a fan of horror, of course I'm inserting logic into conditions I'm not actually involved in and they call me out. I couldn't be more and more impressed with how meta this was.As stated before, I loved the first 20 or so minutes as it was such a sweet story. I knew where it was going, thanks to several people's reviews and once that ship started sailing, I was still onboard. It stayed with the humor, direction and wackiness as this kid's world was established early on.Think: An adult, gruesome at times and much more fun Home Alone and you'll be carried away to the genius of the little movie that could. The only drawbacks were the overambitious ideas, screen creds and over-the- top finale and even then, what led up to that forgives any outlandish climax.Fan of horror-comedy? Call this Babysitter for your immediate fix of the perfect blend. ***Final thoughts: Seriously, this is two ideas in one, like the novel Misery was. And in both cases, I loved both and would love to see both fleshed out. So, if they were to make a sequel, I'm totally there.",The Babysitter
16,bensonmum2,So much fun!,9,21 November 2017,"12 year-old Cole (Judah Lewis) may be a nerdy little kid who's picked on at school, but he's got one thing the other kids don't - he's got a super-cool, super-hot babysitter, Bee (Samara Weaving). They have a blast together and she seems to enjoy his company as much as he does hers. So when Bee comes over to stay with Cole while his parents are out-of-town, nothing could be more perfect. Well, that is, until late at night when Cole is supposed to be asleep, he sees Bee stab some dude in the head with two daggers as part of a Satanic ritual. Needless to say, things get real bad for Cole real fast.As I've said at least 1,624,857 times, I watch movies for entertainment. If a film entertains me, then that's all that really matters. And The Babysitter entertained me like few movies I've seen recently. It's a total blast from beginning to end. The mix of some very funny comedy bits with some nice gore shots and plenty of action checks all my entertainment boxes. The start of the movie reminded me of one of those 70s-era coming of age films where the kid falls for the older girl only to have his heartbroken. The Babysitter follows that pattern for about the first 30 minutes. But once Bee pulls out the daggers, all hell breaks loose and the films kicks into another gear. I know a lot of people complain that The Babysitter's not realistic etc. To those people I say just try to get over it and go with it. It's not meant to be a serious thriller. If you go into with that mindset, I see why you'd be disappointed. But go into with an open-mind and you might have as much fun as I did.I was really blown away with both leads - Judah Lewis and Samara Weaving. For Lewis, I believe this is only his second acting credit. For someone so inexperienced, he really delivers. As for Weaving, I predict a big future for her. She's got the looks, ability, and a real screen presence that should do well for her in the future.One last thing, even though he's only on-screen for a few minutes, I always enjoy seeing Ken Marino (playing ""Dad"" in this film). He's been a favorite of mine since his days of playing the sleazy Vinnie Van Lowe in Veronica Mars.",The Babysitter

18,bowmanblue,Cinema is dying,8,4 December 2017,"Don't let the kind of bland name, i.e. 'The Babysitter'' fool you into thinking this film isn't anything special. Yes, it's a 'Netflix original' and don't let that fool you into thinking that it's just there to make up the quota of 'in-house content' on the web's streaming service. In the UK Netflix costs less than a tenner a month to watch a variety of film and TV and, before you think I'm being sponsored by Netflix, I'm merely pointing out that if you can get original films like 'The Babysitter' for that price, what's the point in going to the cinema that often?Anyway, onto the film. If you check out the blurb of the film you'll see that it's a horror movie, but I won't go into too much detail as I don't want to give anything away that you might not have guessed. It's about a twelve-year-old boy who, much to his disgust, still has to have a babysitter whenever his parents go away. However, despite his initial humiliation, it's not so bad, as he's head over heels in love with his sitter. She's a good looking young girl who is literally his 'fantasy' woman, as she indulges in everything he's into (well, all apart from the obvious thing he's interested in, but that's left up to his teenage imagination). In fact, she seems too good to be true and, whenever that happens, you know something is going to go wrong. And it does. And, in horror terms, something 'wrong' normally involves vast amounts of blood and guts. 'The Babysitter' happily provides such gore.'Meta' is the word I'd use to describe the film. Don't expect to be scared, more amused. The script is light-hearted and self-knowing, even when bodies are being diced it never takes itself seriously – and it's all the better for it. It's your basic 'horror-comedy' (or should that be 'black comedy?') with the emphasis on the humour. Of course the jokes are only really as good as the actors delivering them and I'm pleased to say that a film who stars a twelve-year-old as the lead could be a risk. Luckily, he never comes across as brattish or annoying (like so many child actors do!) and he's quite a believable and relatable hero to root for. Then you have the babysitter herself. She too is a joy to watch as she comes across as cool, caring and friendly, meaning the two leads can play off each other well.If you're into horror-comedies that are simple enjoyable (adult!) romps then you definitely have to watch this one – especially as you probably won't be able to get it on DVD or see it in the cinema! It's definitely worth adding to your 'watchlist!'",The Babysitter

Luckily for Cole his sitter is a leggy blonde named Bee (Samara Weaving) who is into sci-fi and junk food.After Bee puts Cole to bed her friends (Bella Thorne, Hana Mae Lee, Robbie Amell) show up for a human sacrifice. Now, it's up to Cole to keep them from completing their unholy ceremony. Trying desperately to be both hilarious and horrific, this tongue-in-cheek teen slasher fails on all fronts.

23,tabuno,A Uneven Dark Comedy Thriller that For the Most Part Works,7,8 January 2019,"14 November 2017. This is a er...R-rated Pulp Fiction (1994) for adolescents. This very dark comedy has graphic violence and verbiage. It begins relatively benignly almost like the original Spider Man (2002) with Tobey Maguire. Then suddenly as expected or more so, it turns graphically raw and more so. The balance between parody, comedy, and horror is delicately distorted and perhaps not perfectly so. This is no Adventures in Babysitting (1987), but something more along the lines of Rosemary's Baby (1968) meets The Shining (1980) but of course not a crisply and cinematographically beautiful. Instead the McG uses some interesting and unusual photographic techniques that enhance the gyrating and nerve-wracking excitement. There are a number of Buffy The Vampire Slayer (1997-2003, TV) comments by some of the evil characters in an attempt to lighten the gruesome horror, but still the movie remains pretty harsh in its destructive display as well as our boyish protagonist who apparently develops a pretty wicked sense of cynicism along the way. At some point, the movie sort of descends into a horror movie with cute side remarks, but the scenes become more repetitive in a scripted, forced manipulating sort of way. Sometimes it's a wonder when under stress scriptwriters and real people think go upstairs or into another room. They never seem to think about getting away, like really far away. Nevertheless the wry humor keeps coming to soften the idiotic decision-making at times. Overall, The Babysitter does what it set out to do, entertain with a dizzying array of corny, witty, and sometimes over the top gruesome.",The Babysitter

Well, because it's actually really damn good.It tells the story of a scaredy cat weak little boy who still has a babysitter. One night he falls curious to what she does after he goes to sleep and see's more than he ever could have expected.A Netflix original movie starring Samara Weaving, Hana Mae Lee, Bella Thorne, Leslie Bibb and Ken Marino it looks shiney, makes great use of it's soundtrack and has a wonderful 1980's vibe about it.Make no mistake this is not a light hearted piece and is overflowing with lashings of violence and gore to go hand in hand with the hilarity.Early on I recognised that the film had a real charm about it but I certainly never expected it to be THIS good. I get the impression this will be one of those odd titles like the infamously hated The Hottie & The Nottie (2008) which folks don't agree with me on but I think this was excellent.A gory rollercoaster ride that tips its hat to 80's classics but brings them into a new era which I couldn't help but appreciate.The Good:Looks greatSolid soundtrackPerfectly craftedThe Bad:Nothing immediatly springs to mindThings I Learnt From This Movie:We still didn't find out why he was shirtless!!!!There are spoilt kids, then there is himIt's normally ugly people who are sacrificed",The Babysitter

Then again, having experienced the travesty that was Scary Movie and its ilk, the who concept of a horror-comedy doesn't really seem to work with me. Then again, they do tend to be out there, as is evident from this film, and yes, they do tend to go a little more overboard, but aren't anywhere near as stupid as some of the attempts that I have seen to create the genre.I can't say that I found this film particularly funny, though there are some aspects of it that was pretty good, especially since I'm not a particularly big fan of horror films, especially poorly made ones (but then again I doubt many people are fond of poorly made films full stop). I won't say that it was necessarily clever, but it certainly did have some charm about it that made it pretty good.Basically it's about this kid who has this really attractive baby-sitter that his parents always hire. Anyway, his best friend, who happens to live across the road, gets him to check out what they get up to after he goes to bed, so he sneaks out and what starts out as an innocent game of spin the bottle gets a little out of control when the babysitter murders her boyfriend. Mind you, one probably should be a little suspicious considering that he doesn't look like the type of guy that his babysitter would go out with.Well, basically they spot him, and then the movie pretty much involves him running around the house dealing with each of the friends one by one. Of course, the babysitter is what they term as being 'the big bad', so she is dealt with at the end. Okay, there are a couple of jump scares, but in general, it is pretty much what I would expect from such a movie, though it is somewhat a little more light hearted than others that I've seen.I guess in part it is sort of a coming of age film, but also one where our protagonist learns to stick up for himself. The fact that he has to take down the school jock, among other things, sort suggests that, and you could say that he does get the girl in the end, even though she really doesn't appear all that much in the film. However, I didn't think that it was all that bad, and it does have some rather interesting scenes in it as well. In fact, for a straight to Netflix film, it actually wasn't bad at all.",The Babysitter

27,paulclaassen,Unique and different.,6,5 January 2020,"'The Babysitter' is unlike anything I've seen before and completely unpredictable. The first thing I noticed, was the stunning photography. Also note the use of bright and colorful decor. This film looks awesome on screen.The acting is really good. Judah Lewis is excellent as Cole, the film's protagonist, and Samara Weaving is incredible as the babysitter, the film's antagonist. There's an unlikely chemistry between these characters that make the film work as well as it does. The relationship between them is also a very different and unique protagonist vs antagonist relationship. Even actors in the smaller roles - like Emily Alyn Lind as Melanie - are really good.The film is funny and suspenseful in equal proportions and works well on all levels: comedy, horror, gore, action, suspense, you name it. Pay attention to the detail from the beginning of the film, as everything here happens and is mentioned for a reason. This is a very clever script.

33,jtindahouse,Fun but lacking in depth,5,18 October 2017,"'The Babysitter' was a film I really wanted to like (and certainly did in parts) but for the most part just couldn't. It was actually a lot of fun and had some genuinely funny moments, however what it lacked was any depth or actual reason for the audience to care. I would describe it as feeling rushed. The evolution from normality to crazy was far too quick and never makes you buy into the concept. Is that really that important you might ask? I think it is because without some time spent setting up a reason for people to be doing the things they're doing you simply have absurdity for the sake of absurdity.The films strength is its humour. There really are some funny lines thrown out there at random moments. The horror side of things isn't going to do much for people. There's some well done gore, but its all far too light-hearted to ever actually be scary. The biggest problem this movie is going to face is that there's nothing overly memorable about it. I suspect it will be completely gone from my memory by tomorrow. It's not a bad film, just one that if you never watch you're not really missing out on anything.",The Babysitter

It was positively awful.And then I saw it, the director, McG.It all made sense, it was a movie that went too far and not in the great wonderful pushing the limits kind of way, but in the too friendly afraid to take a serious turn, afraid to take a comedic turn, so rather its best to charge head-long into the realm of mediocrity kind of way.Every point that the story could turn into something great, every little part where a a spurt of blood could be real gore, every place where it could have been hysterical...it seems like the director backed off.He took a turn out of fear and the result was...meh. Only ""MEH"" in all caps.Its a shame, it could have been a great fun Halloween Guilty Pleasure. It could have been a cheap Scream, an expensive Evil Dead. Instead its just...meh.And what is worse, its Meh for lack of will.",The Babysitter
35,jadavix,Lame horror comedy,6,8 February 2018,"Netflix is a very different medium than that which the average film is displayed. Most films have historically been made with the assumption that they will be viewed on the big screen. Now, with the fate of the multiplex looking uncertain - is it going to go the way of TV? - it remains to be seen how streaming services will change the cinematic landscape.You see, even if you are bored watching a movie in a theatre, it's kind of hard to do anything else. Obnoxious people might start a conversation with the people next to them, but I believe that is still frowned upon. I guess you could start texting someone, or play a game on your phone, but that's a relatively small screen competing with the much bigger one you've been sat in front of.Netflix, however, is made to be watched in the comfort of your own home. For many viewers, it's just another window open on their PC while they do something else.If you have read this far, you might be wondering what this has to do with ""The Babysitter"", the latest tack-fest from music video brat McG. The answer is that ""The Babysitter"" seems to have been deliberately made for that ""seven windows open at a time in Chrome while I text on my iPhone"" crowd. It just keeps pulling out attention-getting tricks like the words ""WHAT THE FUCK"" printed large on the screen after something surprising just happened. There's a scene of the hero disco dancing with his sexy babysitter where you're wondering if he's supposed to be a professional dancer, and if you're supposed to think their routine was choreographed, and you're wondering if the average house could be made over to look like an '80s nightclub so quickly. Then we see the hero and his babysitter sitting outside watching the movie ""Billy Jack"" projected pristinely onto his shed wall, while they quote lines verbatim and act out scenes. There are scenes in fast forward. Scenes in slow motion. Scenes in regular motion in the foreground, and slow motion in the background. Some of this is pretty cool to look at. Most of it is annoying, like McG is trying so hard to keep you from getting distracted that he is the one distracting you instead.Describing this to you, I'm starting to doubt myself. Is ""The Babysitter"" trying to keep our attention so we don't minimize its window and do something else, or is it trying to keep us off guard so we don't question the ridiculous things we're seeing?I haven't even gotten to the plot yet. Or the violence.Cole is the typical nerdy picked on boy who's also a coward. He does have a couple of things going for him, though: he has a close friend who is a girl who is, at least, his equal in terms of intelligence. The aforementioned slow-mo-in-the-background scene happens when he and the girl are sitting up front on the school bus and the unruly mutants (his classmates) tear themselves to pieces behind them. This is a great moment, perfectly capturing the disconnect of that kind of student with his fellows, and the fact that - lucky, lucky, lucky him - he gets to share that disconnect with someone else.I wish it had been put to the use of a better movie.The wimpy kid - yes, this is basically ""Diary of a Wimpy Kid: Horror Version"" has a babysitter who isn't just his intellectual equal: she surpasses him. She's like him, but better. She's also beautiful.I have a feeling that Samara Weaving is going to be a name you hear a lot. That other blonde babe from ""Home and Away"", Isabel Lucas, also went to Hollywood a while ago, but didn't make much of a splash. She doesn't have the talent of Weaving, I guess. Nor does she have the eyes. Samara Weaving's eyes are extraordinary. With that forceful gaze that could convey anything from ""isn't this fun?!"" to ""I'm going to gut you like a fish"", they are unforgettable, and a hell of a weapon for an actor.You probably already know what the ""plot"" is about, but I'll break it down anyway: the wimpy kid's better-than-perfect babysitter is actually drugging him with alcohol each night and taking his blood to use in a demonic ceremony, the details of which are barely even hinted at. The kid tricks his sitter into thinking she's drugged him and sneaks out to watch her play a game of spin-the-bottle which features a girl-on-girl kiss scene that was presumably done to upstage ""Cruel Intentions"". I may be in the minority (?) but I don't find girls making out sexy and I had to look away during this scene. There, I said it. Anyway, the game ends with the lone nerd getting stabbed through the skull with two knives at once. This establishes a principle that the movie will subsequently obey - the characters' bodies are apparently much softer and more vulnerable than those of actual people, and pop like water balloons filled with blood - except, of course, for that of the hero, who can survive driving a car at top speed into a house without any apparent injury.If you find yourself wondering as you're watching this how the babysitter intends to 1. dispose of the body before the wimpy kid's parents come home and 2. clean up the copious blood, which is now all over the fluffy white rug the evil gang is sitting on, this won't be the only head-scratcher the movie throws at you.Then the movie turns into your typical cat-and-mouse game that we've all seen a million times before.The strange thing is that the movie's comedy comes up here and there as though they had to throw in a joke every fifteen or so minutes. A bad guy will stop chasing the kid and they'll start doing a lame comedy routine. I didn't think the movie was ever funny, and it's certainly never scary. Watching it begins to feel like rolling a die: sometimes you get comedy and sometimes you get horror. It's like the movie doesn't know it's supposed to be both at once.I will say, however, that I liked a line where the girl-next-door tells the wimpy kid a fact, and he asks her if she learnt it in class. She responds ""No, nobody learnt anything in class, I got it off the internet"".THAT's the future.",The Babysitter

Cole also has a cute girl friend named Melanie with whom he has conversation way too mature for their age. On the night in question Cole and Bee have tons of fun but late in the night Bee offers to give Cole a shot of alcohol. Cole dumps the booze into a plant. He pretends to go to sleep. As Melanie suggested, he should stay up since for sure Bee is going to have a guy over. Next thing he knows, a bunch of people show up to play spin the bottle/truth or dare. Bee is dared to kiss everyone. And there's a hot scene of her kissing another girl. When its her turn to kiss some nerd, she stabs two knives into his head. The group collects the blood and they get ready for some ceremony with an ancient book. But things get completely out of their control. Cole has called the cops who show up but end up killed. One of the girls is shot. They discover Cole and he has to try and stay alive while he devises cool plans to injure or kill this group that actually wants his blood (the blood of the innocent) to complete the ceremony. Eventually he'll have to face Bee as well with Melanie's help.The Babysitter is a light horror comedy that surprisingly delivers the gore and violence. And it does so pretty early. This isn't one of those lame movies where all hell breaks loose...in the last 10 minutes. The cast does a great job. You sympathize with them all. Cole's friendship with Melanie is nicely portrayed. Samara Weaving is very hot. Sure, the story could have used some tweaking. More attention could have been paid to the book and the ceremony.

The lead in to the story itself is far too long and the actual meat of this tale, pun intended, over too soon.Its unfortunate the pacing is not a little better and more care was taken crafting some dark humour into this film. It had promise but you could easily see where opportunities were missed time and again.Where this film does work is more on a watered down version of the Home Alone exposition side of things but mostly without the devilish sophistication found in the set piece gags and traps.In short watchable but by no means remarkable. 6/10 from me.",The Babysitter
43,aidanratesmovies,"Empty horror flick has some redeemable moments, but not much",4,20 August 2020,"Entertaining, amusing, but ultimately riddled with cliches and quite corny at times, The Babysitter suffers any originality from its engaging premise, but still proves to be somewhat worthwhile. Samara Weaving and Judah Lewis led this horror comedy. Weaving gives the performance her all as usual, and is definitely the best actress in the film, but for the most part, everyone seems to be either overdoing it or severally suffering to capture the tone the film is going for. Granted, this could also be a writing problem, as the film thinks its smart and inventive by making the characters stereotypes on purpose- to prove it isn't as unoriginal as it truly is. This is a similar problem held by the Scream franchise as horror movie film makers begin to try to think of out of the box ways to tell their stories, and only make them feel and seem lazier than ever. Robbie Amell and Emily Alyn Lind are okay in their roles, but Bella Thorne, King Bach, Hana Mae Lee all other actors and actresses are quite terrible. Personally, I find the slasher genre quite annoying, and besides a few of the classics, I believe the films have very little offer. In the end, The Babysitter is nothing special. It has its entertaining moments, but is hardly a memorable piece of work. It's neither scary nor terribly funny, although always trying to cram in both, and although amusing to watch, the film can feel rather annoying.My Rating: 4.5/10.",The Babysitter
44,I_Ailurophile,Keep your expectations low,2,17 December 2020,"It's a fun premise. There are some good ideas here. But there are entirely too many problems here for it to work.For one thing, 'The babysitter' tries to be too many things at once. It wants to be embody disparate horror tropes of camp, Satanic cults, and slashers, while also embracing the ""coming of age"" story, and crafting it all into a teen comedy, too. This is less like combining ingredients to bake a cake, and more like opening a box of toys when everything has been thrown in haphazardly.It's also far too slick for its own good. It's not an uncommon complaint that modern production techniques in music render the songs sterile, bereft of feeling, life, and heart. The same is kind of true here: the movie looks good, every frame crisp and clean. But that's not necessarily what we want out of a horror movie.Even more to the point, that high production value is kind of necessary to throw in the effects and overlays so essential to the style 'The Babysitter' wants to play with. The issue is that it's not nearly as clever as it thinks it is. Consider 'Scott Pilgrim vs. The World'--all the graphics that popped up on screen, mirroring complementary imagery akin to a comic book or videogame, or visualizing a gesture a character is making or a concept they're describing. That little novelty of film-making is suitable enough for a comedy like 'Scott Pilgrim,' or in sparing small doses to break tension in a scene (as The Bride does early in 'Kill Bill,' drawing a square in the air with her fingers that appears on-screen as dotted lines). But for a horror film--even a horror comedy--it maybe is less appropriate. And when that novelty is exercised so heavily and frequently that it becomes, frustratingly, the most memorable aspect of a movie? Something is terribly wrong.I don't begrudge anyone enjoying this; it has its moments. I actually do like the cast, and the characters--yes, they're annoying, but they're literally supposed to be. But for my tastes, again, it just tries entirely too hard. This is a movie that should have been made in, say, 1981, or '84--before the emergence in pop culture of all the excessive influences that it tries to stir in beyond the core.Watch if you like, if only for curiosity's sake.

Dexterous and flashy horror-comedy has a promising premise, an appropriate helping of attitude and referential faux-irony, and a solid cast, but it's not as inventive as it ought to be, suffers from sketchy incentive/reasoning for the cultists, and runs out of steam long before the end (despite a brisk pace and compact running time).

52,IonicBreezeMachine,A decent slasher parody that makes too many winks to the camera and is too reliant on fan service.,6,13 September 2020,"The Babysitter is a very enjoyable slasher comedy with genuinely inspired moments of humor and shock but also suffers from a lack of restraint in its comedic approach.We follow Cole Johnson, a meek and soft spoken middle school student who is very risk averse despite the best efforts of those who give him advice. Cole is regularly babysat by Bee for whom he has feelings of Unrequited love while she sees him as more of a ""little brother"". One night, spurred by a conversation with his friend Cole decides to stay up late to discover what Bee does after he goes to sleep only to find that Bee heads a satanic and bloodthirsty cult with less the friendly intentions for him.The movie stars Judah Lewis as Cole who is absolutely flawless in the role with not only well expressed vulnerability but a natural likability that is reminiscent of Mathew Broadrick in Wargames or Tom Cruise in Risky Business, from his big screen debut in Demolition to his work in Summer of '84 and even The Christmas Chronicles Lewis is fast becoming one of my favorite new actors working today and I feel he has a promising future as a leading man. Not to be outdone Samara Weaving is fantastic in the role seamlessly transitioning from ""cute girl next door"" to charm to ""blood thirsty maniac"" menace. This was Weaving's first top billed role and you can see how and why she went on to bigger mateiral and critical acclaim in projects such as Ready or Not.The movie is also an affectionate nod to slasher movies with each member of Bee's cult fitting an archetype, easily the best is Robbie Amell as Max who's having an absolute blast playing a shirtless all star quarterback with bravado amped up to 11 and scores some major laughs in the back half of the movie.The movie's core strengths lie in its actors and their chemistry. The direction and script are unfortunately somewhat more lacking. The movie tries to ape Zombieland's usage of comedic texts and freeze frames but it comes off as overly self aware and robs scenes of comedic impact. McG competently directs the material for the most part, but his over reliance on fan service and rambling can lead to some scenes feeling overly leaden.Despite my issues with certain decisions in the presentation of The Babysitter, I still do recommend it for its energy, acting, and genuine fun had with the premise.

The writing is lazy, the characters are awful stereotypes, the editing choices are bizarre, shots are out of focus and the story itself shifts sloppily as it unravels on screen. Characters are developed in a way that makes no sense. The babysitter in question here doesn't ever come across as nefarious and cruel until she randomly kills a guy during a game of spin-the-bottle. Oh, well, she's the baddie now. Let's go with it. This whole film was beneath Netflix.",The Babysitter
56,phanthinga,My type of movie,10,8 November 2017,I say sometimes horror movie doesn't need a crazy plot twist or packed with jump-scares to make it scary it just need a well grounded cast and a lot of blood and gore.The Babysitter directed by McG success in make me relate so much with the character Cole while watching his journey to become a real man in one hellish night.The movie capture the spirit of 80s-90s cheesy horror movie perfectly and i would like to see a sequel in the future maybe with a title like:The Return of The Babysitter,The Babysitter
57,Ruskington,Not as bad as I was expecting but still pretty lame,4,13 April 2020,"This is the sort of film that I generally despise, but I must admit it did hold my attention for the most part. I doubt it was intentional but it kind of has that weird surrealist 80s teen horror vibe, much like Gremlins or The Burbs.Ultimately though, I can't quite see what the point of this film is. It's not particularly funny, not very scary and doesn't work as irony or subversion either. I was impressed by Judah Lewis' performance and quite enjoyed some of the gore, but overall this was a fairly weak, confused effort that definitely does not deserve a sequel.",The Babysitter
58,vampire_hounddog,Cult rubbish in the making,3,28 July 2020,"Cole (Judah Lewis) is a 12 year-old boy who is helped by his sexy older teen babysitter, Bee (Samara Weaving) how to deal with the bullies at school and in the neighbourhood and naturally he develops a crush on her as they become besties. When she is asked to look after him for the weekend when his parents go away the evening initially starts out as great fun. After he goes to bed he hears friends of Bee's come and spies on them as they play spin the bottle. Suddenely an older teenager who doesn't know them is killed in what looks like a sacrificial killing with Cole now knowing that he is next and tries to play cat and mouse with his captors in his own home.A fun, but very silly horror film that allows itself to run out of control as Cole outsmarts the bad boys and girls but it's sure to have its fans. It makes you wonder where are all the curtain twitching neighbours with all the noise and commotion.",The Babysitter
59,kjproulx,Cheesiness At Its Finest,7,15 October 2017,"If you're not someone that can handle random scenes containing excessive blood or can't get in on the joke of the fact that a movie fully embraces its cheese factor on purpose, then I guarantee you'll probably hate your experience watching The Babysitter. With that out of the way, I must say that Netflix's release of The Babysitter was a blast to watch. It's not your generic horror film that goes for jump scares and it's also not to be taken very seriously, which was a breath of fresh air for the genre in my opinion. Yes, horror has been on a nice streak over the past few years, but sometimes a cheesy romp is necessary in order to break the chain. Here is why The Babysitter is worth a watch.Beginning as a self-aware comedy about a young kid and the fact that he finds his babysitter incredibly attractive, this is a movie that has many twists and turns that you won't see coming. Wanting to stay awake past his bed time in order to see what his babysitter does late at night, he witnesses an incredibly graphic murder in his own living room. Having to fend for himself and take down this cult of killers, The Babysitter is relentlessly entertaining from start to finish. The tone of this film is not for everyone though, so I have to caution those with weak stomachs and those who just don't like to see gore. If you're sucked into this wacky film and are willing to let it take you anywhere, then I think you'll have as much fun with it as I did. It's not all sunshine and rainbows though, because there were a few times where it began to lose me, due to its excessiveness. Whether it was the language being thrown at one another or the murders themselves, I found this movie to be a little full of itself in terms of its graphic nature. Yes, it's not to be taken seriously, but it also becomes a little unbelievable, even for the fictional world it's set in. Directed by McG, who has had a very bad track record as of late, I must say has improved with his latest attempt, even though I feel the excessiveness was more than likely what he intended. That may seem like a minor complaint, but it was a looming issue I had throughout the majority. From the very beginning, although the look of this movie feels very clean, the atmosphere itself was very well-done. From smoke filling the ground at night, to a very old and lived-in neighbourhood, I found myself engaged and believing everything that was happening, due to the care in the production design. Sure, there are hundreds of other films that have done this exact same thing better in the past, but why should that take away from deserved praise? The Babysitter was very surprising in terms of making a lot with a little. In the end, The Babysitter isn't going to blow anyone away as a film itself, but I can't deny the sheer fun I had watching this movie. It doesn't take itself too seriously, it embraces its cheese factor, and does a great job with its comedy and keeping the audience engaged with its surprising death sequences. If you're a fan of horror or even comedy for that matter and don't mind gory sequences, then I feel you'll have a good time watching this movie. The Babysitter is now streaming on Netflix and I'll definitely give this one a recommendation.",The Babysitter

63,Alexander_Blanchett,Babysitter from hell,6,17 October 2017,It took itself too seriously in taking itself not seriously but it was fun. Played very well with the typical clichés of a teenage slaughter film mixed with elements of Home Alone. Its not a classic but easy to watch and really entertaining. Acting wise it was solid enough. Samira Weaving was hot and fun. She has good comedic timing which was needed for the role. Judah Lewis held himself very well too although they overplayed the nerdy nature of his character. I liked that it made fun of todays youth where everything that counts is instagram and self exposure. Good soundtrack too. But yeah just too over the top at times.,The Babysitter

The first 1/2 hr is fairly bland setup but then it kicks into high gear with an unexpected turn of spin the bottle. It's a fast paced melee after that thanks to McG. It's a much better film, thanks to his talents, than it otherwise would've been with most other genre directors. Interesting ending, too.",The Babysitter
65,CANpatbuck3664,The Babysitter Tries for Something Specific but They Miss the Mark by a Mile,3,31 December 2017,"I think this movie was a complete misfire. There are bad movies that don't try and then there are those that tried too hard and just whiffed. The Babysitter falls into the latter category for me. There was obviously a lot of effort put in by the crew. McG does his best to add some flair with some Scott Pilgrim vs. the World style to this with some cutaways and visual effects. The actual concept of this movie could have been interesting, and they play around with ""the evil hiding in plain sight"" idea which is always fun. We all want to believe that the world around us has a lot more mystery and that something unbelievable is going on next door. So in concept, I also thought that was a fun choice.The rest of this review isn't going to have many positives. I want to start with the main character Cole. I don't mind having an underdog main character or a character that's a nerd, but I struggled to find anything to like about Cole. He's such a wimp, he lacks any kind of personality and he lucks out so many times that I don't even want to give him credit for making it to the end. He's so weak that you need a reason to root for him and just because he comes to life when Bee comes around doesn't make him interesting.If this movie is carried by something, its Samara Weaving's performance as Bee. She doesn't save the movie but she's easily the best thing in it. You can buy her as Cole's friend and when she makes the switch, she at least has the talent to carry it. Judah Lewis was so wooden as Cole that coupled with the fact he's written poorly, it made dislike his performance even more. The rest of the cast are cold on purpose: Robbie Amell, Bella Thorne, Andrew Bachelor and Hanna Mae Lee are all way too old to be playing the roles they're playing, and it shows. The movie is going for a meta funny vibe (that doesn't work) so I think the direction they were given was probably to act that way, so I don't want to be too critical.This movie is a horror/comedy that is going a coming of age tale at the same time. Not one of those things worked for me. I'll admit the movie is intermittently funny but its not enough. The movie lacks any kind of scares (the gore is pretty intense too) and while the movie has its tongue firmly in its cheek, it isn't smart enough to pull that off. I also couldn't buy Cole maturing as a character. He's really immature already so him gaining that experience (minus the murder and the therapy he's going to need because of it) isn't impressive.I wanted to like this movie but I was just uncomfortable the entire time I was watching it. To sell something bizarre like this you need strong material and talented people in front of and behind the camera. I don't think they accomplished those goals and despite the good RT rating, I have to say give this one a hard pass.",The Babysitter

I just don't know....You get all the vibes of a B movie on this, which is absolutely fine. But there just isn't much comedy to it. You giggle a few times within the first 20 mins or so, then it goes ""serious"" for the rest. Acting is relatively poor also, so I just don't know where I stand on this.If it's a parody then I will rate this a 5/10. However, I don't think it is.

71,nitzanhavoc,"A silly fun comedy, very entertaining, don't expect ""Horror"".",7,11 January 2019,"It would be fair to say that I've never been a fan of Comedy Horror. In fact, if memory serves, this is the first time I find myself actually reviewing one. From my little experience, such films tend to either be parodies (pretty much a humorous mockery of Horror features, from actually impressive criticism such as Cabin in the Woods to sheer fun stupidity like Scary Movie) or simple comedies involving some allegedly R-Rated scenes (blood, gore, sometimes even the mere presence of a ghost/zombie/you name it is enough for the tag). The Babysitter is of the latter, and is definitely worth watching if you're looking for a few laughs.I have to say I was deeply impressed with the acting, as the entire performed very professionally and right on the spot. An actor/actress's job is to play the role of the character created (or adapted) by the screenwriter/s according to instructions from the director, so regardless of the characters themselves (most of whom were far less than impressive) the cast have done very well in acting them out. I particularly refer, of course, to Samara Weaving the film's namesake. Looking at her (which is far from being an unpleasant experience in and of itself) might give the extremely wrong impression of an eye candy and nothing more. I actually feel bad writing this, and I found her acting to be profound. Same can be said for Emily Alyn Lind as Melanie, who was given very little screen time but still made quite an impression. Protagonist Judah Lewis was also great and to be honest I could go on with the rest of the cast, whose skills were, in my humble opinion, too good for such a deliberately low film.The Babysitter is sort of a Home Alone meets Friday the 13th kind of film. It doesn't mean to offer any smart story, plot twist or intellectual contribution (and yet the personal development of the protagonist is quite touching in a way). It's meant to be a silly comedy, funny and entertaining. There's absolutely nothing about it to justify the ""Horror"" tag, besides the fact that blood is shown (a lot of which, a deliberate exaggeration that simply makes it all the more comic) and murder is involved. Watch, don't watch it, or watch a different comedy, you'd do alright either way. I personally enjoyed myself and wouldn't mind watching it again.",The Babysitter
72,stevenrotherforth,"I never had a hot Babysitter like that, Should I be glad?",6,22 November 2017,"The Babysitter The Babysitter is a painting by numbers horror comedy that is elevated from the norm by a good dose of humour and fantastic performances by its young cast. I'm really struggling to be negative here about this film even if it does borrow every horror cliché in the book. This really doesn't matter as it is expertly put together by director McG to create a fun 1hr 25mins.The story is a simple one. Nerdy out cast Cole played by Judah Lewis still has a Babysitter which further alienates him from his classmates. Turns out that his Babysitter Bee played by Samara Weaving is incredibly hot and is a good friend to Cole. So as an adolescent boy he doesn't mind that he has a Babysitter after all. Well not until he learns that she's part of Satanic cult. On discovery of her secret he is then hunted down in a over the top horror romp that will satisfy fans of both gore and comedy.The film caters for a younger audience. I can't see granny and grandpa enjoying this one. However if you're after passing a hour and half with a guilty pleasure this film has it all. Hot Babysitter, check! Action, check! Over the top gore, check! Laugh out loud ridiculousness, check!Sure it's not going to win any major awards and it probably won't be remembered down the line but the fact that it doesn't take itself seriously makes it more than worthy as a piece of throwaway entertainment.

83,jonathanruano,The Babysitter - A Surprisingly Good Movie,7,25 March 2019,"When I saw the Babysitter, I expected a mixture of a horror film and a comedy with very hot women. ""The Babysitter"" has all of these elements, but surprisingly its plot is far more intelligent than appearances suggest. This movie is also a put-on of the various elements making up popular culture -- from the new parenting style which emphasizes giving children an obstacle-free life to a teenage culture which has been rendered incredibly shallow and superficial by social media and twitter/facebook hashtags.The Babysitter's main message is that our current pop culture is absurd and that children, like the protagonist Cole, are far better off when they are challenged and empowered. At the beginning of the film, Cole is a nervous wreck -- and we soon find out why. The dad notices that his son Cole is terrified of driving and his response is to postpone his driving lessons to another time. A short time later, Cole is dissuaded by his dad from fixing his electronic car with a giant knife because apparently the knife is too dangerous for a boy on the cusp of puberty. We also learn that the parents are tearing down the tree house and hiring a babysitter (played by the promising actress Samara Weaving) to keep their beloved Cole safe from the dangers of the outside world. This repeated cuddling of Cole was no doubt done with the best of intentions. But the result is far from satisfactory: Cole is afraid of needles, mocked by his horrible neighbor, and easy prey for bullies.Along with bashing new age parenting, this film also makes an emphatic statement about how teenagers have been transformed into incredibly shallow and superficial human beings by social media. One teenager complains about his Macy's designer shirt being covered in blood and does not seem the least bit remorseful that he was an active participant in a murder. A second teenager exclaims, ""That sucks,"" when told that a child could lose all his Instagram followers after he is murdered. They also talk in hashtags, like ""going viral"" and ""black lives matters,"" as though reality is not more complicated than that.This social indictment of pop culture is interesting. But ""the Babysitter"" also goes further that that. The teenage villains are not just representative of a millennial generation gone terribly wrong; they also mentor Cole and gradually transform him into a confident and self-sufficient adult. What is striking is that the bad guys had so many opportunities to kill Cole. Yet what they did instead was to provide Cole in their unorthodox way with a real world education that prepared him for life's challenges. The Cole that emerges from this film is not a scared, helpless, and cuddled child. He has fearlessly crashed the car into his parents' house and announces that he no longer needs a babysitter.Therefore, I recommend ""the Babysitter"" not only for being a fine entertainment, but also for being surprisingly uplifting. If you observe the interactions taking place between Cole and the villains and ask yourself why these interactions are happening, you begin to realize that these villains sort of respect Cole and want to help him to overcome his fears. As a result, the film juxtaposes the obligatory gore of a horror film with an optimistic message about mentoring and empowerment.",The Babysitter

Thorne's acting was horrendous and god if there is a third film of this, please, ditch her.If I comment on the film that does not include that, however, this is a feel good campy horror that's just meant to be fun. A lot of the (non-harmful) humour had me in stitches and a lot was done really well that makes the viewer chuckle and have a laugh.I watched this with a friend and we had a good laugh whilst also having conversations on why something was harmful and got a good opportunity, at least, to help educate each other on things we'd missed or things that were very subtle and the other didn't notice.A definitely feel good film for a sleepover or movie night with friends but do be warned and check the content warnings if you're wary about the harmful content.",The Babysitter

The Babysitter is an excellent, kind of B-movie horror comedy. It's so over the top it's fun, yet it's actually really thrilling to watch. Especially horror comedies can sometimes be way too cheesy when they're going for the certain B-movie look. In The Babysitter they often used text over the film, which is sometimes a nice touch, but sometimes it did feel a bit useless. You don't necessarily need that, so why use it? But it was a minor detail, however, and it wasn't over used. Another little annoyance in horror movies can be the jump scares. In the worst case you can see them coming miles away and then it hits you. If they aren't done well they are just tacky and even though they give you a fright you just get more annoyed than actually thrilled. But jump scares or the wait for the jump scare where used well. The Babysitter is a fun, quirky yet thrilling horror comedy, and definitely worth seeing, if you're looking for this kind of a movie.

But its actually better than what i was expecting. I truly thought i wouldn't like it and actually did. I didn't like much how the movie was directed (the camera moves in weird ways, sometimes like a ""mtv montage"" - what some people would call it), nor some of the scenes: mostly because when they leave the house it gets a bit more boring - still pretty watchable though. I don't think the plot or the characters should be better developed, a lot of horror flicks don't need that to be good. They had funny scenes almost all of them, in my opinion.I didn't like how they managed the setting space and time for each character. when ""x"" happens you kinda should know where ""y"" character is, or at least have an idea - in my vision of an horror film. This one was a bit off in that. Plus sometimes it was too much over the top, and i'm not a fan of queen by the way (plus, that song? really? so so predictable).Still it's enoyable and a lot of times funny. Could be better? yes, and not with a lot of effort. But how it is, it's already a pretty fun movie that i didn't expect to like much. I'm a fan of horror films, and i've seen worse than this one. If you like the genre you should definitely check it. If you don't...try some of the classics first, maybe you'll enjoy this later. But in general i would recommend to give it a go.",The Babysitter
91,tfminfl,254. The Babysitter.,9,6 July 2018,"254. The Babysitter. Hmmm, mix part Wonder Years, with some Home Alone, a few morsels of Scream, and the recipe book happens to be The Book of the Dead, and you get this great horror comedy from director McG... I know, thats what kept me from watching it too... I mean he did do great videos for such awesome bands like Smash Mouth, Sugar Ray and the Offspring, remember them? No? Trust me, no one is going to remember the crap you like right now either, lol. But anyways... so we meet Cole a young teen, that's well a young teen, awkward, picked on at school, and is going to be left alone this weekend with his incredibly hot babysitter, Bee. The sucky part is, she's also a satanist cult member performing ritual murders in his living room while he's asleep, but I mean, she's hot, so it can be over looked. Don't worry tho, Bee does not intend to kill Cole, she just needs a little of his innocent blood to mingle with the blood of the dude downstairs with two butcher knives sticking into his brain. A coming-of-age horror/comedy worth a watch!! Even has the cute ""Winnie Cooper"" thing going on with the girl across the street, we just needed Kevin's adult narration!!

92,dormesher-21565,A fun movie I had a blast,8,3 July 2020,"The Babysitter. A fun horror comedy with an Interesting premise and a tone that dosent take itself seriously with great main characters and a fun story this movie is just a blast from start to finish.The story is really well done and the kills are brilliant in this film the main characters Bee and Cole are awesome and the actors do an amazing job especially Samara Weaving who is brilliant in this.I also really like some of the Stylistic choices in the movie for example when they are choosing there SciFi dream team you can see the graphics on the screen it adds to the tone of the movie and really works in my opinion.My only issue with the movie is some of the other characters are kinda out shined by the main characters which is ashame because most of them seemed like interesting characters and I would of liked seen more of them.
Also some of the meta jokes don't lend sometimes and feels out of place.I also really like that even though it's a comedy and dosent take itself seriously it's also a story and good message about growing up and taking action for yourself and you can see the confidence that Cole is getting through the movie as everything is happening.The ending is also really well done and it's a nice moment between Bee and Cole which ends the movie on a bittersweet ending.
I have heard they are making a sequel and I can't wait to check out more of this franchise.Verdict 8/10 a great horror comedy that I had a blast watching two fantastic main characters in Bee and Cole and the kills are absolutely fantastic.
Really enjoyed this one and I can't for a sequel just hope the franchise keeps the same tone and stylistic choices.",The Babysitter

96,RhapsodyReviews,Great Comedic Horror.,9,1 October 2019,"Review:
'The Babysitter' is an American horror-comedy film directed by McG. Don't want to give away this review, but I just love this movie! It may be that it's a guilty pleasure film, but I genuinely think that it's just a very well-done slasher movie with a lot of humor. The movie starts out feeling like you're starting some corny comedy flick and then quickly spirals into something glorious.
The movie focuses on a young boy (Judah Lewis) who have a crush on his babysitter (Samara Weaving). One night while he is being watched he decides to spy on her to see what she does while he is supposed to be sleeping. What he finds is a cult sacrificing a teenager in order to get what they truly desire. Being caught spying, Cole is now in fight or flight mode and he chooses to fight.
I'm not going to say a whole lot about the performances, in this movie. I don't really know a lot of the actors that were in this very well, aside from Robbie Amell. Everybody in this movie is spot on. Nobody takes themselves too seriously, but the acting is kept to a high standard where you are having a good time.
The movie kind of feels like a mix of Die Hard and Scream. I mean that in the sense of Scream has a good amount of humor, while being a slasher movie, and Die Hard finds Bruce Willis needing to take out a bunch of bad guys to survive the night.
Overall, this movie looks and sounds fantastic. The runtime is long enough to deliver the story it wants to tell, and short enough to avoid being boring; this movie knows exactly what it wants to be and does it well.
4.5/5",The Babysitter
97,tvcarsd,Good movie but not horror,8,1 November 2021,"The movie has some awesome actors and characters that you can definitely enjoy getting behind and no real characters that you don't care for. This is a nice change from many modern movies that are far to oft full of dead pan characters.It's a straight forward movie with a little satanic ritual that was meant to be a corner stone to the horror element that never materializes. This really should not be considered a spoiler as the movie is a horror and really should have come through with this motion and does not at all. It's really just a violent comedy with a body count.Still good, still enjoyable hence the score. I like.",The Babysitter
98,kenyae-cagle,Not too bad,7,29 October 2017,"This movie had many chuckle moments, but not laugh moments. This movie had terrible actors. I am sure its every man's fantasy to sleep with their babysitter. I find this movie to have its corny moments a little too often. I did enjoy how the movie was shot further out and then was shot in Point Of view of the character. The baby sitter's reactions were very scary and psychotic. It was very interesting. I enjoyed the transition into the plot with the lesbian make out scene. They made this movie seem like a video game with the fonts popping in and out of the movie. This movie was very poorly shot (pun intended). I love seeing cole beat these guys at their own game though as well. I found it funny.",The Babysitter

100,spencergrande6,Annoying and full of itself,3,5 December 2017,"Man this was terrible. Whatever the hell this was supposed to be - comedy, horror, sentimental growing up claptrap - it failed miserably. Not one joke lands. The whole thing feels written by adults trying to write as their childhood selves but being so good at it that they think literally every single thing they think of is just so clever and couldn't possibly be bad. This movie literally has a scene where the hot babysitter and the geeky 13 year old kid watch a vintage western in the backyard on a projector while acting out the whole thing in front of it. No irony intended. It's just meant to be a bonding moment I guess? I mean, wtf is this?",The Babysitter

102,plasticanimalz,Loved It,9,5 November 2017,"I was really expecting a '70s / '80s babysitter trope of the babysitter home alone, and some psycho stalking her, like Lisa, but instead got something fresh, fun, and clever. The comedy / horror genre is one of my favorites and other than Cabin in the Woods, any of the ones post-80s are usually terrible and occasionally you get okay. I was hesitant when I initially saw it since McG was a pretty terrible director with all flash when he started making films, including killing the Charlie's Angel's franchise, but here he redeems himself and did a good job. Really, I have no complaints. What blows my mind is people who wrote a bad review but clearly don't like this kind of genre or didn't seem to understand what it was when they clicked on it. The words ""babysitter"" and ""satanic cult"" are a pretty dead giveaway, along with comedy / horror under the genre. Or they said it had no ""depth?"" You were expecting 'Sophie's Choice?' I even enjoyed this movie more than The Final Girls, which I loved. I've seen a LOT of movies and a lot in this genre and it was top notch. Not really scary but the right amount of dark to compensate. Definitely makes up for the Santa Clarita Diet which was just terrible and fell completely flat, other than a few funny moments.And the cast was great. The babysitter, B, had a young Denise Richards thing and was fully believable as a young nerd's dream, who is not only hot and nice but knows her sci-fi. The film did a nice job of playing up the B and Cole's relationship so you actually felt some things other than it just being funny or dark. And Bella Thorne was hilarious. She usually comes off like an awful person in her roles, but here she showed some comedic chops. And an A for originality as I can't think of anything I've seen that's remotely similar. It's definitely carved out a niche for me as a solid, fun film when you need a break from the heavy stuff, and I'm sure I'll watch it again. Now I'll have to check out Little Evil with Adam Scott since this turned out better than expected.Netflix is just killing it with original content. We don't even go to Amazon anymore and other than Handmaid's Tale, Hulu's got nothing. Keep it up.",The Babysitter
103,phoenixinvictus,Reminded me of the 1980's slasher movies,6,21 October 2017,"Could we call this a coming of age movie? I don't think so but the main character does do some real growing up at the end. Sure there are the usual clichés of a movie like: the babysitter is hot and the kid is in love with the babysitter. Sounds like a teenaged fantasy which has been worn out thin and played one too many times.Despite that, the actors did a great job, and Bee, played by the beautiful the Samara Weaving, is a really likable character, despite her maniac homicidal tendencies. Is this Oscar material? Of course not. It's a slasher movie with some comedic elements in it to make it funny at times and scary at others. There were times when I felt that I was watching a 1980's movie with all the blood and gore typical of the slasher movies of the era.In short. It was fun to watch, and I believe that was the movie's main goal.",The Babysitter

You want the characters you get as they help move along the story.It's fantastically gory. Very in your face and gratuitous. So, if you don't like gore, don't watch. The screenplay was decent for the type of movie. I love the girl who plays the babysitter because she does a great job portraying this super-awesome babysitter we wish we all had (at least up to a point). Even the kid had some fun lines in spite of not being the most stellar actor.I was happy they didn't get too far into the cult or satanic stuff.

118,HanShotFirstGR,Completely stupid!,3,14 May 2021,"Plot:The events of one evening take an unexpected turn for the worst for a young boy trying to spy on his babysitter.Analysis:Mainstream horror films are usually in the same formula and this one wasn't an exception. Without something original to do or any depth, this movie offers nothing to the audience other than typical horror scenes for teenagers to scream and make out.The screenplay was so childish and empty, if you think ""What scary things can happen when some horny teenagers camp into my living room"" you got this movie. It's a film with no structure, too much exposition and bad dialogue, it tries to be somewhat fun but in the end why would you pick these over any cheesy ridiculous comedy? The story tries to be shocking but doesn't have any clever reveal and for the most part relies on randon horror stuff to entertain those who get satisfied pretty much from everything scary. If you look at this storywise or characterwise this isn't even a mediocre movie, it's a very bad one.The actors do try to be fair, the cast has the general feeling of a teenage group of people and act normally as the cool edgy kids their characters are written to be. It's too bad that promising actors like Samara Weaving and Robbie Amell signed up for this. Their presence did convince me to give another chance but it was all for nothing.McG directed this movie and I was expecting that it would be a dumb thing that looks cool. Just like many of his other works this is a story with nothing good that was handled very good visually. You look at this movie and you probably think ""This can't be that bad, it looks okay"" and sadly that's the distraction that lures you in. All the effects and most of the shots were on point and it was the only kinda good element in this movie.Conclusion:I don't have many things to say about this. It was extremely dumb, not funny, the dialogue was boring and I didn't enjoyed it at all. It looks good visually and that's why I didn't smash my computer. If it is your cup-of-tea when it comes to dumb movies go for it, but for me it was a complete waste of time.Rating: 3/10.",The Babysitter
119,andrewmerritt-31652,Home Alone meets horror,6,28 August 2018,"That kid reminds me of a modern day Kevin from Home Alone. The Babysitter is a Netflix original movie Starring Judah Lewis and Samara Weaving. Judah Lewis plays Cole, a total nerd who gets picked on in school and by his own parents. And he has an insane crush on his babysitter because she's the only one who understands him and one day things take a drastic turn as he spies on his babysitter and her friends when he finds out they worship the devil. The way I can describe this as best as I can is take everything you love about the Breakfast Club and put them in a horror movie. And that's what I enjoyed about this is that it parodies classic horror movies that you remember and twists them upside down. However I wish they would go into more depth as to why they are doing this. I feel like they did at some points of the movie, but it just wasn't there and it could use a little more detail. I'll give Judah Lewis and Samara Weaving props. These two work great together and they're chemistry together flowed that I wish that they would show more of than what we got. Before that the movie feels a little random between this random bully wish I guess we need even though we know Judah Lewis is a nerd from the first scene. Also the parents felt out of place as well and you could've just not shown his parents and we would've known exactly what was going on. Sometimes you don't need to show parents in every single high school slasher movie. But everything after that is awesome as the movie turns into a horror version of Home Alone as Cole defends himself against his babysitter's friends. And I had fun with this until the very end, which brings the question: what was the point of that? And the movie just ends abruptly. Overall I will say that I found the movie enjoyable for what it was worth, but I felt something was missing to give this just a little bit of effort.",The Babysitter

I don't watch the movie after the trailer. It's the plot, cast, ratings and no spoiler reviews that makes me select a movie. A movie you won't expect much from, but still delivers to satisfy the shit out of you! Damn, this one has it. It's little hilarious, not much. Yes, it's adult comedy.
It's a surprisingly awesome movie, should definitely try once a watch. It's an above average movie of the genre - The genre which is horror, but doesn't have anything that could scare apart from the BGM. Yes, it falls in that category of hundreds of movies. Only the BGM is scary.

125,deeznutz-09839,It was ok,6,28 October 2020,I mean they aren't horrible it's just the completely obvious decisions the characters could've made. For example when max was chasing cole through the garage and cole just disappeared hasnt he seen enough thriller/horror movies to realize that cole I just some where he can't see him? When max was choking cole why didn't cole just gouge his eyes out? And when cole found the girl pretending to be dead why not just stab her just to be sure? It's just the obvious choices that p**s me off but other wise it was some what enjoyable. Another thing I liked about this movie was that cole wasn't a p***y and he just killed all of them when he could kill them unlike in any other movie the character would always hesitate but cole didn't hesitate what so ever.,The Babysitter

131,pedroquintaoo,"Funny, bloody and nice",7,13 October 2017,"I was intrigued by this movie because its concept is different from the slasher films that we're used to watch. Here, the teenagers are not the victims, they're the killers. The Babysitter is full of good jokes, gives to us some bloody kills, there are a bunch of references to the pop culture and tries to twist some clichés, ending up on a fresh and different work.It's a nice film, the producers are not afraid to show violence (sometimes they create some humor around the deaths), it's a love letter to the 80s horror films. However has a problem, the trailer spoiled the full movie, I knew who was going to die and that destroyed my experience a little. Btw, it's not a negative critic, the soundtrack is okay, but I would prefer to hear more typical 80s music because that could improve the 80s slasher vibe.Fresh, violent but also funny, The Babysitter is a love letter to the slasher genre. Avoid the trailer, turn off your brain and enjoy this nice experience.Rating: 7/10",The Babysitter

I know it is a comedy, but wtf are these people supposed to be? No matter what happens they just keep going as if nothing happened at all. Barely no reaction to them getting killed one by one. Every day life for them i guess.
And the dialogue is so lame that it is cringy... yea i don't know. I really don't understand these 6-7 ratings, but they must have an audience, go figure.",The Babysitter
133,celtic451-228-782719,Great Movie!,10,26 November 2017,"I totally enjoyed this movie. The beginning was a very believable setup to a high school background and I was blown away by the production, acting, and writing. And then it had probably the most surprising plot twist I've ever seen in a movie. The dude that played the 12 year old is an amazing actor and the girl that played the babysitter was complicated, witty, and sassy. The supporting people were great as well. I thought the dialogue was fun and witty and smart and there were at least some elements of Fast Times in this movie. One the best movies I've seen in a long while. I totally loved it.",The Babysitter
134,KaZenPhi,Nothing too original but a fun watch,6,27 February 2020,"And mercifully short to boot!
I don't mind long movies, strap me in for a 3 hours Kurosawa or Scorsese like Alex in Clockwork Orange and I'll never want to get out of that chair, but it's become quite a plague recently that movies have started to really take their time to tell very simple stories with the depth of a kiddie pool.
85 minutes (including credits) is the perfect length for this fun slasher throwback and for that alone this movie should be lauded.
On top of that all the characters have great chemistry, especially the two leads and while it's nothing too creative the jabs at and slight subversions of certain horror movie tropes are pretty fun and at times a bit more subtle and smart than I would have expected from someone like McG.
The only thing that was nagging me a little bit was that the movie is part of the super self-aware recent style of comedy where every character knows they are in a comedy movie. Call it the Joss Whedon disease. It's fine at times but it kind of makes you not care for anything that is happening on screen even if you're entertained, which I was.
It's not too bad here, mainly because of the main leads Samara Weaving and Judah Lewis. Their bond over their mutual movie obsession makes sense to me as a movie obsessed weirdo with similar-minded friends and feels quite warm and genuine, but when the teen romcom eventually turns into a slasher movie the same ironic comedic tone is kept, which isn't bad but it squanders the opportunity to have a really gripping second half.Still, I liked it, I might even watch it again some time, which I have never said or thought about a Netflix movie or show before.",The Babysitter

However, I feel the film in its entirety was a missed opportunity. It's great until about midway, then it loses focus and doesn't deliver on the level set earlier in the film.The premise of the group being a satanic cult is very interesting, but they don't go further into what it really means, why they are doing, why them as a group are doing it... just a lot of unaswered questions.A very dumb and unbelievable part was also the fact that the main character lives in a suburb with plenty of neighbors, but for some reason he acts like he lives in an isolated house in the middle of the woods. Any neighbor would call the police if all that stuff happened, gunshots, people running and screaming in the yard etc. The kid doesn't even try to get to a neighbor, doesn't have a cellphone nor does he try to find one.

141,SylvesterFox007,Blood-Soaked but Heartfelt,9,18 October 2017,"""The Babysitter"", Netflix's original Friday the 13th offering, mixes its blood-spattered horror with a funny coming-of-age story. In fact, the entire first act is almost completely devoid of horrific elements and committed to letting the audience get to know its plucky hero. The movie starts with Cole (Judah Lewis), a twelve- year-old boy who still screams and struggles like a much younger child when it's time to get a shot. Cole is afraid of everything, constantly bullied, and completely oblivious to the fact that girl next door Melanie (Emily Alyn Lind) has a crush on him. Cole has a crush of his own, on his babysitter Bee (Samara Weaving). Why should he care about being too old to still need a babysitter when his parents want some time out of the house, when his sitter's this hot and this cool? She sticks up for him when he's being picked on, watches old movies with him, and indulges his nerdy hypothetical questions about which science fiction characters would make the best team for saving the world from evil.Then things take a really dark turn. At Melanie's urging, Cole sneaks out of bed to spy on Bee. He catches her playing a game of Truth or Dare that ends with her giving quick kisses to jock Max (Robbie Amell), goth Sonya (Hana Mae Lee), and class clown John (Andrew Bachelor), and a long, passionate one to cheerleader Allison (Bella Thorne), before making out with her dorky boyfriend Samuel (Doug Haley) . . . and then knifing him in the head. Turns out Bee has promised her friends she can make all of their dreams come true if they participate in this Satanic ritual she knows. The ritual also involves taking a few harmless drops of blood from Cole, but when the clique finds out he's seen too much, they won't settle for that.The stock characters that would have been helplessly butchered in 80's horror movies are the monsters here, but they're also still victims. As Cole faces his fears and makes them chase him around his house, they each end up meeting a gory demise one by one. Never mind the times where Cole gets outside of the house and then runs right back in, just for the sake of continuing their deadly game of tag for the sake of there being a movie.Robbie Amell is a surprising standout. Very amiable for being both a dumb jock and a psycho killer, Max takes the occasional break from the chase to try to play big brother to Cole, mentoring him on how to stand up for himself before resuming trying to kill him. But it's really Judah Lewis and Samara Weaving's show. With all the time invested into getting to know them at the beginning of the movie, they manage to make you believe, or at least want to believe, that there's still genuine affection between the babysitter and her charge, even after she's set her friends on hunting him down. As a result, the inevitable confrontation between them is actually quite poignant and touching.Director McG cut his teeth on music videos before helming 2000's TV to screen adaptation of ""Charlie's Angels"", which I always found fun and exciting (though I wish he hadn't let all the reviews praising the movie for not taking itself too seriously go to his head, since the sequel shifted from tongue-in-cheek to absurd self-parody) and his flashy style is on full display here. I found myself wondering how long we have until on-screen text and quirky soundtrack cues being treated like additional characters makes a movie feel dated instead of hip and modern, but I did grin at a couple of the captions and song choices, so here I'll allow it.There's plenty of comically over-the-top gore, but moments meant to be suspenseful are more eye-rolling that nail-biting, so if you're looking for something to make you scream and jump out of your chair, this may be the wrong movie for you. But if you're looking for a sly and silly send-up of films about nubile teens being massacred and one with plenty of heart beneath the gruesome exterior, you may find yourself falling in love.",The Babysitter
142,mikedegroot,"Wild, exciting, funny, and partly makes no sense.",8,1 March 2018,"I love funny horror movies when they are done right. The Babysitter definitely is, for the most part.Plenty of hilarious adult humor, great death scenes, and a menagerie of quirky characters in crazy situations. Very solid acting for the type of movie that it is and darn near perfect casting. Over-the-top in blood and gore, but in a good way.Certain plot elements of why some of the characters do what they do, make little to no sense. How things unfold without anybody noticing is completely absurd, but that's what makes for a good comedy/horror. I wasn't expecting a lot, but was nicely surprised.",The Babysitter
143,adam-may-bower,Actually Good!,8,2 June 2018,"'The Babysitter' is a surprisingly funny and refreshing horror/comedy with a great cast and plenty of blood to satisfy horror fans, and others alike. I honestly didn't expect much out of this movie, as I assumed it would be a dumb slasher flick with stereotypical characters and poor gags. Much to my surprise, this movie was incredibly self-aware in its horror/comedy genre and all the gags were in good doses and generally made me laugh. While the ensemble of villains were very much your average stereotypes found in many American films (hot cheerleader, dumb athlete, weird Asian, funny black guy and sexy blonde) the filmmakers were consciously aware of it and essentially made it their own. The performances in this film were all hilarious and played well by the cast, with Bella Thorne, Robbie Amell, King Bach Hana Mae Lee all doing a superb job at playing their simple characters. But it was really Samara Weaving who was the standout of the film as she played the title role of The Babysitter. She was able to be funny, scary and sexy all at the right times and is definitely a promising actress for the near future. Judah Lewis is also great in the leading role of Cole, who is victim to the happenings of this film. The plot of this film is paced really well and wastes no time in getting to the point. While it may have been predictable at some points, it was overall an entertaining and refreshing addition to recent slasher flicks from the last few years. This movie may have its obvious flaws, but they are easily overlooked by the great cast and MCG's smart approach to the horror/comedy genre.",The Babysitter

It's kind of like the horror movie your mom would have let you watch when you were 12. Well I guess nowadays parents let their kids watch Freddy & Jason at 5, but think back to the 70s or 80s, in fact my mom probably wouldn't have let me watch it because of the amount of blood & guts. It does have some terrific kills, original for sure! I did think it was well done for what it was, acting was decent, production was good. The pacing was gold! No lulls in this.

The relationship between Cole and Bee is wonderful. There's a montage sequence where the two of them have a blast when his parents have left them to their own devices which was adorable. I also loved the movie and pop culture references that the two shared. She's stunningly beautiful, but also very funny and super cool.Bee's gang of high school horror movie stereotypes (jock, nerd, cheerleader, weirdo, clown) are as cool as Bee. There's a sequence where the jock is simultaneously trying to slaughter and mentor Cole, which cracked me up. The 'weirdo' role is played by the girl that whispers f*cked up sh*t under her breath in the 'Pitch Perfect' films - a fantastic casting choice!The only complaints I have are - Cole gets out of the house and could easily just run for help. Instead, he goes back into the house! Also, the chaos makes an unholy amount of noise, yet none of the neighbours complain or call the cops! Also, the gore and bodies in the house magically disappear with no explanation. I assumed that Bee had cast some kind of 'wax on, wax off' demonic spell, but it would have been nice to explain that.A really fun film though - I watched this after rewatching 'Frankenhooker' for the millionth time, and if you're into daft horror like that, you'll really enjoy this.",The Babysitter

There are certainly some issues with the logic, probably anyway. Maybe the characters are a little one-note. The thing is, I was having way too much fun to care.From the comic-book text overlays to the major twists and turns to the child-engineering-prodigy trope to the humor-gore, I really, thoroughly enjoyed this movie.The tone started off as a comedy/coming-of-age story, but when it decided to delve into horror, it really delved into horror. It kept some of the comedic and coming-of-age elements, but from the first instance of horror on, it was without a doubt a horror movie, just a dang fun one.I'd imagine this is a rather polarizing film. Either people will love some of the wackiness, or they'll feel it gets in the way of what The Babysitter could be.

167,tokanac,A mediocre horror film,5,14 October 2017,"This movie is a good movie to watch, and it's funny to boot. I had never seen the trailer, which seems to be a good thing when reading the other reviews; I was just drawn to it by the poster. When I checked this one out on IMDb.com and saw that the movie had earned a 6.7 rating, I thought that it must be really good and decided to give it a go. I found it funny in some parts, and I admit that I would find this somewhat thrilling/scary if I was watching it at the cinema – the lights are low, the vision is sharp and the sound is high, echoing throughout the room. Seeing that I was at home, though, I didn't have this exact experience.The movie started off like a good teen flick as they set up the backstory a bit, and I could see why Cole fancied Bee, his babysitter. The movie kicked off a quarter of the way into the movie with people being murdered left and right. The humour was riddled throughout the movie. The film had an element of Home Alone in it, but not too much.McG and writers could have spaced out the murders, though, and created more suspense. Also, it wasn't that realistic; Allison would have been long dead by the end of the movie! Instead, they prolonged her death for comedic effect, which I find boring. Yes, this gave Bella Thorne a bigger part and more opportunity to show her comedic acting chops, but still.It was nice to see Robbie Amell in a sociopathic role for once, which is different to some of his other movies, especially the DUFF, in which he starred alongside Bella Thorne, who plays Allison in this movie. All in all, while this movie was funny, and it certainly had murder, it was a bit of a B grade movie and, in my opinion, didn't exactly earn that 6.7 rating; more like a 5.Would I watch it again, though? Sure. It was a good enough movie. Would I recommend this movie to friends? There are better movies than this, which I would recommend first, but sure; it's not a bad movie.

Granted, I did see the trailer ahead of time...which did spoil the entire thing. I was hoping there would be more to it..there was not.Bad. Real bad. OoooWeeee. Awful.

The chemistry of the lead characters at first is just so captivating and then you think you know what this movie might be, your ground moves beneath your feet and you ask yourself oh my god what just happened. It's so so unexpected and just grabs your attention for the rest of the film.The story is so simple yet scary and cinematography is top notch. The thriller elements are just wow. Samara is such a talented actress i genuinely admire her skills. This movie is underrated like ready ot not and i find this extremely frustrating. Worth the watch for sure.",The Babysitter

Never have liked horror movies, yet i always try to give them a go, but one after an other just keeps letting me down.Kinda was rooting for the bad guys and girls, because the victim/good guy was just bloody stupid and awful.Also can't see the Comedy aspect in this, unless you think the pretty poor acting from some of the characters is so laughable that it's comedy.There was only two good things in this movie and first was We Are The Champions song and the second one was the car stunt death(ish)-scene.",The Babysitter

As only viewers that age could find it funny.The film has a decent enough plot, but is let down by poor directing and acting.The main characters are so annoying its impossible to find then funny or even likeable.It is more or a chick flick than horror or comedy.

174,cglachan,Best Horror Ever,10,20 October 2017,"I simply don't understand how this movie is getting such a bad review from users on here. This movie made me laugh so hard and freaked me out in a few places. I'm 23 so I don't know if these commenters are middle aged fogeys. I didn't hear about the movie, it just popped up into my Netflix Notification box and I was pleasantly surprised. The gore was fantastic. The actors who portrayed the ""cult"" were hilarious. It truly shocked me and had this debonair about it that I think has been missing from entertainment for years. Fantastic movie with jump scares, suspense, and funny moments. When Max was circling Cole in the tree making the original Friday the 13th sound effects(hissing and ticking) I lost it. I snarfed monster out of my nose and covered the screen and I can say that has not happened in years. Hands down my favorite movie of recent time and certainly my favorite Horror-ish movie of all time.Don't listen to the naysayers, this movie is worth the watch. If you're over 21 watch it with a wet palette(so to speak) Superb acting from everyone in the movie. Also, I never found myself getting frustrated with the plot/writing like everything else I see on TV nowadays.",The Babysitter
175,laurasomia,A surprisingly good time!,7,1 October 2019,This movie delivered more than I anticipated! I thought this was going to be one of those teenage horror flicks with terrible casting and no humor... but this reminded me more of something like Zombieland or Dale and Tucker vs Evil!

176,schizoidnightmares,A mixed teenage nightmare and fantasy,7,28 June 2020,"The Babysitter is definitely something... Unique in a nominally ordinary premise. The way the kid handles his fears... He doesn't freeze up, he just goes at it without hesitation like soldier... He would be highly suitable for dangerous occupations requiring quick decision-making and survivalism.In fact, I have never seen a kid depicted on screen as so resourceful and brave in my entire life, at least taking into account all of his existing fears and anxieties.I cannot say I am fan of the borderline inappropriate flirtation between the babysitter and ""the baby."" It treads a very fine line between being eccentric and outright creepy. That's probably the point though.This film is conducted at alternating paces of slow, intermediate, and fast. Everything about it feels off and unusual. I would say this is an entertaining film, but not one executed all that well. It leaves too many questions unanswered... Like it is setting itself up for a sequel, which I think belongs more in television shows than standalone films.",The Babysitter

As many other unknown movies in Netflix, I thought this was going to be another waste of hour and half I wouldn't get back, but I gave it a shot. Turned out to be amazing. The protagonist really deserves an award for his performance, The characters, as stereotypical as they are, play their roles hilariously, and the events in the movie (I wanna make this spoiler free) will keep surprising you and keep entertained from beginning to end.

179,FallonTimberlake2016,Enjoyable but forgettable and unoriginal.,5,31 October 2017,"The Babysitter is a horror comedy that centers around a kid who has an incredibly hot babysitter that is using his house to sacrifice people for her satanic cult. If I were to pitch this film to a studio, I'd say it's Home Alone meets Scream. This is definitely not as good as either of those movies, but it still contains some good horror fun. Don't go into this film expecting a genuinely creepy horror movie, and you should be relatively satisfied. The goal here was not to make a straight up horror film or a straight up comedy--it was to create a hybrid of the two. This film is enjoyable, nothing more and nothing less. However, nothing stands out here that will make me remember this for more than about a week. This review would be longer, but there's honestly not much to talk about here. The film is pretty conventional, and the only performance that stands out is Judah Lewis as the main kid and Andrew Bachelor (""King Bach"") as one of the members of the satanic cult. The Babysitter is a pretty fun film if you want to watch something mindless to get your mind off the stresses of the world, but other than that it is pretty forgettable.I give The Babysitter a C.",The Babysitter

But after watching this movie, I really amazed and surprise how dazzling this movie was! Way beyond my low expectations.The Babysitter is a perfect Halloween night movie. You Just you can't avoid to fall in love with Samara Weaving as the hot blond nerdy babysitter, Bee. A combination of charming, captivating, energetic and breathtaking character at the same time. Judah Lewis as Cole is also above avarge and miraculously has an excellent chemistry with Bee's character.Well you certainly wouldn'tt expect A or B class acting in popcorn flick movie on Netfilx, but overall, trust me, it's a really really satisfying horror comedy.

Other than Samara Weaving, who really does looks like she's having a blast and some alright violence, I can not find a lot to love about this movie.The premise is alright and could lead to something watchable but the script espically the dialogue is so obnoxious and really failed at making me laugh. I think there was maybe one joke involving the jock guy that I laughed out loud at, the rest was (and I'm sorry to use this word) legitimately cringey. I found the most of the cast wither bland (th main kid and his neighbor) or annoying (Only a Spoonful guy and Bella Thorne).Other people seem to like it fine but I really did not find anything funny or scary in The Babysitter, and therefore to me it failed as a horror comedy.",The Babysitter

185,ana57709,Loved it!,7,19 October 2017,"After watching this I am surprised to say I'm actually impressed. The storyline is pretty basic so the fact they still managed to keep me on the edge of my seat throughout the entire thing is something that left me baffled. The trick with this movie is to recognize what it's out to accomplish and not expect any more of it. Its funny, gory and overall bad ass atmosphere is what keeps you hooked throughout the running time, not to mention the great performances by the main characters.What I loved most about this film is that it took old-school horror movie clichés and made it into something refreshing and fun! I say this because people are complaining about how cliché it was not noticing that the cheesiness was the beauty of the entire thing.

Judah Lewis plays smart young kid, and plays it really well, and pair that with the natural organic friendship that seems real with Samara Weaving, and the tango their characters play from friends to enemies and back again was enthralling.
Weaving's demon blood cult underlings fit the bill really well with their charismatic ranges, fill out the movie with suspense and comedy.",The Babysitter

A perfect blend of comedy horror and ""bad language "" in the right place at the right time. That balanced with the flippant comedy in between the gruesome but still funny ""horror"" parts. There are so many homages to a tonne of films ""the burbs"" for one comes to mind. So many think that would be a bad thing, but these homages are all to top 1980s films.

Other people clearly like it, and I don't knock them for it, but for me personally this movie was a let down despite the hype around it. In terms of horror, it's an okay film. It's got blood and gore and violence. Not on par with some horror films out lately, but meh. In terms of a comedy, it just wasn't good. The entirety of the first half hour of the film or so was just too jumpy. It felt like it just kept jump cutting to a new scene without really adding to the plot. It also made it so the dialogue just couldn't flow as well. The jokes were also lacking a great deal. I think I only laughed at one, and as of writing this (while listening to the end credits) I can't even remember which one it was. A lot of the character relationships felt forced and there was little to no actual explanation for... anything. Like why the bad guys were doing what they were doing or what the backstory was to... well... any action or motivation for any character. There were plot points brought up that would have been way more fascinating to get into, but they were never addressed after being mentioned. I wish more effort had been put into writing good jokes for the movie instead of the massive amounts of fake fog generated for almost every scene. The acting of the main two characters was okay, but the rest of the characters were just too plain and stereotypical. If that's what the writers were going for, then good job, but I'm afraid in terms of a ""good"" movie it failed. Usually I enjoy original Netflix content, but this was probably my least favorite item to come out of them of all time.",The Babysitter

195,knoxfan2008,"Embarrassing, try-hard, phony movie",1,19 October 2017,"This film is bad in pretty much every way. McG proves once again that he can't doesn't know how to direct a movie. This film is an hour and 20 minutes and felt like it was over 2 hours. From the first few frames, this film is obnoxious in every conceivable way. The acting is smug and hammy, the dialogue is cringey, the music is derivative and everything about the plot line reeks of a middle aged man trying desperately to look like a cool kid.This is the ""basic B*tch/Bro"" of movies. The two leads early on have a ""nerdy"" conversation, but it's so vapid, it feels like it was written by someone at Buzzfeed who had only ever seen 2 or 3 mainstream blockbuster ""nerd movies"". It's the movie equivalent of a jock who pretends he's ultra geeky because he watches the Marvel movies. The one phrase that perfectly sums up this movie is ""over confidence"". McG has seen these quick editing tricks and sound effects in other films by decent directors like Wright and Lord/Miller, and decided he would use that style in his movie without understanding why and how those directors use them in the first place. The kid in this movie is not believable in the slightest as a loser because he looks like a young Leo DiCaprio. His character is set up as having a phobia of practically everything, yet instead of this coming into play, he acts like John McClane whenever a threat presents itself. This kid lives on a suburban street, yet when gunshots, screams and cop lights are going off every few seconds, NO-ONE hears in the houses 20 metres away. Everything else is contrived, the attempts at humour are embarrassing, and there's only one that lands, (a cutaway involving a knife in a dishwasher).This film was hate-able in all aspects. Even the repetitive gore doesn't have any charm, because there have already been dozens of these wacky gory callback nostalgia films (Game of Death, Turbo Kid, Stranger Things) that have done it without feeling so empty and shallow. DON'T WATCH THIS",The Babysitter

199,Vinicius8,Innovatively cliché.,6,16 October 2017,"Hot babysitter turns out to be part of a satanic cult that kills people as sacrifice. Pretty standard stuff, right?It turns out that the movie starts with a ""boom"": funny, well paced, well edited and actually smart for once. Cinematography, lightening and, again, editing were innovative and riveting (somewhat remembered me of Nicolas Winding Refn) but the cutting-edge aspects died down as the movie stalled through the common route taken by many other horror movies. Along that path, absurdity grew as the originality diminished, resulting in a predictability, but once again showed improvement in the last few minutes of the film.Still, it's worth remembering the whole experience was very enjoyable and funny. Sometimes even edge-of-your-seat tense. The few jumpscares weren't effective in the least, even though a shame, it was to be expected and did not affect my entertainment (and should not affect yours either). This is the definition of late night flick. It's not bad enough to make you cringe, not complicated enough to give you headaches, but rather gory and funny enough to make you relax and enjoy your evening.",The Babysitter

I didn't enjoy a few of the actors performances. The screenplay is really simple and easy going, but the movie's development is not granted, and this helps the continuity so much. Apart from that, the characters are overly stereotyped, most of them have no characterization at all and their appearances are easily forgettable. The comedy side of the movie is almost invisible, and so is the horror one. I did enjoy the movie after all, but I surely won't remember half of it in a week or two.",The Babysitter

212,TwentyWasHere,Surprisingly Entertaining,7,29 October 2017,"A fun horror comedy, though not much horror, gore or annoying jump scares. It clearly draws its inspiration a bit from 'Home Alone'. Though it doesn't get too silly doing it.The production value is fine given the budget, the actors do an above average job and the writing and directing is professional. The premise of the movie feels fresh overall and that means a lot these days.If you are in for a funny horror comedy put this in your queue, grab some popcorn and watch this on a Sunday evening, preferable with friends. I wish there were more horror movies out there that try to be original these days instead of the another haunted house, found footage, creepy kid snooze fest salted with jump scares. This movie in an anti- thesis to these snooze fests and shows that you can still do movies beyond the beaten path.The movie itself rates about 6 out of 10 but I give it one more point just for trying to be original and the coolest babysitter ever in movie history - well despite what she does when you sleep.So 7 out of 10.

Don't watch this movie if you want to be scared because I think it's more about t&a. The characters aren't all that deep and we don't really figure out why the babysitter does what she does.

The acting is decent but I think the plot is awsome and even tho some of actors aren't the best it dint stop me from loving every second of it.So even if you aren't a horror fan I still recommend this movie to you, and I thought it was awsome.",The Babysitter
226,twist-bite,Good gore where the evil side has shifted,7,28 October 2017,"I have got to start by saying that this movie was entertaining. I've never asked myself how much time has been left form it, not even once and I usually do that with most gore movies (even though I am a bit of a fan) because they lack substance and are just made with small parts of gore followed by a lot of useless dialogue.While the premises of this movie has lacked substance and the motivation of the characters hasn't been sufficiently explained, it doesn't really matter for this movie genre and you receive enough to get an idea of what's going on.The movie starts with a shy little boy, always being bullied who is the only one in his neighborhood who still has a babysitter which embarrasses him and puts him in an inferior position. However, this is about to get challenged as you can spot from the trailer as well.Without giving any spoilers, I want to say that it was a good surprise for me. Directing was good and character's dialogue while not that smart was quite fitting for this type of movie. I am giving it a 7 for its genre of slashers/ gore films and I think it's quite there alongside The final girls and Tucker and Dale vs Evil.(although I found Tucker and Dale funnier than this one)It wasn't much of a comedy although it has its moments, but just expect a few bits of sarcasm along the way and dark humor delivered through various murder scenes. I recommend it for people who like slasher movies and are not in need of a story full of substance to enjoy them. I don't recommend it to parents whose kids still have a babysitter and this might complicate their lives!",The Babysitter

229,matdog321,If you find this film mediocre you probably haven't seen many horror movies lately,7,14 October 2017,"Going into The Babysitter, (having just got back from the Happy Death Day premiere) I can say I had no clue of what was to come besides the beginning (thanks to the spoiler-ly trailer, avoid it at all costs!) so i was pleasantly surprised with it. Netflix has a reputation of creating rather good original movies, this probably won't be considered one of them judging from the harsh reviews on here. But can i just say, the idiot that rated this 1 star and said it was ""so bad"" that he had to cancel his Netflix subscription is the reason I decided to write up this review. For one, this is a Friday the 13th release, revving up audiences for a splendid Halloween this year with decent horror movies. With that, how do you not expect some clichés and classic horror tropes? The one movie that finally decided you should cancel your subscription was an almost-parody of slasher films, well I guess the joke is on you. Your payment or lack there of, is not affecting anyone. Netflix doesn't care, the director of this film doesn't care, and we sure as hell don't. The film is fine, the acting is sub-par from the leads (with the exception of the always terrible Bella Thorne & King Bach) but what do you expect? There are plenty of award winning drama's on Netflix that might suit you more than ""The Babysitter"". My second point is, the film is far from mediocre in my opinion. I have seen many horror movies, many home invasion movies, many slashers, and many horror comedies. If were talking 2010's, almost none of them are more than 1 dimensional cash grabs and shock value filled snooze-fests. This film has heart, and while it does have a few cringe lines you can tell the cast and crew had a lot of fun with this. I couldn't have guessed the movie unfolding like it did, let alone the final act (I think there is a line in the end that also states how surprised they were) and I'm glad to have been treated to this movie which was sort of like a weird mix of Home Alone meets The Loved Ones meets Scream. I also read that the film was shelved for a couple years before release, and I can see why. It's very hard to sell this movie idea with such taboo topics such as a kid being the protagonist from a devil worshiping cult hellbent on murdering him. But if you're still down to see this movie then you won't be disappointed. Fans of slasher movies and gore are sure to love this film more than the average viewer, but to say this film is mediocre and Netflix-cancel-worthy, please shut up. You're opinion is you're opinion but being outraged over this film is laughable and I would hate to be that boring.",The Babysitter

From the warm and colorful production design, snarky dialogue and a clear glee for gore this looked like a fun entry into my favorite genre. To my dismay, this film was a big let down. While horror has an innate ugliness from the often dark subject matter, this film was just plain ugly from the start - every character is mean spirited and crude that I just didn't care for any of them. There is no-one to root for and very little story wise to build tension. It's so paper thin and really never gets going. While I did enjoy the gore and the acting was fine, I can't recommend this.

Now Cole must run for his life before Bee and her cult kill him too.Once it gets going the film goes from raunchy comedy to an EXTREMELY gory horror film, a tone switch that is handled well. Samara Weaving is excellent as Bee, and Robbie Amell, Bella Thorne, Hana Mae Lee, and Andrew Bachelor (aka King Bach) do just as good as her cult members. Judah Lewis makes for a likable protagonist. That said, I found the bully character very annoying since I found him to be nothing more than a one-dimensional stereotype. Right when it looks like he's going to help Cole he deserts him, destroying all hope for character development. Another problem is that words flash across the screen for no reason, and it gets annoyingOverall, despite a few flaws, The Babysitter is an enjoyable horror comedy that I highly recommend.",The Babysitter

Every villain in the story tries to act like a role model and a freaking knife murderer at the same time. Every one of the teenager murderers were created as a impossibly far fetched parody of millennials. Every one of them are written as shallow and as self centered as possible to resemble youth of our day but I would expect the writer of this sh.tty movie to chase children with a cane, yelling 'Darn kids, get off my lawn'. Seriously were the scenes, characters reacting to their own lethal wounds with only concern for their future careers and boobs were supposed to be funny.

244,courtney_london,Pretty entertaining and funny for what it was - teen comedy/horror flick.,7,13 October 2017,"This movie is pretty good. I mean, it's a comedy that's also kind of in the horror genre, but it's also a teen flick so don't have too high of expectation. I gave The Babysitter a 7/10 for what it was. I am not comparing this movie to great horror films like Silence of the Lambs, Friday the 13th, or Nightmare on Elm Street. This move is in the teen comedy/horror section. The movie starts as a predictable young teen flick where a 12 boy (Cole) has a crush on his babysitter (Bee). Cole stays up late one night to witness Bee and 4 other teens kill a nerdy teen as part of a ritual while his parents (who are in my mind hilarious) are staying at a hotel for the night. Incredibly unrealistic gore makes it very funny to watch as Cole tries to hide, then escape the teens as they attempt to capture and kill him. There are the stereotypical horror characters in this movie (shirtless jock, annoying cheerleader, ""token"" black guy, weird Asian girl, and of course the blonde babysitter), which are all pretty funny characters for their, sometimes brief, screen time. One comment I will add is that you never really find out more detail about this ritual; which may be a good thing because often scary/horror films miss on this mark. This movie is a good cross between teen comedy and a chase scene in an 80s horror movie. The Babysitter is pretty fun to watch but it's not super funny, or super scary; it has an entertaining mixture of both. If you thought The Cabin in the Woods was good, this is probably a teen equivalent.",The Babysitter

255,Laimbrane,"Close, with a glaring, obnoxious flaw",5,16 October 2017,"The Babysitter is an above-average self-aware horror comedy that is nearly rescued by some good performances from young actors but ultimately maimed by some shockingly bad choices on the part of the producers.Cole (Judah Lewis) is a 12-year-old boy with overprotective parents that is routinely bullied by others at his school for being awkward and shy. We find out that his parents (Ken Marino and Leslie Bibb) have a regular babysitter named Bee (Samantha Weaving) that takes care of him. They leave because... well, basically so the events in this movie can happen without them around. Once they do, Cole sneaks out of bed to find the sitter and her friends downstairs initiating a satanic ritual that requires Cole's innocent blood. He's discovered trying to escape, and the rest of the movie devolves into him defending himself.The movie definitely has a campy 1980's feel to it mixed with a late-90's ironic detachment that insecurely reminds the viewer of how aware it is that the story is ridiculous. I put the blame for this solely on McG - a cotton candy director with flashy visual style that is completely wrong for this film. McG still seems a little stuck in the music video mode that made him famous back in the 90's, with pop-up subtitles on the screen that is kind of a modern take of that old Batman ""Pow"" and ""Crack"" - only these are to explain feelings and actions, not to visualize sound effects. They're quirky but distracting, defusing any tension that would otherwise exist from the plot. A more confident director would have slowed things down a bit, dragged out the more tense moments, and spent more time on the characters.And it's unfortunate that the actors are overshadowed because they actually do a good job playing passably good renditions of those 80's horror movie tropes. Lewis effortlessly portrays sweet and vulnerable, and his ease in front of the camera and his clear affection for Weaving is what makes the movie work. For her part, Weaving was pretty good as the blonde girl villain. She and Lewis shared an unusual chemistry for an older teenager and a younger one, seeming like actual friends that was only slightly forced. As written (and mostly as it was played), their relationship was actually kind of touching, and its sugar- coated complexity was the highlight of the movie.Unfortunately, those positives were completely overshadowed by one nagging little complaint that kept rearing its head through the film. And that is the strange fact that the movie is kinda racist.And I don't just mean that the black guy dies first (though he does) - there are two black characters in this film, and both are one-dimensional ""bad guys."" The first is a slapstick clown that gets gratuitously squirted with blood (the horror movie equivalent of a pie in the face) to the joy of other characters, overreacts to the police, baby-whines about his role in the group, makes several comments about his blackness, is the first person Cole kills and has the most gratuitously violent death. The other is the main, unsympathetic bully who's fat, wears headband, has two white toadies that somewhat turn on him, and squeals in melodramatic horror when his bike gets run over at the end. I tried to ignore it but it was so glaring to me that those two might as well have been painted in black-face.That feeling of uncomfortable embarrassment I had watching parts of this film is hard to rectify with the rest of the film, which is more of an 8. So I figure a movie that has some very good and some very bad aspects should average to about a 5, and there we go.",The Babysitter

261,patricktday,"A Strange ""Good/bad"" Movie",1,15 September 2021,"The Baybsitter is a strange film to critique in that there are numerous ways to do so. If you're looking for a ""so bad it's good"" experience, this film and its sequel (alongside anything directed by McG) are the money. Although, in terms of legitimate quality when assessed like most films, it's very poor.The movie is usually funny with how putrid the transitions are, often times music feels entirely out of place and the tacked-on movie-ruining references are even more so. The dialogue feels more like bad nerd erotica for a good chunk of the film rather than an actual movie. Although, sometimes the movie becomes offensive in its quality.For one, the characters are so stereotypical that the movie is hypocritical - it attempts to comment on social issues such as feminism, yet the female characters are exclusively either the Madonna or the wh0re. It attempts to speak on racial inequality, and yet every black character is ""hip"" or has a ""fire mixtape"", uses words like ""yo"" and ""forreal"" in every second sentence and greet people with the same close-to-the-chest handshake. It all feels like a confusing cha-cha slide of political alliance, as though it wants to be appeal to racists one moment and condemn the very same bigotry in the next. The commentary either feels largely underdeveloped and simplistic, downright racist or sexist, or simply unnecessary.A lot of ""good-bad"" movies are also good because they're surprising. You never really know what'll happen because it's impossible to predict a script so laughable. The Babysitter is different, though, it's sort of a grey area of predictability: despite its efforts to subvert expectations, these sudden changes in tone and pace never feel threatening. Every ""scare"" you can see coming, most deaths are the same, besides the first and one of the last, but even when the movie is surprising, the reaction it provokes is more of indifference; perhaps an ""Oh... ok."" From the audience at best. Sometimes scenes can be seen from a mile away, other times quick shifts and changes in the script are surprising, but never thrilling or bewildering in the same way as other movies of this calibre.The dialogue is so laughable that it's hardly worth mentioning. When the script is actually trying to be funny, it isn't, and when it's not, it is. There is one joke that made me laugh and this was the only moment of genuine quality in the entire script: the stereotypical black character makes a joke about STD's that isn't in too poor taste and involves an actual setup and punchline rather than the movie just half-assedly saying something that sounds ""quirky"" or ""relatable"" like it does for the rest of its duration.Overall, if you're looking for a laugh with a friend, this movie may be it. Something to poke fun at and have a good time with in the background. Even if it can get offensive at points, it is mostly a fun time if not taken too seriously. However, being reviewed genuinely, and having its quality assessed legitimately: this movie is a disaster, even if it is one you can't look away from. The characters are unbearably bad, the writing is contrived and at points, horribly offensive. The Babysitter is certainly a strange one, although whether or not it's worth the watch depends on who you are. If you want a good movie, look elsewhere. If you want a good time with a bad movie, you've found a candidate.",The Babysitter

264,erickdalexandrie,"Not funny, not scary, not thrilling, not worth it.",1,30 April 2018,"This is the second worst movie I ever watched on Netflix, behind The Invitation. I couldn't even finish this crap, and I'm used to watch bad movies. This movie tries to be horror, comedy and teen. It's neither.It isn't horror because it's not scary. The whole book thing is just a pathetic excuse to justify the murders and it's not even interesting. No demon appears, the people are just people without any supernatural powers and their only goal with the ritual is ""to get what they want"". Very original.It isn't comedy because it's painfully unfunny. This film should be called Cringe Compilation 2017. Every single sentence that came out of the black guy's mouth made me roll my eyes so hard that I could see inside the back of my head. The blonde woman (not girl, these ""youngsters"" are on their 30's) shot in the chest was trying to beat the black guy at the cringe competition. Her whining is very irritating and the writers desperately tried to be funny by throwing terrible lines such as ""nobody will suck my nipples anymore"". Near the end there is another terrible scene with this girl when she complains that the boy grabbed her chest while trying to escape her. The writers tried their hardest to be self aware so the movie would look less ridiculous; it didn't work. The writers also think that a comedy doesn't have to be at least a little realistic. They CHOSE to set this ""movie"" on the suburbs, but not one neighbor hears the screaming, the gunshots and the explosion. The boy escaped the house and, instead of asking help to his neighbors, he hides in a basement. This isn't poetic license, it's just lazyness.It isn't teen but tries very hard to be. Throwing obvious references to pop culture as if they were nerdy or something is just one of the things this movie does so teens might relate. But in case this wasn't enough, let's have a long lesbian kiss, that will lure in the horny teenagers for sure. But wait, some girls might watch this too, so let's have the hot guy shirtless through the entire movie, and let's make sure that the kid acknowledges this so we can show how self aware we are. If the horny teens are lucky to not die of boredom through the rest of the movie, at least they will have something to do in the bathroom. The attempt to portray a handsome kid as a loser and the ugly, fat kids as the bullies was just stupid.I can't talk about the ending because I didn't watch it, and neither should you. All I can say is that this movie is pure crap and will make you reconsider watching anything labeled ""original Netflix"" again. If you like unfunny jokes, no plot and dialogue that will make you scatch your face and look at the watch out of embarassment, then go for it.",The Babysitter

It is not funny or scary just pure guilty pleasure fun. There were a lot of references to other movies teen and slasher and in a way you can call it a parody although the references are very subtle. Nevertheless, i could see the references so it was fun knowing the self aware nature of this fun. It is more like a Scary Movie rather than a Shaun of the Dead/Zombieland kinda parody. The girl from happy death day (which was a similar kind of movie but with a dragged run time) does what she does best, look hot. 
There is no logic in the movie and do not even try to find one. I may be repeating myself again but this point is highlighted during the movie that there is not a lot of logic behind whatever is happening. Watch it if you like cheese cinema with a runtime of just 1hr 20 mins. Enjoy",The Babysitter
267,marcus_sparrow,The most all out fun movie I've seen in a while,10,8 June 2019,"A romantic slasher horror comedy packed with lots of nerdy references to make my heart warmer that also helps to show the two main characters relationship that develops really interestingly throughout the story and how it culminates is just awesome. It's also a growing up, becoming a man story mixed with Breaking Bad.
The movie is wholesome, has a lot of crazy good, funny dialogues, and characters.
The actors are all play their parts perfectly for their roles. And while most of them just there to be killed their moments are great and memorable thanks to the weirdness of the story. Especially Judah Lewis and Samara Weaving. Their just swimming in their roles. I just want Samara in every movie that has this level of craziness. Or any movie, you know... she's not an eyesore... to say the least.
The direction is new, unique and just fun. This movie is just so much fun! And it shows from the very first minutes.
The music helps every scene, and has some classics that make the retro feel even stronger.
The kills gave me some Final Destination vibes even tho here not the death itself killed, they had similar feel of absurdity.
It quickly became a favorite of mine.
Hands down best Netflix movie so far, and the most underrated. Make you some good 85 minutes and watch it! If it ever gets a sequel, I will be the first to watch it.",The Babysitter

I guess there are a few redeemable qualities though, I did jump once and gasp for air I enjoyed the overall feel of the movie and I didn't feel like it wasted my time.

276,punkharpy,A poorly crafted film with oddly good films,2,4 May 2020,"A lot of people seem to like it for how cheesy it is, and I initially enjoyed it for its charm but I soon grew kinda bored. I think that enjoyable stories are heavily character based, and this story has a lot of flat, static characters. There's a big difference between using stereotypes in an enjoyable way, and using them for lazy writing.I was also super surprised to find out that the DP was Shane Hulbert, because the cinematography really lacking. Almost every shot has a ridiculously blurred background, and almost every shot is way to close to someones face. You really can't feel very immersed when the shot changes every five second and they're all either slow motion, show to much, or only show someones face. It's also weird how the blurred shots will transition to clear shots, and back to blurred shots.The humor was to be expected, I'm doing my best not to go into detail, but it's a lot of low hanging fruit. One of the jokes it literally just a ball being thrown at the main characters head, and another guy saying ""Suck it!"". It honesty feels like this movie was made in the 80's with how simple the humor is. Don't get me wrong, there's nothing wrong with low brow humor, but this was just lazy.The story was obviously kind of stupid, and over the top but I think that was intentional. It was executed in a really mediocre way, and a lot of times I felt bored watching it.All in all, it tried to be a silly slasher comedy with a really simple textbook humor, and ended up being a poorly shot, painful nightmare of a movie entirely riding on stereotypes, and tropes. It really feels like Brian Duffield just hired an intern for the entire screenplay. It goes down as yet another poorly crafted netflix film.I just felt really upset about this one because it had a lot of big names behind it like McG.",The Babysitter

288,MrDudds,Brilliantly Daft Future Cult Film,7,6 October 2018,"McG's brilliantly daft slasher comedy works so well because it embraces what it and its genre is and isn't afraid to use that to maximum efficiency.McG made a name for himself in the music video business and has since gone on to direct multiple films but has never really found his footing. As we saw with Terminator Salvation, serious thematic themes are not his forte. Luckily The Babysitter is far from that and plays perfectly to his past experience.In many ways, it is very much a music video. A modern soundtrack, a crisp suburban setting reminiscent of those late 90's/early 00's videos, and a collection of highly attractive cast members. This also plays perfectly into the well established slasher genre. Rather than focussing on a trying to establish itself as pillar of originality, or on creating a weaving plot line, The Babysitter instead focuses on simply having a good time.If you don't look at it too hard and take it for what it is (which any true horror fan should be used to) then you will likely have a blast.

The story left the audience with plenty of ah ha moments that didn't take themselves too seriously, but walked the delicate balance of humor and thriller. Samara Weaving was perfect for this role, it's too bad Netflix didn't put her on the cover. She's the quintessential dream girl for all boys. I'm glad films like this get made.

Cops kick the door down but he chooses to run upstairs instead of outside. When he eventually does get outside, instead of running down the street, shouting help, he decides to hide in a garage and then a crawl space. There's an explosion and NO ONE in the neighborhood hears that. Then he is in the street, in that confrontation with Robbie Amell's character and breaks free but where does he run to-- back to their backyard instead of down the street. Then Samara Weaving starts shooting at him and he runs to his friend's house and rams into her and has zero sense of urgency and then closes the door without locking it. Then, they hide and run past the front door that is open. Oi! It's like that Geico commercial where they play a parody of stupid things people do in a horror movie.

From the beginning you're all in with the 12 year old boy who lead who has a bully, a girl as a best friend and parents that still think he needs a babysitter.

I am always a skeptic when it comes to them and very leery about giving in and watching them because I feel like I am always let down. This was actually funny! I (for the first time in YEARS) actually laughed out, loud so loudly, that I made everyone in the room jump! I am ALSO not a fan of cult/slasher style movies but they BLEW this one out of the water! The suspense made me feel like my shoulders were stiff after watching it! There were parts that were totally predictable and other SUPER suspenseful scenes that were completely UNpredictable! I absolutely LOVED how every single aspect of the beginning eventually came into play later on in a magnificent display of cinematography and irony! I immediately started calling all of my friends to tell them about this movie when it was done. THIS is the movie that I have been waiting to come out for the past 4+ years!

From dealing with his awkward Gen-X parents (Leslie Bibb & Ken Marino) failing marriage to bullies (Miles J. Harvey) that follows him home from school. He'll learn to manage his budding feelings for his classmates (Emily Alyn Lind) and his babysitter (Samara Weaving). All while surviving an assault from a Satanic Murder Cult (Robbie Amell, Hanna Mae Lee, Bella Thorne & Andrew Bachelor).The Babysitter is a 2017 Netflix horror film from director McG (Terminator Salvation, Charlies Angels). Famous for some of the best music videos of the 90's; this is the first feature from McG I've actually enjoyed. It's schlock without being schlocky. It's a perfect grindhouse-esque B-movie elevated to perfection. The plot is tight, gruesome, and funny with a nice runtime of an hour twenty-five. The story has tons of set-up and payoffs with enough twists to keep you engaged. Its special effects are mostly practical, beautiful and only once did an effect stick out as fake. There are tons of great uses of slow-mo to show a deeper relationship between characters. Text abruptly pops up on screen in a funny stylistic fashion. The staging of every scene is set up with care which makes me think the films storyboarding must have been incredible.Not only is the technical direction of The Babysitter perfect; the cast is fantastic as well. Judah Lewis excels as a confused preteen trying to figure out who he is. He has a real emotional journey over the course of the film that is always grounded and real. Meanwhile Samara Weaving is devastating in her role as Bee the Babysitter. A perfect blend of charming and predatory, she'll leave you guessing Bee's true intentions long after the movie ends. Her band of merry murders are also entertaining. With a stand out performance from Robbie Amell who plays a psycho-killer more charming and fun than Ted Bundy.I'm actually disappointed it's taken me three years and a global pandemic to sit down and watch the Babysitter. It's been on my radar since its release in October 2017. Now it's one of my favourite horror movies.

312,carmenulalume,waste time,2,23 September 2020,I'm really suprised that it's 6.8 points. Because that was the worst comedy movie i've ever seen. I couldn't even bear to watch it until the end. And i wanted to cry after this nonsense was over. Sorry..,The Babysitter
313,jeffreyolsen-33738,A Fun Thriller with a Hidden Theme,8,4 October 2020,"While not the classic ""scary movie"" this film does provide ample entertainment to those interested in the genre. It starts with a scared adolescent boy who is living the stereotypical ""nerd"" life. He's also afraid of all the classic things such as shots, spiders, driving, hieghts, and talking to girls. Throughout the film each one of these fears has to be conquered so that he can survive the night from his cult leading killer babysitter. The film is entertaining through it's gore and comedy, but hidden in the background is a theme that all young kids can connect with and that is the only way to adulthood is to face those childhood fears straight on. This leads me to my own interpretation of the film as an action adventure created in his own mind to propel him from a scared preteen into someone ready to take on the challenges growing up can bring. A great watch and hope I'm not reading too much into it.",The Babysitter
314,fmphmk,What a pleasant surprise,7,18 August 2021,"I feel like all we do lately is look for that slasher film flashback that doesn't try too hard. The babysitter was not only funny but easy to watch with some

The first act offers up a promising film that could be good if done well. First off, this kid lives IN THE SUBURBS and instead of run out the front door to a neighbor's house he runs upstairs, jumps out a window into the front yard, and runs to his BACKYARD to unscrew a vent and hide in it instead of to a neighbor's house just to show you one of the actions that just lacks a sense of logic. Most of These things could have easily been fixed by changing location. The only reason it's not a 1/10 is because of the first act and cinematography. I was waiting for a twist end where maybe he was just imagining this story to his babysitter because it lacks so much logic that it seemed like it was written by a child who loves horror movies. That twist honestly would have brought it up to a 5 but once the movie ended all I could think to myself was, What. The. Hell.",The Babysitter

Without giving away any spoilers, I'd like to say: Anyon could have come up with this plot. There is very little creativity or complexity within this film.2.5 stars out of ten. Trust me, look for a better movie. Netflix let the ball drop with this one. So disappointed, wish I didn't spend my time on it.I mean if you literally have nothing else to do, to the point where even watching paint dry sounds fun to you, then yeah I recommend this movie.

The overall ending is in line with every other coming of age teen horror flick, but the way the story unfolded was far from predictable.Pros:Strong performances by the entire main cast, the main pair's chemistry was very well done/developed, and some of the villains were much more likable then I had expected.Director McG's use of graphics within scenes was very tasteful and unique.

This feeling only shifted after seeing a short preview video on Netflix. When it started to play I found myself chuckling along at the protagonist questioning my one of his capture isn't wearing a shirt anymore. A few days later on a whim I looked at my wife well trying to find something to watch and asked if ""The Babysitter"" would do. After the protest from my wife, we sped through the measly 1h25m run-time. Don't judge this movie by its cover. It is fun and self-aware flick that knows how silly it is and is not afraid of poking fun at its self. The premise really does not do a good job of conveying its meta-humor and ridiculous scenarios. Of course this movie like most these past few years likes to tug at our nostalgia strings and includes some great TV/movie/comic references and of course 80s rock'n'roll. I've watched it about three times in the past few weeks to show friends and family, who all had the same eye roll effect when I recommended it. In the end they all laughed and enjoyed it.

Not very scary really, at least on t.v., but I'm sure it would have been scarier on big screens. It really didn't matter though, because the kid's character in the movie threads through the entire story seamlessly, perfectly developed, and the babysitter's character is actually believable and the babysitter we all would have fallen for when we were that age, and been equally as brokenhearted to find out she's actually a psychopathic killer, and was just using us for a satanic ritual.",The Babysitter
345,sneha26490,Doesn't deserve a sequel,4,20 September 2020,"I first tried watching this film two years back with a fellow-horror movie enthusiast, but we lost interest in the first 10 minutes because a lot of other stuff was happening at that point of time. This time around, I saw the film with the husband.""I am not drunk enough to watch this film,"" he complained mid-movie, while I laughed at some scene that he didn't find mildly funny. The big problem with 'The Babysitter' is that there are a lot of pop-culture references that non-movie enthusiasts won't understand. There was a scene with the lot of star-trek references that were completely lost on me too. At the cost of being 'nerdy cool', the makers alienate a lot of regular movie fans and bore them.The plot is pretty simple - 12-year-old Cole is the only boy in his class who still has a babysitter; a very hot one at that. One night, he learns that she is a part of a cult that makes human sacrifices and finds himself fighting for his life in his own home. It's like 'Home Alone' meets 'Evil Dead', although there are no ghosts or ghouls. Just a boy trying to save himself from a bunch of psychotic teens baying for his blood.There are quite some gory slasher scenes that horror fans would enjoy screaming to. Not the scared kind of screaming, more like ""ew, ew, ew"" kind of gasps. The cast is very good-looking and all actors do their part well. Some of the stuff is insanely stupid and you know that the makers deliberately tried to do spoof like scenes to draw some laughs.Despite having a short runtime of 90 minutes, 'The Babysitter' would have benefited from some snipping. I think they take too long to come to the whole horror bit, so the set-up to the conflict could have been shorter. Instead, the killing sequences could have been elongated a little to heighten the drama and horror a little. Most of the kill scenes are over too quickly. Some sappy romantic scenes get more screen time than they deserve.Judah Lewis who plays the 12-year-old hero is definitely the saving grace of this film. He is adorable as the shy, starry-eyed nerd who has the hots for his gorgeous babysitter. While the movie is mediocre and probably didn't need a sequel, Judah Lewis definitely deserved a second-shot. I hope the next one is more fun and the makers have learnt from their past mistakes.",The Babysitter

However if you are like horror/comedy and jokes movies and don't take everything what you see in movies seriously like me then this is really good movie for you. Movie concept is unusual. Usually in horror movies Teens are chased by psychopath but in this movie teens are the psychopaths. Samara Weaving's role as Bee/babysit is excellent she is actually believable babysitter I think we all would have secret crush towards cool & really friendly babysit like Bee when we were 12 year old, and been equally as brokenhearted to find out she's actually a psychopathic killer. It seems that she is also having ''some'' kinds of feelings towards Cole (?). 9/10Judah Lewis's role as Cole is also excellent. It is really easy to relate to him. He is absent- minded but smart school nerd who falls in love to his babysit Bee. 9/10Emily Alyn's role as Melanie is really superb. She is supportive and kinda really good friend to Cole and she has secretly crush on Cole. 9/10Other characters: Hana Mae Lee as Sonya 8/10 - Robbie Amell as Max 8/10 - Bella Thorne as Allison 8/10 - Andrew Bachelor (Also known as KingBach from Vines) as John 8/10 - Leslie Bibb as Cole's mom 7/10 - Ken Marino as Cole's dad 7/10Jokes are fun and edgy just it should be in these types of movies. Plot is also good. It is understandable and NOT Predictable like some people claim it to be. Plot's build up is also pretty good and solid. Character chemistry shows in the movie. 8/10All in all this movie is good for edgy comedic laughs and for horror/gore fans. Only disappointing thing was that other people just cant see really good horror/comedy anymore like I do but still it is their own opinion and it is understandable. This movie also has 80s classic horror flick vibe which is good.Should I recommend this to someone? - Yes! I personally would recommend this movie for people who likes over stereotypical teens and jokes and horror. Would I watch it again? - Yes! It became one of my favorite Comedy/Horror flicks . If there is planned sequel or prequel I would defiantly be first in line to watch it. Solid 8/10 for me. Looking forward to sequel or prequel (if there is planned one)!",The Babysitter
363,rtwhirlwind,Over hyped,2,22 October 2017,"Watched this movie as I kept seeing it being hyped all over the place and was disappointed. First of all a good deal of you are going into this based on all the Bella Thorne controversy. She is not the babysitter and is only a main character because the cast is twenty two people. Secondly this movie has some very obvious parts that have been ripped off other, much better comedy horror movies (Zombieland comes to mind). Lastly it plays on every movie trope that does nothing but fictionalize reality. A perfect example is how a bullet hits a character in a movie and they fly back twenty feet, when even a twelve gauge will not budge you in real life. I will admit I have bias towards this movie because the jokes in it are referenced from everything I hate even though a good deal of the time they are being used to make fun of what the joke is about. The vast majority of people will more than likely enjoy this movie, I am just warning you that you are in for what is basically an hour plus long instagram joke with dead bodies. Oh and do not try to make sense of how he is the only person in this day and age over two years old who does not have a cellphone.

Did the filmmakers get stupid or they think the viewers are stupid? Putting a skinny seductive blond into a film does not make the film successful right away. You need actual funny situations.

Yes it's that bad. And it's not even like the ""so bad it's good"" type of bad. It's just outright bad. The movie fails utterly terribly in every attempt at humor, the acting is some of the worst I've ever seen. Film production seems to think it's being cute and creative by writing ""POCKET KNIFE"" on the screen every time the lead character uses his pocket knife. This is not only completely idiotic, but I don't even get what the director is trying to accomplish with stupid little things like this. They don't fit in the film, don't make sense, and is just something else in this film that makes you cringe every time you see it. Netflix usually makes some good stuff, and when I read the description of the film, it sounded like something I'd like. Sadly they managed to take a film idea that could have been done in campy horror fun, and turned it into something that tries way too hard and just completely flops at every attempt at being witty or humorous. I did not like it.... at all..... The acting and characters are so unbelievably stupid you almost feel embarrassed for the poor actors who were forced to appear in this steaming pile of garbage.

My main problem is that SOME scenes were genuinely funny, like, they were credible and funny enough to make me chuckle, but other ""funny"" scenes were TOO ridiculous, like... ""Scary movie"" levels of ridiculous, it totally threw me off because it didn't seem like that was the kind of movie I was watching.
It's not too bad though, some scenes were good and it did make me feel engaged with some characters, but the final execution was lacking.
In other words, it had a lot of potential, but sadly some really bad scenes kind of ruined it for me.
Who knows, if you like ridiculous humor and don't take movies seriously? You might like this, so it's worth giving it a try if you have time to kill and you want a movie you can laugh at for it's weird scenes.",The Babysitter
372,AlphaManR,Confused,3,16 October 2019,"Basically it sucks. I would say it is kids movie due to the mechanics and stupid coincidences that doesn't make sense at all. In addition to not knowing for what age group is it, I don't know what category is it. Not that funny ,some silly jokes , and not horror . Just an awful movie.",The Babysitter

374,mathieuad,5.5 to 5.75 really,5,6 November 2018,My first thought was wow this is terrible... but for whatever reason I couldn't stop watching and because of that I won't trash it. If you have a good since of humor and an open mind it will entertain you. You will chuckle... However I won't be running to tell my friends about it.,The Babysitter
