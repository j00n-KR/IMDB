0,SnoopyStyle,TRON Jam,5,23 July 2021,"LeBron James worked hard to be the greatest and he's not about to let his son Dom be a slacker. Instead of basketball, Dom only wants to be a video game designer. WB's new computer algorithm Al G. Rhythm (Don Cheadle) wants to use LeBron's popularity to dominate the social media space. After LeBron rejects the offer, Al G. Rhythm kidnaps LeBron and Dom into the computer world. LeBron has to play a basketball game to win freedom for himself and his son. LeBron is sent to Tune World where he finds a lonely Bugs Bunny.LeBron is a functional actor and I like the older style Looney Tunes cartoon world. I love the Michael B. Jordan bit. I like some bits in this movie but it's way too long and too much of this is below par. The best part of this movie is Bugs Bunny in his Looney Tunes world and then they go off to various franchises to search for the rest of his friends. I like all of that. I like the animation style. Quite frankly, an animated LeBron James allows him off the hook for his acting. His voice is unique and works well for animation. Turning him in cartoon is a good thing. He doesn't have to act. He should stay a cartoon until he wins the game.His son Dom is a big problem. He's a brat. The excuse is that he gets enticed by Al G. Rhythm but it's a sorry excuse. At no point is he concerned about being in a computer simulation or about his father. The solution lies in Al turning Dom into a monster. When LeBron has his big emotional speech, Dom can slowly turn back into a boy looking to hug his father. That is much better characterization and progression in his story arc.Finally, this movie is hella busy and way too long. It is almost two hours long. The game is almost an hour long. They need to cut out at least fifteen minutes if not more. There is so much chaotic action that the long game section grows tiresome. People are excusing this for being a kids movie. Some of these references are going right over those kids' heads. They are not going to get A Clockwork Orange. For people who get all the references, this is bad for them. For kids who don't get the references, there's no point to it. This movie has fun bits. I love the Looney Tunes animation section. I don't like them digitized into computer animated. The plot is bad simplistic writing. The father son conflict could have been done better. This is way too long and that pushed me over the edge.",Space Jam - A New Legacy
1,Prismark10,Space Jam: A New Legacy,6,22 July 2021,"Live-action/animated comedies fall into two camps.For every Who Framed Roger Rabbit there is a Cool World.Space Jam: A New Legacy is a belated sequel to Space Jam which was released in 1996.The story line is LeBron James is a great basketball player but a dumb dad. He wants his son Dom to follow in his footsteps even though he is too short to be a basketball player.Dom wants to have fun and be a games designer. LeBron wants to just drill his sons to be the best like him, all work and no play.Al G Rhythm (Don West) is a rogue artificial intelligence program that abducts Dom leaving LeBron and the Warner Brothers cartoon characters playing an epic and upgraded basketball game.The story is for Bugs, Daffy and Co to come on the scene as LeBron tries to get a team together. He was hoping to get Superman and Batman. Instead it's Tweety, Taz and Foghorn Leghorn.It's an exercise on WB using its intellectual property to show Disney that it too has assets. So you have Harry Potter, Hanna Barbera cartoon characters, Justice League to Looney Tunes. Incongruously for a movie aimed at kids. It also has characters from Game of Thrones, It, The Devils and Clockwork Orange.It is frenetic and colourful. I found myself laughing a few times and I watched this movie with low expectations given the bad reviews this movie has had. The film is a little too long and the plot makes little sense. I wonder if LeBron James banned his kids from playing games consoles in real life!",Space Jam - A New Legacy
2,nogodnomasters,I found Michael Jordan,8,31 July 2021,Lebron James having a strong work ethic has trouble with his son who is not as into basketball as he wishes. They get sucked into a computer (Tron) by Don Cheadle playing a sinister algorithm. In order to get out and save his family James must win a basketball game with the Loony Tunes as his team mates.The story was bad. What I liked was the trip down memory lane with the tunes. Bugs Bunny doing William Shatner with all the pauses. Seeing famous villains in the background like Pennywise and the Wicked Witch of the West. In many ways this film is more for the adults who watch the film with their kids.Sorry I enjoyed it for the classic lines and if anything to hear the Notorious P. I. G. Rap. Who comes up with that? Great stuff.,Space Jam - A New Legacy
3,kosmasp,Does this stink more than Pepe LePew?,6,16 July 2021,"Now this or rather the original was not going to be cancelled because of one character. Whatever your feelings are about this character ... he is not included here - and if you actually check how his appearance would have gone down in the movie - you may change your perspective or your feelings about him not being included.But this ""outrage"" of some, who thought the character was deleted because of any backlash that might flush over the movie ... well it seems gone now. People are rather quite sad and mad about the overall outcome of the movie. And I would argue that LeBron is not really to blame for that. His acting abilities are better than those of MJ (and I say that as a big MJ fan).I think one of the biggest problems of the movie is how long it is. And how much ""other stuff"" it tries to push and pack into the movie. So many characters (and yet no Pepe - had to mention him once more for fun) and a 2 hour run time. As expected this looks way better than the original.And it tries to make more sense than the original too. While we had Aliens in the first one, this is closer to home. It also has Don Cheadle ... what a wonderful bad guy. But while it tries to make sense ... it falls flat on its face - no pun intended.The young ones might not mind and hopefully take the message this has (be yourself) and run with it - again no pun intended. The big ones may get a bit annoyed after a while I reckon. Still there are some good jokes in here (half time surprise guest/cameo), but also some really bad word puns/jokes - you may fall for them ... or not.The soundtrack overall is not as great as that of the original. There are some really good/updated/tweaked versions of some classics - like flavor in ya ear. So overall I have mixed feelings about this - I'm still a bit surprised this has such a low score right now (under 4 overall)",Space Jam - A New Legacy
4,jboothmillard,Space Jam: A New Legacy,4,26 July 2021,"I watched the original live-action cartoon hybrid twice at the cinema when I was a kid, and many times after on video, it was always rumoured there would be a sequel, and it came twenty-five years later, directed by Malcolm D. Lee (Scary Movie 5, Girls Trip). Basically, basketball player LeBron James (as himself) wishes for both of his sons, Darius (Ceyair J. Wright) and Dom (Cedric Joe), to follow in his footsteps. But Dom, a child prodigy in computer software, instead dreams of becoming a video game developer. LeBron shows an interest in the arcade basketball game Dom has developed, but a glitch from a certain move causes his character to be deleted, which crushes Dom. Meanwhile, at Warner Bros. Studios, Burbank, state-of-the-art A. I., Al-G Rhythm (Don Cheadle) has secretly become self-aware and desires more recognition from the world. LeBron is invited to the studio to discuss a movie deal, taking Dom with him. While LeBron dismisses the idea, Dom shows an interest in the studio's software. Dom expresses his interest in software development, leading to a blow-up argument with his father at basketball camp when LeBron refuses to let him give up on the sport. Al-G lures the father and son to the studio basement and traps them in virtual reality. Insulted by LeBron's refusal to recognise his potential, Al-G takes Dom as his prisoner, and tells LeBron his son will only be released if the basketball star assembles a team together to beat him in a game of basketball. LeBron is then transported through the virtual space where he is dumped in Tune World. LeBron finds the animated world is deserted, with only cartoon character Bugs Bunny (Jeff Bergman) remaining. Bugs explains that Al-G persuaded the rest of the Looney Tunes to leave their world and explore other realities. Meanwhile, Al-G manipulates Dom to turn him against his father and helping him to develop and upgrade himself and his game, which he secretly intends to use against LeBron. Bugs wanting to help LeBron form his basketball team lures Marvin the Martian (Eric Bauza) to landing his spaceship in Tune World and he and LeBron steal the ship to travel to different worlds based on Warner Bros properties. In DC Comics, they find Daffy Duck (Bauza) and Porky Pig (Bauza) trying to be superheroes. In Mad Max: Fury Road, they find Road Runner and Wile E. Coyote. In Austin Powers, they find Elmer Fudd (Bauza) and Sylvester the Cat (Bergman), and Tweety Pie (Bob Bergen) when Sylvester spits him out. In Casablanca, they find Yosemite Sam (Bergman) playing ""As Time Goes By"". In Game of Thrones, they find Foghorn Leghorn (Bauza) riding a dragon. In The Matrix, they find Granny (Candi Milo) and Speedy Gonzales (Gabriel Iglesias). LeBron is unconvinced by the playing capabilities of the Looney Tunes; he insists they find a character with genuine talent. Finally, back in DC Comics, Lola Bunny (Zendaya) is with Wonder Woman (Rosario Dawson) to prove herself as an Amazonian, but Bugs convinces her to join the team to save LeBron's son. LeBron ignores the objections of Bugs and insists on coaching the ""Tune Squad"" on the fundamentals of basketball. When the time for the game arrives, the Tune Squad meet with Al-G's team, the Goon Squad, consisting of upgraded avatars of several active professional basketball players with superpowers and led by Dom. The Looney Tunes are surprised when they find themselves also upgraded, to become computer-animated beings, with more realistic features. To further the stakes, Al-G livestreams the game and abducts countless viewers, including LeBron's family, into the virtual reality while summoning all the Warner Bros. Characters to watch the game. Al-G announces that if the Tune Squad loses, all viewers will remain trapped in the ""server-verse"" for eternity and the Looney Tunes will be deleted permanently. With Dom Ball being a video game, LeBron and his team must contend with scoring high bonus points for style and execution, and the superpowers of the Goon Squad easily dominate the first half of the game. During the break, Sylvester attempts to recruit former Tune Squad member Michael Jordan, but finds actor Michael B. Jordan instead. LeBron realises that traditional basketball skills will not be enough and allows Bugs to devise the strategy for the second half using their cartoon physics to catch up with the Goon Squad. The Tunes manage to regain points until the teams are close to tying. LeBron confronts Dom and tells him he no longer wants to stand in the way of his dream. Dom forgives and trusts his father, and he abandons the Goon Squad. Al-G assumes control of the Goon Squad and uses his own abilities to make them seemingly unbeatable. Dom realises the only way to win the game is to use the glitch move, even though whoever does so will be deleted. During the final seconds of the game, Bugs sacrifices himself by performing the move, helping LeBron score the final point, winning the game and causing Al-G and the Goon Squad to be deleted. The James family and the abducted citizens are returned to the real world, while the Tunes gather around Bugs as he bids farewell before disappearing. In the real world, LeBron becomes closer to his family and supports Dom's decision to become a video game designer. After dropping Dom off at a video game trade event, LeBron is delighted when Bugs appears, he can't really ""die"", being a fictional character. He asks LeBron to put him up for a little while until he can find a way back to Tune World. Also starring Sonequa Martin-Green as Kamiyah James, LeBron's wife, Khris Davis as Malik, Harper Leigh Alexander as Xosha James, Xosha Roquemore as Shanice James, Stephen Kankole as Young LeBron, Gerald 'Slink' Johnson as Warner Bros. Security Guard (as Slink Johnson), Sarah Silverman as Warner Bros. Executive, Minari's Steven Yeun as Warner Bros. Executive, Ernie Johnson as Game Announcer, and Get Out's Lil Rel Howery as Game Announcer, with the voices of Jeff Bergman as Fred Flintstone and Yogi Bear, Fred Tatasciore as Taz the Tasmanian Devil, and Justin Roiland as Rick and Morty. Other Warner Bros. Movies and TV references and characters that can be spotted included: King Kong, The Wizard of Oz, The Flintstones, Yogi Bear, The Jetsons, What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?, Batman (1966), Wacky Races, Scooby Doo, Where Are You!, A Clockwork Orange, Captain Caveman and the Teen Angels, Superman (1978), The Shining, Gremlins, Thundercats, The Goonies, Batman (1989), Batman Returns, A League of Their Own, Batman: The Animated Series, Animaniacs, The Mask, Superman: The Animated Series, Mars Attacks!, Batman & Robin, Men in Black, The Iron Giant, Harry Potter and the Wizarding World, The Lord of the Rings, Ben 10, 300, The Conjuring, Dunkirk, It (Pennywise), Aquaman, and Joker (2019). James is likeable enough, Cheadle relishes being the villain, and of course Bugs Bunny and his cartoon friends are delightful. I was hoping for something entertaining, but it does not have quite the same charm as the original. The biggest problem is, it tries too hard to be clever, it is not all that funny, it tries too hard to imitate the wonder of Ready Player One cramming as many references as possible from Warner Bros. Properties, almost forgetting the Looney Tunes, and is much more style over substance. There is not a bad word to say about the animation, going from traditional hand-drawn to fantastic special CGI effects to make Bugs fluffy and so on, and any geek watching will have fun spotting the movie and TV characters. It is unfortunate that it is a bit of a let-down, but not a terrible part-animated fantasy sports comedy. Wacky Races was number 100, Captain Caveman and the Teen Angels was number 90, Yogi Bear was number 80, Foghorn Leghorn was number 61, Thundercats was number 54, Scooby-Doo, Where Are You! Was number 49, Road Runner was number 48, The Sylvester and Tweety Show was number 35, Daffy Duck was number 30, Looney Tunes / Merrie Melodies was number 20, The Iron Giant was number 12, The Flintstones was number 11, and Bugs Bunny was number 10 on The 100 Greatest Cartoons. Okay!",Space Jam - A New Legacy
5,paul_haakonsen,They shoot and... They missed...,4,20 July 2021,"""Space Jam: A New Legacy"" was not a movie that I was in any particularly rush to get to go and watch. But since my 11 year old son wanted to watch it, of course I found the time to go watch it with him.And while my son definitely enjoyed the movie, I must admit that I was not overly thrilled with this 2021 movie from director Malcolm D. Lee. ""Space Jam: A New Legacy"" is definitely a movie for the youngsters.Needless to say that this 2021 movie turned out to be as I had initially expected it would. And ""Space Jam: A New Legacy"" didn't really offer me much of any worthwhile entertainment or enjoyment.Visually then ""Space Jam: A New Legacy"" is definitely spot on, because the animation and art style used here is good and pleasing to the eyes. And there is no secret about the fact that it is the animated cartoon characters that carry the movie singlehandedly. It should be said that there are so many interesting characters and things going on in the background that ""Space Jam: A New Legacy"" could actually be watched twice; the first time for the movie alone, and the second time to take in all the background stuff. There are so many cameo from lots of different movies.Storywise then ""Space Jam: A New Legacy"" wasn't really impressive. And it certainly didn't manage to entertain me in a wholehearted manner. However, it is sort of impressive that six writers could collectively manage to come up with so little. The storyline told in ""Space Jam: A New Legacy"" just failed to captivate me and didn't offer much of any enjoyment or entertainment in comparison to the 1996 ""Space Jam"" movie - which was no masterpiece, but at least it fared better than the 2021 movie.As I mentioned above, then it is the animated cartoon characters that carry the movie, no doubt about it. But even with the likes of Don Cheadle and Sonequa Martin-Green on the cast list, there wasn't much to do. Then there was LeBron James instead of Michael Jordan; and boy that was just horrible to witness because he was fully stripped of anything even remotely to an acting talent.""Space Jam: A New Legacy"" is a movie for the youngsters, pure and simple, and aside from being nice visually, then there was nothing much to behold here.I am rating ""Space Jam: A New Legacy"" a less than mediocre four out of ten stars.",Space Jam - A New Legacy
6,michaelRokeefe,Bow down to LeBron James,3,15 August 2021,"NBA Champ LeBron James goes on an epic adventure side by side with Bugs Bunny and a whole gang of undisciplined Looney Tune characters. It is a manic mashup of two worlds trying to show staid parents how to try and connect with their computer savvy kids. A basketball gem between LeBron and the cartoon characters against a heavy powered roster of pro ball players.Along with James appears, Jared Sullinger, Don Cheadle, Sonequa Martin-Green, Cedric Joe with announcer Ernie Johnson doing the play-by-play. Zendaya is the voice of Lola Bunny and Jeff Bergman voices Bugs Bunny and other cartoon characters.Is there a hidden agenda here to change attitudes and opinions of LeBron?",Space Jam - A New Legacy
7,sunwarrior13,Proves That LeBron Is Not Jordan Even Off The Court,1,15 July 2021,"After 25 years since Michael Jordan and the Looney Tunes appeared together in ""Space Jam"", another reboot or remake of the franchise was made in ""Space Jam: A New Legacy"". It stars LeBron James, who tries to chase Michael Jordan in the GOAT (Greatest Of All-Time) conversation, just proves once again that he is not him on and off the court especially with poor acting unlike Jordan,who was clearly having fun in his role in the original.It was apparent the comparisons will be made compared to the first movie released in 1996. While the digital and visual effects are a lot better, it proves once again that LeBron does not have the marketing appeal that Michael has. That is why you see a lot of ads(from LeBron and Warner Bros) implied on the film and focused on it rather on the story it has.Well, this movie was released to capitalize on both stars being the best of their respective generation's NBA players. Too bad that this movie proves once again that LeBron is not comparable to Michael even off the court.Take note,I am not even a Jordan fan. Wilt Chamberlain is the true G. O. A. T (Greatest Of All-Time) in NBA History. Hands down. Not LeBron nor Michael.",Space Jam - A New Legacy
8,studioAT,Space Jam: A New Legacy,4,28 October 2021,"Warner Brothers have been itching to do a sequel to 'Space Jam' for years, perhaps even more so since the following Looney Tunes film ('Back in Action') didn't really capture the publics imagination in the same way.So here we go, 'Space Jam 2', that pits LeBron James now against cartoon bad guys in a Basketball game for reasons far too complicated to go into here.The first film wasn't great, but it had a charm about it. This one instead goes for all out tech trickery and shoving lots of Warner Brother's IP's down our throats in the hope that something sticks. The less said about the new version of Lola Bunny the better too.It's fine, it's enjoyable enough, but certainly not memorable.",Space Jam - A New Legacy
9,CinemaSerf,Cutting room floor stuff that ought to have stayed there...,4,15 September 2021,"This has to be in the running for turkey of the year. It's such a shameless example of bad storytelling, bad acting, and product placement that they might as well just have given you a goodie bag as you (prematurely) left the cinema replete with your Warner Brothers tattoo. It's centres around the son of LeBron James being kidnapped by an evil AI. The only way he can be rescued is by LBJ and his new bestie ""Bugs Bunny"" putting together a team that can win a basketball game against team selected by the AI. That's about the height of it - there are no characterisations worthy of note amongst the humans, and though it is quite nice to see some of Warner's cartoon characters on a big screen again, any nostalgia that evokes is soon washed away by the sheer naffness of this whole enterprise. Quite whom this is for is anyone's guess - but it sure wasn't for me...",Space Jam - A New Legacy
10,neil-476,A misfire,6,23 July 2021,"Space Jam: A New LegacyBasketball wiz LeBron James is having problems with son Dom, who is more interested in computer games than basketball. On a trip to Warner Brothers, computerised mastermind Al G Rhythm sucks them all into the WB server to play Dom's computer game version of basketball.If you saw the original Space Jam then there are no huge surprises here. Let me start by saying that the animation - both traditional hand-drawn and CGI - is terrific, as is the integration with live and CGI backgrounds.LeBron James can't act and doesn't come across well as the fictional version of himself. It takes forever for the story to get going - I had a couple of small boys in front of me, hyper with excitement, and Mum took them out after half an hour because the film simply hadn't captured their attention at that point.I didn't dislike the film, but it did a Ready Player One with characters from various WB franchises and, during important sequences, I was concentrating on spotting characters in the audience for the game rather than concentrating on plot.",Space Jam - A New Legacy
11,Edvis-1997,4,4,22 July 2021,"Like really? So much advertisement and commercial put about this film, how's going to be great, even the name "" A new Legacy"" and everything for this? Really disappoited. It didn't bring anything new, whole concept looked really poor and average, the only part which was kind of nice that they've put whole DC Movies personages here, I liked this idea. But everything else, despite this, was hideous. If they didn't have idea how to create second part maybe it wasn't necessary? One of the worst movie of 2021 so far.",Space Jam - A New Legacy
12,Cineanalyst,"Brand You, Too, WarnerMedia",1,16 July 2021,"This may be the most patronizing, soulless corporate hackery passed off as a movie instead of the near-two-hours commercial that it is for WarnerMedia IPs and its product-placement partners I've ever seen, and I've seen the first ""Space Jam"" (1996), as well as Steven Spielberg's ""Ready Player One"" (2018) that this sequel crassly rips-off. I was under the impression that I subscribed to HBO Max for new movies--not for advertisements to subscribe to the streaming channel I'm already subscribed to. At least, the original ""Space Jam"" made some sense; it was about basketballer Michael Jordan playing basketball to win his right to be paid for his brand against a slave-capturing amusement park, Moron Mountain... I said it only made some sense. In the pretentiously-titled sequel threatening a franchise, ""A New Legacy,"" basketballer LeBron James plays a video game to win his right not to be digitized and turned into an obnoxious movie brand, but that's exactly what the real King James did in agreeing to do this obnoxious, digitized branding movie. Oxymoron Mountain.Besides Warners pretending to be against the very thing the fictional Warners is doing in its movie and what the real company did in making it--i.e. A faux indictment against what movie culture has become as brought to you by one of the biggest multinational conglomerates behind said culture--and James playing a character with more apparent character than his brand really has, we get the stupidest of father-son relationship dilemmas. Stop wasting time creating a game, son, and concentrate on playing this other game instead, and stop having fun, 'cause I'm the grumpy old man of throwing a ball through a hoop. All of it would be more tolerable, too, if the Looney Tunes were allowed to remain traditionally-animated cartoons instead of computer animations that are, then, turned into even-uglier computer animations. Or if weren't so cloying. Or overly hyperactive even for Looney Tunes. Cartoon basketball was bad enough, but overwrought video-game cartoon basketball as observed by every IP in WarnerMedia's vault--and that move as convincingly as the generic fans in an NBA 2K video game--manages to be so much worse.Even if a joke here or there is almost funny, it doesn't matter. (The best may be the Michael Jordan cameo, which I saw coming, but still wasn't bad. Most of them, though, involve more branding, such as cartoon James's fall creating a hole in Looney Tunes land the shape of the Nike swoosh logo, or his attempts to recruit DC superheroes, which are also owned by Warner.) That's because the entire thing is so ugly, hackneyed and ultimately insulting to the intelligence of the viewer-customer that it cannot be redeemed. A movie must have some underlying value--it needs a soul, to be forgiven. This one doesn't.",Space Jam - A New Legacy
13,westsideschl,WB,3,19 October 2021,"Well, good thinking on WB Studio using only in-house supporting characters (Bugs, Daffy, Elmer, Road, Sylvester, etc.) - saves a lot of money.Not sure that I like the message of ""Be the best basketball player ... focus on the game of basketball & not (tech) distractions."" The problem is that the odds of making a life long living from bball is statistically very much lower than being tech comfortable (e.g. Programming; repair; innovation; application). And, likely to be less serving/helping to humanity & the Earth.",Space Jam - A New Legacy
14,UniqueParticle,Dog water with some average entertainment,5,30 July 2021,I understand the hate Labron James can't act he should stick to basketball; even Micheal Jordan did better in the original without much acting! One of very few aspects I enjoyed was the references to other movies and the toons did great. I yawned even though I got plenty of sleep although glad I saw in theater. I rarely not enjoy movies but this adaptation was pretty bad even in the original the young version of Micheal played basketball really well.,Space Jam - A New Legacy

16,briancham1994,What a mess,5,23 October 2021,"I'm amazed at how so much happens in this film and yet nothing really happens at all. There's a decent if pointed set-up where LeBron James wants his son to pursue basketball but his real talents lie in video game development. The execution of this story is a strangely contrived adventure where the antagonist traps both LeBron and his son in a virtual world for very thinly defined reasons. That's the main problem of this film - the character motivations and plot conflicts seem very thin, as if the screenplay were unfinished. For example, the backstory of the Looney Tunes characters leaving their world for other movie worlds was badly explained and I was still wondering why they were scattered and why they decided to come back. The skits on the other movie worlds were neat individually, but they didn't add up to much. The thin plotting and aimless animated sketches are a flaw shared by this film's predecessor, despite what the nostalgists may claim, but this time it's too chaotic to be fun and the plot was muddled up.",Space Jam - A New Legacy
17,Thanos_Alfie,Average...,5,26 August 2021,"""Space Jam: A New Legacy"" is an Animation - Comedy movie in which we watch a new version of ""Space Jam"" of 1996. Instead of Michael Jordan there is LeBron James who has to work together with Bugs Bunny and the Looney Tunes to win a basketball match and not letting artificial intelligence achieve its goal.Since I had already watched the first movie of ""Space Jam"" I knew what to expect from this new version of it. The direction which was made by Malcolm D. Lee was average without achieving to intrigued audience and make them feel that they are also a part of this movie following his main characters. The interpretations of LeBron James who played as himself, Don Cheadle who played as Al G. Rhythm and Cedric Joe who played as Dom James were good and their combination worked pretty good. To sum up, I have to say that ""Space Jam: A New Legacy"" is an average comedy movie and I advise you to lower your standards if you want to watch it otherwise you will be disappointed.",Space Jam - A New Legacy
18,cruise01,"Colorful, fun, and a bit hallow as a movie.",6,20 July 2021,3 out of 5 stars.I loved the first Space Jam film which took Michael Jordan into a looney toon world to play ball. This film modernizes with the digital world of warner bros studios. Taking Lebron James into the digital world. Where he meets looney toons. And in order to get his son back. Which they had a conflict which Lebron always wanted his son to play ball but he is obsessed with making video games. Lebron James would have to form a team to play ball against a digitalized characters that would break the rules against basketball.Decent story about father and son. And a theme about doing what makes you happy. Lebron James is a fun addition. The visual effects and animations is great. Especially when it digitizes the toon characters. It is colorful. Fun. And it has a lot of cameos of warner bros characters.Acting was okay. Don Cheadle playing a villain was eh. The direction does get forgettable. And feels hallow when it comes to anything else. Like it feels like a one time view kind of movie. Until your bored with the humor.,Space Jam - A New Legacy
19,zkonedog,Captures None Of The Fun Or Magic Of The Original,3,18 July 2021,"In 1996, the original Space Jam ""had something"", so to speak. Seeing Michael Jordan on the big screen interacting with the Looney Tunes was a first-of-its-kind sort of experience, and despite the ridiculous concept it worked perfectly. Sadly, this long-await sequel captures absolutely none of that magic or fun.For a very basic overview, Space Jam: A New Legacy sees Warner Brother's sentient artificial intelligence Al G. Rhythm (Don Cheadle) hatch a plan inside the ""server-verse"" to finally get the recognition he feels he deserves. Central to that mission? Abducting LeBron James and family to play in a high-stakes basketball game that pits father against son. Along the way, James must root out the old Looney gang for the epic court contest.I will readily admit that nostalgia for the original got me into the theater to see this sequel. Absolutely no doubt about that. However, I will not concede that the same nostalgia is preventing me from giving this one a better rating than 3/10. ""A New Legacy"" is just a bad movie, plain and simple, for numerous reasons...-Whereas Michael Jordan just had to show up and be himself in the original, here LeBron James is given the emotional heavy-lifting tasks. Predictably, it does not go well. He cannot believably convey a single emotion.-A lot of people are criticizing the decision to showcase so many WB properties (Harry Potter, Superman, Batman, Matrix, Game of Thrones, etc.) in this film. That didn't so much bother me, and I actually enjoyed the concept of a tongue-in-cheek poking fun at those topics. But it all comes crashing down when the finished product looks suspiciously like an algorithm-created property that the plot was trying to skewer!-The ""Looney Tunes playing basketball"" concept is no longer new (by virtue of the '96 effort), and nothing is done to spruce that avenue up whatsoever. Same old gags just replayed again. Also, the way we interact with athletes is so different now that James simply cannot command the cultural cache that MJ once did. Just having him physically present isn't enough like it may have been in the mid-90s.Overall, ""Space Jam: A New Legacy"" is a clunker, no two ways around it. It isn't the worst film I've ever seen (it got me to chuckle a few times), but it is almost completely devoid of any real emotion or fun, in stark contrast to its predecessor that is still considered one of the most fun films ever made.",Space Jam - A New Legacy
20,eddie_baggins,Obsession with pop-culture overrides everything else in this forgettable adventure,4,12 July 2021,"There wouldn't be many proclaiming from the rooftops that 1996's Michael Jordan/Loony Tunes starring Space Jam is a cinematic masterpiece, but there was an undeniable and energetic charm to that real life/animated hybrid that ensured it became not only a box office hit, but a beloved childhood favourite for many children of the 90's.Operating at the peak of his world dominating powers, Jordan made for a fun leading man in the chaotic toon filled basketball filled escapade and established his legacy as a once in a lifetime athlete and pop culture phenomenon but wanting to prove his metal as a claim to the throne of the true GOAT of the NBA world, Lakers superstar LeBron James spearheads this modern day take on the Space Jam brand with A New Legacy, a likely box office beast that sadly lacks any of the charm or spark of the original, as you can't help but feel as though Malcolm D. Lee's film is nothing but a James love-fest moulded in with a dream Warner Brothers marketing department idea that is going to make some serious money for the company over the coming months/years.To be fair, A New Legacy isn't a complete write-off, upon initially hearing about another Space Jam taking shape under the guidance of James and Black Panther director Ryan Coogler's hand as a producer, one would've been sane enough thinking things could only turn out very badly for all involved but Lee's film isn't bereft of decent ideas and fun moments that come and go through its close to two hour run-time and there's a nostalgic joy getting to once more see the Loony Tunes gang get a moment in the spotlight but thanks to James's atrocious acting skills, a big collection of flat jokes and an incessant push from the film to cram in as pop culture references as it can allow, A New Legacy is more often than not a chore to sit through and one that potentially will bore its young audience rather than capture the imaginations of them.Seemingly taking inspiration from Ready Player One's rulebook, once James gets sucked into a computer-verse run by Don Cheadle's delusional A. I Al G. Rhythm and forced to compete in a world changing Basketball match against his own son whilst reuniting a disbanded group of Loony Tunes members, there's an obsession with A New Legacy to throw everything at as from a cameo point of view with everyone from the Joker, Mad Max and Harry Potter getting a run (or strangely enough for a kids film Austin Powers or A Clockwork Orange) and when the film resorts to scenes such as Porky Pig in a rap battle or James and Bugs Bunny going into the Matrix you really do start to wonder what the film is trying to do or who its trying to do it for?Thankfully for us and for James's reputation he ends up spending half of the film in animated form, saving us from more high school level of acting talents that would've further dampened A New Legacy's struggle to find itself and stand on its own two legs, as it ends up feeling like nothing more than a reminder to us all that James is the greatest athlete on the planet (did you know?) and that you should probably buy some his or Warner Brothers merchandise if you haven't already.Final Say -Saved by a few imaginative scenes and a welcome return from the Loony Tunes gang, Space Jam: A New Legacy suffers badly from Jame's poor screen presence/acting ability and an inability to find its own identity amongst its endless procession of nods and winks to other properties and brand names.2 cases of mistaken identity out of 5.",Space Jam - A New Legacy
21,digitalbeachbum,Ci tiu filmo estas tuta acajo,1,20 July 2021,"I watched the movie the first time and thought it was poorly written. I didn't care for the disjointed storyline, the logic of the script, the idea behind Warner Bros having a super computer with AI that could do anything like scanning a person and teleporting them in to digital format (TRON?)I watched the movie a second time to give it a second chance but it was still poorly written, but even more of the flaws came out. I realized it was one giant advertising scheme for Warner Bros. They pushed their entire catalog. (Ready Player One?)I watched it a third time, this round I had my family with me. No one could stay interested. The writing was still terrible. The plot was ridiculous and lacked continuity. The plot sucked. The movie was like one giant commercial. LeBron was terrible. This was basically one giant reboot of the original movie with some minor changes.It was so bad the third time that everyone decided to put their faces in to YouTube, Pinterest or Facebook. No one was interested, even the kids. We ended up turning it off.I don't dislike (I didn't care for the Cleveland to Miami act) LeBron but the guy can't act. He's a ball player, like he said, and movies aren't his thing. Michael Jordan was better. He was believable. LeBron is like a lifeless, dull, sap. He couldn't convey emotion if you pumped four million volts through him.I liked the cartoon bit, but when they converted to CG, that was a downer. I didn't care for it.The movie also lacked a good soundtrack. I guess it is a timing issue. The original Space Jam had some amazing tunes at that period. Fly Like An Eagle, The Winner, Space Jam, I Believe I Can Fly. None of the tunes from this movie will beat I Believe I Can Fly.Yeah, I dislike this movie, but not Lebron. I didn't care for LeBron's ego. This movie was all Lebron's ego. The guy thinks he is Jordan, but he isn't. Stop trying to copy Jordan. Go do something original.",Space Jam - A New Legacy

LeBron is the sports figure here-Michael Jordan was in the original-that gets roped into the cyber world of an artificial intelligence bad guy played by Don. Cedric plays LeBron's son, who gets kidnapped by Don to force LeBron to play a game of basketball in the serververse-kind of like in the Matrix. LeBron's wife is played by Sonequa. LeBron enlists the Looney Toons characters-Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck, etc,-to help him win and try to rescue his son. The effects are good and there are lots of cameos-mostly in the crowd scenes-to keep an eye out for, both real and animated. The cameos range from sports figures to Warner Bros. Properties and even other sources. I remember seeing King Kong, Batman & Robin, It, Game of Throne characters, Harry Potter characters, The Wizard of Oz characters....well, you get the drift. During the end credits, there are photos of the toons and real people-such as Porky Pig fighting Ronda Rousey-but nothing at the very end, except the signature line is heard, 'That's All, Folks!'.It's rated ""PG"" for cartoon violence and language and has a running time of 1 hour & 55 minutes.If you have little ones, it would be a good one for the family.

Your morning commute never goes well when your toast is spread with traffic jam. So there is little surprise that SPACE JAM: A NEW LEGACY could just as easily be titled SPICE JAM: STEWED LEPROSY. As the latter heading suggests, SPACE JAM trashes everything that it touches, from CASABLANCA and KING KONG to Bugs, Daffy and Yosemite Sam.

28,kevin_robbins,People who complain about this film forget the first Space Jam wasn't good either.,5,18 July 2021,"Space Jam: A New Legacy (2021) is a movie we recently saw in theatres two days ago. The storyline follows LeBron James who wants his son to be a basketball player while his son is more interested in designing and building video games. When WB approaches LeBron about a new campaign, which was designed by their own Artificial Intelligence (AI), LeBron hates the idea and turns it down, upsetting the AI. The AI decides to kidnap his son and only allows him to return home if Bron can beat the AI at a game of basketball. Bron will be given his team of toons to work with while the AI forms his own goon squad. This movie is directed by Malcolm D. Lee (The Best Man) and stars LeBron James, Don Cheadle (Crash), Sarah Silverman (School of Rock), Steven Yeun (Walking Dead) and Lil Rel Howery (Get Out). The storyline for the holistic movie is nothing special, but the toon characters are awesome and their introductions into the film was magnificent (the best segments of either film are in this picture - the Matrix and Mad Max sequences are legendary). I loved the background characters at the game and loved how Disney showed they do more than cartoons and super heroes (The Nun, It, Gremlins, etc). The animation for this film was excellent and superior to the first film (as you'd expect). Overall, this was a lot of fun for the family and a hair below the original. People who complain about this film forget the first Space Jam wasn't good either. I'd score this a 5/10 and recommend taking your kids to see it.",Space Jam - A New Legacy
29,alindsay-al,A Poor Sad Sequel,3,29 July 2021,"When I was younger I used to watch the Looney Tunes and I loved and the original Space Jam is a guilty pleasure film for me so I had a tiny bit of excitement for the sequel New Legacy and I had the chance to watch it today and here is my review for it. The premise of the film sees Lebron James sucked into an artificial world where he must unite the Toon Squad to win a game of Basketball.Main Character
As mentioned above, Lebron James plays himself as the lead character and he seems like a pretty charismatic guy in real life but that is not the case here. He is so boring to watch here, and for the majority of the film he is just reacting to what is going on with the whole world. The film forces him to deliver some emotional scenes and he just can't do it and it really makes the film fall flat.Supporting Characters
Don Cheadle plays the bad guy in the film and he just looks like he is having a really fun time with the role, this is no great villain performance but he is possibly the most entertaining part of the film and that has to count for something. Onto the toons and they are pretty entertaining, the old classics are there by Buggs Bunny, Wile Coyote and Foghorn Leghorn and memories of my childhood came back. But they also get put into the background for Lebron, I never really got Zendaya voicing Lola Bunny and guys like Semmity Sam and Daffy Duck have little to do and the biggest negative is giving my favourite character Marvin Martian barely anything to do. I didn't really care for Lebron's onscreen son and Sonequa Martin-Green is really wasted as Lebron's wife.Story
The story offers very little. The whole theme of fatherhood is let down by weak performances and a weak dramatic script. The first film had the looney tunes in the forefront but here they feel like afterthoughts, in favour for Warner Bros very clear poor marketing and they try to cram all these franchises that they own in order to try and convince you to watch them. This is despite the demographic of young kids will have no idea what half of these franchises even are.Script
The script does have a few chuckle worthy moments and although I complained about the obvious marketing ploy, a lot of the cameos were quite funny to me as a big film fan. But the drama really isn't there and a good chunk of the comedy feels like it should have been left in the prime days of the tunes.Style
The animation for this film is pretty great, it looks exactly like it should for the majority, until it goes to more CGI instead of animation and it becomes a bit strange. Also this film felt really long, the last basketball game itself feels like an hour long and I shouldn't be feeling like that in a family friendly film with Looney Tunes characters.Overall
Overall, Space Jam: New Legacy is a bad film. It will have some people who grew up with The Looney Tunes and the original film but they will not like it and kids shouldn't be bought up watching this garbage of a film cause it has some nice visuals.",Space Jam - A New Legacy

What leads up to this disagreement is LeBron's insistence that his boy attend a basketball camp (while the tyke wants to go to some E3 gamer conference) as they're summoned to the Warner Bros. Studios lot to hear a pitch developed by Cheadle's algorithm. Dismissing the idea as absurd, Cheadle decides to take advantage of the son's already obvious friction w/his pere to lure him into his world (sort of a matrix vision of the computer's NeuroNet). LeBron follows suit but needs to reunite the toons (already disbanded by Cheadle's program to points unknown) so he recruits Bugs Bunny to collect his cohorts for the final game which is populated by many a Warner Bros. Property (King Kong, The Iron Giant, The Herculoids, Space Ghost, et al) but also humans who will forfeit their lives if LB's team loses. Not really my cup of tea (it wasn't my cup of tea back in 1996 & I didn't come out for the Brendan Fraser/Jenna Elfman starrer Looney Toons: Back in Action either) but just as a matter of being that guy who needs to see what the fuss is all about, it's a box I just checked off but bottom line the final product isn't offensive or nausea inducing but as a product of studio synergy, it gets the job done & people plugged into the material (whether because of nostalgia for the first film) will find the same happy place here for them to prop up their feet & let their eyeballs absorb the colors.",Space Jam - A New Legacy

The story makes no sense and doesn't even follow it's own premise all that well. The turn the tunes into 3D characters which feels like a mistake.

34,aidanratesmovies,"I wanted to give it the benefit of the doubt, but ultimately its exactly what you would expect",4,16 July 2021,"A somewhat fine film overrun with commercialism and forced antics in an attempt to remain relevant- Space Jam A New Legacy could have easily been something special, but instead- its just rather lazy. Lebron James steps in to take over the basketball all-star role this time around, and he's honestly pretty corny, but fine all in all. James 'character' in the film is just so thinly written to make way for the film story, ultimately weighing down what could have been another fun adventure with a different star. James is hardly the films biggest problem though, and out of all of it, I oddly have to name Don Cheadle as the worst thing about this film. Not only is his character a poorly written and constructed device (that's also kinda a perfect metaphor for Warner Bros oddly) but his over the top performance and wooden delivery make for honestly one of the worst villains i've ever seen on screen. The film is thankfully entertaining, although it can be kinda cringeworthy to watch at times. They try really hard to appeal to the kids of this generation, and it is so incredibly forced that it can honestly be quite hard to watch. I enjoyed seeing all my favorite tunes again, but the CGI overkill in the second half of the film is a bit too much to bare- and honestly just feels like one huge commercial. Yes, there are commercial elements in the films first half, but I felt like it still had some heart and tue humor to it- it wasn't trying too hard or shoving products in our face. In the end, the film had a few funny moments, and didn't bore me (as some may say it did) but it's far too shallow to be a decent film- and far too forced to gain any sympathy.My Rating: 4.4/10.",Space Jam - A New Legacy

This comedy combines live action with animation and is filled with life lessons, funny catch phrases, loads of glitzy digital effects and a glimpse of Warner Bros. Cinematic library.When LeBron James and his son, Dom (Cedric Joe) get mysteriously sucked into the Warner Bros. Digital world by a rogue AI supervillain (Don Cheadle), nonsense and chaos ensue. Dom is kidnapped and LeBron is challenged to a high-stakes basketball game by the evil AI. Lebron must form the most winning team to get his son back and, a loss could leave him and all those he loves, stuck in the server-verse forever. Lebron and his Looney Tunes pal Bugs Bunny meet up for a wild adventure through the server-verse. Will he win, or be trapped there forever? Watch to find out.The writing is clever. It is comedic and zany at some points; at others, it is very wholesome and realistic. The animation is outstanding! The movie combines traditional animation with three-dimensional computer graphics and live action. LeBron's cartoon character is spot on. The tour through the server-verse is so enjoyable. Seeing iconic characters like Yogi Bear, Pennywise, Iron Giant and King Kong is every movie junkie's dream! Eric Bauza plays a very important role in this movie as he voices Daffy Duck, Foghorn Leghorn, Elmer Fudd, Marvin the Martian and Porky Pig. Jeff Bergman is also instrumental in this film as he voices Bugs Bunny, Sylvester and Yosemite Sam. Both Eric and Jeff voice their characters so well that it's like listening to the original cartoons! Space Jam: New Legacy also features Don Cheadle, who is the rogue AI AL. G. Rhythm. His villainous role features a wide range of emotion and I give him two thumbs up for his outstanding performance. My favorite character is Granny because she is a good-natured, protective, spunky old woman that has some epic moves.The messages of this movie are that family is everything and there is power in chasing your dreams. Sometimes, we need some loony things in our life to make it better. There is mild language and a lot of action.I give Space Jam: A New Legacy 5 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 7 to 18, plus adults. It's a great family movie. Fans of the original will love this, too. This movie releases July 16, 2021 in theaters and on HBO Max.Reviewed by Katherine S., KIDS FIRST!",Space Jam - A New Legacy

Rhythm kidnaps Dom into what he calls the serververse; and the only way LeBron can save his son (along with thousands of other people/characters) is to play a game of basketball. Not any game of basketball though. The upgraded version created by his own son. To add to the craziness LeBron is forced to team up with the looney tunes to take on Dom himself alongside upgraded versions of professional basketball stars.Audiences who are fans and familiar with the various Warner Brothers intellectual properties would be delighted to see many of the characters they have watched before get a cameo in this film. There are literally too many of them to mention. There are definitely funny parts in the movie. The Looney Tunes cast certainly were one of those who delivered the comedic parts. Don Cheadle also had many comic parts as well. He actually fit in the role of a comedic villain. His character sucked, but you could at least see Cheadle was having fun making the film. From hybrid animation to computer graphics. The transformation of the Looney Tunes cast into 3D CGI was done well. The story was definitely supposed to be a hit. But what made it uninteresting was a combination of uneven pacing and rushed editing. The film ran for about two hours and yet it seemed like a rush of clips tied together to form the film. There were scenes that jumped from one point to the next without any context whatsoever. The film also seemed to serve as one long commercial showcase the various intellectual properties of Warner Brothers. It was great to see many of them on the same screen, but their cameos were a little off considering they were just there.Overall, Space Jam: A New Legacy might definitely please younger audiences because of its visuals and bright colors.

40,Pumpkin_Man,"As a 90's Kid, I Thoroughly Enjoyed This Movie!!!",10,18 July 2021,"I was 6 years old when the original Space Jam came out. It's always been one of my childhood favorites. I never imagined that after 25 years, they'd actually make a sequel to it, and now that it's here; it really isn't all that bad. No way will it ever be as nostalgic as the original, but if you're a fan of the original, and love cinema, especially films and television shows made by Warner Bros. Then you're in for quite a surprise. There are many nods, pop culture references and Easter eggs to great franchises such as Harry Potter, Game of Thrones, Mad Max, The Matrix, Casablanca, The Wizard of Oz, King Kong, The Iron Giant, Rick and Morty, the DC Universe and much more.LeBron James stars as a fictionalized version of himself. (I feel weird for saying this, but LeBron showed more emotion than Michael Jordan did in the original. MJ seemed wooden and had hardly any emotion when he met the Looney Tunes. LeBron was legit excited to meet Bugs Bunny and treated him like a buddy.) At a young age, LeBron was taught that basketball is all work and no play.Fast forward to present day, he wants his children to follow in his footsteps, but his son, Dominic ""Dom"" wants to create video games. One day, LeBron and his family are invited to the Warner Bros. To discuss a movie deal, but when he and his son get into an argument, an evil computer A. I. named Al-G Rhythm abducts them and forces LeBron to play a high stakes basketball game against video game characters that his son created. Al-G gives LeBron 24 hours to put together a team, so he's sent to Looney Tune World and teams up with Bugs Bunny to put together the ultimate team. LeBron wants big powerful characters like Superman, King Kong and the Iron Giant, but Bugs just wants to get his ol' tune pals back together.This becomes one of the best scenes in the movie. LeBron, and Bugs visit other Warner Bros. Produced films to find all the remaining Looney Tunes. I won't spoil all the surprises. If LeBron and his team loses, then Al-G will take his son prisoner and abduct anyone who is livestreaming it on their cell phone. Welcome to the jam!If you grew up with the original, I implore you to give this new one a try. I was skeptical for awhile, but when I finally saw it, I really enjoyed it and I felt like a kid again.

41,lambiepie-2,Well...Basketball was in It,5,19 July 2021,"In watching this film, I got a ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"" kinda vibe with Warner Brothers properties all over it. Now to be honest, I didn't watch the first one, but I didn't think that mattered. The idea was simple - a kid who didn't want to be like famous dad whose dad wanted him to be like famous dad. But it's 2020..or so and tech is big so he wants to be a tech designer. So that makes him ripe to convince that he should join that side because his famous dad doesn't care, etc.Okay, so with this when they get through the 'toon-town' thing and to the big basketball game, there is TON of HBOmax and Warner Brothers & their acquired properties in the audience and to be honest, I spent my time identifying them. ""Oooh, there's Frankenstein Jr!!!"" while those very young ones 6 to 10 years old and a few adults watching the movie with me were asking, ""What or who is Frankenstein Jr.?"" ...of which was the same kinda thing when I watched ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"" and I asked some adults ""Who is Betty Boop?"" It's that kinda film.Be prepared - all the 'cancel culture' broo-ha-ha is not there. It's just a Warner Brothers cartoon film for kids and those who like basketball, and a B-I-G promotion fest for the adults who catch onto it all. I ranked it higher than most reviews placed here because I liked the seeing the cartoons, and putting the live and cartoon properties in the audience of the big game.",Space Jam - A New Legacy

In contrast to 'Space Jam' (1996), which successfully integrates Michael Jordan with Looney Tunes cartoon characters, the screenplay for 'Space Jam: A New Legacy' frequently ignores the presence of Bugs Bunny and his companions. These animated figures are just referenced in passing and never play a significant role in the storyline of the film.",Space Jam - A New Legacy
46,kjproulx,Basically a Remake of a Film that Wasn't Great to Begin with,4,29 July 2021,"I'll be honest right off the bat and say that I've only seen the original Space Jam a total of two times. I find it to be mildly enjoyable, but it wasn't a film I ever latched onto. The nostalgia of the 90s is all over it and that's what makes it entertaining to this day, but I still don't think it's great. When I heard they would be making a very loose sequel and Lebron James wasn't going to be filling the shoes that Michael Jordan left, I was intrigued. With the technology today, this concept could be big and fun. Well, Space Jam: A New Legacy definitely had its moments, but it's ultimately just the same concept all over again. Here's why, unless you're showing it to your kids, it's really not that special.Here's the premise in a nutshell. Lebron James is having issues connecting with his son Dom and has nothing in mind for him but that he wants to make him a basketball star just like himself. After stumbling across a room on the Warner Bros. Lot, Lebron and his son are sucked into what the film calls the ""server-verse"". This is where all the worlds from the movies Warner Bros. Have ever made all exist. Being sent to the land of Looney Tunes by Al G. Rhythm, who runs the so-called ""server-verse"" and has challenged Lebron to a basketball game in exchange for his freedom, comes across Bugs Bunny. Bugs then helps Lebron assemble the rest of the ""Tune Squad"" and the second half of the movie is basically the basketball game.Other than some incredibly impressive visuals and a fun soundtrack, there really isn't much substance here. It's really just a story of a father winning the love back from his son. For that, this film is not that engaging and the screenplay is very, very standard as well. The final act of the film goes on way too long and it just felt like a massive commercial for Warner Bros. As a company. At least all their famous movies are good and have memorable characters, right?As far as the positives go, Don Cheadle as Al G. Rhythm completely held the movie together for me. His over-the-top and campy performance made me smile and he's in a lot more of the movie than I expected. I also really enjoyed the portion of the film where Lebron became a cartoon character with the rest of the Looney Tunes. That aspect was not a part of the original film and I found that to be a very nice addition. Other than that though, Space Jam: A New Legacy really doesn't have anything that suggests it needed to be made.In the end, the life lessons for kids throughout this film have all been done better in other family films. The aspect of meshing Looney Tunes with live-action Basketball still kind of has its charm, but again, the movie just feels like a giant corporate commercial. Lebron James is fine in the movie because he's in his element, but he's not the best actor overall. I smiled a few times and loved a cameo that occurs in the latter half of the film, but it wasn't enough to warrant a recommendation from me. It's just not that good of a movie. If you're a fan of the original, I'm sure you'll find moments to enjoy here, but it ultimately feels like a tired premise when looking back.",Space Jam - A New Legacy
47,DarthVoorhees,It doesn't know what it's appeal is...,3,28 July 2021,"The original 'Space Jam' wasn't a good movie at all but it benefits from being the time capsule movie of the 90's. The color palette, the pop culture references, the product placements and Jordan cement it as a classic, an undeserved classic but a classic nonetheless. 'Space Jam: A New Legacy' pretends the original never existed, a fatal flaw. The prime selling point of the picture is nostalgia. It doesn't do LeBron James any favors pretending that he isn't in the shadow of Michael Jordan. It's debatable who the better basketball star is but 'Space Jam' is Jordan's.We live in a nostalgic age. We're constantly revisiting 90's IPs and I don't have a problem with that. The only thing relevant to the original is the title. It's a shame too because I think a lot of humor could have been generated by being Meta about the comparisons between James and Jordan and why there needed to be a new 'Space Jam'.LeBron James is the star of the film. I know that he is reviled as much as he is loved and brings a lot of baggage with him. I think a lot of the hate he has received is totally unfounded but 'Space Jam' too isn't going to help his reputation. Jordan wasn't Brando but he looks like it in comparison to James who is awkward and wooden. It doesn't help that the moral of the story about being yourself is so heavy handed and LeBron doesn't stop hammering it in. I'm sure this isn't the case but he looks like an egotist because there is no selfparody or sense of humor to his performance. He spends a great deal of his screen time lecturing the Looney Tunes. I'm sorry but not only is this going to strike out with the millennial but the kids are going to hate it too.The set up to the ball game is overly complicated and Don Cheadle's villain is given no reason to hate James or exist. We just see Warner products everywhere. I don't mind this in theory as a few of the film's only laughs come from revisiting these properties. They don't join the game or comment on it though. They just are there for you to pause it and gawk at them.They needed to bring back Jordan. The movie doesn't work without him. It could have been the perfect opportunity for the two NBA legends to celebrate both their achievements and show they had a sense of humor. Instead this is probably LeBron's biggest disaster since 'The Decision' while Jordan's legend grows with 'The Last Dance'",Space Jam - A New Legacy

51,mfellipecampos,Good,7,28 August 2021,"It is full of reference to the Warner universe and from the beginning makes it clear to the public, that is, a self-promotion for the studio and King, that being said, any attempt to speak ill of these aspects is unfounded, it is made for it , which is very honest. However, it lacks a lot in the story, it is shallow despite surprising in its references to The Matrix, It a Thing, Harry Potter, King Kong, Rick and Morty, Game of Thrones, Superman, Wonder Woman and the rest of the Justice League, brings excitement for that aspect.The shared universe is well done, both in animation and in CGI. Warner wanted to show its potential and got it, of course it's not a 10, but it's good. Unfortunately there are flaws in the plot, for example: spoiler: it doesn't explain the real reason why Bugs' friends leave his world and in the end decide to come back.It's not focused to be a sequel, even though it has a mention of the previous movie, it's just similar (that doesn't make the movie bad).When I went to see it I thought it would be a cheap copy of the old one, I had low expectations and didn't expect much, however, it has its original aspects, a different feel and new pop culture reference, it's not the Looneys that need help anymore, but the LeBron James.The acting was relatively good, but Don Cheadle left something to be desired because of his character without depth, a classic villain, where, it has no sense for what he does, nothing interesting, they could have at least given a little sense to value the actor. .It surpassed my expectations, but not really a grandiose one (nor is it its goal), but just a fun movie that implements good references, great to watch with the family.Film viewed from the 27th to the 28th of August 2021.",Space Jam - A New Legacy

53,MrDHWong,Shamelessly rehashes the original film and makes a poor attempt to appeal to all audiences,4,17 July 2021,"""Space Jam: A New Legacy"" is a standalone sequel to the 1996 animation/basketball themed film ""Space Jam"". Starring NBA player LeBron James in the lead role alongside Don Cheadle, it shamelessly rehashes the original film and makes a poor attempt to appeal to all audiences.In Burbank, California, NBA superstar LeBron James and his son Dom (Cedric Joe) are sucked into a virtual world by Warner Bros.' high-tech A. I. program Al-G Rhythm (Don Cheadle). Taking Dom prisoner, Al-G promises to return him if LeBron is able to assemble a basketball team consisting of Warner Bros. Characters and beat him in a match against his own set of players. LeBron hastily agrees and is sent off flying into the virtual universe where he lands in ""Tune World"", meeting with a solitary Bugs Bunny. LeBron informs the famous cartoon rabbit of his predicament and they both agree to recruit the rest of the Looney Tunes to form their own unique basketball team to defeat Al-G once and for all.I suppose it's just my own morbid curiosity but I have a habit of greatly anticipating sequels to films that have been in development for an extended period of time. They can be worth the wait, like ""Blade Runner 2049"", which added so much more to its already established lore, or a complete disappointment, like ""Independence Day: Resurgence"", which was little more than a cash-grab rehash. ""Space Jam: A New Legacy"", or as I'm calling it, ""Ready Player LeBron"" is the latter example, doing what the original did that made it something of a cult favourite amongst 90s kids but simply applying to it a deceptive new paint job.I'm not going to act like the 1996 film was perfect, as watching it back today made me realise how badly it has aged. It was basically just a giant ad filled with Nike shoes, McDonald's Fries, and bottles of Gatorade. It also doesn't help that the now disgraced R. Kelly sang the film's theme song. With that said, it was still an amusing concept for the time, and besides, ads can still be fun to watch if they are marketed correctly. This follow-up, which comes to us a quarter of a century later, is also a giant ad, albeit, in a different sense of the word. Instead of consumer items, here we are being advertised various different IPs (Intellectual Properties) belonging to Warner Bros. Such as Harry Potter, the DC Universe, Game Of Thrones, and even The Matrix. Oh, and the Looney Tunes are in there as well in case you didn't notice by now. Normally I would love to see all of these IPs crossing over but here it's handled so poorly that I ended up dreading seeing all these different universes merging. This is because there's no sense of organisation with combining everything together, it is all carelessly thrown in there as a means for Warner Bros. To show off how many of these IPs they own the rights to. In other words, the company appears more preoccupied with being dominant over what its audience should enjoy rather than merely wishing to entertain us with some of its characters.The film is at least decent to look at, with state-of-the-art CGI effects that do a serviceable job of combining 2D cartoons with 3D environments. However, the parts I liked best were the ones where an animated LeBron James was in Tune World interacting with Bugs Bunny and the others. It's so rare to see traditionally hand-drawn animation these days, or at least a style that replicates it efficiently, so I guess that's why scenes like these stood out to me the most. That's not to say the 3D animated Looney Tunes looked terrible, although they did look a bit creepy at times, I'm just more of a fan of old school animation and the charm that comes with it.Additionally, I can't tell if it's the lazy script or bad comic timing but the film just isn't that funny. Considering the Looney Tunes are supposed to be some of the funniest cartoon characters of all time, it's a huge shame to see all their antics fall flat here. Taking the place of the slapstick humour we are used to are dated Matrix parodies, which haven't been relevant in over twenty years, and Porky Pig rapping, calling himself ""The Notorious P. I. G."". Of course, I am aware this film's target audience is young children but how many of them are actually going to understand any of these references? Surely the filmmakers can't expect to have their parents explain every single pop culture joke to them? In total, I think there were only two parts of the entire movie I found amusing, one was a reference to a certain meme of Bugs Bunny impersonating Elmer Fudd and the other alluding to why Michael Jordan declined to return to make this sequel. The reason I am not elaborating further is because in the event that a parent who is reading this ends up dragged along to watch the film with their kid and wants something to laugh at won't have it spoiled for them.Although he's obviously not an actor by trade, I think LeBron James was able to hold his own throughout the film. I don't follow basketball so I'm not sure what type of person James is off court but here he seems like a sincere person at heart who cares about other people. His acting is surprisingly better than I expected too, which gives the impression he must have taken some lessons in order to effectively play this fictionalised version of himself. As for Don Cheadle, his character is just a generic cartoonish villain wanting nothing more than for an excuse to show off his excess power (sounds a lot like Warner Bros. Itself if you ask me). He only exists to set up the big basketball match at the end, never really feeling as though he is huge threat in the long run. Though to Cheadle's credit, he at least looks like he's having fun playing the role.In the end, ""Ready Player LeBron"", sorry, I mean ""Space Jam: A New Legacy"", was not worth waiting the extensive twenty-five years it took to get made. It does exactly what a sequel shouldn't do in rehashing the entire basic plot structure of the original while trying to pass itself off as something completely new. Upon some research, there were apparently some spin-offs considered in place of this film such as skateboarding with Tony Hawk or golfing with Tiger Woods. Those would have been much better ideas than what we got here so if there's another follow-up in the future, let's hope they follow that format instead.I rate it 4/10.",Space Jam - A New Legacy
54,elicopperman,Exactly What You'd Expect,5,19 July 2021,"25 years following one of the most polarizing cult classic sport movies from the 90s, Space Jam, Warner Bros has finally released its long awaited sequel. Directed by Malcolm D. Lee and Terence Nance and starring NBA all star Lebron James alongside the Looney Tunes gang, the film has been garnishing countless attention from former fans of the first movie and the general public alike. As of now, it's been going rather smoothly at the box office and on HBO Max, despite not being met with the nicest critical reception. So as a non fan of the first film, let's see how this followup has been presented in 2021.The main plot centers around a fictionalized LeBron James teaming up with the original Looney Tunes cast in order to win a basketball game against a rogue artificial intelligence that has kidnapped his son. Just like the first film, the plot is utterly bizarre past the point of comprehension, especially when we consider the massive time lap. What makes the plot even worse is how rushed the pacing is just to make it to the game, and if you're unfamiliar with the Looney Tunes or much of the movie references the writers implement to signify their new presence, you'd feel utterly lost. It doesn't help that for a movie that could easily tackle how badly artificial intelligence has ruined the progress of human knowledge within the entertainment business, it would rather make it all about the cliched and predictable storyline of James trying to understand his own flesh and blood. Needless to say, the plot feels like a failure in the making.However, as fundamentally flawed as the whole movie is, it might actually be fully aware of all of its problems. As this is a long awaited continuation from a ridiculous corporate cash grab, it never takes itself too seriously enough to allow the insanity of a project like this run wild. Because this movie mostly takes place within a Warners streaming verse, much of the plot relies on the gimmick of product placements to serve the function of James and the Looney Tunes taking down an AI. While the actual game plot gets a little underwhelming due to the predictable outcome, there are still plenty of gags and bizarre turnarounds that are too unbelievable to look away from. Also, if there is any group from the crew that clearly had a ball on this, it would be the animation team led by veteran WB animator Spike Brandt, as they really capture the timeless comedic nature and poses in the lovable Warner Bros characters that we have all cherished for decades onward. Even in CGI, the talents of the gifted animators can never be outmatched with the right amount of craftsmanship and love.On a side note, while Lebron isn't that great of an actor in his own right, he does seem to at least take the movie about as seriously as it needs to be, so any hoaky underacting can be attributed to the nature of the film more than anything else. In addition, Don Cheadle must have been having a ball as the AI during the making of the feature, as he disguises his truly despicable pettiness with a sly charming persona to a believable point. Also, it's incredible to see how far famed voice actor Eric Bauza has come in voicing Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck, Marvin the Martian and many more, as his wonderfully sharp range brings the characters to life very solidly. Other veterans like Jeff Bergman, Bob Bergen, Candi Milo fit right back into their character perfectly, but it is noticeably peculiar having celebrities like Zendaya voicing Lola Bunny, Fortunately, she does bring a certain level of charisma that was much needed for a character that had already grown better in other media. It's funny comparing non actors, in this case basketball players, to professional actors and VAs, but that's what movies like this are for.So even though Space Jam: A New Legacy is far from a great movie, it didn't really disappoint in being what it set out to do in the first place. While it's obviously not going to win everyone over, there's a good chance fans of the first film will find the most value out of it and even share them with new people like their own kids (c'mon, it's been 25 years since then). Unless you're more in the mood to check out Black Widow or you hate the first film with a passion, I'd say this wouldn't be the worst flick to take your family to on a lazy weekend. Besides, we haven't had this much fun in the movie theaters in a long time.",Space Jam - A New Legacy
55,rdoubleoc,Mixed feelings.,6,12 August 2021,"The quality of this movie is off the charts, in terms of computer graphics. I'll give it that much.However, it's just not that watchable (it literally took me 4 times because I just kept wanting to do anything but keep watching this movie, in most scenes, not to bash it, but just to be honest).Also, is LeBron that special? I see people who are great at lots of things but they sure don't get THAT much praise. A movie just shouldn't praise one guy so much unless it's a documentary.The ending with all of the different Warner characters is pretty good, however, but not great.Don Cheadle does a great job in his acting and role, also (as usual), and this should be noted. He really is a great actor, and sells the part of the villain nicely (I can't see anyone doing it better, actually). If Hollywood has any more bad guy roles, there's your guy (or at least a very solid one)!I feel like Six Flags could've made it into the movie more, besides one funny line, though.",Space Jam - A New Legacy
56,ronakkotian,Feels more like an advert of Warner Bros. promoting their properties,2,25 July 2021,"The original Space Jam was a childhood favourite of mine. Even though that film doesn't hold as well now, it's still much better than Space Jam: A New Legacy.Space Jam: A New Legacy follows LeBron James as he works with the Looney Tunes to win a basketball game in order to save his son from a rogue artificial intelligence.Looking back at Space Jam now, it's not very good but there is a certain charm that film possesses and a level of nostalgia for me which makes it a guilty pleasure. However, I found no joy watching Space Jam: A New Legacy. I was interested purely because of nostalgia but this film disappointed me on so many levels. It doesn't even feel like a film. It's more of a 2 hour advertisement for all the properties Warner Bros own. We're taken through franchises like The Matrix, Austin Powers, the DC universe and many more throughout. It felt like a cheap way to promote and sell their properties. Even the audience of the basketball match is made up of characters Warner Bros own. The huge amount of characters and references were so distracting and took away my focus on the actual game. The story of the original Space Jam was very cheesy and predictable but it came from a time where it was more acceptable. Here, the premise is so outdated and predictable all the way through. Aside from one, every single joke fell flat. The only aspect of Space Jam: A New Legacy that I thought was well done were the effects. Clearly a lot of effort went into them and the film indeed looks great.The performances are also pretty awful. Michael Jordan's performance in the original was not good and the same goes for LeBron James. This film revolves around him more than the Looney Tunes themselves but James isn't able to carry this film. He is very wooden especially during scenes that require him to show emotion. It's evidently clear that he's not an actor. Don Cheadle looks like he's having a lot of fun playing the villain but the script unfortunately doesn't work in his favour. The Looney Tunes were fine but I felt like they weren't utilised to their full potential here.Space Jam: A New Legacy is a film to forget. The script is very cringey and predictable, the acting isn't good and it lacks the charm and fun of the original.

A rogue artificial intelligence kidnaps the son of famed basketball player LeBron James, who then has to work with Bugs Bunny to win a basketball game. There are some entertaining moments for sure, but it's one gigantic commercial for Warner Brothers IP properties, which is a huge turnoff for most viewers. The target audience is definitely kids. Their parents who grew up watching the original movie might be annoyed and let down.The film is directed by Malcolm D. Lee. Are you Team Tune or Team Goon? This is a spoiler-free movie review.THINGS I LIKED:
If you're a LeBron James fan, you'll love this movie because it features him, showcasing a bunch of real-life clips from his historical career.If you're a Warner Brothers cartoon character fan, you'll love seeing all of your favorites. Berg Bergen is the only voice actor to return from the original Space Jam movie of 1996.Academy Award nominee Don Cheadle is great, as expected. He was just nominated for an Emmy for Outstanding Guest Actor in a Drama Series. Good on him. He's a wonderful actor and he seemed to have a lot of fun with his role in this film. He plays AL G. Rythm (algorithm)
There's a lot of humor, although not all of it lands. LeBron is good about letting them take a lot of jabs at him and his career.Tons of fun movie references and clips of film classics like Superman: The Movie, Batman (1989), Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, THE MATRIX, The Wizard of Oz, Mad Max: Fury Road, Wonder Woman, and soooo many more.If you're not that much into basketball, there are still plenty of non-basketball shenanigans to enjoy.TONS of fun Easter Eggs! Look closely!Lots of entertaining cameo performances and voice talents from other sports stars like Sue Bird, Anthony Davis, Draymond Green, Damian Lillard, Nneka Ogwumike, Diana Taurasi, and so many more.There's an awesome Michael Jordan gag that actually made me laugh out loud. Loved it.It's super entertaining to look at the audience during the big game to pick out all kinds of characters from zillions of Warner Brothers movies.I've always loved movies that combine animation with real-life actors. I enjoyed the different animation styles.The movie features the huge E3 conference. One of my sons competed in that when he was in college. He now does art design on video games at Blizzard!If you love basketball, you'll get a kick out of the ""server-verse"" version of the game.THINGS I DIDN'T LIKE:
Warner Brothers promotes itself HARD in this movie.As great as LeBron James is at basketball, he's not a very good actor. I don't think anyone is very surprised by that, but it's a shame because LeBron is in almost every scene in the movie.The movie tries to cram WAY too much into every scene.Visually, it's sometimes hard to catch everything because things fly by so fast and furiously.The explanation at the very end of the movie about the demise of a certain character was incredibly lame and lazy writing.There is some super cheesy writing as well.Warner Brothers cartoon fans have already been complaining that we don't see enough of the cartoons. I disagree. There is plenty of cartoon chaos.All of the Extras in the audience during the game don't always react correctly to what's actually happening in the game. It just looks like they were filmed cheering to be inserted into the scenes later, which of course they were. I'm just saying that it really looks like it.The soundtrack isn't as good as the first movie.The plot is just silly with ridiculously high stakes.TIPS FOR PARENTS:
Lots of cartoon violence.Mild profanity. One character is obviously spewing profanities in one scene, but they humorously get bleeped out.There are a lot of references to R-rated movies that kids won't understand or recognize.You can see my full movie review on my Movie Review Mom YouTube channel!",Space Jam - A New Legacy

The whole father and son arc was incredibly weak and predictable, and used as a device so Lebron didn't have to actually carry the weight of acting, because damn his acting was wooden, and so was the dialogue, and the story for that matter. Don Cheadle couldn't even bring that terrible writing to life. The film takes so long to get to where the audience wants it to go, and then it tries to bedazzle you with lights and characters galore, the background characters (like Pennywise, Batman, The Mask) looked so awkward.

He has flaws, but by the end, you know he will be what he needs to be : a self-named King (sarcasm).And with that, you know this can't be a good movie. It's passionless.The plot is simplistic and almost non-existent. A game to solve a family problem, period. Magical technology with ugly CGI of animated characters (Lola looks SO bad). Worst of all, is that they show you they have access to all the Warner Brother properties.. but aside from cheap references and background characters (ala ""Ready Player One""), they just end up drafting the Looney Tunes to be underused.

Space Jam 2: A new legacy is about a rogue artificial intelligence who kidnaps the son of the famed basketball player Lebron James. Who then has to work with Bugs Bunny and the rest of the looney tunes to win a basketball game in order to get his son back. I absolutely hated this film with a passion, and it was nothing more than an embarrassing cash grab from Warner brothers.My first of the few positives would be the nostalgia, the fun opening scene. The basketball elements and decent character background. The film did manage to achieve brief moments of nostalgia for me. Whether it was the basketball scenes reminiscent of the original, the soundtrack or just seeing the looney tunes back in action, it did manage to have some nostalgic moments that entertained me. I also thought the opening scene was fun and provided some decent character background. The film worked at its best when it focused on the characters and the basketball without all of the other bells and whistles. It was nice to get some background into LeBron's character and how he interacted with his basketball coach as a kid, it set up what he would be like with his own son in the present well.Now for my first few negatives. The set up was very generic, as well as the villain. The script and dialogue were terrible, as well as the performances and warner brothers using the film as promotion. The set up was so incredibly basic and predictable. Having the worn trope of having a son who doesn't feel accepted by his father for not wanting to do the same thing as him has been used so many times beforehand and didn't kick the film off in a good way at all. The villain was also incredibly generic. Think of the most simple motivations and reasoning behind a character's actions and that's what you had here, not even the charms of Don Cheadle could stop the poor writing behind this. The script and dialogue were also unfortunately very bad. It was forced, corny and never felt realistic. The dialogue was awkwardly executed, and you could tell even the actors were struggling to deliver the lines well, the script was simple and poorly constructed, it felt like no effort was put into making it even serviceable and it really effected the film. I do also have to say the performances were not very good. LeBron James seems like a likeable person, but his performance was terrible here. He delivered his lines in a forced and awkward manner and it all felt clunky and robotic, with no chemistry with the rest of the cast. I also thought this was just promotion for Warner Brothers. This didn't really feel like a space jam film. It felt like egotistical and desperate promotion of Warner Brothers IP. With no effort to even cover it up. Going as far as having some scenes within the studios really shows where the studio had there priorities with this film.My final few positives would be the animation, the voice cast and character designs, as well as the fun scenes with the looney tunes. I thought the animation here for the looney tunes was excellent, due to improved CGI and just more attention to detail the designs of Bugs bunny and co were drastically improved and it was interesting to see them so well designed. I also thought the cinematography here was great. It was largely used as a distraction, but the film bounced off the screen with its fun and creative worlds and futuristic visuals that were a visual delight. I also thought the voice cast was excellent, it was great to hear all of the original cast return in there glory, with a great new addition with Zendaya who bought Lola Bunny to life in a much better representation of her character then the original. I also thought the character designs for the looney tunes opposing teams were fun. Combining famous basketball players with different animals was a fun idea, they looked great and posed a good threat to the main plot point and the team. Finally, there was also a lot of fun scenes with recruiting the looney tunes. Despite Warner Brothers using the film as promotion, the scenes involving the looney tunes being trapped in different brands were admittedly very entertaining to watch and some of the best parts of the film.My next few negatives would be corny tone and humour. The rushed pacing, as well as the repetitive conflict and odd character decisions. This film rushed over so many things, any form of development or important scene introduced was just rushed over, never giving the audience time for any of it to connect or sink in, so therefore I just didn't care about the characters, I also thought the humour was terrible, I understand it's a family film. But the humour was incredibly forced, awkward and just fell flat. It was incredibly corny and was just trying too hard to be cool or funny and it just came across as cringy. I also thought the conflict here was extremely repetitive, having the son not feel accepted by Lebron was fine and it was clear his passion wasn't in basketball. But when the same lines and repetitive reasoning for the conflict was used so often without any form of development or just more to it, it just stayed in the same place and therefore it got tedious and repetitive. Plus, the son made some very questionable character decisions, the film made it come across like he hated his dad, without enough development between there relationship, so the son actually came across as naïve and extremely unlikeable, with illogical and harsh decisions throughout that made me even more disconnected to the relationships.My final few negatives would be the slow pacing in the second half, the lack of stakes or development to the plot. The awful 3D design of the looney tunes. And the messy final act. The film was easily thirty minutes too long, with a messy and clunky final act that dragged on for too long. The final basketball match was forty minutes long that's almost half the movie, and it didn't fly by it dragged along almost to the point of it being unwatchable. I also thought there was a complete lack of development or stakes to the plot. I never once considered the villain to be a threat or thought that there was a slight chance of the team actually losing, it was just predictably and simply laid out. With no development to the characters or further explanation into the villain. Finally, I thought the 3D designs for the looney tunes were terrible, I seriously don't understand why the creative team behind the film decided having 3D designs instead of 2D would work in the final act, because it didn't. Everyone looked poorly made and the designs were frankly off-putting and worked better with the original 2D designs. This didn't need to be changed and was a poorly executed creative decision.Overall, Space Jam 2 is mildly entertaining in parts, and it was nice to see the looney tunes back. And will probably be mostly entertaining for young kids. But it was an embarrassing cash grab from Warner Brothers. It was lazy, forced and completely cringy. Another failed sequel to a classic that should have never been made. Warner Brothers, there is a difference between trying and trying too hard and this fell completely flat.Overall rating 27/100.",Space Jam - A New Legacy

Which gives it the most hype, that's what half the movie feels like.Typical jokes of the characters, but in less intensity.Ideal for the previous generations, the new ones do not entertain so much.Talk about the importance of family and the importance of listening and letting others be.An option to see if you like movie reboots.",Space Jam - A New Legacy

78,Darkjak007,25 years later this movie achieved nothing,4,17 July 2021,"This movie wasn't going to be good from the start ,but somehow it ends up being even worse then the original. We see LeBron james as a kid playing a gameboy he gets called out by his coach who tells that he need to truly apply himself if he want to succeed. Cut to the present LeBron wanting his sons to follow in his footsteps. He push them specifically his youngest son Dom. The Problem is Dom is a game designer and doesn't want to play basketball. And from that you know what's the arc and the resolution. How the looney tunes factor in is that while at Warner bros talking about a movie deal LeBron and Dom are under surveillance by the studios self-aware A.i Al-G Rhythm(Don Cheadle) who digitized them into the serververse a universe where all the Warner bros characters exist on different worlds and blah blah Son's kidnapped LeBron meets the toons and all their fate's rest in the hands of a basketball game. LeBron doesn't offer anything outside of his stardom. He is a horrible actor giving terrible line delivery almost as bad as Shaq. I'm not going to lie like most and say Michael's performance was gold material,but Michael was likeable. Despite his bland attitude you could a least enjoy his presence he knew what kind of movie he was in and made the best of it. Regardless on where you stand with LeBron he's not that he is a Jerk who want things his way the whole movie. An ass to his Son until the end when he gets the obvious lesson. The Toons are alright just as much they were in the orginal but they dont get much screen time before the game. The animation on all of them is good,The 3d design look great I would've preferred those to 2d redesign Honestly. The seververse is just a big advertisement for Warner. With DCEU posters everywhere,a whole ready player one scenario with the all these Studio characters that most casual audiences probably aren't even going to recognize or know. With terrible cosplayer standin on a repeated loop. Overall this a diaster of a film while it could've offered something with the serververse but the tired message, The product placement combine with LeBrons acting makes this a sleeper to get into the end with very few joke that actually worked this film can be forgotten* Spoiler/Plotholes* starts the basketball game starts to soon and last to long like 40 minutes. It's not even really a basketball game as opposed to a video game version of dom's creation. I guess also the first movie doesn't exist in this continuation because the toons live in a server not the center of the earth. They have no memory of Michael but they make jokes about him. Even the Nerdlucks show up. The defeat of Al G Rhythm has no repructions he's suppose to be the algorithm for the studio servers and controls the whole serververse wouldn't his death destroy the servers and all the characters? The whole bugs death is pointless, he's fine and how did he get into the human world?",Space Jam - A New Legacy
79,johnsmithjanuary-20081,Cmon y'all it was fun,9,19 July 2021,"The negative reviews seem to be made by individuals who either dislike Lebron or dislike animated kids movies. In that case this movie wasn't for you. If you watched this movie with an open mind you would've enjoyed. I watched old looney tunes cartoons growing up and I've also been a basketball fan my whole life. What some critics described as blatant advertising for other WB movies I thought was pretty creative and entertaining. The references weren't exactly to unheard of movies. And it's important to view this as a looney tunes movie with Lebron NOT a Lebron movie with looney tunes. Obviously Bron isn't the greatest actor but he did fine and it wasn't as bad as people are making out to be. At the end of the day this movie is for the kids, and not adult critics and movie reviewers. As long as you keep that in mind you'll be able to enjoy it.

The Tune Squad vs The Goon Squad was a pretty cool idea if you think about it. The movie was alright, but they also have a little bit of drama and there's also hilarious cameos as well. I love how they tell the story of LeBron James and his son, because this movie is like a father and son story, and the Looney Tunes will do anything to help LeBron get his son back from an evil super villain who played War Machine from the MCU, Don Cheadle. Space Jam: A New Legacy was alright, but still I really enjoyed the original Space Jam more and the Looney Tunes all together.Thank you for bringing the best Space Jam movie ever made!!!",Space Jam - A New Legacy

86,AdrenalinDragon,Space Blunder: A Desperate Legacy,5,16 July 2021,"Space Jam: A New Legacy is a sequel 25 years too late. Trying to bring back the nostalgia and success of the 1996 original, this new one lacks the charm and charisma of the original. In the end, this one feels desperate on throwing so much crap at the wall to see if something lands and sticks, and it lacks the heart and ambition making it a big cashgrab without direction.That being said, I don't think it has zero merit. When the Looney Tunes Classic 2D Animation sequence of the film comes up, it looks pretty good and has a bit of fun with what it does with slapstick humour and references. There are Warner Bros. References to franchises everywhere, which makes it feel like Ready Player One, so at first it's kind of cool but then you realise it's going to throw this at you non-stop and starts to get tedious. Little glimpses of humour are okay and the voice actors do a good job with the characters.All the live-action/human actor sequences however are really bad. To be fair, Michael Jordan was kind of bad too, but he had more depth to him than LeBron James did and was acting at cartoon sequences to nothing. Don Cheadle is really the only actor seemingly having a blast with it. Everybody else acts poorly and there's not really a Bill Murray or Wayne Knight equivalent here to add in some good banter. I didn't buy the kid was a computer genius either, not helped by poor acting.Its Soundtrack was lacking here too. It's one of the very best things going for the original Space Jam and fitted well with the themes and style of the film. Here there's nothing memorable and just seems generic and forgettable. The film relies mostly on CGI visuals and by the end becomes complete and utter nonsense of going too far off the rails for my liking personally, especially with no firm rules.In the end, it wasn't the worst watch in the whole wide world, but it felt like it was trying too hard and lacked what made the original Space Jam appealing and become a Guilty Pleasure. Yes it was nice to see the Looney Tunes again, but this is not the great big comeback for them and all the money in the world and cameos in it don't mean alot if the film isn't hitting the right notes for new and nostalgic fans.4.5/10.",Space Jam - A New Legacy

91,arabnikita,I feel bad for the kids,3,21 July 2021,"Space Jam: A New Legacy (2021)For many years I have been dreaming of a Space Jam sequel and with a heavy heart I admit that this wasn't what I wanted. I am writing these words with a lot of pain in my heart as I am huge fan of Basketball and LeBron James but I can barely find any redeeming qualities for this mess. Space Jam 1 was an easy going film with a simple storyline, plenty of comedy and memorable soundtracks. It was fully aware of it's foolishness and as a result felt highly enjoyable. Space Jam 2 feels like a giant Warner Brothers commerical with too much content making it feel hollow and heartless.It seems like the director was on a mission to saturate every second of this film to the point that it resembles a collection of videos stacked on top each other making it impossible to care for anything. On top of it all, the movie tries to push messages of self actualization but the writer is simply not clever enough to make this or anything else in the film look natural. In a way it feels like a eating a cake stuffed with every imaginable candy while chasing it down with a bucket of chocolate.While I enjoyed watching James and Bugs visit the different WB franchises as they formed that ""super"" team, eventually the content became excessive. Naturally, Looney Tunes do supply some funny moments and if you are an NBA fan, you will get a few extra laughs. Unfortunately, even basketball itself felt pathetic in this movie. We all remember the Monstars from the original but here, the villains are flat and robotic with the unnecessarily ridiculous Don Cheadle orchestrating the cringefest.However the worst and most noticeable part is the lack of any kind of music. What made Space Jam 1 so special and wholesome were those soundtracks that have kept the film in my heart for years as a pleasant memory. What was supposed to be a goofy comedy about basketball, turned into an excessively long CGI exposition-fest lacking heart , joy or any sort of organic momentum. Space Jam 1 is a cherished memory while Space Jam 2, is a memory that I want to erase from my mind.P. S.

This is what happens when you get too many egos and too much money together and not a wit of ingenuity and talent. Plus, they're playing off the success of a film that was 25 years ago. The target audience of then are now young adults. Any adult that finds this entertaining should seek professional help immediately. And even worse, space jam of the 90s went a long way toward bridging race relations. MJ was a hero to my youngest and the main reason why he got interested in basketball but without the genes, it was more passion than personal reward. Still it was funny to watch this little white kid go up and hug a full size posterboard in the mall. Kids from everywhere, who probably knew nothing of basketball and MJ's record, fell in love with the movie and the characters anyway because it was a genuine story, not a marketing gimmick.

Sure it's showing its age but it has been 25 years, so that's a given. This new one, though, is mostly BLEH!It's too long, it's too bloated. The looney tunes take a massive backseat, which is the biggest mistake this movie makes. The personal human story is not what we came here for, and it's cringe. It's basically WB flexing itself and giving you a big advertisement of their streaming service HBO MAX and all their major properties but whereas before, the core idea was having fun, here, it's all corporate first. Just goes to show how much the pop-culture landscape has changed in these 25 years. Also, HBO and WB, you ain't doing any favours for yourself by reminding us of Game of Thrones.Sure, there were some moments and some scenes, no matter how short relative to the entire runtime, that were fun, I'm not gonna lie. It wasn't all bad. That one Michael Jordan joke was the best part, I laughed out loud. But stuff like that was so few and far between, it pissed me off why they didn't let the writers and the animators etc just go full ham like that. You'd still get your marketing and advertising but instead of being bland and boring, it would have been so much fun.Anyway, I'd recommend watching the old one again. And if I were to rate it, I'd give it a 3.5/10.P. S The 3D looney tunes were the stuff of nightmares. NO.",Space Jam - A New Legacy
98,jjburkekid,Not that Bad as People Say,4,26 July 2021,"When I go on this site for Space Jam 2 reviews, they were all saying that the film sucked. So I went to see the film for myself, and my expectations were pretty low for this film. However when I saw in on HBO Max, it was still pretty bad, but it did have some good elements to it. My least favorite part of the film was the first 30 minutes. During that time, it seemed less like a movie and more of a commercial for HBO Max and WB. It was pretty boring, and almost served nothing to the film. LeBron James isn't a very good actor, and how he says his dialogue is very still. The next 30 minutes do get kind of better, but still not very better. IT still felt like a commercial, but at least it was fun seeing LeBron and Bugs recruiting the Looney Tunes Gang. The Wonder Woman one was just stretched out too long. The moments with Al G. Rhythm and Dom were dull. Even the Basketball game was annoying because the stakes were really low and just random. In the second half of the game, we finally see the Looney Tunes in their true form ( aside from Porky Pig raping). And in the 2nd half of the game, it was pretty fun to see how the Basketball game played out. The story and characters were all pretty bad. But the animation and the visuals were stunning. The reason this has 4 stars and not 1 or 2 is because of the great visuals and solid animation for the Looney Tunes, both in 2d and in CGI. In all, it's a long, HBO Max commercial with a dull story, low stakes, and bad comedy. The animation and visuals are stunning, and some of the basketball game was fun. It may have some fun parts, but it would've worked better as a commercial for HBO Max.",Space Jam - A New Legacy

102,thepriceofpayne,A Little basic but still fun,5,17 July 2021,"You know I get that the original ""Space Jam"" is nostalgic but it's far from a good film. If that affects your views on this film that's a little crazy to me. Having said that I can not whole heartedly call this film good, but it's fun. ""Space Jam: A New Legacy"" has good effects and a fun premise but despite LeBron James' best efforts it falls flat. This movie understands the Looney Tunes a little better than the original film (though not as well as Back in Action) and features a good character arc for Bugs Bunny of all. However the awkward delivery and shameless IP placements do nothing to enhance the viewing experience. Despite this we must all remember this movie is for children, and it's a fun ride that will be enjoyable for them. I don't recommend this as a Cinematic classic, but I'll gladly recommend it as a good time!",Space Jam - A New Legacy

104,theredsky,Space Jam: A New Legacy Review,1,23 July 2021,"A ironically hilarious film but an absolutely terrible film none the less. Everything about this film doesn't work. The story, the acting, the CGI, the references, the script. All of it feels terrible compared to the first film. The first film isn't that great either but at least it was self aware. This isn't. The film doesn't understand when it is making fun of itself and it shows. I enjoyed the references in the first film as they felt natural but this was Ready Player One on steroids and if you don't like Ready Player One like me, then this will be a nightmare. Sometimes there are cool Easter eggs in the background but some of it feels weird. I love A Clockwork Orange but it still feels weird to see a bunch of characters from that movie watching a Basketball Game. The humor is unintentionally funny. I never laughed at a joke they were trying to make but I laughed at almost everything else because it was so bad that it's funny. I enjoyed watching this movie but that was probably because I was with friends. I feel like watching this on your own is a painful experience. I did find myself being painfully bored during points but the jokes my friends were making and their reactions helped keep my interest. All of the performances are AWFUL. Lebron James did an awful job. Michael Jordan wasn't great in the first film either but his performance felt intentionally funny but this was just painful to watch. Don Cheadle was really weird as well. The only reason I kind of enjoyed his performance was because I was joking about him the whole time. The script is the most predictable boring story ever. The first film's script was predictable as well but the journey to get there was fun and this wasn't fun. The visual effects look kind of decent at times except Live Action Lola Bunny. Her eyes look really really weird for some reason. I would really only recommend this if you watch it with friends. It's a lot funnier to watch this with other people than on your own.",Space Jam - A New Legacy

No build-up, no backstories, no explanations.95% of the movie is just the screen full of bright lights and loud sounds.No real plot to speak of. People just accept that they're zapped to Toon Town...and just get on with it. No sense of anything being at stake. It never just stops to breath...it's non-stop and relentless!Overall an absolute shambles!2 stars given purely for the cameos.Wouldn't even recommend it to Michael Jordan to watch!",Space Jam - A New Legacy

107,timeblank,You Almost Did What???,1,18 July 2021,Space Jam should be changed into a Lebron James Story. Just a father and son conflict. What is weird is some Warner Bros. Studio made up AI sucks them in to the computer. However the first movie was about aliens in a distant planet and toon world was in the center of the earth. How does toon world only exists in a computer? Awful writing.Then this movie tries to do the unthinkable. That's how this movie deserves one star. How dare you tried to kill off a beloved character! Totally disgusted!,Space Jam - A New Legacy
108,haydenluz,Space Jam: A New Legacy,3,18 July 2021,"I don't have much good to say about this film, so let me start with the bad. Space Jam: A New Legacy, feels like a bad rip off of Spy Kids 3: Game Over. The concept is fun, but very formulaic, while not being totally cohesive or consistent. Id be lying if I said the film doesn't have heart and creativity, but it's severely overshadowed by the corniness, and the plot being all over the place. Space Jam: A New Legacy has countless cliches, and easter eggs, where it gets super distracting. I expected a few fan service moments, but it seemed like this whole film was catered to that, leaving it to run thin. Malcolm D. Lee knew what they were going for, being a simple, and silly film, so you cannot take this serious at all. Lee did his best to embrace his goal, but he over-did it, creating way too many cringey moments.I can totally see why Lebron James is a basketball player, because he cannot act. Maybe it was the way his lines were written; he just seemed uncomfortable, and not genuine at all, which is one of the biggest dampers of the film, considering this was more of a ""lebron james"" film, over a Space Jam film. The Looney Tunes served their purpose for the most part, but they felt more like a side attractions to Lebron.Although I have a lot that I didn't like about this film, there were a couple of qualities that made it somewhat enjoyable. Even though the Looney Tunes were mainly side characters, it's always a pleasant treat to see them on screen, doing their thing. The cinematography and animations were done fairly well. Everything was very bright, and clear, being visually pleasing. With the film totaling almost two hours, it definitely overstays it's welcome, but it does have a good pace, keeping me engaged almost the whole time.Overall, this was mainly just a nostalgic grab! It was definitely made for the younger viewers, and I believe if you go into this film with an open mind, some of the older crowds could enjoy it for nostalgic purposes.",Space Jam - A New Legacy

110,Sandra-durand80,Disappointing,1,17 July 2021,Least diverse movie ever. Not what I expected in a movie that was meant to be entertaining. I didn't like it.,Space Jam - A New Legacy
111,kenstallings-65346,Never should have been made,1,4 September 2021,"The original Space Jam was a popcorn movie that benefitted from an original plot concept, taking the most popular athlete in the world at the time and grafting animated Looney Tunes characters into an ensemble cast. It worked, though no one considered the result anything more than a Thanksgiving movie pleasure.There was never any real urging for a remake.So, the entire basis of this production appears to have been how can another highly talented basketball player glorify himself and chase the ghost of the player most consider the greatest of all time? The answer seems to have been to set him up in the same theatrical vehicle, and allow him to prove to the world that he too, ""Can Be Like Mike!""Sadly, if that was the goal, it failed as miserably as the movie itself did.It seems as if the production team knew it would end that way, and so little effort was made to do anything other than put a movie on record and show it in theaters. Any effort at quality scripting, good production, solid directing, and getting the most out of the casting, seemed put aside, so that the resulting failure would at least have consumed very little hard work and ingenuity.The result was hammered in the press, and is one of the few times the critics got it right to lampoon a movie.",Space Jam - A New Legacy

The story is Boring and predictable and just not funny. The colour effects are overused and that makes the movie way over lit. And could cause seizures for certain people. Did I forget to say that the story is also a pile of mess. The characters are so bland it's frustrating. I mean it had an interesting start but it went know where. The Idea is good and the story could of been good but it goes no where and missed the mark so much it bugs me. The first movie is a 7 out of 10 for me because it was funny the characters were cool the story wasn't complex and the Soundtrack was really good. And the Script was also good. This film had a bad Script. Ruined my Childhood. Skip It and don't make the same mistake I did!Overall: 3.5/10.,Space Jam - A New Legacy
116,BijeshNagesh,Slam Dump!,4,16 July 2021,"There's no legacy here, just a series of weak CGI and contrived storytelling. This 'New Blunder' managed to ruin my childhood memories of the excellence and artistry I cherished seeing in ""Space Jam"" 1996.This review is written keeping in mind (and heart) the real legacy of the 1996 ""Space Jam"" movie.I adore every one of the 'Loony Tunes', which made me that much more disappointed to watch how they used them in this disaster-sequel. I guess LeBron James did his best with what he could. I liked what Kamiyah James (played by Sonequa Martin-Green) brought to her role. I also liked Don Cheadle's portrayal of Al G. Rhythm.They barely used the extraordinarily talented Steven Yeun (who played a Warner Bros. Exec). Malik (played by Khris Davis) was so funny but, sigh, under-used. I half-expected him to be 'teleported' into the cartoon-court and give us some fine LoonyTunes-inspired hilarity. But he was 'benched' throughout.Sadly, all the characters came across as 'inadequate' within the confines of this particularly ludicrous script.I think the filmmakers were trying to strike the perfect balance between the original 1996 ""Space Jam"" and the 1988 ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"" film. Whereas those two excelled, ""Space Jam"" 2021 - more like 'Space Ham', and I'm not looking at you, Porky Pig - turned out to be an epic train-wreck.I sincerely pray they do not show a screening of this movie to Bugs Bunny and the rest of the Loony Tunes gang. The 'Tune Squad' will just freak their freak! Some of them will seriously wonder what encouraged the animation artists to make them look and move the way they did in 3D. Even Tweety might have been urged to use a few censor-worthy words after seeing the 'final out'.Over the years, I have enjoyed Basketball - I am not a diehard fan but am familiar with the game's various elements. Many a friend and cousin of mine have actually played Basketball at an official level. I take this time to hope and pray that these friends and cousins do not end up choosing to see this movie over the weekend.I have a feeling that even some sports-gamers won't appreciate some of the elements they integrated into this film, which felt like a strange unappealing version of 'Fantasy Football', only with Basketball and upended beyond belief.The voice-casting for each of the 'Tunes' was great. The references to various WB IPs was brilliant. The characters' full-cartoon designs were superb compared to their frightfully inferior photorealistic (almost) 3D-CG counterparts.The 'classic cartoon' scenes were literally the only ones in this film I enjoyed watching. The nostalgia I felt there should have carried over into the rest of the movie, in keeping with the excellence of the 1996 original. Alas, that wasn't the case with ""Space Jam: A New Legacy"".The whole 'teleport everyone who tunes into the live-stream' part was overkill. After a while, every real person in the digital realm seemed to have forgotten their perilous circumstance, and were happy cheering the teams on (!).I wish they didn't transform the Tunes into those semi-realistic 3D renditions. That was the whole charm behind ""Roger Rabbit"" and the original ""Space Jam"". They should have kept the toons looking toony and merged them with the 'real world'.Only the 'Goon Squad' got a worthy 'upgrade' in this re-design, and even then they didn't come close to touching the presence and intimidation value that the original 'Monstars' brought to court in the 1996 version. Oh, and they gave the Monstars' tiny versions a few seconds of screen time by way of cameos.I was enjoying all the 'WB easter eggs' they included in the audience more than the game itself. However, they all looked like real-world cosplayers who were 'teleported' into the game. Even King Kong seemed confused about the whole thing, and I don't blame him.The kid Dom James (Played by Cedric Joe) seemed completely oblivious to the Matrix-level implausibility of the situation, let alone his father's more than reasonable concerns about Al G's ambitions. It was literally fun and games to Dom, when all he had to do to cease Al's 'reign' was stop playing ball.He did in the end, late as it was. I could practically see the big red 'convenience-button' glowing and a lazy screenplay writer smacking it with hypnotic glee while another one pulled down on the 'predictable-lever'.Don't even get me started on that major Jordan-cameo let-down. It quite frankly broke my heart.There is not much good to say about the sheer 'Loony' atrocities, and predictabilities, that have been committed in this highly anticipated sequel. The movie defied credibility, and not at all in the exceptional way the original 1996 film did. I ended up highly anticipating the movie to finish so I could begin the arduous task of writing this painfully truthful review before attempting to heal myself from the Toony-trauma of it all.The legendary Warner Bros. Studios (!) worked on this supposed-to-be-brilliant sequel, and not a one among them stopped to suggest, ""Hey, we can do better, way better."" In the 'Age of Streaming' where all sorts of IPs and Studios (even WB, for that matter!) are upping their game, this crew decided to go low. The final result? A grand slam dump in lieu of a dunk.I don't think I will ever forgive them for what they tried doing to my all-time toon-hero Bugs Bunny. If something untoward had happened there, there'd have been hell to pay.""That's all folks!"" Wait, let me rephrase that... ""That's it, folks, I've had it!""",Space Jam - A New Legacy
117,nasdagoodshepherd,"Okay, seriously. The hate needs to STOP!",9,18 July 2021,"Unbelievable, just unbelievable. So much hate on one film? That's cold. Like it's okay to dislike a film, but ya know people worked hard on this movie Right? Jeez at least let me see like 30 or 50 good reviews on this movie.Anyway Space Jam: A New Legacy is just AWESOME! Possibly one of the best movies of the year in my opinion. The story is very interesting that LeBron James teams up with Bugs Bunny and the rest of the Looney Tunes gang to win a game of basketball in order to save his own son. I really love everything about this movie, the visuals is rather beautiful to look at and the mixture of traditional animation, CGI animationa and live-action is very impressive and the humor is very good. And in my opinion, all the Warner Bros references is very incredible which made Space Jam: A New Legacy a one gigantic love letter for Warner Bros and that is awesome.I am serious, Space Jam: A New Legacy doesn't deserve all the hate and all the scorn from anyone and it is so much better than the first Space Jam film, even thought I loved the first Space Jam film. I know this movie is not for everyone but please, don't give this movie so much hate, it doesn't deserve all of that terrible stuff.

118,stefstars,Ralph Breaks The Internet - Warner Brothers Style,3,19 July 2021,"Prior to watching the film, I saw so many critics claiming that the original version had a soul and this one couldn't hold a candle to it. I couldn't understand what made them say that since the original was also a cash grab, taking advantage of Michael Jordan's popularity, reviving the Looney Tunes, and maybe trying to create a show for those little alien creatures from ""moron planet."" After watching this new version, I can now see the heart and soul of the original one and how this one lacks it.The first Space Jam was by no means a cinematic masterpiece, but it had effort, it was fun. It didn't have to try so hard. The Looney Tunes didn't have to try so hard to appease to their modern audience, they were still as looney as they were in the 30s - 60s and it worked ! The story was sloppy but still fun cos it had a cast that made it so. Michael Jordan didn't deliver an Oscar worthy performance or even a good performance for that matter, but you could tell he was having fun. It just worked, it was a mess, but it worked. I loved this film as a kid and I still enjoy it as an adult even though now I can see it's flaws better. But even with its flaws, it's still miles and miles better than this new version.Warner Brothers took the Disney route and decided to make a film where they show off all their intellectual properties in ways that aren't necessary. If ""Ralph Breaks The Internet"" left a bad taste in your mouth, then I suggest you avoid this new Space Jam film. They decided to cram almost every notable character, film, show from their library into the film. I guess they felt The Looney Tunes, alone, weren't enough to entertain this new generation of kids or (the more probable version) it's a shameless long ad for whatever streaming service they may have planned for the future.They tried to create a touching father, son story for the film but there's nothing touching about it cos we spend only one scene establishing that Lebron has high expectations for his son and his son can't reach them cos he's his own person. The movie latches to that one scene to carry the rest of the poorly written story. The villain in this film is the algorithm of Warner Brother's library, played by Don Cheadle, who wants Lebron for reasons I still can't understand. He lures Lebron to the Warner Brothers studio, Lebron brings his son with him to the meeting, Lebron refuses whatever deal was offered to him and from there Don Cheadle decides to kidnap Lebron and his son to get his way. Listen this ""Al. G. Rithim"" character is just a poorly written excuse to enter the world of Warner Brothers where you will be hit with intellectual property after intellectual property of Warner Brothers - just like Ralph Breaks The Internet. When Lebron goes into Looney Tunes world, Bugs Bunny is the only Looney Tune there cos the other Looney Tunes decided to explore the other universes in the Warner Brothers library. Yet another written excuse to show off the characters and films that Warner Brothers owns. Actually the final basketball game is the ultimate show off of all their intellectual properties.Now for The Looney Tunes in this film. They lost their classic touch, that even Space Jam in the 90's let them keep. This version made them cringe worthy with lines like ""Haters gonna hate,"" Porky Pig raps, and the rest hardly speak. A couple of lines here and there, Daffy (a normally funny Looney Tune) is not funny at all in this film, Zendaya (fantastic as she may be) is no Lola Rabbit. Her voice doesn't match Lola at all. The only Looney Tune that stayed faithful to the classic was Marvin Martian, a Looney Tune, that was noticeably missing in the original version - not sure why since he was so popular in the 90's. All in all they're very underwhelming and take a backseat for the other intellectual properties that Warner Brothers wants to show off. It is through them that Lebron realizes that perhaps he was being too hard on his son cos he keeps trying to prevent them from being looney, for basketball purposes. They just tried really hard to make the Looney Tunes interesting to their modern young audience, which is a big mistake in my opinion. My 8 year old cousin loves the classic Looney Tunes as they are, he even watches the old cartoons on HBO Max, he doesn't need them to try to act urban or c0oL for him to like them. Also they included the ""big chungus"" meme cos ""see kids, we're in with the times, haha Warner Brothers is just like you haha""This review is really dragging on, but I can write you a book on how this film is terrible and could never come close to the original Space Jam (which isn't even that high of a standard !) I thought Michael Jordan would've made a cameo, but instead the little alien villains from the original did and Michael B. Jordan made a cameo cos ""haha, heehee, they got the wrong Michael Jordan !"" I now see what the critics meant when they say the original Space Jam had a heart and a soul, cos after watching this awful reboot, you'll realize it did. There was effort put into the original Space Jam and something fun and memorable was actually created, this new version is a shameless cash grab that doesn't bother to hide that this is what it's doing. They've decided to follow in Disney's ""no longer hiding it"" cash grab footsteps and it is unfortunate. I hope I didn't see The Iron Giant so many times cos those disconnected, money hungry producers plan on doing a reboot of that awesome movie. I'm not even going to go over Lebron's acting skills cos he's not an actor and neither was Michael Jordan. Don Cheadle didn't even bother with his character, while everyone else was trying really hard to be funny or even give the impression that they were making an effort, Sarah Silverman included.3 stars, I would ideally leave it at 1, but my 8 year old cousin enjoyed it and at the end of the day he's the one they made this atrocity for. Yet even he agreed, that the original is better. I don't recommend this film at all, just stream the original one.",Space Jam - A New Legacy

You're either going to geek out at these references or you'll get annoyed of these references in the first 5 mins, and find the rest of it to be straight trash.This was one of the most anticipated sequels in the past 25 years, and it was just...horrible. There was scope to do SO MUCH and build up on the 1997 nostalgia, but no, they had to make an ad. I get mentioning Harry Potter and Game of Thrones ONCE, but again and again...!? This is a Space Jam sequel. Stick to THAT!Stay away from this, and save 2 hrs unless you have to babysit a 3-5 yr old at home and you can't find anything else to calm the kid down. I mean, I get that you paid $15 for your HBOMax, but you didn't pay to watch ads, let alone a 2-hr ad. And oh, surely not waste your time going to a theater.I get calling LeBron 'King James' in real life, but the first 15-20 mins felt like they over calling him 'King'. I get it, it's LeBron! You calling him 'King' in the movie 53 times isn't gonna change LeBron haters. His acting was OK for an athlete but that's totally fine, nothing against that. But animated LeBron was better than the real one. Don Cheadle was better, but duh!? He's an actor.The story was ehh. There are a few chuckles here and there, but there's nothing else outside of that.

120,pinokiyo,Bugs Bunny is the MVP - Not Lebron. This is why MJ is GOAT...,4,22 August 2021,"This just shows why MJ is GOAT/better than Lebron. Lebron might have taken acting lessons from Shaq's Kazaam tapes.The original Space Jam story made a lot more sense, feels like a documentary compared to outrageous things that happen in Space Jam 2. I loved how it actually related to MJ's baseball career/retirement. It actually really made great use of other co-stars like Charles Barkley, Larry Bird, Bill Murray, and who could forget the original Space Jam had the GREATEST, MOST AMAZING soundtrack ever!! (I even bought the CD at the time... if you know what CD's are...)There isn't even any good music in this new Space Jam 2 movie. Not to mention we all know the controversy with Lola Bunny getting a major downgrade as well. (Thanks Karens and overly sensitive World today)It's funny how NBA today is just high scoring over 120+ points/lack of defense; where in the 90's, it was normal for a lot of games to be held under 100; even in the original Space Jam, the final game score for the ToonSquads were under 80 points against the Monstars. And then we got Space Jam 2 where it's a ridiculous video game, with video game looking CG loony toons, with outrageous scoring rules going over 1000 points.... okay.It's true, Warner Bros really just wanted to self-promote and show off their catalog, in a Ready Player One-like scenes that really makes no sense.I have to admit, the ""MJ"" cameo during half-time was hilarious though. And the little twist with Bugs Bunny was actually touching, I think it made cry (LOL), but overall you knew it was never going to top the original GOAT.The original Space Jam really felt like a theatrical blockbuster movie with great story, cameos, and unforgettable soundtrack - and of course the greatest basketball player of all time. Space Jam 2 definitely has a straight to stream quality TV-Movie. Space Jam 3 with Jeremy Lin on YouTube is actually better than this.",Space Jam - A New Legacy

I say leborn James was no different then Michael Jordan but he still knew how to play basketball in real life . And seeing bugs bunny and daffy duck was so awesome and hilarious. Seeing the rest of the characters from Stephen kings it and other characters from the Warner brothers studios was absolutely awesome and so inspirational to all Warner bros fans all over the world .

122,sjarja,"I guess i am not the target audience, nor suffering from nostalgia",1,21 July 2021,"I do remember the original Space Jam. It was a light entertainment movie that was kind of fun to watch - but certainly no more than once.This new movie felt worse .. significantly worse .. than even the Emoji Movie (if anyone remembers that train wreck)No effort in story, characters or personality/creativity. No original message, nothing.Now, this is more a movie for Americans, i guess, because i have no idea who the protagonist is. Possibly a basketball celebrity like the last one? (that Micheal Jorden at least was known internationally) - anyway, never heard of him.But even unknown actors might do good movies of course - so lets look at the storytelling. A flash of loosely connected scenes that portrait Warner Bros pop culture property - or in short .. a movie length advertisement for WB - how .. erm .. subtle.I can only hope the movie hit the nail in the USA - because it certainly missed it BIG time here in Iceland. Its references simply do not hit the mark at all, its protagonist is unknown and the toons seem not to adhere to the established personalities that they had in the shorts.All in all - a terrible waste of time - that does not satisfy nostalgic adults, nor teens/children at all.",Space Jam - A New Legacy
123,valen060,"Ready Player Two... err Space Jam 2 Is Pop Culture Extraordinary, Yet Short On Story",5,18 July 2021,"Almost 25 years ago, the idea of crossing over NBA legend Michael Jordan with Looney Tunes was playing on the best of both worlds for all ages to enjoy. It still remains a classic to me to this day ever since I first watched it in theaters as a kid in 1996. The self-referential, meta humor and fourth wall-breaking gags are what made Looney Tunes memorable for decades, so it adds to keep the story going in Space Jam.Now introducing this standalone sequel 'A New Legacy' featuring a new generation of people along with current player LeBron James stepping up to the court? It's not a perfect film, but it felt like it tries to remain faithful to the original despite the overstuffed use of Warner Bros-based properties surrounding it. It's like it really wants to follow off the trail left behind by fellow Warner Bros. Movie Ready Player One and many others that succeeded at crossover films in the comic book movie genre. But despite the crossover of different properties and pop cultural stuff coming together to witness the ultimate basketball game in cyberspace, there's more that can be done. I was blown away on spotting every character and reference thrown onscreen, but as for the leading man himself? LeBron James had big shoes to fill left behind by Michael Jordan, but I feel like he did his best even if his fictionalized self does come off as seemingly obnoxious compared to a chill Jordan those years ago.The things this movie did succeed in was its amazing visuals, animation, and performances (Don Cheadle did great as the eccentric villain Al G.), but fell short on the story. Lebron's son is kidnapped and must venture into the studio's computer server with the help of Bugs Bunny and co. To save him. You can place all kinds of TV and film references or characters in one movie for a cameo, but it's not enough if you can't get a great story working. A great family distraction for the kids, but looking at this sequel from an adult's perspective? It could potentially put them to sleep easy. Some audience members in my theater dozed off during the animation sequences, but finally woke up during the basketball scene, which I find hilarious than what was shown onscreen. Anyway, it's flawed, but in no way awful.",Space Jam - A New Legacy
124,ha77y73ad97,Ok sequel that doesn't capture the spirit of the original,6,9 August 2021,"This is by no way a better movie than the original but Im watching Looney Toons play Basketball again but with upgraded animation. The story is simple but its a kids film, Dad has to save his son from an evil computer AI by playing basketball. The original former basketball player has to help Looney Toons after their world gets invaded. Both are so simple but people expect character development from a bunch of Cartoons and a Basketball player. We know who Lebron is and the Toons aren't going to change.The positives of the movie is that the Don Cheadle is goofy and a likeable villain who just wants to be human and appreciated. No one can deny the toons aren't likable same as Mickey Mouse just transcends every generation from their first introduction. As mentioned before the final game makes for great animations and shows how far these animators have come! Feel like a true video game not just Toon World. There's far to many cameos and nods to other films throughout the movie, recurring the Toons is just fun for old and young! Never thought i'd see Mad Max and a Clockwork orange in the film film let alone a kids animation!Then this is where we get the issues with the movie, no matter how simple the film is it doesnt hold you throughout the middle section of preparing for the game. Never really bought the father/ son relationship but didn't land. They tried to re-create Wayne Knights characters in Khris Davis but its the same script just played by a different person but not as well! A positive can also be a negative when having such adult characters being apart of the movie but changing Lola bunny for no reason for being to adult but keeping them involved, you literally have Pennywise next to the group that coined the phrase ""Ultra Violence"" just an odd choice from the WB execs. Flintstones, Yogi and Booboo, all DC characters and Harry Potter are all perfectly fine for kids but imagine having to explain what Game of Thrones is to a 4 year old!Overall its simple fun with some good laughs but can see why people arent happy with the remake and being disappointed!",Space Jam - A New Legacy
125,feyipuk,The best film with the Justice League in I've seen all year.,6,24 July 2021,"Similar to the first film; NBA superstar plays in animated environment against a team made up of copied and toonified NBA superstars, to ultimately learn a lesson about how he should treat his family. Oh, and his kid does some wild tapping on a keyboard/scanning stuff with his phone and there is a risk with giving AI too much control. Fun in places, nostalgic in others, but ultimately too much crammed in for one film.First of all, LeBron may be (I don't follow the sport) a great basketball player, but he never appeared comfortable on screen. There was basically zero chemistry between him and Cedric Joe, who's playing his son, and even the emotions associated with being toonified - like the crux of the film - looked pretty underwhelming to him. At first, this fits with the films message about family, but his best scenes come when he's turned into a toon and the animators cut loose. Why they didn't use his real family for the brief live action parts and increase the animated parts, I don't know.Secondly, this as a montage advert for a studio that's trying to gain new audiences (or other studio to buy them) for their back catalogue. With the number of films/shows/characters they've shoehorned in, it's worth a second watch; from Harry Potter to Batman (animated and live action) and the Justice League. From the Flintstones, Jetsons, Animaniacs and the old aliens from the first Space Jam, through King Kong, Game of Thrones, and - weirdly for kids film - the Matrix, Mad Max: Fury Road, Austin Powers, and Casablanca. They even had the Wizard of Oz and Clockwork Orange characters. Most of these made no sense to my under 10's, and the film executives - Sarah Silverman and Steven Yeun - scene was so meta it completely lost their attention. The Harry Potter parts got their attention, but I couldn't see them leaving going ""I really want to watch Iron Giant"" because of this film. Could see WB making a series with crossovers like this, sure, but here it was too fast to fully appreciate but too slow for the action of the film. Who were they actually supporting?Even the bad guy seemed derivative. An Artificial Intelligence; Al G. Rhythm! It's a name that made me think of the Animaniacs space episode where Al Gore is Al-5000 (2001: A Space Odyssey take off). They could have at least had him dance a bit more? For Don Cheadle this is easy money; he doesn't have to move much and after his years of Marvel CGI he's probably very used to acting to nothing, in front of a green screen. It was all very clever, but, again, why they didn't have a fully animated bad guy, I don't know.That's what saved this film and made it enjoyable; it's toon craziness. In a world sick of lockdown and Covid, job worries and family crisis, and where film goers are still asking who can pick up Thors hammer or why can't DC find enough light bulbs so their films aren't so dark, seeing an animated duck with its bill on backwards or randomly blowing stuff up with a truck load of dynamite is just fun. The Toon Squad training, the animated physics of falling, and simply all those cameos of old characters made me smile. It's just annoying they included so much annoying live action to get there.",Space Jam - A New Legacy

It's insane with crazy call backs to the original and insane cross overs to other Warner bros properties like Batman and even Rick and Morty. I just had a fun time watching this film and that's what it's all about, some people just need to loosen up and stop being so boring. Yes the acting is pretty shocking from Lebron and even Don Cheedle surprisingly but it's still a good and enjoyable film. The animation is great and the scenes with the tunes are easily the best in the whole film. The end basket ball game is just fun and actually hilarious at times. I'm not saying this is a good film by any means this film has its flaws but all in all it is good fun. So go and get it watched and have a good time. Enjoyed it!",Space Jam - A New Legacy

128,TheMysteriousReviewer,Not As Looney As The First Film,7,19 July 2021,"Space Jam: A New Legacy is weaker than the first film, but it's still decent. It does have problems with a predictable story, pacing that feels way too long and the fact it would rely more onto LeBron James. But it can also have some fun moments with fantastic mix of visuals and 2D animation, impressive basketball powers and some likable charm from Looney Tunes and other Warner Bros properties. Of course, I could recommend this for those that grew up with Looney Tunes. But just like the first film, I would mostly recommend this if you're a basketball fan. The movie could use better ways with the writing, but at least it was decent after years from the first Space Jam. And at least it's better than the Tom and Jerry movie that came out earlier this year.",Space Jam - A New Legacy

132,dudeguy-29536,Warner Brother's Biggest Mistake Ever,1,27 September 2021,"I can see why some people actually like this movie knowing how hyped up it was in the trailer with the cameos and action-packed elements this film wanted to provide. But I genuinely cannot like this movie. The first Space Jam didn't rub in this much of a cash grab like the sequel does. Space Jam, like many people have said, is basically a good movie because of how it was produced for its time when basketball was popular and animated commercials were always worth watching since they were very creative with what they would come up with in the making of them. Space Jam was definitely not a perfect movie, the only thing oscar-worthy was honestly the animation, but I still liked it for what it was from its time. But this sequel didn't need to happen. Instead of Michael Jordan we have Lebron James in the cliché father and son bonding plot which actually would've worked okay atleast with this movie if this was the only flaw. But this movie makes Lebron unlikable to his son manipulating him to be an athlete instead of what he wants to be which is a video game creator. Which is annoying to the audience. Michael Jordan never appears in this film which would've been forgivable if this movie was atleast okay. But since MJ told WB he didn't want to, WB hypes us up with Michael B Jordan in this movie instead, some people find it funny but I find it disgusting to anyone who wanted to see MJ. Atleast don't talk about him at all if he doesn't want to be in the film, seriously. We're focusing on someone else this time. The villain Al-G, who is also a live action character, is cringeworthy who plans to make the world his own game. The acting is noticeably bad unlike the first film. Lebron isn't just too chill, he's usually too awkward at times and so are many of the other live-action characters involved in the story. And this is a common problem with live-action animation hybrids but here it's a lot more noticeable since the Looney Tunes don't appear until later. And of course speaking of the Looney Tunes, even the Looney Tunes are a problem. Yes, I'm not kidding. The stupid controversy desexualizing Lola Bunny is honestly a sexist thing to do with a character. Compare Lola Bunny to Jessica Rabbit from Who Framed Roger Rabbit atleast, Lola wasn't even sexualized in the first place. But anyway, most of the Looney Tunes hardly get any roles. It's mostly Bugs Bunny and sometimes Daffy, Granny, and Sylvester. Pepe Le Pew was not even in this movie at all because of another dumb controversy about him sexually harassing women. This is the Looney Tunes like what do you expect? They were from a time when cartoons got away with a lot of things that wouldn't be allowed in cartoons nowadays. In the first Space Jam he was just teaming up in the basketball tournament like there wasn't even a joke about him chasing Penelope Pussycat who doesn't like him. And the animation is also problematic. Not only is the CGI too furry and realistic on the Looney Tunes but the idea of it makes no sense. They enter the live-action world hand-drawn but are ""turned into"" CGI and will be released back to 2D if they win the game, like what sense does this make? I mean yeah the CGI looks unsettling but still, this doesn't work. And even though this movie brings back traditional animation as well, the traditional animation in the first film did an outstanding job with the Looney Tunes, here it's noticeably downgraded, overly saturated, and less fluid as if Warner Brothers didn't make the budget. The only animation I was fine with was the robot that helped Al-G Rhythm. The only thing I can really like from the Looney Tunes is the voice acting (except for Lola) and maybe a few creative jokes in the Looney Tunes world that actually feel like the Looney Tunes. And no I am not talking about the Big Chungus joke where he apparently becomes canon. And of course, the cameos in this movie are all a lie. They all stay way back in the game's crowd blurred away doing nothing but spectating. And the movie's soundtrack is just too cheesy with constant rap and pop songs. This sequel was truly a mistake, I'm sorry.",Space Jam - A New Legacy

LeBron is a much better actor than MJ, and the jokes in this movie are great. Don't get me wrong, it's not a perfect movie, there are some bits that drag or that I'd change, but overall this was a great time. People need to take their nostalgia glasses off and view this movie by it's own merit. The acting is better, graphics are better, writing is better, it's a better movie.

134,TheMovonka,Don't compare generations...,3,22 July 2021,"In short, Space Jam 2, is what it was expected. A modern, colorful, chaotic kids' movie following the legendary vibe of Michael Jordan saving the Loony Tunes by playing basketball to an unforgettable soundtrack. You have everything, from nice graphics, kids oriented jokes, a modernized story using the streaming and social media universe instead of the old hole on the golf court and the hint for the parents in the cinema, that big data algorithms making entertainment might not be the preferred future. Next to a lot of marketing for the Warner Bros movieverse, you recognize that it was really tried to catch the never aging charm of Bugs Bunny and co within a faster changing world. You even see in the senseless story, that today's kids are expected to have less attention span, hence everything must be in a hectic and fast pace.But well, it will entertain kids and it will earn its cost. What it can't be called is a worthy sequel. The original is timeless as it caught the perfect timing. Michael Jordan was on basketball cards in every kids' room from wherever to even Vienna and Chicago Bulls were heroes without having seen one game. Cartoons were on the edge of dying out but still accepted in cinemas, and with ""Believe I can fly"" we have a song that is still played on parties today. Now we have a lead actor that only a few will know around the world (not talking about US), the hype is over, we have other major sports and trademarks to follow and with all the cameos and references, there is not one charming connection to the original, despite disappointing comments. In summary, a nice kids movie but a poor tribute to the legend of Space Jam.",Space Jam - A New Legacy

137,pronitmallick,Only promotion,4,16 July 2021,"Space Jam: A New Legacy is a movie that starts with Warner Bros dropping their IP like Lebron James dunking baskets. The pacing seems fast in the beginning but it gets slowed down in the middle so that Warner Bros can show off their properties correctly and perfectly. Don Cheadle looks the most polishing one when it comes to acting, LeBron James have done it ok but Michael Jordan did a really good job when it came to getting mixed with the cartoons. In terms of story you can summarise it with just two words which is showing off IP's and making you a little emotional like it's hundred's of predecessors. In terms of fun there is loads of fun in the whole movie. Every scene of this movie is filled with characters that we cherished through our whole childhood and teenage years. Warner Bros did manage to make this movie a watchable one with your family on a weekend with their IP's but they definitely failed to catch our eyes with the story and the other stuff. Overall if you have time on the weekend and if you love Warner Bros characters, otherwise there are other films to watch on the onlineverse.",Space Jam - A New Legacy
138,veinctor,It wasn't that bad.,6,27 July 2021,"I don't like the Luney Tunes, Basketball or LeBron (I dont even know the guy). But I liked this movie. The first half was boring, as we see LeBron and his family trying to find an excuse to get to the toon world. But once they get there, the madness begins!To me this was like YuGioh. They play a silly game, with high stakes. They have to combine all kinds of styles one way or the other. So we have live action, then live action and 3D, live action and 2D animation, live action with 3D and 2D animation... every combination is there. Just like in YuGioh the monsters are real, or they get sucked into the game and so on and sto forth. So in my book this is fine, even if it has been done over and over in various media.Many reviewers complain about this movie being a big advertisement. But that was Batman the Lego Movie, Ready Player One and Ralph Breaks the Internet. They all have product placements, King Kong and Iron Giant. But they don't have Rick and Morty!Some others complain about the 3D Looney Tunes. I was fine with that, as the movie explores and experiments with a bunch of different graphical styles, like Into the Spider-Verse. My fav style was Wonder Woman/ Lola Bunny.The story is stupid. But the premise is stupid to begin with. What is the challenge of competing with a pro in their own game? If the protagonist was a soccer player that was forced to play basketball, then I can see the challenge.But yeah, it's a silly cheesy movie. What do you expect? It's the Looney Tunes.

It's a three-star movie because it did not live up to the first one, which is still my favorite but has some of the amazing effects and animation a movie has to offer.

Property. At the very least it's still superior to the awful RALPH WRECKS THE INTERNET, although that isn't saying much. Still, this film does have its assets. The concept of being trapped in some kind of virtual service world gives the film some vibes of the likes of TRON and even SWORD ART ONLINE. But of course the real highlight are the 2D animated sequences. Bugs Bunny and his co-stars are always a pleasure, and while the animation here lacks some of the 3D shading in places, these scenes are still a delight, particularly in sequences like a chase through DC City and a MATRIX scene. That said the film did lose me a bit in its last hour when the Looney Tunes turn into CG characters (in all fairness, though, at least there is context to it). Going in with low expectations I liked the movie more than I expected to, but it can't be elevated to anything other than mediocre at best.

147,pootc,A bombastic mess with great animation,3,15 July 2021,"Computer animation and special effects sure have come a long way since '96 because this movie looks fantastic. Unfortunately that's all folks (for the positives) because this '21 sequel is a bombastic mess, void of anything new and aside from the ""server-verse"" angle, it's not good.The original was never a masterpiece but it was just that - ""original"". The six writers decided not to actually write a movie and instead just copy ""Ready Player One"" by scouring and unloading the entire Warner Bros intellectual property catalogue on the audience to overload the senses and mask how unoriginal, unnecessary and contrived this all is.Lebron James and the cast put in a solid effort with what they've got to work with, especially Don Cheadle as the villain.The trouble with ""A New Legacy"" is that there isn't a story to warrant a sequel, let alone the whopping 115 minute runtime. The original was a swift 87 minutes which served as a celebration of Michael Jordan's return to basketball at the height of his popularity - it was lightning in a bottle!Kids and basketball fans who love LeBron James will surely like this movie. As previously said it looks great. It does hit the funny bone more than once, it has a soundtrack too and for some people that might be enough to call this a good time. If this were original and the first one I'd be more flexible in my rating but it's not. I've seen this movie before - it was better the first time.Bill Murray, you the real MVP!3/10.",Space Jam - A New Legacy

What more can you get out of this?Had any returning characters, even one, get character flanderization, I would have given it a flat out 1/10.This movie is more shameless with the self-advertising than even Wreck it Ralph 2.

152,Blazehgehg,I... did not expect to enjoy this as much as I did.,8,17 July 2021,"Based on the trailers that were put out, and then later clips from the movie itself, I figured this would take the appeal and bite of the Looney Tunes, sand down all the edges, and focus instead on making bland advertisement for everything else Warner Bros owns.And it... doesn't? I mean, parts of it do, I guess. The end of the first act is all about traversing the Warner Bros. Universe, interacting with The Matrix and Wonder Woman and all these other WB properties, but it never feels like the point of the movie in the way you get with, say, ""Ready Player One"" or ""Ralph Breaks the Internet.""The last comparison is of particular note, because in Disney's movie about a character on a network of branded properties, they chose to have Wreck-it Ralph exploit clickbait for money and make friends with a poor, down-on-his-luck pop-up advertisement. It felt gross, like Disney didn't want to create a conflict of interest with their marketing partners.By comparison, Space Jam: A New Legacy is about Warner Bros inventing a Youtube-esque algorithm to make all of their future movies. It then suggests that, in order to conquer the entertainment industry, they need to sign LeBron James and create a deepfake clone that will star in all Warner movies -- past, present, and future. The real LeBron rightfully says he thinks that idea is stupid, angering the algorithm and giving us our jumping off point for the story.I loved the idea of the algorithm as the movie's villain, and A New Legacy doesn't shy away from making jabs at problems with data privacy and digital rights ownership.This is a movie that has its tongue lodged firmly in cheek. For some, I could see how this could lead them to not connecting with the movie. A New Legacy is big on making fun of something for being bad, while also doing the exact things it's making fun of. I mean, consider what I just said: LeBron James rejects the Warner Bros pitch because he thinks sports stars in movies is dumb, but the whole movie is basically what The Algorithm was trying to make. That kind of double-meta self-aware humor is this whole movie's bread and butter, and either you're in to that, or you aren't.Even the CGI-ification of the Looney Tunes themselves, where they get ""upgraded"" from traditional cartoon animation to 3D computer graphics is played for meta humor. The Tunes look at themselves, now with realistic fur and skin, and sneer in disgust. It echos the sentiment I saw from some on social media. The movie is drawing attention to its own marketing gimmick and trying to get you to believe that they don't like it either. Whether that's true or not is buried under too many layers of production bureaucracy to know for sure, so I advise you to not think about it too hard. In that light, I thought it was fun, and it at least shows they knew their audience.Which is the whole movie, really. I'm pretty sure I had more fun watching A New Legacy than I would have if I went back and watched the original Space Jam. It's not a perfect movie, and when it does lean in to the pop-culture parade, it's definitely at its worst. But overall, it hit almost every note I could have asked for.",Space Jam - A New Legacy

157,cagebox111,Cringy,2,9 August 2021,"A very bad movie and one that only young children or Lebron James apologists will even slightly enjoy. The beginning of the movie before it all goes into the toon world is atrocious. James' acting is terrible and the written is beyond cliché. There is some enjoyment in just seeing the classic Looney Toones characters and brief appearances from some DC Superheroes, Scooby Doo, Space Ghost and other Warner Brothers characters. But the actual movie is garbage. The original Space Jam isn't high quality but it is at least fun. This is just dumb and you don't need to shove how great Lebron James is down my throat. Greatest athlete in the world? I suppose it's arguably true but I think it's a stretch to say he is still the greatest basketball player in the world let alone greatest athlete in the world. We all know Michael Jordan is a more legendary figure, in his personality and his game, and Lebron's Space Jam is just a cash grab on what was a beloved kid's film.

I find it's usually the stuff aimed at the younger demographic that's always stuffed to the brim with logos and big names; they just love shoving it all in the faces of those young, undeveloped minds, don't they?Space Jam 2 goes down as another example of the many failed reboot cash-grab attempts that have flooded the industry in recent years.That's the reason I always find myself seeking out indie films these days, far more originality than anything the mainstream can muster up (no product placement either).Want a tip? Just forget this film ever existed and go and watch the original. It's 25-years-old and is still far more fresh and gripping than this drivel, it actually had focus on the Looney Tunes as opposed to the ball-bouncing protagonist; and the story was far more entertaining.",Space Jam - A New Legacy

The story lacked originality but it was an ok family friendly movie with a message to young adults to always believe in your yourself and not to give up. The animation was top of the line but you feel as though you are watching a lego movie that is commercialized with all on WB movies they have ever created like Harry Potter, LOTR, and DC characters. The rest of the cast included Lil Rey, Sarah Silverman, and Anthony Davis. The characters were voiced by Rosario Dawson, Zendaya as Lola Bunny, and Gabriel Iglesias.

166,nlgthunder,I don't think it's as terrible as everyone says...,6,27 July 2021,...Maybe that's because I just saw the original space jam for the first time right before the sequel. So I carried literally zero expectations. I'm thinking that may have helped me out some.It was fine. Lebron plays a real a-hole for a lot of the movie. Why he signed up for this script is a little beyond me. I wasn't mad at the concept of traveling around Warner Bros films. At least they were overt in plugging their stuff rather than slipping product placements throughout and thinking we all won't notice. It was a relatively cute idea but also cheesy as all get out.I will say the Looney tunes gang was missing some of their original zing which was disappointing.

168,kingbk-2,An Airball of a Sequel,4,16 July 2021,"Let's be honest: the original Space Jam was not a great movie. It holds nostalgia in our eyes because it starred the greatest basketball player of all time next to some of our favorite cartoons. However, the original Space Jam looks like a classic compared to this overly produced mess of a sequel.First off, let's get something straight. LeBron James is an amazing basketball player and he's very popular with young adults. However, he does not have the same aura about him that Michael Jordan did. MJ came at a time when being a celebrity wasn't so ubiquitous like it is now with the Internet and social media. Also, media is so fragmented now that we really don't have those ""shared"" experiences like we once did. EVERYONE knew MJ and the Chicago Bulls, basketball fans or not. I'm not sure LeBron has that same appeal. Also, even if people didn't like MJ, they respected him. Maybe it's because he gets political, or maybe because he switches teams, I don't know why, but LeBron is much more polarizing. Maybe it's just the cultural climate we live in today, but there are a lot of people who straight up don't like the guy.The second thing is how corporate this movie is. So many product placements and pseudo commercials all over the place. It takes people out of the story and makes it feel like you are just watching endless commercials for 120 minutes.Third, 120 minutes is way too long for families. 90 minutes or less. Kids loss attention after that. So do adults.This movie is fine if you are looking for something to do for 2 hours, but there are better ways to spend that time than watching a lukewarm, unnecessary, over the top commercial showcase designed as a sequel to Space Jam.",Space Jam - A New Legacy

The cameos in this movie are great. Space Jam: A New Legacy is not as good as the original but it is still good. I love all the stuff to do with Warner Brothers and their movies and the Warner 3000. This movie looks impressive. Porky Pig is my favorite Looney Tunes character. The Notorious P. I. G. Joke was funny. I liked when they went and recruited all of the Looney Tunes characters from the different Warner Brothers movies. LeBron James' acting is questionable but that's alright. I watched most of this movie yesterday besides, the last 20 minutes. I had to finish the last 20 minutes today because I went to go see Cruella in the movie theater before I could finish this movie but the point is, I like Space Jam: A New Legacy more than Cruella. I know people hate this movie but being a fan of the first Space Jam, the Looney Tunes and movies in general. I had a great time. I didn't really care about LeBron James' fake son in the movie, Dom or the Goon Squad. I don't like modern music or a lot of stuff apart of current culture so I didn't like LeBron dabbing or the new jersey's but I am happy that when the Tunes and LeBron are training they wear the original jerseys. I do not like LeBron James and his acting was questionable to bad and I wanted Michael Jordan to reprise his role instead of LeBron James but I really like the Looney Tunes. I can see some problems with the movies but I just don't care, I was very surprised that this movie is actually good and I really enjoyed it.Overall, Space Jam: A New Legacy is not as good as the first but it was better than I expected.

193,SouthernViews,Is it Product Placement or Nostalgia?,8,2 August 2021,"I decided to watch the original Space Jam before watching this new one. I have to say I found it to be clunky and boring at times. Let's just say it hasn't aged well. Viewing it left such a bad impression that I waited a few weeks before watching the sequel.My expectations for the movie were low, given the many horrible reviews. After a slow start, the film took off and found its groove. I found myself laughing out loud several times. When done, I went and read the reviews. I don't get why there is so much hate. Nor why there is so much love for the original. Two key points I'd like to make.1) Many complained ""this is just product placement"" given the wealth of Warner television and movies scattered throughout the story. I have to wonder if these are the same people that were in awe of the same level of product in ""Ready Player One."" I guess that movie tugged at ""nostalgia,"" but this one is only ""product placement."" Whatever. I didn't see it that way at all. Warner crammed this movie with so many Easter Eggs it will take multiple viewings and endless pause/rewind to find them. Just check out the endless YouTube videos out there listing what others have found. Personally, I absolutely LOVED this aspect of the movie.2) The original Looney Tunes cartoons often operated on two levels. Kids got the slapstick fun and silly gags. Adults often caught a different set of jokes targeted at them. So, when people complain about ""Why are there these adult movie references in a kids movie?"" The answer is simple - the joke is for the parents.I rated this movie an 8/10 because I think kids will have a blast. There's a heartwarming story woven throughout the film. The VFX are fantastic. I also feel the Warner references show a huge level of care and detail put into the script. Lebron does a fine acting job. IMO it runs about 15 minutes too long and could have used a bit more editing to improve the pace. Otherwise, it's a blast.",Space Jam - A New Legacy
194,skylermoore,Boring,3,18 July 2021,"I guess on a larger scale of rating this would be a higher 3/10. Something closer to a 4. The original space jam wasn't great, but it felt good. It had fun with its self and it did justice to the Looney toons franchise. It wasn't a masterpiece but it's a beloved classic. Space Jam A New Legacy doesn't do any of that. It feels like a stretched out advertisment that lasts 2 hours. There's maybe 1...2??? Jokes that made me at least grin. They make the Looney's 3D for no reason and nothing quite makes sense. The acting across the board is bad. Don Cheadle played about as good as he could with his character and it lacks any soul or purpose other than basically stroking Lebron's ego. There was no reason for a sequel, but the fact they got 6 writers to write and come up with this is beyond amazing tbh. Worth a watch if you have HBO Max already I guess but don't pay anything for this.",Space Jam - A New Legacy
195,Millennialprince,Passable family film,6,2 October 2021,"You know for a movie with six credited writers it's almost a miracle Space Jam 2 is as coherent as it is. I credit that to Malcolm Lee's assured direction and LeBron James' innate charisma. Although James isn't a master thespian he has screen presence, more so than Michael Jordan. The film starts with a similar framing device like the first film, where you have a quasi-autobiography involving the main character as a child. It establishes that he pushed his son to achieve and he's become something of an overachiever. He neglects his son and doesn't support his passion for video games. So the film has some emotional stakes before you get into the Looney Tune world. The Looney tune sequences are a lot of fun, and they get a lot of mileage out of the sight gags.There are some clever sight gags like Wile E. Coyote and Road runner in the Mad Max Fury Road universe, or Lola Bunny playing tournaments in the Wonder Woman universe. This film is very similar to Ready Player One, since that you have various characters interacting with various universes owned by Warner Bros. I will concede that this is Warner Bros advertising their IP, but none of this bothers me, since a lot of the gags were plot specific. Alas, not all the gags work like the Porky pig rap, or the matrix spoof, but the film doesn't linger on this for too long, and part of the reason this works for me is that the film is very self aware about what kind of film it is. So if you're a millennial like me, and you have nostalgia for the original Space Jam, you might enjoy this film since this has the same spirit as the first film. Space Jam 2 is far from masterpiece, but for what it is it's a fun family film.",Space Jam - A New Legacy

Conclusion - SJ2 was really entertaining and actually better than the original. The first half of SJ2 was a bit dry but set up a good theme. The second half really stepped it up making the story complete and satisfying. The effects, animation, cultural references, cameos and humor worked for me.James put in a good performance, as he did more just say the lines written for him. He certainly won't win ""Best Actor"" but he seemed very much engaged and convincing as a father who has to learn how to allow his son to be his own best self.

205,jediforce10,A legacy of awfulness,2,16 July 2021,"Being a huge fan of the original Space Jam, a sequel wasn't generally a bad idea but I never saw any reason for there to be one. Perhaps one could argue a sequel can work if you got the right talent, the right sports star for it, and a solid plot. It could be possible to do something like this, but you'd need to find all the right things.Space Jam 2 doesn't have any of those elements at all. The film is a complete mess from start to finish. It really has no reason to exist at all. If anything, it makes me wonder why anyone bothered with this in the first place at all. It's painfully obvious though that the film is trying to cash in on nostalgia for those who loved the original Space Jam film. Sure, Space Jam definitely had its weird moments but at least it worked and was fun and entertaining; much more than this film.The first strike against this film is who they chose to be the sports star. So they want to stick with a basketball player, so who do they choose? Somebody fantastic and loved by lots of people? Like maybe Tim Duncan, Dirk Nowitzki, or Kobe Bryant? Nope! Make way for Lebron James. Why he was chosen is beyond me when I felt there were other better choices is beyond. That's only the beginning of the problems with the movie though.If you thought Michael Jordan's wooden acting was bad in the first film, Lebron James is somehow worse. Lebron is either taking things too seriously or is trying too hard to be funny. Jordan's acting was wooden yes, but at least some of the deadpan deliveries got some chuckles from me. Here, James is trying too hard to be serious or funny without balancing it out.The other actors are okay for the most part; given the material they've got to work with. Some of them are good like Bugs and Daffy being pretty good. But the acting in general is really nothing to write home about. It's just passable at its best.Most of the problems with the acting though can be attributed to the awful script. The dialogue is repetitive and it gets tiring really fast. Lebron constantly saying he has to save his son or, more annoyingly, the constant gushing over Lebron James himself. I know the original Space Jam definitely gushed on Michael Jordan, but good lord does this film take it to another level. The movie has to remind us again and again how good Lebron James is, and it gets sickening quickly.Equally bad is the comedy in this movie. The first film's comedy did have some awkward moments in it, but a lot of the jokes worked well and still stand up well to this day. The jokes in this movie are instantly dated or are tiresome. Hearing Granny say ""haters gonna hate"" just felt cringe worthy and a lot of the visual gags just makes you want to roll your eyes. The only slightly good joke was Sam shooting those basketballs; it got a slight chuckle from me.The CGI and cartoon effects look good for the most part. However, the Looney Tuns don't work out well in the 3D portions. They all look rather poorly designed and facial models (particularly Bugs and Lola) look off and jarring. The other designs are fine for the most part though.The film relies heavily on a lot of winks and nods to other WB properties such as The Iron Giant, some appearances of Harry Potter for some reason, Austin Powers, or A Clockwork Orange. They don't add anything to the movie overall; nor does it serve any purpose aside from some poor fan service. If anything, seeing those characters will remind you there are better films you could be watching than this.The story overall is just an utter bore. The whole movie plays it in a generic way that has very little creative twists or turns. There's very little creativity in this film and the whole movie ends up being by the numbers in how it plays out. There is one twist that may get you off guard, but not by much. There's no sense of fun, no entertainment, and no joy. It just feels boring and dreary.The original Space Jam definitely had its problems for sure, but at least it felt like a fun film that was tongue in cheek entertainment for everyone involved. This movie though feels like it has only one demographic being targeted; very little kids, and I do mean very little. Even then, kids would be more entertained with almost any other movie than this.Do yourself a favor and forget this film happened. Go watch the first Space Jam with Michael Jordan. While that film has its own problems, it can at least still entertain and give some great laughs. This film really serves no point at all other than to be a cheap cash grab. The only legacy this film has is one of wasting your time and being an overall failure.",Space Jam - A New Legacy
206,AllanSmitheee,Amazing? No. A good time? Yes.,7,23 July 2021,"A lot of reviews seem to take issue with A New Legacy not being ""like the original"" (and perhaps LeBron James rightfully insulting a certain so-called ""politician""). I may not be blinded by nostalgia but let's be real, Space Jam isn't, well, the classic everyone thinks it is. I'm a 90s kid and I didn't think much of it then either. Trailers for the sequel played in front of nearly everything I saw the past couple months, and I've just about had it. Until I actually saw it. By no means is this a masterpiece but it sure is a lot of fun.The script - by six credited writers (four of whom receive story credit) - isn't winning any awards anytime soon (except maybe a Razzie), but the hackneyed cliches and tropes can be easily overlooked by a quality performance by LeBron James, his acting chops previously seen in 2015's Trainwreck, and Don Cheadle, who clearly knows what he's working with and spares no time in hamming it up far past eleven. The only real nitpick I have cast-wise is Zendaya as Lola Bunny. Now I'm a ""Zswagger"", having enjoyed her past work (Euphoria, The Greatest Showman and the Marvel Cinematic Universe), but the in-jokes at the previous, albeit standalone, film would have fared more comfortably with Kath Soucie.James plays a fictionalized version of himself, father of three, his youngest son Dom is a tech prodigy who doesn't want to follow in Dad's footsteps. While at Warner Bros. Studios, Dom is lured into the ""Serververse"" by rogue artificial intelligence Al-G-Rhythm (get it?), who wagers LeBron to a basketball game wherein his and Dom's freedom depends on winning. Upon being thrown through virtual space to Tune World, LeBron, now in 2D animation (hopefully, we'll get more of that in the near future), meets Bugs Bunny and learns that the other Tunes have been exploring other realities, persuaded by Al-G.Up to this point, it was all merely self-aware. Here, it takes being a WB product and kicking it right in the ""balls"". The realities are other assorted Warner-owned properties, including but not limited to, DC Comics, Harry Potter, Animaniacs, Hanna-Barbera, The Wizard of Oz and a number of considerably more adult-oriented franchises, i.e. Game of Thrones, RoboCop, Mad Max, The Matrix, Austin Powers, and Rick and Morty. But the barrage of cameos doesn't stop there; a blink-and-you'll-miss-it shows Bugs transforming into Internet meme Big Chungus, and at the big game, Beetlejuice, The Mask, the Gremlins, Pennywise, the Droogs from the ultraviolent Kubrick thriller A Clockwork Orange and (this still baffles me) Sister Jeanne of Ken Russell's highly controversial (and WB's equivalent of how Disney feels about Song of the South) The Devils. Her appearance is far more frequent and leaves one to wonder if the studio plans to acknowledge the film in any capacity anytime soon.In the long run, Space Jam: A New Legacy, while not necessarily good, is regardless entertaining. It's like Ready Player One or any given MCU movie: don't expect anything substantial, just go with it and have fun pointing out the Easter eggs. 3.5/5.",Space Jam - A New Legacy
207,datoneman,So shockingly bad it makes me sad to even rate it this low very cringy movie.,1,17 July 2021,"Within the first 2 minutes it was cool, within 5 mins of the movie it was just like a video tribute to him just with creative editing not a good look at all, within 15 minutes clearly they promo for Nike was to extra like ok we get he is apart of Nike, now the acting from James himself was awful very cringy most of the time clearly whoever decided to make this movie didn't factor that in at all they could have use it's real wife n kids to draw more of a real emotion out of him ijs, then the way Don Chino look like ugggh I personally hate the upgrade to the jerseys that's just me AD as a hawk or eagle then to use the WNBA players like they did was awful I hate that part with a serious passion they could have use them better alot better and actually use them as the women that they are very distasteful the voice for Lola threw me off big time the way they even use some of the looney toons was a head scratcher they could have kept Pepe Le Pew frfr they when they got to the actual game jaw dropping back to back cornball lines very basic ABC-ish it's a kids movie I think but woooooow this was awful the acting was so bad it took away from the plot of the movie in my opinion it just seem like a movie gear more towards James then I guess whatever the point was suppose to be I didn't even finish looking at the movie I was so ashamed of it I like the call back to the mon-stars but other then that I can't say I like anything about the movie then the son walking away from him while he talking to him at that point I was saying to my self bruuuuuh Hollywood need to stop it lol no way in the world that's happening without putting a hand or hands on him to stop him slow him down or you know but that's how unrealistic this movie came off as at least with the original space jam you wanted to or felt like you could be in the movie or that could happen to you this one was very cringy.",Space Jam - A New Legacy
208,jaredkjacoby,Not Quite a Slam Dunk...,6,19 July 2021,"LeBron James is trying to get his son Dom to get into basketball, but Dom is much more interested in gaming, to the point where he creates his own video game. When they go on a trip to the Warner Bros. Studio, they get into an argument and they find themselves in an evil computer A. I. known as Al-G Rhythm. Al-G forces LeBron into a basketball game with his own son and sends him to Tune World. There, he meets Bugs Bunny who misses his friends after they went to different worlds. Bugs agrees to help LeBron get his son back and the two gather the gang for the game.I have been waiting for this film for a long time. I am a huge fan of Looney Tunes and I have always wanted to see them on the big screen ever since I was a kid. For that, this was one of my more anticipated movies of the year just for its source material. It was the one movie that I told myself that I was going to watch in theaters no matter what news or reviews came about. All that said, the first film is not all that special to me, but it was a nice crossover between basketball and Looney Tunes. This sequel makes for a much bigger crossover. Is it a slam dunk, or does this big budget juggernaut miss the goal?Space Jam: A New Legacy is a mixed bag. The story is where the film falls apart the most. There are too many cooks in this kitchen. It tries to be about basketball, LeBron's legacy, Warner Bros' film catalogue, the big game inside Dom's video game, the Looney Tunes and the fractured relationship between LeBron and his son. There is so much happening in this film at such a fast pace, that it is hard to make out what is happening a lot of the time. It is over reliant on references and some of them are pretty bad. Did we really need an Austin Powers reference? Some of them are not too bad. Seeing Foghorn Leghorn ride a dragon in the GoT world was awesome and both DC worlds were great. One reminded me of the DCAU and the other was animated like a comic book. However, they come off as more of an excuse to show how many IPs WB has than to show how the Tunes got separated. The third act is when the movie finally regains focus and the game itself is quite exciting.The humor is hit and miss. There are some horribly cringeworthy scenes where they try to modernize the characters, but there are plenty of scenes that put a smile on my face. There is a scene with Roadrunner and Wile that made me crack up and almost anything Bugs did put a smile on my face aside from the one scene. When the Looney Tunes get to act like themselves, that is where this film shines. Some of the humor from LeBron and Cheadle cracked me up too. They know how ridiculous this film is and they give it their all. The best gag is one involving Michael Jordan. The emotional moments are unbelievably cheesy and sappy, but not to the extent of Tom and Jerry. There were a few scenes where I got a little sad. Seeing Bugs so deflated is just depressing for me. The ending made me even sadder. It helps that they are at least well acted and that the relationships between the characters are done decently enough to get some emotion. Yeah, I was into this film more than I should have been.As for the characters, I like the way Bugs Bunny is portrayed in this film much more than in the original Space Jam. He has so much more personality and wackiness while playing a bigger role in the story. The scene where he first meets LeBron and messes with him is one of my favorite scenes of the year so far. He is painting tunnels, he is tricking Marvin into taking his ship and he even says ""this means war"" at one point. He is also much tougher here than in the first Space Jam as he is the only one that sees through the villain's plan and tries to go against him. If you are not a fan of him, he also gets a couple scenes where he is the brunt of the slapstick so he is not invincible. He even gets a few emotional scenes that work such as missing his Looney friends. This is my favorite portrayal of Bugs Bunny in a Looney Tunes film so far and they nailed his character... except for the scene where he dances to a pop song that made me want to throw something at the screen. Jeff Bergman gives his best performance as Bugs. He brings this character to life any time he voices the rabbit and this film is no exception. I was kind of disappointed that Eric Bauza was not voicing him at first because I love Bauza's take on Bugs in Looney Tunes Cartoons, but Bergman killed it in this role by showing the range Bugs has in his personality. He deserves a lot more credit than he got. If there is one thing I will firmly defend about this film, it is the way Bugs was handled and voiced in this film.Unfortunately, the other Tunes are a mixed bag. The best cartoon characters in the film are Wile E. Coyote, Granny, Daffy Duck, Tweety and Taz. Wile in particular is really funny. He has no lines and yet he probably got the most laughs out of everyone. He also gets a few awesome moments that I did not expect. Granny does too as she goes up against this huge virtual basketball team. Taz has the coolest basketball play out of everyone. Daffy Duck makes for a funny coach while getting the most stylish outfit. Roadrunner actually gets a scene where he gets humiliated which is surprising because he is arguably the most invincible main LT character. A lot of the other characters are wasted though. Gossamer, Yosemite Sam and Elmer Fudd get so little to do. Gossamer does not even get a scene of him joining the squad! I am not sure if Foghorn Leghorn got to do anything in the game. Speedy could have been used a little more, especially when you take his voice actor in consideration. Sylvester gets hardly any screen time at all. Marvin does not even join the game. Even Daffy could have gotten a bit more screen time. The biggest wasted potential of all however is Lola Bunny. She is made more of an action girl than last time, but they give hardly any focus to her relationship with Bugs or improve on her personality from the first film. She is more supportive of her team at least, but I wanted to see more scenes between her in Bugs. The one good thing is that she does have a soft spot for family, but they should have done more with her character.Voice-acting wise, all of it is great from the talented voice cast. Eric Bauza voices Daffy, Foghorn, Porky, Elmer and Marvin and he crushes it. Bauza is a very talented voice actor because he can capture the voices of the characters perfectly, especially Daffy. In addition to Bugs, Bergman also voices Sam and Sylvester, but gets little to work with them. Bob Bergen is solid as Tweety. I really liked Candi Milo as the sassy Granny here. I also liked Gabriel Iglesias as Speedy and I would not mind seeing him voice the character some more. Then there is Zendaya as Lola Bunny. She is fine in the role, but I prefer Kath Soucie's take on Lola. Heck, I would have loved to have seen Kristen Wiig come back as Lola, but Zendaya gives a sweet performance as the character that fits the friendly tone of the character. However, she did not need to be the only voice actress credited in the ads. Overall, the voice cast is fantastic and they brought these characters to life.As for the human characters, they are not bad at all. LeBron James is fine in the movie. He has more fun here than Michael Jordan did in the original. He has better chemistry with Bugs and he embraces the silliness of the movie. I liked his arc with his son more than I thought I would. It has a good message about letting your child be them. Don Cheadle unsurprisingly steals the show as Al-G though. He does not give a damn. He just hams it up entirely and I loved it. He made for a much better villain than Swackhammer. I did not expect Cheadle to act this hammy in the film, but his presence makes it a lot more fun. He is also charismatic and easy-going when he needs to be. The goon squad is cool on paper, but I just do not see them fitting in the world of Looney Tunes the way the Monstars did. While the team does make for a fun antagonistic team for the Tunes to go against, the players themselves seem out of place.The visuals look fantastic. Just seeing 2D animation is exciting enough, but it is so fluid and energetic, that it felt like watching a Looney Tunes short. The expressions are fantastic and the slapstick works for the most part. Animated LeBron is a lot of fun and they did not waste his design at all. They put him at the brunt of slapstick and play around with his animated design the way they do with other characters. I wish the whole film was 2D. That said, even the 3D animation looks great. The Tunes look solid in their transitions for the most part, the goon squad have wicked designs and the court feels like a huge high stakes game. Again, the animation and expressions look great and there are even some funny jokes about their transitions such as Bugs' disdain for it. The basketball game itself is a ton of fun and every character from both teams gets to utilize their abilities to their advantage in the game. The soundtrack is good, but I like the first film's soundtrack better. Nothing popped out the way the first film's music did.Space Jam: A New Legacy is a tough movie for me to grade. On one hand, I had a good amount of fun in the theater and just seeing Bugs Bunny and Daffy Duck on the big screen is a dream come true for me as a fan of these characters. That being said, the movie is a freaking mess. It relies too much on references and there is too much going on in the story. I know that some reviewers have torn this film apart, but I cannot bring myself to dislike it because I enjoyed my time with it too much. That being said, it is hard to recommend this movie to pay money to see it in theaters because it has a lot of problems that cartoon to movie adaptations have along with heavy-handed crossovers. If for nothing else, I am happy that I got to see some of my favorite characters in theaters.",Space Jam - A New Legacy
209,willcrabbe,Just painful,2,17 July 2021,"Space Jam: A New Legacy is a soulless and joyless experience that doesn't even succeed at being entertaining in any way. While the original Space Jam (1996) was also a corporate cash grab, it at least had a distinct sense of charm and fun that is severely lacking here. The film felt more like a 2 hour long advertisement for the various properties that Warner Brother own than an actual film. The references to R-rated properties such as Mad Max, The Matrix and Game of Thrones seem out of place for a family film (cynics could say the film is targeted at millennials)The plot centres around the strained relationship between LeBron James' relationship with his youngest son Dom, who wants to be a video game developer rather than a basketballer like his Dad. After the two are sucked into the 'Warnerverse' they are pitted against one another in a game of basketball based on the game Dom has been developing ('Domball'). This is not an emotionally investing storyline mainly due to James' stilted performance which may be worse than Michael Jordan's in the original. I guess there is a positive parental message here regarding letting your kids chase their own dreams rather than impose your own onto them. It could have been executed much better though.I like to find the positives where I can, and the animation and CGI in the film is really vibrant and pops off the screen. It's easily the highlight of the film but unfortunately it has nothing to back it up with - I found the film exceptionally tedious and the jokes were mostly cringeworthy and unfunny. The most humour I got out of the experience was how awfully brazen and out-of-place a lot of references were. Pennywise the Clown and the Night King enjoying a game of basketball? Rick and Morty dropping off the Tasmanian Devil onto the heroes? What even was going on in this film?Really I can't recommend this film in any capacity. It's an overly long and thoroughly dull slog through Warner Brothers self-congratulatory vanity project that seems to lack any sense of self-awareness.

There were a few laughs, and the opening montage was nostalgic of the original Space Jam. And the people who said this movie was basically about showcasing LeBron's talent were right, but the original did the same for Michael Jordan. I don't expect basketball players to be phenomenal actors and neither should anyone. I did enjoy the Michael B. Jordan cameo and all the universe references which was a funny twist. Even some adult films like Mad Max and Austin Powers! Definitely didn't expect that in this movie. Some might call it pandering, but I guess I enjoy being pandered to.",Space Jam - A New Legacy

224,ryanwesthamfan,Don't listen to the critics this is a fun movie,7,16 July 2021,"The Good- This is a great return for the Looney Tunes characters. There are certain jokes and quirks that absolutely work in here and there isn't really any character here that falls flat. Everything about the Looney Tunes characters is amazing and I have missed seeing these characters on the big screen. The animation is great as always and the CGI works when it's needed to. The actual basketball match is great when these characters are going completely bonkers it is so much fun to watch. I smiled and laughed throughout the whole film which is all I was really looking to get out of this film. Don Cheadle was a lot of fun in this role as well.The Bad- I didn't think LeBron James was that good in this role his acting just felt very fake or forced especially in the emotionally heavy moments. I wish that it wasn't completely focused on LeBron and more on the Looney Tunes much like the original.Overall Thoughts- Space Jam: A New Legacy is a fun movie, it's not a perfect film but neither is the original. It brought the Looney Tunes characters back on the big screen and did them justice, although I'd have loved to of seen them to be more of the main focus of the story. I miss these types of movies and this brings back a lot of nostalgia. Overall I'm going to give ""Space Jam: A New Legacy"" a 7/10.",Space Jam - A New Legacy
225,phil_doucet,"Low expectations, well exceeded!",8,17 July 2021,Go into this with low expectations and the intention of having a good time and you will enjoy it. Inside jokes were great and only recognizable to an NBA/Lebron fan and although the story is not exactly original per say the animations were fantastic.I have a feeling the bad reviews are coming from bitter Lebron haters. I'm not a Lebron fan on the court but off the court he's great. The new Toon Squad jerseys/unis are outstanding and I was entertained from start to the finish. I won't spoil it here but the movie even had a moment where I got chills. All I'm going to say about that.This is not the place to show your hate for Lebron or debate the Lebron/MJ GOAT status. Just enjoy the movie for what it is. Having said all of that what's missing is a soundtrack like the original or even a hit song but long gone are those days of movies producing chart topping songs let alone soundtracks.,Space Jam - A New Legacy

This film is not that. It resembles a slave auction, where the evil master WB puts all their slaves (IPs) up for a humiliating display? It is a brutal, demeaning, animal process, which is what this movie ends up being, too. If you've ever liked a fictional character, seeing them in this movie makes you like them less.

In fact, me & my lad quite enjoyed spotting the characters in the crowd during the big game. Sadly, they aren't integral to the plot so don't really hold weight when it comes to giving a rating.I can safely say I will neverwatch this movie again of my own volition.

We figured the movie would become watchable at this point. It didn't.I managed to avoid the original, despite buying hundreds of original movies a year on VHS when that came out. Figured it wasn't for me. Should have kept my guard up I guess, getting old made me weak.I hope this Le Bron James fellow (not sure I spelled that correctly, I'm European, so to me he's just a name I've vaguely heard of) got paid his weight in platinum for this.

233,evrivali,Very entertaining,7,11 July 2021,The movie is great and if I dare to say even better than the original. The movie is full of pop culture references and it's really funny if you belong in the adult audience. It has its fair share of 3D and 2D animation and the main idea is more promising than the original. It's actually less stupid and more satisfying to watch because everything in the plot is built with much more care than the original space jam which is cool and all but it barely fills its 90 minute duration. Space jam a new legacy is 2 full hours and you have something cool to watch every minute. I really wasn't looking forward to watching it but I'm glad I did. It's a very nice family movie with respect to the original.,Space Jam - A New Legacy

237,yorktown_hawk,It's baaaaaad.,1,17 July 2021,"Is there like a prerequisite to overuse CGI nowadays?The original was good because the story was simple, akin to the Looney Toons cartoon series, and the cameos from the other NBA players were simple and light-hearted. The only CGI was the obvious putting the real-world characters into the Looney Toones cartoon setting.In this abomination, for starters the name of the movie doesn't even relate to the theme. It's a cash grab off past glories.There is no mention of outer space in this, WHICH IS HOW THE ORIGINAL GOT ITS NAME. Instead this trash was set inside a computer (game) system. Not even remotely close to outer space.Turning the Looney Toons into 3D stop motion animation was just trying too hard to modernise something that didn't need modernising.LeBron was stiff and too sentimental. The sentiment wasn't needed. Even though MJ was the star attraction of the original, the plot wasn't about him per se. However in this product-placed trash, the movie is all about Lebron and how he's a superior individual who can still be better. Yawn, seen it a thousand times already.The family were just far too perfect too. Except for the son who created the game. He was too self-entitled. Just totally unrelatable, the whole lot of them.The video game was a complete rip-off of NBA Jam too. Didn't try to hide it either.Having the teams scoring in the thousands was just dumb.Fortunately, the kids will be naive to the original and not see how flawed the plot of this abomination combined with LeBron's cardboard acting and they'll probably enjoy the OTT antics of the Looney Toons in this.

I've seen many people complaining about the cameos and refferences... but that was a good part too, Ready Player One has a lot of that and no one says nothing bad about it; references and cameos appart, the animation and overall story is good and pretty enjoyable for everyone; classic humor can be seen everywhere with the Looney Tunes and many other jokes told. And the match had such action and intense moments alongside the 3D animation characters that are very good (yeah, that's for the haters of Lola's redesing, she's still good).But as this had all that good, there was only 1 thing that tooke me out of the movie completely and it was everytime Lola talked... let me explain. In my country (Spain) they decided to cast Lola Bunny with a Star Talent named Lola Indigo... and she breaks the moment that the movie tries to build, fun, sadness or even the speech in mid-time is runined by her Star Talent voice (Zendaya at least did it great, for sure).Ejoyable?

Granted, the first wasn't a Oscar winning piece, but it was watchable and exciting.We open up with LeBron as a child, more interested in his GameBoy. Coach takes his video games away as it isn't helping and say's basketball will help your mother.Mr James ( or King James, uggh as he is called over and over)asks his son, who is developing a video game, if he wants to tag along.to the Warner Brothers lot to listen in on a supposed project. At this time, we meet Don Cheadle's character inside the computer (yes, it is really that confusing.)Don Cheadle wants to play a basketball game. If you win, you are free, I win, you stay with me in here forever. So, James and Bugs Bunny go on a search to find the Loony Tunes characters.That is the movie. Assembling the ""team"" then playing a game. The movie is chocked full of every single Warner Media character. It got to a point where it was super frustrating seeing so much brand product placement. Sure, Disney does Hidden Mickey's, but that is less subtle. Seeing It the clown and The Mask were too distracting in the crowd. In fact, there was an overly long, awkward Austin Powers bit which did not fit except being owned by Warner.. At one point, I figured I'm watching a giant ad for HBO Max.One more thing that annoyed me, Lebron can not act! I wanted to leave, but I forced myself to watch this.

Alas, it wasn't even close. The story sucked, the actors, oh well (they're not actors, right? But then why do they act...). No coherence, no character developing, not even enough cartoon moments, no real laughs, nothing to keep you watching. Yes everything is cartoonish, but besides the names and facial features there is nothing reminding me of my childhood's heroes. Also no basketball (I mean real basketball). To my utter disappointment Warner Bros managed to produce a sequel to Space Jam, which is even worse than the first one (and that's no easy task).It is simply one of the worst movies I watched lately, and I am certain, that it wouldn't have made it to the theaters without LeBron's name.

I thought Lebron acted well for not having a lot of movies under his belt and he was funny in Trainwreck so I gave him the benefit of the doubt with this movie.

259,MarkoutTV,Low expectations is key,5,22 July 2021,"I expected to scoff at this entire movie and instead I only scoffed at the first third. The premise of Lebron's son being some NBA Jam inventing wunderkind, and Lebron being the regimented dad who couldn't see the literal genius behind him was just so dumb. It was the most paint by numbers ""I think I know what kids are into"" setup they could have went with, and Lebron's acting only made it sillier.But once they got into the Looney Tune world, there were some decent chuckles. I'm a sucker for the Looney-style slapstick and some of the references to other WB properties landed, even if most were lazy. People consider the gratuitous referencing/advertising to be ruinous to the movie, forgetting their was a scene in the original where Daffy kissed his own ass with a Warner Brothers logo on it. At least there was more effort than THAT in this one.The best parts of the movie are Lebron and Bugs gathering the Looney Tunes team together. The stuff before that was awful. After, the game itself went too long and there wasn't as much comedy as I was expecting there, but it was fine. Not nearly as entertaining as the original but I'd say it did it's job. And the ending was just there. Nothing to it.Overall though I think there is plenty of stuff here for kids to enjoy and JUST enough old school Looney humor and references to make adults not hate their lives watching the movie. I think it's overhated by the weirdos that can't stop with Jordan/Lebron debates. Just take the movie for what it is, and it's not ""good"" but it's enjoyable.Which is exactly what I would say about the original, by the way.",Space Jam - A New Legacy

263,nicky-43953,Reboot or Sequel?,6,16 July 2021,"I got very confused thinking whether this is a reboot or a sequel because of the logic and mentions of this movie. Throughout the movie, it felt more like a reboot than a sequel since the first movie the world of the Looney Tunes lived underneath a golf course, and in this movie, they live in a self-aware computer simulation designed as an algorithm which made it feel like a reboot. But when we meet the Looney Tunes characters they mention the most obvious things in the first movie, like Bugs and Lola mentioning that they've done a basketball tournament before and all of the other Toons remembering Michael Jordan and Sylvester bringing Michael Jordan but instead brought Michael B. Jordan for an unnecessary cameo. Which makes my mind hurt like thunder: is it a reboot or a sequel?I believe Warner Bros. Relied on nostalgia too much in this movie, there are cameos and references to their movies but they don't do it right, they even made cameos of characters they don't even own like Rick and Morty, I think. I don't know how many things they own but they relied on it too much and don't have enough time to improve the story.The good parts in this movie are the setups and payoffs in it but some don't make any logical sense. The plot is good with the stakes, the goals, but some of the urgency doesn't make any logical sense as it was established before.The character arc of LeBron was a little cliche but all the other arcs from other characters were either tossed aside or replaced that doesn't fit with its thesis and we're never established in the first place.I understand that this is Looney Tunes where everything is crazy and fun but in cinema there has to be some rules that need to be followed.",Space Jam - A New Legacy
264,kerorogio,Virtual Meh,5,1 August 2021,"Frankly, I don't know anything about basketball, I grew up with the first film, and at the time I knew the name of Jordan, but only because it was a little bit mentioned on television, an iconic name like Dali for boxing or Pelé and Maradona for soccer... Lebron, on the other hand, I did not know who he was, nor that he was disliked by half of the fans of this sport, so I did not automatically judge him as an unfortunate choice.I found the film itself a little inferior to the progenitor, which was already a simple film for kids, with a non-actor visibly struggling to talk to the void (even for real actor it is complicated). Lebron honestly seemed less awkward than Jordan, but the film falls on other fronts. There are too many improvised humans for too much time, and the emancipating diatribe between father and nerdy son, quickly becomes annoying. While the first film, in its mediocrity, I could still watch it every now and then, of this sequel, I think I just liked the recruiting part in 2d animation.Regarding the scandal for the flattening of the chest of Lola I think that the fans have exaggerated... a little, it is true that in the '90s she had a more aggressive appearance, but she never had an exaggerated body like Jessica Rabbit, nor even provocative like Berri of ""Conker"" or the Minerva Mink of the ""Animaniacs"". Lola has been made more generic, for small children, it is true, a pathetic choice for sure, but it is not all this great change and loss, she's never even been popular. I would have understood more if the fans had complained about how sometimes, the CG, does not render his face very well in the ""three-dimensional version"". On the other hand, regarding the exile of that loser womanizer of Pepè Le Pew for ravings of incitement to rape ... it reminds me of the silly polemics about japan robots in the 80s and against magical girls in the 90s. Luckily Pepé has never been particularly nice or funny, give a damn, but it remains a disturbing fact.As for the opponents, the first impact is negative, the Monstars were not very charismatic masses of muscles, but their being dull and brightly colored made them nice. These new mutants have less time to make themselves known and have to struggle harder because of the grim CG.The development of the challenge is rather confusing because in addition to sports, it mixes video-game rules with Looney's follies, and computer graphics complicates things. The Rap part sucks, but not as much as the excessive citation of the Warner properties, which used the film to get a mega publicity, even making many famous characters move awkwardly in the background, worse than a Capcom fighting game. Plus, other minor quotes that should grab the nostalgic, like the wtf Mc Hammer ballet. Even some regular scenes are a bit nonsense, like super Granny against Chronos.The quality hasn't really dropped, it's just that they tried too hard in my opinion. Simplicity was the winning weapon in the first film, the incipit of this sequel feels more stupid, both for the identity of the algorithm, and for the way in which technology is superficially treated, with an aftertaste of old ""Serial Experiments Lain"" that doesn't get your brain off the ground like a couple of unscrupulous cartoonish alien entrepreneurs. Obviously, the new generations will elaborate it in their own way, but I don't think they will diverge too much in opinion.In short, a film to be seen only once, there is a certain attention to detail, but... I doubt it will be remembered as the first with Jordan.",Space Jam - A New Legacy

To get out, LeBron James teams up with the Looney Tunes in an epic basketball match for the ages.Despite LeBron James' poor theatrics throughout the flick, the acting was phenomenal. Whether it be Zendaya as Lola Bunny or Don Cheadle playing a rogue AI, the film featured many famous actors who performed their heart out, no matter the scene.While the acting was nothing to laugh at, the plot and writing wasn't nearly as good. As it is a kid's movie, the screenplay featured many unnecessary scenes that present cameos and semi funny jokes for the adult audience. Moreover, in true Space Jam fashion, the story (although fun) was too much.In addition to the acting, the special effects were amazing. No matter the scene, the screen was brimming with life and color.

There is a scene early on in the movie where James says to WB executives - ""Athletes acting, that never goes well. ... With all due respect, this idea is straight up bad."" And that in itself is the review of this movie in a nutshell.In another scene later on, where James and Bunny are making a team, James starts naming DC characters that would make for a great team - Superman, Iron Giant, King Kong, etc. Now that would've been a fun and new twist to the original legacy of Space Jam but instead what we end up getting is a bad mish-mash of the old movie with the same old Loony Tunes characters.Throughout the movie I was so distracted by all the WB Easter eggs and that made me realize how uninteresting the actual movie was. It just did not make me feel anything. I re-watched the original Space Jam before watching this one and Oh! How much fun that movie was!

The story while good enough as a sequel was really brought down by the James family acting moments. LeBron and the kids were wholly unbelievable, but the mother was decent as the no nonsense member of their family.While the upgraded graphics were really good, the best parts of the movie were where they were cutting on LeBron for various things he has done in his career and Porky Pigs rap solo in my opinion.The only thing that may have saved this movie was if Michael Jordan really had walked into the locker room instead of Michael B.

But then again, Jordan's acting in the original wasn't much better either.Enough with the MJ/Lebron comparisons though. Too many fanboys make the mistake of judging this movie on a biased perspective of whether or not they like or dislike Lebron. Aside from all that, Lebron's remake did a decent job of entertaining the audience. From an artistic and creative point of view, this movie was awesome.

Is the original really that good to begin with?? Well, no. The original suffers from many of the same flaws that A New Legacy has, but ANL has just a few more. Michael Jordan in the original movie had some pretty stiff acting and Lebron James is the same way as well, except MJ's characterization felt a little more realistic while Lebron's was more over the top and lacked the soul that this film needed. Lebron and his ""son's"" story just didn't really mesh super well and made the film feel a bit off balance. Bugs and the gang were just as entertaining as ever though and Don Cheadle as the villain Al G Rithm was pretty amazing. The overall story itself was a lot more complex then it really needed to be which made it feel unnecessarily over the top constantly. I understand the premise of the franchise in general is insane, but at least the film from 96 managed to stay more grounded and balanced with its characters and story. Is A New Legacy really that bad? No, but the flaws are there and fairly noticeable, especially when you finish the film and it feels like you just missed something.

319,holtrowley,Not as bad as they all say,7,18 July 2021,"Okay....yes it's not very good but it's not trash like everyone says here. I do think the majority of the hate comes from them making a second one with Lebron though. People love Jordan and want to compare it like he is trying to out do it etc. It's called a new legacy because Jordan is to old now etc so you need the new most famous and most would call the best player of current times. They even reference MJ and they clearly remember him etc. It's not like they are taking that away they are just going with a new player. Again, I think most of the below 4 star reviews have something to do with their love for the first, they hate Lebron, or they think MJ is the best and want to do the comparison thing to Lebron. The movie is not great. This movie was doomed to be hated when it was green lit. Yes I do think they could have gone with a different plot and it would have helped the movie a ton. Lebron could also be a better actor lol. Cause oooof. I watched it to just see and it's not that great but it's a movie you can turn on and watch and I'm sure kids will like it. It's a fun movie that could have been better but I don't think it deserves the hate it's getting. Again read most of the reviews most of the hate is from the reasons I said above. Just watch it as it's own movie where Lebron plays B Ball with looney tunes. They gave love to the first and had a few funny jokes about it etc. It's not great but it's what it is.",Space Jam - A New Legacy
320,jmarietta-65992,Calm down critics,7,18 July 2021,"People complain that LeBron is a bad actor when his soul purpose was to be a serious workaholic athlete, but even then his acting was still pretty good as well as his lines and comedy. This movie was a little bit cheesy but nothing that I hated. It wasn't '96 Space Jam good, but almost as good. See it, you will enjoy it.",Space Jam - A New Legacy
321,Kerry_Bradford,Space Jam New Legacy is NOT a complete dumpster fire,6,18 July 2021,"I'm going against the grain here in saying Space Jam: New Legacy was NOT a complete dumpster fire of a movie. It's more of a matter of perspective. Most people reviewing this movie now were under the age of 10 when the original came out in 1996 including me. That movie was a classic and remained in our minds as a cherished memory. As it should because it brought Looney Toons, which were still relatively popular at the time, and Michael Jordan who was a literal basketball legend known world wide, together in formula that was fail-proof. I feel most people already had a stigma coming into this film whether their personal dislike of Lebron, uninterest in the old school Looney Toons characters, or just not willing to like this movie because the original is the one we hold close to our hearts.I personally started enjoying the movie once the toons were introduced. Before that point, it was borderline unwatchable. You have to remember overrall, this is a movie geared towards kids of that age group in today's world. You can't take every movie so seriously.Yes, Lebron's acting sucked but so did Michael Jordan's in the original. The film IS a bit all over the place but sometimes you just have to sit back and enjoy a movie for what it is. If you go into it with that outlook, you might not have that horrible of a time.",Space Jam - A New Legacy

325,marmar13,A movie made for no one,2,19 July 2021,"There were two ways Space Jam: A New Legacy could have succeeded: as a kids movie for today's kids, or as a nostalgic homage to the original. It fails at both.It's far too long and slow for a kids movie, and the Looney Tunes don't appear until something like 1/4 way into the movie. Kids don't care about Casablanca, The Matrix, and A League of Their Own. Kids aren't nostalgic for MC Hammer. They don't care about lines from Training Day. Kids sure as hell don't go to a movie for references to A Clockwork Orange.So is it for nostalgic adults? No. This movie has nothing to do with the original Space Jam. It doesn't acknowledge the previous jam. It doesn't even play the signature song. There are no clever jokes for adults. All of the properties I listed above (and hundreds more) are used as mere props to remind the audience of how many properties WB owns.It's a total waste of film.",Space Jam - A New Legacy

It's neither for children nor for adults. Yeah, all of that is true. But seriously, have you watched the original in the last, I don't know, 5 years? Maybe it has more heart than this one, but it also has the exact same problems, at least in what concerns the corporativistic aspect and the main protagonist. So I don't get why this is bashed, and not the previous one, outside of blind nostalgia. Furthermore, I find funny that this is corporativistic garbage, but all the Marvel and DC movies are not. Who bashes those movies for those aspects?? Almost no one. Anyway, I'm not gonna defend this movie, other than some jokes that I find funny and creative, in the Looney Tunes vibe. 2.5/10.",Space Jam - A New Legacy

When he finally meets the Looney Tunes after he and his son, Dom, get into trouble with the Warner Bros AI, the film's antagonist, then it gets interesting since the Looney Tunes characters were fun enough to carry the film.With that though, they should've taken cue from the first movie and introduce us to the Looney Tunes characters earlier, and point out the stakes through the AI character.The ending also could've been better, longer, and covering more than one real-life location.

I was there with my son and he had zero reactions. Only thing I saw was him yawn once.The last part, during the game, is better. I saw my son actually getting into it.. so was I to be honest. There is a halftime scene with ""Michael Jordan"", I saw it coming and it was very cheesy. 7/10 for an average of 3.5..

It was something we watched over and over as kids, and continued to do so throughout our adulthood giving us nostalgic vibes. However, space jam 2 wasn't nearly as good as the first. It was confusing, and the actual basketball game was unrealistic with crazy rules. Lebron was hilarious in train wreck, but he still needs some time and practice improving his acting skills. One more thing about the first was that the soundtrack was wayyyyy more memorable, which I still listen to today. I don't recall any song from the second that I would put on my playlist. Space jam 2 was just a one time watch.",Space Jam - A New Legacy
349,mattwillandis,Why so much hate?,7,22 July 2021,"When a person thinks of the looney tunes now, they unknowingly make it a synonymous grouping of all of the tunes. But it wasn't always like that, and anyone that knows the original looney tunes cartoons knows that. A cartoon may contain three, heck, maybe even four looney tunes all together, but never the entire cast! Thus when space jam arrived, collecting all of everyone's favorite loons together in one movie, the praise and excitement was ecstatic. This was the brilliance of space jam, and is one of the reasons why many still love the film. But this left space jam: a new legacy at a disadvantage. People have already seen all the toons together,(twice!) so now what? Well, how about instead of just all the looney tunes getting together, what if ALL Warner brothers properties got together?! Let's be honest, that sounds pretty cool. When you start to think about it a little more though, many problems arise. ""How do you account for clashing art styles?"" ""How do you combine all worlds together while maintaining focus?"" And ofcourse ""who will replace his airness, Michael Jordan?"" The answers: a simple versatile new cartoon style, a complex high tech computer, and the new basketball king, LeBron James. After saying all this, I understand why people feel this isn't space jam. It feels something sort of like space jam, but it's not. It's more like a ready player one spinoff movie than a looney tunes film! And you're right, 100%. I can not argue with you and ignore that and if that's how you feel I 100% understand your resentment towards this film. Personally I found a great deal of enjoyment in this movie, not just from its interesting concept and beautiful(I mean gorgeous) visuals, but from its new lead and story. Unlike many other people, I personally quite liked LeBron in this film, and this may be an unpopular opinion, but I think his acting beats Michaels by a long shot. I understand people thinking he's annoying and a bad father, but to be fair many of his faults are pointed out directly in the film, and he changes for the better by the end of the movie. As for the super computer aspect, I thought it was an interesting, though still kinda dumb idea, and honestly pesters me with more questions of ""how???"" The more I think about it. The final aspect, it's versatile new cartoon style, is another aspect I expect caused much irritation with the fans. ""Why change the art style?"" Like I said before, when trying to combine so many art styles, changing some may benefit the overall flow of the film, making it look more... ""normal"" I suppose. That being said, the looney tunes old design is sorely missed, and I felt that they're redesigns we're honestly unnecessary, and obviously I'm not the only person holding this opinion based on others ratings. And so all the main aspects of the film can either be positives or negatives, based on your expectations from the movie. Personally, I enjoyed it. Are there plot holes? Yes... and the first space jam held none??? In all honesty I wouldn't go into this film with the expectations of seeing a looney tunes film. I'd go into it with the expectation of seeing an epic warner-brothers basketball game, starring the tune squad and LeBron. Simple tweaks in expectations may make it a far more enjoyable experience to some, and I recommend a rewatch with that mindset if you felt unsatisfied with your first viewing.",Space Jam - A New Legacy

The plot was thin, but it was a Looney Tunes/NBA crossover; you don't really need to explain why everything's happening, just have fun getting there.This was fun at times, but it mainly felt like it was trying too hard to not be the first film (despite the in-film allusions to it), and got too bogged down by the need to remind you that LeBron was being a bad dad.",Space Jam - A New Legacy

It feels like one part feeding Lebrons ego, one part nonsensical abysmal story, and ten parts promotional work for everything WB owns.The plot involving a computer algorithm as the main antagonist that somehow sucks LeBron and his kid into a server and then forced them to play the sons video game creation is the most half baked idea I ever heard.

369,SaturnCoyote,...Overhated,6,20 July 2021,"I'll just start it off here. It's not perfect. As a kid, I didn't really watch the original Space Jam but loved Looney Tunes. I just wasn't into the whole sports theme. I remember certain parts of the original, such as Micheal interacting with the Looney Tunes characters, and when I heard a film with some 2D animation was coming to cinemas, I was hyped. I love 2D animation and I don't understand why it doesn't do well in terms of the box office.I didn't go into this film expecting much and... I got exactly what I expected. It was a fun filled experience but I felt bored? I'm unsure how to describe it. The 3D models look off at times and the acting was mediocre at best (I could not take the villain seriously). I also didn't laugh much at all which is unusual as I still find myself laughing at Looney Tunes to this day.The cameos though were really fun and I loved seeing the Tune World come to life. At the end of the day though, this is a kids movie. I'm not the correct target audience for this film. And you know exactly what I would have though of this as a kid? It's ok. Nothing more. I would have went off to watch the original cartoons afterwards. It's pretty unmemorable and I can't even remember the kids name off the top of my head, considering I just watched it yesterday.It's a good movie and a fun ride, but probably one you'll only watch once unless you absolutely love Looney Tunes, 3D animation and basketball.",Space Jam - A New Legacy

Instead of trying to so hard to relevant and cool, Warner brothers forgot this movie was marketed to children who probably don't know the looney tunes like the children that grew up on them. The original was about the looney tunes needing help from a legend saving their world from being taken by what I would call Bullies of the cartoon world. The movie it was fun, entertaining as well as teaching kids to stand up for themselves. I get main stream celebrities are not actor which is not what I was looking for.

My expectations were not that high. I was pleasantly surprised.It definitely starts off slow, but picks up eventually. I started off on my phone (watched at home) but actually watched the last 2/3 of it. The animation is worth paying attention to, if nothing else, and the crossovers and stuff are neat to catch.The 1 star reviews are unwarranted. James's acting is really not that bad. There are a few scenes where you can really tell it's not his day job, but I've seen other movies, with ""professional actors"" who did worse and nobody is ripping them a new one in the reviews.It is enjoyable. Appreciate the animation and the humor (there are indeed a few chuckles), and remember the fact that really, this is a PG movie and the target audience is like 8-13 year olds. You just will not get the depth and intricacies of plot that you would expect from a Scorsese, Spielberg, or Kubrick. I mean. Come on.It is a kid's movie, folks. For kids today to relate to and understand.This is a movie for children to enjoy. Not 26-35 year olds trying to relive their youth.If you want to see the original Space Jam so badly, rewind your VHS tapes and watch the original Space Jam.",Space Jam - A New Legacy

Don't get me wrong, I'm a fan of basketball and I'm a fan of movies.. yet this drivel was over the top. It was a full on slobberfest on how the mighty king Lebron is. I'm sorry, I do not want to be hit over the head with that. It's like he spent money on this to be like: ""look how great I am!"" And I'm not having it. There was some really great elements and some actual potential to make this movie enjoyable, but it falls way to flat. I seriously wanted this movie to be better because it could have been fun.

385,originalzanman,"An ""Out of this Server"" Experience ;)",8,17 July 2021,"I'll start by saying that Space Jam (the original) is one of my top 10 favorite movies of all time! I keep seeing people talk about the ""acting being bad"" and ""being the worst movie ever made"", but honestly I think people are letting nostalgia get the better of them.To me, this was an enjoyable movie that pieced in so many more properties from Warner Brothers, in a way that made it its own. It has kid-esq humor that can still be enjoyed by adults, and it had a mixture of new wave enjoyment with peppered moments of Nostalgia. It wasn't the most intricate story-line you're ever going to see, but you can tell there was an effort put forward.A Corny, Fun, over the top movie...I think if people forget that this is suppose to be its own entity...it is something they will truly enjoy. And Lebron James's Acting? Not as bad as people say...but its also not going to be an Oscar worth performance when you're in a Looney Tunes movie!",Space Jam - A New Legacy
386,nmibaker,"As a film its not great, but as a movie sure why not!",7,20 July 2021,"It clearly is not supposed to win best film at the oscars but for what it is, it was pretty good.You can see how Lebron slowly became more comfortable in front of the camera as the movie progressed. He started very stiff and dry and then you can see he got into his role more when interacting with the Looney Toons characters.I loved the addition of all the Warner Bros characters. I think thats what really made the movie. Seeing all the characters from old shows or movies that spark memories in the audience. They really hit the mark for their target audience.I think thats also part of the reason I like this movie. Its specifically targeting the audience of people who have seen the first one and are probably a bit older, maybe 20s-30s and like basketball as well. A very specific population, and if you don't quite fit into it you won't appreciate it as much.Ok yes its corny and has bad acting. But thats not really the point of the movie. Like I said before, it's not supposed to win Best Actor or any award probably. So just take it as it is and have fun. It's not so serious.",Space Jam - A New Legacy

Seriously, this felt like a Lebron biography with an attempt to be funny by putting cartoon characters in. Much anticipation, big letdown.",Space Jam - A New Legacy
388,mackcrocker,My thoughts on space Jam a new legacy minor spoilers,3,8 August 2021,I want to start off this review that I have a huge fan of the original space jam. It has a place in my heart. So having said that after it was announced I was not very optimistic of this film. I went in not trying to compare this to the original and go in with an open mind. So after viewing the film I have to say I did not enjoy it . It was very lackluster and the acting was horrid In my personal opinion. It made me really want to watch the first one. Lebron isn't that good of an actor and I really wanted at least a Jordan cameo. One good thing was that there was a lot of Warner bros cameos and references which I found pretty cool. Overall it's not really that good maybe a kid might like it but fans of the original will not enjoy. I was expecting a micheal Jordan cameo and I got really excited went they alluded that he was coming to help. But they turn it into a joke with micheal b Jordan and it left me with a sour feeling. Having said that I really think it was not a good film no where near the original there were some really good jokes that made me chuckle a bit but other than that the jokes fell flat mainly it was aimed towards kids not fans of the original. So I give space jam a new legacy a 3/10. Let me know what you thought of the movie.,Space Jam - A New Legacy

391,shawnjones82,Just a bunch of LeBron haters,7,17 July 2021,"It wasn't amazing, but it was pretty entertaining. Lebron acted a heck of a lot better than Jordan did.

He has a massive fan base, if you didn't know.",Space Jam - A New Legacy
395,DeonJ2006,"It's a 6/10, but a very low one",6,28 August 2021,"Earlier today, I watched the first Space Jam, and I really liked it. It's no masterpiece, sure, but it's not trying to be. It's just a fun experience that knew what it wanted to be. The characters were likeable, it had good, fast pacing, the animation and 2D hybrid worked really well and it was just all-around fun.As for the sequel? Meh. I actually really liked the first half. It established the idea of a digital universe with Warner Bros. Properties, where LeBron James meeting Bugs Bunny in the Looney Tunes world and the other Looney Tunes being able to access different Warner Bros. Worlds. I can understand why some people wouldn't like this, it does feel very self-promoting and there are references to stuff for adults that kids won't understand. But on the other hand, they're only short scenes and do work as part of the concept of the Warner3000 Server-Verse. Other than that, I just thought that the film was really fun at this point. The Looney Tunes all get a time to shine and I almost thought that it would be on par with the original.As for the second half, that's unfortunately where the film starts to go downhill. It's not bad, and I like how they try and spend more time with the basketball game, but it's also where the film's biggest issue for me starts. You know how I previously criticised Maf's SuperMarioLogan Movie for feeling rushed with it's pacing. Well this film has the opposite problem. The basketball scenes feel slow and tend to drag on.Whilst the basketball stuff in the first one felt shorter in comparison, I didn't have an issue with that as they didn't overstay their welcome and the film's fast pace helped this. As for this film, I feel like they spent too much time on the basketball game. It hurt my enjoyment of the film because until then, I really liked it.I also find it funny that the last scene with the Looney Tunes that aren't Bugs have them looking sad whilst Bugs supposedly dies before he regenerates in the real world a week later.But overall, I did really want to like this movie, even with the poor reception it got. It's still okay, sure, but I was disappointed.",Space Jam - A New Legacy
396,seedoeatreview,Not my Jam!,5,14 July 2021,"It's a rare occurrence when the kiddos and I aren't on the same page when it comes to movies. It seems as if animation studios have learned to cater to adults as well as children when it comes to kids' movies, and that's a great thing as a parent. But then a movie like Space Jam: A New Legacy comes along which gives parents nothing to grasp on to and makes you feel every minute of its excessively long two-hour running time. As for the kiddos though, they absolutely loved it!In Space Jam: A New Legacy LeBron James basically plays an exaggerated version of himself, treating his two boys like basketball teammates, rather than acting like a father, in a very overbearing and demanding way. Although one of his children likes playing basketball, his youngest Dom (Cedric Joe) would rather stay in his room building video games. LeBron is having none of it and demands that Dom constantly practice as well as attend an upcoming basketball camp. It is then, after a series of strange events, Dom & LeBron get sucked into a computer program run by Al G. Rhythm (Don Cheadle), with their only hope of returning to the real world if LeBron can beat Al G. In a basketball game. It may sound easy, but with James only having Looney Tunes characters as teammates and Al bringing in NBA & WNBA stars on his team, this may be a game that LeBron can't win.THE GOODNot a penny has been spared in making this one of the most colourful, beautifully animated features ever seen on film. Animation has come a long way from 1992's original Space Jam and in this sequel of sorts, all the usual Looney Tunes characters return, but this time, have been given a 3D-style makeover. If only some of that money was spent on producing a decent script!Mr. 10: This film was awesome. I loved seeing all the Looney Tunes characters come to life and seeing Porky Pig rap was my favourite. There were also lots of funny jokes, which was good too.Mr. 7: All the Looney Tunes characters are so silly and it's really funny when they're constantly fighting with each other. I like how they all team up together to play basketball against the bad guys.THE BADWith a script that sounds more like a Public Service Announcement, rather than an entertaining movie, I actually thought I was listening to something that a bunch of sixth-graders had put together rather than a Hollywood movie. While a lot of animated movies may cater to adults this film does not even bother, keeping everything low-brow and very childish from start to finish. I have no problem with this because my kiddos loved it, but what I don't understand however is just why you'd bizarrely put in scenes from The Matrix, Mad Max, and Casablanca. Mr.10 and Mr. 7 were continually leaning over in their chairs asking me what all these strange scenes were. Not only were kids not born when these films were originally released but they're not even in the age range to watch these films NOW!Mr. 10: The only part of the film I didn't like was Al G. Rhythm because he didn't make any sense. Sometimes he's really strong and then sometimes he's really weak. If you run the computer program shouldn't you always be strong?Mr. 7: I didn't like the bad guy because he kept changing the rules so he could win and LeBron would lose. It didn't seem very fair.THE UGLYIf you want to see a film whose main reason to exist is based wholly and solely to market toys to kids, then Space Jam is that film. From start to finish there is always a product brand, toy, or game perfectly positioned on the screen to face the audience with a character on the screen saying something along the lines of ""hey will you pass me that LeBron James branded basketball?"" 'Yes, I can pass you this LeBron James branded basketball'. This may be a slight exaggeration but watch this film and you'll get my drift.I knew that Space Jam: A New Legacy wasn't going to be good but I just didn't expect it to be that bad. From wooden acting (by the human cast) to Looney Tunes characters with voices completely different than the ones I grew up with, this movie was quite the slog to sit through. In saying that though, my kids enjoyed every minute of it and I'm happy to admit that not every film is made for me.TWO AND A HALF LEBRON JAMES BRANDED BASKETBALLS OUT OF FIVEMr.10: This film was awesome. The Looney Tunes characters were really funny and it was great to see them all team up together. Porky Pig was the best. Four and a half out of five.Mr. 7: I liked seeing all the Looney Toon characters turn from cartoon to 3D and they were all really funny. But I didn't like how long the film went for or the bad guy. Four out of five.",Space Jam - A New Legacy

But Space Jam 2 just did it a bit too much.And worst of all I don't understand why do you need so much of social messages in a movie like Space Jam and make the jokes so much restless, oh! Sorry, did I mention jokes? There were none.Everything doesn't need to be politically correct sir, some things are better with dumb humor.And a big downvote for making Lola Bunny flat af. Not into the furry stuff but the og Space Jam Lola Bunny's looks played a major role in the movies jokes and overall humor.Again, a message to all the studios, Somethings are better left dumb humorized and everything doesn't need to be politically correct.

403,Omegamon-Alter-S,Take the Torch and Make it Burn Brighter,10,24 July 2021,"This movie is insanely good for a 90s child if you ask any guy at that age. Like one critic said in the review for Avengers: Endgame-'The final chapter is for someone who has read the former stories.' This draws for the following arguments I represent. The movie is almost like a hip-hop version for Ready Player One. You can watch so many Easter eggs in this fantastic movie. I'll cite some that I can remember or I can recognize, The Matrix, Batman, Rick and Morty, Jobs, Superman, Wonder Woman(of course with her famous BGM), Joker, Pennywise, King Kong, Kevin Hart, AD, Klay Thompson and the most stunning one-Michael Jordan(with the Sirius BGM).Without doubt, all these lined with LeBron James made it a masterpiece and of course, the performance of Don Cheadle is professional as always.For those who grow up with those characters or players, I can say we all share an amazing feeling like 'Gosh! Finally someone put all those things in a 110 minutes movie.'The group of Wonder Woman and Lola Bunny, Superman with Daffy Duck and Don Cheadle as Jobs really impressed me, but if you ask me which scene is the most incredible one, I can say it's the MJ's show up. When LeBron's team are all depressed with no hope in the half, the Sylvester said he found Michael Jordan to help them, and as the Sirius went on, we saw his shoes , we felt his airness and his power! And finally, here was the Michael B Jordan, even Daffy Duck roasted that 'we couldn't get Michael A Jordan, so we got Michael B Jordan?!'The look on LeBron is very funny, we could see his complexion changed from expectation to shocked and last, disappointed. This punch line has got me too, my face was exactly like the LeBron at that time.One man's meat is another man's poison. Unlike 1996, Space Jam made its best in that age. People in this time have a severe sight on everything, sometimes even mean especially when you try to take to flame from the legend, but I think LeBron made a different, outstanding, and impressing performance that could only be achieved by him not just in the court, but off the court, and in this film.",Space Jam - A New Legacy

418,matitya-33937,Space Jam 2 is Good. Deal with it.,7,23 July 2021,"This movie was panned. I know that. But guess what when it first came out so was the first Space Jam. This Space Jam has a Rotten Tomatoes score of thirty-seven percent. Guess what the original has a Rotten Tomatoes score of forty-four percent. ""But this movie is just a commercial for Warner Brothers.""Need I remind you that people said the exact same thing about the first Space Jam. Doug Walker (in character as The Nostalgia Critic) complained that it was just a commercial for Nike. It's a critique with which I disagree but it was never an uncommon one. This movie was bombarded with the exact same critiques that the first one was when it first came out.""But what about the pop culture references?""
The first Space Jam also had those ""I didn't know Dan Aykroyd was in this picture"".It's exhausting to have to go through all the illegitimate critiques before you get to the legitimate ones.My biggest worry when I saw this film was that it would be a blind rehash of the original. It wasn't. Instead of being about Basketball it was about video games (albeit sports influenced ones). Instead of having themes about standing up for yourself it has themes about trying to bend others to your will.Bugs Bunny has a great moment towards in the end of the film and I love what they've done with Lola as a character. The humour was genuinely funny and I for one enjoyed the Easter Eggs to every Warner Bros movie ever.The Algorithm's plot to force Lebron to play against his son in apocalyptic Basketball actually was clever in its cruelty. And I do think the characters are well-acted. And to keep this a Spoiler free review I'll just say if you're paying attention it wasn't a Deus Ex Machina. (I can't give more details).What did I not like about this. I don't love the transformation of the Looney Tunes from cartoons to live action though to the movie's credit neither do they. And the early part of the film spent too much time trying to advertise Lebron James (where the original didn't with Michael Jordan). The Algorithm could have had a more fleshed out motive but Cheadle played it well enough that I don't care.When the merits of this are measured against this first, I like the first better. But I still greatly enjoyed this film and find the attacks against it unfair.Space Jam 2 is good. Deal with it.",Space Jam - A New Legacy
419,dreamstate123,Blatant money laundering,1,17 July 2021,This is simply a way for Lebron to make millions to spew hate back at people for the elite. Simple as that. The people who financed this farce should be fired. No one that watches basketball likes this man. His acting skills are nowhere to be found. Anyone with more than two brain cells knows this was a way to pay him to keep on talking garbage about America and true Americans.,Space Jam - A New Legacy
420,donmega628,The hate is hilarious,6,17 July 2021,"The original Space Jam has always been in the running for worst movie ever. It's beyond horrible. This is not nearly as bad. And, obviously, Lebron is a much better actor than Michael. Get over yourselves for a minute and try to have some fun with your kids.",Space Jam - A New Legacy
421,derekbagga,Let's get ready to fumble.,3,17 July 2021,"An overall disappointing film. Lebron may not be a solid actor, but he defiantly tries, however this film falls apart due to terrible directing, cringe-writing and overall lack of vision. The toons feel like they take a back seat in the entire movie when compared to Lebron and his son's family problems (which isn't even that relatable). The entire execution of the films plot is just bizarre and there are many moments that are just boring or feel like they are being rushed/trying way to hard to get a reaction. For a film that emphasizes in things ""looney,"" this was probably about as un-looney as you could get. The sequel deserved better than this.",Space Jam - A New Legacy
422,bensterpiszczek,Space Jam: A New Legacy THOUGHTS,6,18 July 2021,"When I first heard there was going to be a new Space Jam reboot (sometime after watching the 1996 film for the first time during the 2020 pandemic), I became convinced that Hollywood really tries to play up the classics by rebooting EVERYTHING. Star Wars, Halloween, Jay & Silent Bob, the list never ends.It goes without saying that the original Space Jam is a Warner Brothers classic. It's a funny throwback film with a sense of fun and escapist wonder. My first viewing of the film was a smooth and unique experience that I often have with cult classics.Fast forward a year later in the pandemic's aftermath, and I'm with four other friends watching A New Legacy in theaters. Like many reboots, it incorporates tropes synonymous with the term Generation Z. It involves smartphones, technology, groundbreaking Computer Animated Imagery (CGI), and what better way to incorporate Basketball than to put a big shot like LeBron James on the big screen (in the same way Michael Jordan filled the role of an iconic basketball superstar in 1996).Spoilers ahead, this is your final warning. So let's talk about the plot. It begins in 1998 with a young LeBron James becoming distracted by video games and learns that he needs to ""apply all"" of he wishes to play basketball. He throws out a used original Nintendo GameBoy his friend gives him and we cut to a montage of James's career playing over the opening credits like the first movie. In the present day, James has a family including two sons, one who plays basketball often and his other son Dom (who loves video games) who is a child prodigy that can actually program and homebrew his own video games.James and his family visit the Warner brothers studio and Dom takes an interest in the studio software known as Al-G Rhythm, who traps James and Dom into virtual reality. Al-G takes Dom as a prisoner and attempts to use him to beat his father (the LeBron James) in a basketball game, where Al-G instructs James to assemble a team of players for a basketball game in the span of 24 hours.James meets Bugs Bunny in Tune World (and only Bugs, as every other Looney Tune left Tune World thanks to Al-G convincing them to explore other realities by being in crossovers of properties such as Mad Max, Wonder Woman, ect), and essentially reunites the original Tune Squad (sans Pepé Le Pew due to the Culture Wars), and once the Tune Squad is reassembled, Al-G kidnaps every Warner Brothers properties (including R-rated films like It (Pennywise)and A Clockwork Orange) and kidnaps people from the REAL WORLD on their phones to watch the game, the James family withstanding.Al-G then ""upgrades"" the Tune Squad by rendering the Looney Tunes in an astonishing CGI. Tune Squad goes up against Goon Squad, consisting of video game characters Dom designed led by Dom himself. During the first half, Goon Squad outnumbers Tune Squad heavily, and as if that wasn't bad enough, the biggest letdown occurred. During the halftime break, Sylvester attempts to recruit former Tune Squad member Michael Jordan (from the 1996 film) but accidentally locates Michael B. Jordan instead. I genuinely fell for that, and I have no idea why they did that. Yeah it was a funny joke and all, but at least have Michael Jordan give LeBron James a little wisdom to bring strength to the group, ya know?So in the final half of the basketball game, LeBron tells Dom that he no longer wants to stand in the way of his dreams, and Buggs welcomes him into the Tune Squad with Al-G assuming control of Goon Squad. The Looney Tunes use their cartoon physics to make a comeback and the Tune Squad ends up winning when Bugs sacrifices himself by pulling a glitch maneuver that deletes him and posterizes Al-G, basically offing him. The movie then ends with Bugs actually surviving and walking off into the sunset w LeBron.When I walked out of the theater, I felt that the movie, while not as good as the original (for a few reasons),can still pass as mindless entertainment the first time around. It's a pretty funny movie that's worth a watch, despite the negative reviews. One scene in particular that had me laughing in my seat was when during the big game, the Tune Squad turns into a group of rappers with Porky the pig roasting Al-G, it came out of nowhere and it was pretty hilarious.The characters, while not memorable to the 1996 film's degree, were still fun. LeBron James and his family dynamic intertwining with the current state of Looney Tunes (both literally and figuratively) attempted to make a stronger story out of the original while introducing modern themes. I'm almost under the impression that the title A New Legacy can be a reference to Gen Z.In conclusion, I walked into Space Jam: A New Legacy with fairly low expectations (sans hoping Michael Jordan shows up), and I walked out mostly satisfied. Not one hundred percent moved (like with It (2017) and The Iron Giant (1999)), but satisfied. I went out to the movies with my friends for a fun night, and the Looney Tunes came through.",Space Jam - A New Legacy
423,skater_dude_32792,Was Actually Very Decent,10,18 July 2021,Only gave it a Ten so that it could eventually reach a more honest ranking than what it currently has. This film deserves at least a 6. People are judging this film as if it could have been Oscar potential but dropped the ball. It's just a kids movie. Let's appreciate LeBron for agreeing to do such a film. He knows he's not a great actor and he even jokes about it in the film. He was aware that Space Jam means a lot to others and had big shoes to fill. Over all this film was far better than I expected. So many fun fictional character cameos. The original Jumanji was great. The remake with the Rock was great and was a reimagining just like this space Jam. It was a fun film if you leave unreasonable expectations at the door.,Space Jam - A New Legacy
424,zmmetz,A dull witted sequel that shouldn't have been made,3,30 July 2021,"Is this a promo ad for Lebron James? Sure felt like it.Sat down with the Fam and I was the only one who really didn't like it. I got the references
(including the Bobby Knight reference) and saw all the WB characters. Some of the jokes were funny but most just felt awkward.Judge it for yourself, just don't expect anything spectacular.",Space Jam - A New Legacy
425,westhoff_justin,Not Bad must say,6,17 July 2021,"While the jokes don't land very often and there's way too much product placement (especially for brands that endorse LeBron), I can't deny that this movie is really entertaining. The fun novelty of it all just lends itself to a easy watch.",Space Jam - A New Legacy
426,curlosmart,Not as good as the original but not as bad as most make it out to be,6,17 July 2021,"This is a fun, entertaining movie. It's certainly not one that you'd watch and come out of the theaters pondering the deeper life lessons this movie taught you, it's a popcorn flick. When an athlete is the main actor you should probably lower your expectations a bit. LeBron is obviously a top-tier actor but he wasn't horrendous. Compared to Jordan in the original Space Jam his acting is a bit better seeing as he actually seems to be showing some emotion like he would on the court in the actual games like when he talks to the referees in the real games. In the original Space Jam, Jordan looked bored most of the time and barely expressed himself.I liked how there was a mix of 2D and 3D animation which shows the different era we're in now compared to 1996 where 2D was king. However this movie unfortunately represents this new era in another way by littering the movie with constant references which can be a fun game for the audience to spot and recognize characters from other Warner Bros. Properties but this screams of the movie being a giant advertisement by Warner Bros. Starring LeBron and the Looney Tunes.Compared to the original, this is a bit worse but it's not horrible. I enjoyed watching the film and got to the end. Many of the reviewers claiming that the original Space Jam was much better make it seem like the original is some sort of Oscar worthy movie when in fact it's not. Most of those saying that are looking at the original movie through rose-tinted goggles. The original was better but not by much. On top of that, there are claims that this movie is basically LeBron worship as a god but it takes many cracks at his shortcomings in his career and legitimate criticism fans have of him such as switching teams too often and passing the ball to teammates at the last second instead of taking the last shot.If you're looking for an entertaining movie to watch with your brain turned off or with others I'd recommend this movie. If you happen to be a fan of the NBA or The Looney Tunes, this movie should be on your radar.",Space Jam - A New Legacy
427,sventempest,"Not even so bad it's good, it's just bad.",1,17 July 2021,"The one star is for the animators who put in a lot of work into such a terrible film and nothing else. Everyone is phoning it in. It's an ego trip for LeBron. Even when he's not around people are asking ""where did LeBron James go?"" and ""Gosh I sure do love King James."" You know this.Here's the one moment I had a slight glimmer of hope for the film.Very early on there's a scene where out of touch execs pitch a dumb movie with star power to LeBron. It's stated these dumb film concepts, made by a soulless AI, are not a good idea. And for one single moment, I hoped that this was meta commentary, a glimmer of self awareness in a film about to dunk on itself.No.This is a vanity project for LeBron and WB, it's as crass and commercialised and soulless as the film concepts it pretends to reject.Don't waste even a second on this film.So much wasted time and effort.Enjoy your new pool or car or whatever, Cheadle.It really bugs me as well that so many people are making this about ""wokeness"" or the latest culture war nonsense. Or even their personal opinion of LeBron. I don't care about that. I don't care about The s*x*u*l assault Skunk or people misremembering a rabbits assets. This is based purely on the film I endured.No exaggeration, I didn't even know nor care who LeBron was. This movie was my first introduction to the man. And based on how he portrays himself in a movie he produced? He's a terrible human being utterly out of touch with reality with a desperate need to be validated and a massive over inflated ego. I don't believe this was a caricature of Mr. James because his acting isn't good enough to be an exaggerated version of himself.Days later, I came back wondering if I'd been too harsh, I mean the Fury Road Runner part did make me smile. But that could easily have existed as a silly skit totally removed from the film and still be fun.Literally everything else, every other scene, despite being bombastic and colorful and sometimes weirdly OVER animated, had the same flaw. They were boring. I don't know how you can have such a wellspring of creativity or at least a wellspring of franchises to draw from, and manage to make it utterly boring, tedious, monotonous.

449,darylkulak,"It's Fun, Dang It",10,18 July 2021,"We loved Space Jam 2. The graphics are crazy-amazing. Watch it on a big-screen TV if you have one. One of the scenes took a year to animate, apparently. The story is predictable and very family-friendly.We were amazed at how the director was able to find voice actors to mimic the voices of the Warner Brothers toons. Bugs Bunny is perfect, so is Daffy Duck and Marvin the Martian. In other cartoons made since Mel Blanc died in 1989, no one has ever been able to get those voices right. Well, this time they nailed everyone. Even Foghorn Leghorn and Yosemite Sam, which I think would be tough.Porky Pig's rap is a high point. Since he stutters, we were wondering how he was going to pull it off, but he does!And why aren't there ""style points"" in real-life professional basketball??The majority of the reviews here show that people were offended by the focus on various Warner Brothers properties as part of the story. We loved it! It was so neat to see Pennywise in the crowd, or the Iron Giant or King Kong, or to see the worlds of Harry Potter and the Matrix and Casablanca as Lebron goes whooshing by them. We liked those movies back then and it was enjoyable to see them flash by throughout this film. Rick & Morty even make an appearance! If you like these characters, why are you mortally offended to see them in another movie? So weird.It is true, Lebron can't act. What were you expecting? Viola Davis level acting? It's not his focus in life. But he did okay, and the people around him (his on-screen family, Don Cheadle, toon voices, etc.) did a great job.We had a rollicking time watching this. And a big thanks to the studio for doing the day-and-date release of movies in theaters and on HBO MAX. We loved seeing this on the release night and we hope HOPE! Hope that they will continue to do this. We do not expect to ever go to a sticky-floor cell-phone-ringing people-yakking theater ever again, so having the benefit of timely movie releases at home is an amazing benefit.

Jokes were played out, stale, cliche and flat out cringe. CRINGE. Very difficult to pay attention.

Isn't that the point?You know ""it's so bad it's good"" that's basically LeBron. He is so bad that it makes for some unintentionally funny quotes. That along with terrific CGI is the only reason I won't be giving a 1. Even then it gets overbearing 95% of energy went into the animation.This movie can only be enjoyed by those in the single digit age because anyone with a fully developed brain can't possibly watch this abomination and say ""wow that was great"". WB completely neglected the audience that enjoyed Space Jam and who were excited for the sequel which is a damn shame.

466,liampemberton,Not as bad as everyone says but still bad!,4,1 August 2021,"As I begun watching it, I was enjoying it. A look at James' life as a kid. I quite enjoyed the opening sequence (not as much as the first one, mind you).But all that changed when WB wormed it's way into the plot. Almost every scene was reminding you that you were watching a WB film. It was like I was watching a two hour HBO Max commercial. It was just too distracting.There are some good parts: the first 10 minutes, the animation and even the Michael B. Jordan cameo got a little laugh out of me.So it's not as bad as most people say, but it's still bad all the same!",Space Jam - A New Legacy

This score is gonna go up exponentially as actual people see it and review it for what it is instead of trying to soapbox about LeBron.Lots of solid gaga and good animation.

472,rsna_mille,Hillarious & Teaches something good surprisingly!,8,20 July 2021,"I wasn't too sure I was going to like this movie from bad reviews to Lebrons recent outbursts-BUT was pleasantly surprised when we needed something to watch on our 30 year old married couple date night. We both grew up watching the original and were suprised how much we loved this one! It was hillarious we laughed a ton! If you didn't laugh during This movie you have no sense of humor. I could of done without swearing in a kids movie only reason why it got an 8 not a 10. Teaches a good lesson for families and how families are fundamental you need to stick together and support each other! Also that dad isn't always wrong or an old fuddyduddy he is trying to teach you so you succeed in life because he loves you. Also that dads need to love their kids and pay attention to what they like to do as well and get to know their kids. What kids movie teaches you to love and respect your parents? Not many anymore usually just knock the parents down or mock them for being dumb. It was refreshing to see a non modern agenda lesson being taught in a movie.Also love the shout out to Michael Jordan and all the this has happened before to make it a true sequel, the shoutout to Akron, and all the references to Lebrons mistakes like leaving from team to team. And as far as an ego movie if you watched the original, Michael Jordan was proclaimed matter of a fact best basketball player in the universe this one says greatest of all time (and they say uhhhh the verdict is still out on that one or well there was that one guy) so which one was more egotistical?Go ahead thumbs down this review but we loved this movie it's a keeper!",Space Jam - A New Legacy
473,diyisaiah,A Space Dilemma,4,9 September 2021,"As movie sequels often go, they are produced due to the well received public and critic reception to the first film, meaning that the second film in a successful film franchise can only go one of two ways; become a box office knock out with a re-imagined perception of the first film along with new and modern visuals and ideas, or risk angering already established fans to the first movie with no originality, or a strong enough chronological link to the first movie in order to connect them together. Space Jam: A New Legacy, does more of the second.The concept of merging NBA legends with animal cartoons is brilliant, original, and has the versatile ability to appeal to all ages, from toddlers to grown adults. What the original Space Jam does seem to lack within its visuals and 3D cinematography aspect, this sequel fails to continue, or even attempt to include.This sequel to the original classic Space Jam somehow loses its humor and playfulness along the way, painfully stringing along overused height and race jokes, having tacky and simply terrible visuals of the cartoon animals, and containing a premise that makes just about as much sense as it's casting does (spoiler: none). However, actress Zendaya, known for her more recent roles as Rue on HBO's ""Euphoria"" and MJ in Marvel's ""Spider Man: Homecoming"" succeeds in her role as Lola Bunny, and may be the only saving grace in this entire movie. Whilst this movie receives a 4 overall, LeBron James' acting receives a 1. Barely.Space Jam: A New Legacy really just fails to embody the spirit of the first movie on almost every single line. Fans of the first movie will be extremely disappointed with this sequel, unless they're fans of borderline basic jokes, bad acting, and a confusing plot that nobody will remember.",Space Jam - A New Legacy

Honestly it gets a 5 from me because of the looney tunes (for the most part they did their thing but sometimes they were hard to stomach as well), the Austin powers scene, and the Rick and Morty cameo. Other than that it was a 2 hour waste. I'm glad I have HBO max free because I would've asked for my money back if I saw it in theaters.",Space Jam - A New Legacy

I loved the first Space Jam but this is just trying make money off of a successful name. Seems like you failed this time.

479,mommyplum,Ugh,4,20 July 2021,"Let's face it, for all of us parents now wanting to treat our kids to movies in theaters again after such a long time where it was not possible, we'll basically go to anything family-rated at the bargain matinees. Literally, anything. However, 30 min into this, I couldn't figure out how the agents of Dom Cheadle and LeBron James talked them into this project. I've loved Dom Cheadle in everything I've ever seen him in, he's a wonderful actor, but he has nothing to work with here. His character has no depth - that's how he's written, it's not Cheadle's fault. LeBron playing a fictional version of himself seems natural and engaging in front of the camera, I'd like to see him in other things, because this movie is kind of a mess that didn't need to be made. The set up takes a long, slow time to get through - fictional LeBron has trouble connecting with his son, who would rather expand his talents for coding and creating video games than play basketball and just wants his famous father to accept him as an individual. He and his son butt heads, but later try to mend fences by going together to the Warner Brothers studio to hear a pitch generated by the AI heart of the WB ""Serververse"" (no, really, a serververse). LeBron passes on the opportunity, but the AI algorithm (played by Dom Cheadle) takes offense and kidnaps the pair in revenge, digitizing them into his cyberspace within all the WB vaults. He then separates them, manipulating the son into thinking the AI is his friend and basically threatening LeBron into assembling a team of Looney Toons characters to face off in a wild, crazy rules basketball game to be held later. Confused? Confounded? Not even sure why all this is our plot exposition? Yeah, me too. We then plod through LeBron recruiting different toons and then the day of the big game - where it's revealed his son is now the star player on the opposing team along with malevolent versions of the OPs he created for his own video game and the WB AI as the Goon Squad coach. Somehow, inexplicably, the AI has also managed to kidnap andndigitize thousands of people across the globe to be spectators, along with LeBron's wife and other children. He tells LeBron right before the game starts that if he loses, all these people will be trapped in the ""serververse"" forever (eye roll). Don't even get me started on the absolute slog that is the big game. It goes on forever. And ever. Needless to say, LeBron and his son reconcile, join forces and win the game against the AI, who is vaporized, and return to the real world. LeBron accepts and encourages his son's individual pursuits and later they discover the toons can now visit them in the real world. Snore. But, my kids were just happy to be out at the movies again, so I guess it's worthwhile for that.",Space Jam - A New Legacy

LaBron (China) James is no Micheal Jordan, not on the court and NOT in acting either! He can't seem to act and I feel as if he's trying to set himself up into acting after his basketball career is over, which he is at the end of his career.

Although I'm a big LeBron fan and I've looked forward to the movie for years, it was better acted and written than I expected.

495,Samba-boy,It just goes on and on and on,4,13 August 2021,"This movie looks like they took the original Space Jam as an example and remade every scene, but added the extremeness of it by about 200%. With about 45 minutes of movie to go, the game starts, and it will take those 45 minutes to actually wrap it up. There is no training montage, before but a small compilation of scenes of Bugs and 'King' James where they get back all of the Looney Tunes from the other franchise planets because... Well, I don't know why they're on other planets, actually. They tried to explain, but it was such a weird explanation, it was the most cheap plot device ever.So, no real training can be seen (they even acknowledge the fact that Babs is the only one who can play basketball), and a second before the game starts LeBron angers everyone by making the Tunes actually play like him (and failing). Creatively, it all feels really cheap. The best jokes are Daffy turning into CGI and saying ""Oh, I feel expensive!"" and Sylvester saying ""It's been 25 years, I thought he aged gracefully!"", that's it. This movie wasn't needed. I didn't need to watch it.And how could they kill off Bugs Bunny with such an emotional tearjerker like that? It's like they took the scene from the original where Bugs saves Babs and gets slammed doing it, but now turned it into something where he could actually die. Bugs Bunny shouldn't die, he's a fricking Looney Tune!",Space Jam - A New Legacy

After more than twenty years, Space Jam returns to the big screen with another explosive installment. Even if it's not perfect story-wise, the movie has enough heart to entertain the younger audience. The humor is well-crafted and the characters are funny enough to make the viewer interested in what's going on. LeBron James works fairly enough as the lead protagonist, even when the world around him is totally computerized. The soundtrack is memorable, not as much as the original, but still good nonetheless. All things considered, this franchise can still offer a ton of exciting and dynamic moments, which is why I wouldn't mind seeing another one in the near or distant future.",Space Jam - A New Legacy

Even characters doing the talking or main action are often blurred out with focus placed on someone else. As if we're only allowed to pay attention to that character that's in focus and noone else. No bueno.I hope they do a new cut release with no blurring so I can enjoy the film in HD.Otherwise, the art was very competent and visually appealing. I just wish it wasn't all blurred out all the time.",Space Jam - A New Legacy

So, I at first was not planning on even watching the new one, but I heard here and there that it was a decent movie. I watched it. I hated it. It gave me a headache. I at least was hoping for it to be better than the first one, but it wasn't even close. Lebron James is as interesting as a brick wall. It seems like half of the movie he forgets that he's fighting for his and his son's life. Other than a couple scenes it just all about playing the game ""right"". Zendya as Lola just felt.....odd.

549,ferdy-feisal,Disqusting with all character Warner Bros,5,16 August 2021,"Overall quite enjoy. At the beginning of the film, the audience is also introduced to the figure of LeBorn James so that the audience knows who LeBron James is and all the achievements he got. The Looney Tunes character is also presented with their own uniqueness.The conflict that was played around the family between father and son until the ending was packaged well.The perceived drawback is the tempo of the story which is very rushed. So that it doesn't feel emotional between the LeBorn James character and the Looney Tunes characters themselves, it's only about Looney character searching, Looneys join, gather and then compete with their opponents. The dish that is quite disturbing is when movie characters from all Warner Bros. Productions start to appear.",Space Jam - A New Legacy
550,immbg5400,Is what it is,8,17 July 2021,The people who judge the movie based on the first film have no argument. I went into this movie just ready to expect a basketball driven plot line with superstars all over. This movie had that but has all the right shine and polish for kids.

You know that you are going to watch a kids movie with Lebron playing basketball with the Looney Tunes... come on, the expectations cant be that high.... yes, it was hilarious and nonsense in some scenes, but that is what Looney Tunes is all about! I just think the expectations of the people are way too high nowadays. If you take nostalgia aside, it is even better than the first movie.For me, it was an entertaining movie and I just enjoyed watching it from the start till the end. I liked the idea to switch from a real existing tune world to a barely alive tune world in the Warner Bros network. Also the message of the movie was wholesome. For me, the best part of the movie are all the little fanservice/insider jokes for 90s kids. It was like travelling back to our childhood.All in all it was a nice movie and it fully met my expectations.",Space Jam - A New Legacy

554,mojarradali-21785,Painful to watch,1,19 July 2021,I expected acting to be bad given the lead is a basketball star not an actor and to his credit he did fine. However the story was not well developed. Characters were not well developed. All of a sudden you would see random toons added out of no where. Nothing about it brought back the original vibes that were exciting and fun. It was all cgi and fake. WB clearly wanted to say how many franchises it owns rather than focus on the movie and who ever promoted that idea should get demoted. This was a 2 hour marketing campaign rather than what if a basketball player played basketball with looney toons characters.,Space Jam - A New Legacy
555,cooperm-26264,A bigger budget does not make a better movie,4,24 July 2021,"I personally find this a very difficult movie to summarise. It's really not good, but there are some entertaining aspects and ideas here despite what many reviews are saying. Yes, it is true it's basically a 2 hour ad for WB, but their visiting the various franchises to find the Looney Tunes was a nice idea - the problem I had was that this part was far too rushed and just not funny. The execution is a mess. There's just too much going on. It flits from franchise to franchise and it's just tiresome. You can tell the people in charge of the visuals and animation tried hard, but it feels exhausting to watch.There were surprisingly few moments involving the Looney Tunes that I cringed at, but at the same time they weren't particularly memorable either. In fact, they kind of felt like an afterthought as they're not directly involved in the main plot. Whereas in the first movie they need Michael Jordan to help them, here they just happen to be LeBron's team for no real reason. Speaking of LeBron, he's about as charismatic as a brick. No, Michael Jordan wasn't outstanding, but he at least had some screen presence. LeBron's acting is dreadful, and that includes his voice acting. He's just a complete and utter bore to watch, and just not entertaining enough to carry the movie. There were some amusing moments here and there, but this movie takes itself too seriously. The first movie is a lot simpler but I prefer it that way - it pokes fun at itself and the actors looked to have a good time. This movie was visually chaotic, and it all seemed so lifeless and fake. It had a needlessly convoluted plot that made no sense, and it was far too long. At almost 2 hours in length, I wish they'd have spent more time on introducing the Looney Tunes characters than the tedious basketball game itself. It's basically a big, soulless cash-grab with some funny moments.There was more 2D animation than I was expecting, and this was nice to see, but the movie overall was lacklustre. It very obviously had a much larger budget than the original, but that definitely doesn't make it a better movie. If you see this movie at all, see it for the visuals and animation. Otherwise, it's pretty terrible.Oh, and I'm also confused as to why they didn't have Bob Bergen voice Porky Pig in this movie. The guy who replaced him is okay, but Bergen's Porky is by far the best. It's just odd to me since Bergen is in the movie voicing Tweety when Porky is his speciality.",Space Jam - A New Legacy

569,yellowwassenaar,"Wanted to like it, but couldn't look past big issues.",4,24 July 2021,"Space Jam - A New Legacy - 4/10 - Very meh, but it was somewhat entertaining, probably more so for the kids. There were little nods to the original - yes it is a sequel and the first movie did happen - which was kinda cool. I thought they might act like the original never happened, but they acknowledge it in several ways. Some surprise appearances were funny, like Michael B. Jordan and the original monstars in the crowd, but wasn't a fan of a similar intro about Lebron's life. Should've done something new. It felt at times as a worse reboot of the original, but if you see it as just a movie on its own then it did have its moments.I liked the reverse of the original where Lebron was a cartoon in their world as opposed to the original where they made the Looney's more human / 3D like. The morale of the story is good, the story itself not that much, but the original also had a silly setup. Don Cheadle tried his best, but lacked the villainous traits to sell his character. Lebron is probably the worst in terms of acting, which I expected, so that's another reason I like the cartoon. Unfortunately this changes for the game itself and the Goon Squad didn't look good or cool in my opinion. Dame Times was probably the worst scene of the movie. The biggest issues I had with it aside from Cheadle and Lebron are: the lack of certain Looney Tunes, lack of side stars and the basketball game.Let's start with the game, which didn't feel like a basketball game but just lots of gimmicks and fast paced scenes to show off animation. This ties in with the lack of Looney Tunes, as WB showed off a lot their own films and characters, which I didn't really have much of a problem with since the Looney Tunes still had a big part of this film. A common critique I disagree with is that the Looney Tunes don't play a big part, which was my worry, but that's not the case at all. There is however a lack of certain characters to shine, in my opinion Speedy Gonzales - voiced by Fluffy Gabriel Iglesias - should've gotten way more lines and while's he really tiny, him not appearing for long stretches was odd. The back and forth between Tweety and Sylvester lacked as well and Taz would've thrived in the craziness of the game, but they didn't capitalize on his 'talent'. Side stars in terms of people appearing as themselves or comedians to make it funny, like the original, was lacking. A certain NBA legend in terms of broadcasting making a significant appearance was cool though. That is another reason I would've loved more Speedy since Fluffy's lines are definitely the funniest of the movies.All in all, for children probably entertaining enough, but Lebron lacked MJ's charisma to really make this memorable, the Looney Tunes had their moments but could've been better, casting was a bit of a disappointment and the basketball players as the Goon Squad barely left a mark. Glad I was able to download it and not waste a few hours going to the theatre. Since I'm not a fan of WB and given how poor some of their own characters looked, it did feel a bit cheap to make all these references to their own products. The message of the movie was good even if poorly executed due to bad acting, but I managed to sit through it, so a 4 is in some ways very forgiving. Looney Tunes saved it from being a 2 or even a 1.",Space Jam - A New Legacy
570,iamerkin,A Fun Movie About Basketball and Cartoon Characters,7,27 September 2021,"I understand why many people are not very fond of LeBron James, I'm not a fan of him either, but that doesn't mean we have the right to discredit what he has done for the game of basketball and what he has brought to the game. Do I think he's a perfect human being? No. Do I think he's the GOAT? No. But I respect him, 'cause he's a great family man and a great player. And this goofy movie about basketball and cartoon characters is just that, a goofy movie about basketball and cartoon characters. What did you expect? Oscar-worthy acting and screenplay? I think if there was a God of Basketball in Greek mythology, it would've been Michael Jordan, but it annoys me how some people act like he was the greatest actor of all time. This movie is different from the original, and I liked that. I personally think it's better than the original, but that's just my personal opinion.

It was essentially an extended Nike commercial/self-fellating Michael Jordan adventure.3) If you go in expecting the first movie, you'll be disappointed. Don't expect spectacular acting either. Again, it's good for what it is.If you go in with the very simple ""Well, it's just a kids movie, so it's gonna be simple,goofy fun."" Then that's what you'll see.It's still strange to me, seeing grown adults panning a kids movie, as though they're the target demographic. 20 years ago, sure.

I like Don as actor but he's really annoying as the villain in this movie. WB wants to remind you what franchise's they own. If WB owns it it will be mention. WB also spent good money to put in a crazy amount of product placement in. *spoiler*The Looney Tune's don't show up for the first half hour very boring starter. Once the Looney Tunes show up it finally gets entertaining though LeBron ruins a good amount of the humor. Though it also takes them awhile to get to the other looney tune characters it's lot of Bugs. (Note I'm not against him but he's just gets on my nerves in this movie. ) On top of all that the actual basketball game is a cheap video game with terrible point system.

It's nothing but a dull reboot of the original and serves as a way for Warner Brothers to reference themselves for 2 hours and for Lebron to show how amazing he is for 2 hours. I'm not gonna act like the first Space Jam was good, but at least it wasn't total cringe. At least the first Space Jam had moments where I chuckled. Heck at least they played actual basketball, not this video game bs. This is just two hours of CGI that tries to distract you from how hardly anything is going on.

592,rzwznbrqfm,Thumbs up in my book,10,5 October 2021,I went to see this movie as a joke and for laughs after seeing all the 1 star reviews which are hilarious but after watching the movie I have to disagree I know the original has a special place in people's hearts and in their childhood but this movie is made for the new generation so of course you might not find the jokes and movie as good as the original which is great but I love this movie yes it's an advertisement yes the acting is not great and yes porky pig rapping almost made me die of cringe but this movie was fun and the animation was great! It was just a fun movie to watch and the soundtrack was fire. I know some people didn't watch this movie because of LeBron but you don't really think of it when you watch it at least i didnt but I think all things aside it was just fun.,Space Jam - A New Legacy

594,HitsMan1307,"Ignore the hate, this movie is a lot of fun",9,2 August 2021,"There's a lot of hate on this thread for this movie; a lot due to the idea of a sequel ruining the first. If you're like me, and the first came movie was released when you were a child, this will bring back a whole lot of nostalgia, and that to me, is priceless.First of all, remember that this is geared towards a young audience; one where Looney Tunes is not as prominent and Warner Bros. Knows that. The use of other films to show the various time travel exploits of the Toons is real fun, and makes you wonder just how much Warner Bros actually owns. It's impressive.The movie itself is your standard hero-villain type we've always known and the storyline of LeBron James' relationship with his son is a pretty good one. Sure, there's a few plot holes and weaknesses but it's Looney Tunes where cartoons explode and are alive the next scene - take that at face value.If you're looking for something fun and enjoyed the first Space Jam, this does not disappoint. In fact, A New Legacy brings back all the fond memories of seeing the first movie and is great for kids too.",Space Jam - A New Legacy

Shameless cash grab! Poor story line, cgi over cartoon for no real reason and it looks terrible. CGI porky pig is disturbing. This should have been a wonderful nostalgic trip and instead it's a dumpster fire. The entire movie is a Warner Bros. Easter egg which makes nothing an Easter egg.

The reason I give it a middle rating is 2 things: most young kids will enjoy it. My 10 year son loved it! But he's a fan of Looney Toons and he likes LeBron so that's just a no brainer. Also, the special effects are really cool! And it's cool to see some pop culture characters from other hit tv shows & movies, make appearances in this movie as well.But with all that I still don't know what it is, I don't know what was missing, it's just.... boring! It didn't have as good of laughs as the original although it tried but just didn't land. I didn't hear anyone in the theater really laughing, not kids or adults!

If it weren't for him (and of course my kids) I wouldn't have given this movie a passing glance. It had potential ""okay"" moments that lasted a split second, only to be torn from poor writing, coattail riding, and whiney actors (LeBron James). Poor writing is just that: poor writing. However coattail writing speaks of the first one being so great that they banked on its success bringing this one good profits and supporting ratings. LeBron James, well he whines about everything (pay, politics, playing time, etc). I feel bad that Don had to carry this movie for a bad rating payout!",Space Jam - A New Legacy
605,kooper-90299,"It's a cartoon, not Citizen Kane",5,17 August 2021,It's really sad to see that so many people take the time to trash a movie with 1 star reviews just because they are jealous of the star. They are either Michael Jordan fans that are scared to admit LeBron is better at basketball or they are mad he doesn't play for their team. That should have no bearing on the review of a movie but haters gotta hate. It's no Roger Rabbit but it's fun and the graphics are excellent. The rants about it being a Warner Brothers commercial are ludicrous. It was great trying to identify all the characters from the WB. I'm going to watch it again to look for the ones I missed. LeBron seems to let negativity roll off him but I hope he doesn't let this ridiculous outpouring of vitriol and hate discourage him from future projects. I think he'll rise above it.

I know he tried to do it but in my eyes he failed as an actor. The first 20 minutes of the movie felt like a documentary to me. There was nothing special about it and well it took 2 minutes until you would realize about the father-son problems.* Another thing is the looney toons appearance. I appreciated the fact that they included most of the iconic characters in looney toons but I feel like the only ones who mattered were Bugs & a bit Lola. Daffy and Porky and many other characters were not in the spotlight. They just used coyote & mig mig jokes many times during the game and I guess the writers forgot other characters do exist too. The funny thing is I don't remember seeing speedy doing anything on the field even though he is supposed to be the fastest one :)* Being predictable is another problem but since this is just a family friendly product that you might watch it once for laughter (if you found anything that much funny throughout the movie) , I'd rather cross this one out.Overall, There are many things wrong about Space Jam 2 but still, it might bring some joy to you. Especially kids who will probably find it good too. But Warner missed an amazing opportunity for having a cool cross-over movie. There was many easter eggs and of course the appearance of other iconic characters out of the looney toons universe too but in reality, none of them mattered. I tried to not care about the reviews when I was going to watch it for the first time but I ended up having the same idea as 90% of everyone in here.",Space Jam - A New Legacy

People who were expecting an Oscar award winning acting performance from Lebron are very delusional. Please do not forget that this is a movie made specifically for children with an NBA player as it's main protagonist. With the low expectations I had for Lebron's acting skills, he surpassed my expectations. But this movie wasn't just about Lebron, the Looney Tunes absolutely delivered a great performance. They were so good, the amount of nostalgia and comedy they brought was incredible. On top of that, there was a ton of other nostalgia aside from the looney tunes which I won't spoilt but it was so cool how Warner Bros brought it all together. The CGI and visuals of the movie were incredible and anyone saying otherwise clearly doesn't know a thing about good CGI. The main thing that I think stands out most about this space jam was how much I laughed. It wasn't a masterpiece but what children's movie is a masterpiece? I can't think of any.

Just months before it's release, the liberal cult of snowflake-crybabies, decided to cancel a cartoon character named Pepé Le Pew. He was my favorite character. I know that if you are a liberal that you don't have a sense of humor, I get that. I know that if you are a liberal that you have to be told when to laugh. But if you can't see the funny in a smelly skunk who wants to get in close with hugs and kiss', maybe cartoons are not for you. Maybe instead of getting a cartoon cancelled, you should try to figure out how you are going to move out of your mothers basement.And then they cast LeBron Lames as the lead? Lames is the main reason I missed this movie. Putting money in LeBron Lames pocket is the same as putting money in Communist China's pocket. I refuse to support a Communist loving, police-officer-hating, ignorant-race-bating-bigot, like LeBron. And judging from the reviews and response this film has generated, everyone else feels the same.There is a reason that Michael Jordan is the GOAT. Not only did Michael revolutionize the game of basketball but he also revolutionized the icon status.

This movie does nothing to bring back the dead franchise of looney tunes and if this movie is representative of the argument of lebron v Jordan, well Jordan has got in the bag.",Space Jam - A New Legacy
653,BeckyHew,Ignore the Reviews and make up your own mind,6,30 August 2021,"Saw this today, personally I don't think it's as bad as some of the reviews make out. It has a lot of WB cameos yes, but where is the harm in that? It's been done in a funny way and why not? Acting isn't as bad as others have made out. It's a little cheesy, but it's also funny. If you liked the first Space Jam you'll probably enjoy it. It's definitely not the worst kids film I've seen. It's also a good story about being yourself.",Space Jam - A New Legacy
654,c-johnson0912,Bad writing and an odd plot,4,30 July 2021,"I went into this movie with an open mind. As a previous original Space Jam movie fan I thought this would be similar and have the same magic. Boy was I wrong. The dialogue was bad and the plot was strange and confusing. I am not sure that a child would understand the algorithm portion even with a character in place of a program and the first half hour is nearly unwatchable. Too much bad dialogue. Just play ball with some toones. I got the feeling someone thought since Lebron was an ""actor"" they needed to give him more lines and chances to act. This was a poor decision. When the cartoon portion started it got much better but still seemed pretty poor. At this portion of the movie kids may start enjoying it a little more but it is still no original. Better luck next time Warner bro's.",Space Jam - A New Legacy

The thought of the server universe and all of the WB IP existing in its own digital universe I thought was really intriguing.In reality this movie seems like it was written by listening to kindergarten kids listing good ideas for a movie and merging it all unfiltered into a 2 hour snooze-fest.

If kids rated our movies we wouldn't want to see them. This movie is not for the adults. It's for kids. You have to watch this from the perspective of an 11 year old and see how you would have liked it. My kids loved it and thought it was wonderful. It's heartwarming, funny and actually has amazing special effects. There are also good family values with themes of family, fatherhood and the important of being yourself. Will it win an Oscar? No, definitely not. But my kids laughed and smiled and ignored their tablets while it was on. It gave us great family time as we enjoyed it together.",Space Jam - A New Legacy

There are lots of inside jokes within the movie that reference to other WB movies & basketball (obviously).Brons acting was okay. The storyline of movie was also okay. I loved the pop culture references and the digs movie had at LeBron. It was nice and easy to watch. I wasn't the biggest fan of how they changed up the basketball storyline when it turned into bonus points etc but I'm a gamer so I didn't actually mind it as much.Overall, I'm happy that I saw it and enjoyed it but I wouldn't go out of my way to watch it again.",Space Jam - A New Legacy

676,kenjenkins-83136,No Thanks,3,28 July 2021,"LeBron is a garbage human being who makes millions of dollars selling shoes made by literal slaves in China while crying about racism in America so it wasn't very surprising that he thought it was okay to curse in a children's movie. He spends the first part of the movie trying to build a super team, because just like real life, he knows he is overrated and needs people to carry him. Most of the humor is for adults but seems to have been written by a 10 year old. There was a lot of double dribbling and traveling so it was a lot like watching LeBron play a regular NBA game. Bugs Bunny gets drunk, a bunch of garbage rap music because why not, it's such a great culture to influence our kids.

In the first twenty minutes of the movie,there was a family drama that I didn't care about and I got bored while watching it. The worst features of the movie are that it is very boring and the acting is terrible. LeBron James and Don Cheadle's acting is disgusting. There are good things in the movie too. There are references many movies and TV series such as The Matrix,Harry Potter,DC,Rick and Morty,Mad Max:Fury Road, King Kong,It. There are also funny references to old Space Jam movie,but these references cannot save the movie. The same goes for music.

Rhythm, (really? That's his name) feels like he forces the start of the movie by choosing LeBron to be the center of this WB collaberation. But why? What makes LeBron so special that it warrants this? Because he knows how to dunk a ball?Now the first movie had a ridiculous villain too but at least it made sense to me as to why he was going after the toons.The movie is your basic ""parent doesn't understand child"" cliche story in every kids movie. It isn't bad but it is hard to like the kid when he doesn't see he is obviously being manipulated.Speaking of manipulative. Bugs Bunny, while I understand he is the original troll of the cartoon universe, tricks LeBron into recruiting the toons when he already had people he wanted to recruit. Bugs basically said ""oh your kids in danger? Well forget that I gotta get mah buddies back.""Next are the references which makes me ask, ""who is this movie for?"" Kids? Adults? Furries? I don't know, because while it looks like it is for kids, it has references to movies and shows that they are either too young to recognize and too you to still watch to this day.If you have a kid or are a kid you'll enjoy it but this will not age as well as the original did in my book.The original cost $80 million to make and made back 3 times as much.

I felt the story plot was really dumb, but the father/son drama kinda hit home. I also felt like a lot of stuff was going on, too much.

And this movie does tease the fact that this is a direct sequel to the first movie, but they actually don't spoil new fans if they didn't watch the first movie, but the old fans might recognize the references about the first movie this movie teases, and even if people don't like this movie, you can't lie that this movie is just like Ready Player One and has tons and tons of movie references that you might've enjoyed, and seeing your favorite movie in this movie, oh yeah and the part when they turn into 3D is pretty awesome, I know some people aren't gonna like it but you have to know this is a New Legacy, this isn't the 90's anymore, this is 2021 now, but the movie does still keep the 90's nostalgia but still being modern, and that's how you make a sequel to a 90's movie.",Space Jam - A New Legacy

724,hotshotsmith,It's Different,7,19 August 2021,"I had to balance my rating between what I would give it verse what my kids would give it. Being a father of 3 boys (1 really into Lebron) I watched this because they wanted to. Obviously it is not the amazing Space Jam we remember but...On it's own it's not terrible like people suggest. I don't know if it was Warner Bros. Decision or Lebrons but he does get hyped up as ""The King"" way to much in the movie. The story line is pretty wacky and goofy as a Looney Tunes movie should be and I think that's where I keep it in positive light. I personally would give it a 4 or 5 but taking into consideration it's a kid's movie and my boys all loved it, i'll compensate for that. It has jokes, basketball, cartoons and it shows a relationship between a father and his son (I can appreciate that). In all honesty it teaches a good lesson about following your dreams as a kid and as a parent to not force your kids into the same path you followed.On a side note, I can only imagine how hard it is to be a super stars kid. They have to grow up with so many expectations because of their parents. In this case, it makes feel bad for Lebrons kids, painting a real picture of expectations passed on to kids that follow in their parents footsteps.",Space Jam - A New Legacy

727,rulbike,"Ignore the haters and go see it, totally worth it.",7,29 July 2021,"30 year old average joe here went to watch it with my 11 year old bro, and we totally loved it. The jokes are funny and the story has a big heart. The story is ok, i mean obviously its unreal and whatever but c'mon its the Looney Tunes, i mean taking into consideration the original one, both stories are completely unrealistic and what else. However, i dont go watching cartoons expecting and inch of reality and sense. I go to have a good laugh and have a great time and that is precisely what it delivers.Lebrons acting was ok, Jordan had more charisma yeah but LB performance is not bad. The rest of the characters are well done, specially his son Dom, i think he was also quite good and other family members had a coulpe of funny jokes and situations. Don Cheadle was great as the bad guy, he gave it all and was very pleased with the acting in general.Now for the laughs and jokes, i personally liked them a lot. I liked the fact that they placed the movie inside the Warner Bros universe, which compiles movies and subjects like DC, Harry Potter, Matrix, and Casablanca, to name a few. I had a laugh with the scenes involving the Looney Tunes appearing in all those classics, we all have watched over and over, it was very original and a good twist. The effects of course are waay better than the last one, the 3d models looked amazingly great.To finalize, i was very glad with the overall message of the story, which revolved around LB accepting the fact that his kid is different and that all passions are worth it. I think it is very meaningfull in this day and age, when we have kids more focused on electronics and videogames and we adults criticize them, just like our parents critisized us in their time. However, as LB puts it ""you do you"". I personally identified myself with LB and his son; when the 1st one came out i was a little Dom living on my world doing my things, now i feel like a LB trying to guide the youngers to my mentality and all, and it is here where we forget how we where the same, its all a cycle. In the end what matters most is family, and loving each other. The movie pictured this issue beatifully, it made me tear up a bit tbh.Anyways, ignore what other say, the movie is very enjoyable and has a great message. Take your kids with you or your siblings cousings, whatever. They will enjoy it and you might learn something about yourself too. Not as good as the original but still worth it. 7/10.",Space Jam - A New Legacy

There was going to be a basketball game between the Looney tunes+LeBron and a set of mean characters, and I think they did the best they could with that. People are hating on this movie because they remember the Space Jam from their childhood to be much better, simply because they were 5 or 10 year olds at the time and were very easy to please.

Also confused by the trivia on here saying it's not a true sequel because they're called the ""Goon Squad"" and that the Monstars aren't even in the movie.

I didn't go in expecting this to be the same or better, but this was SO far below any reasonable expectation I had to leave.This explains why LeBron bowed to Chinas demand he apologize for his comments on Taiwan being a country.

Some actual looney tune comedy? It can't be that hard...you have literally ALL of Warner bros property to work with. It's supposed to be corny, so was the first space jam...but this? Omg. Worst story premise on the face of the earth and then it had the nerve to try to make you feel something at the end??? You know what I feel Lebron? Anger. Anger for you wasting 2 hours of my life with this hot garbo. I moderately like Lebron as a person and an athlete and I just find there is no earthly way he watched this movie and thought it was good and ready for release - no sane person could have. I'd be interested to hear his true thoughts. This was honestly one of the worst movies I've ever seen in my life and I'm not even exaggerating. After the opening scene, pure cringe pedal to the metal all the way through. I physically cringed watching the movie.

Looking back, it's a bad movie with bad acting. But I still give it an 8/10 for the nostalgic factor because it was made for kids from the mid-late 90s, and not for 30+ y/o men. In retrospect, it's probably a 6/10.I tried to watch The New Legacy with the same perspective and realized that it's even better than the original because it has more heart, better acting, and the artstyle and special effects are second to none. The cartoon segment has one of the best animations I've ever seen. Mind you, I've watched in 4k on a 65"" inch TV.Although it is a kid's movie, it does have an underlying respectable message for parents. Especially African American dads, the importance of being present but not overbearing, to hug your kids, and to say ""I love you.""Lebron's acting needs some work, but it's better than I expected. If he is patient enough by accepting small roles, he could develop into an action star.Don Cheadle, Mr. Kung Fu Kenny himself, is back on his BS, did a good job for the most part of the movie, BUT, I'd personally prefer Kevin Hart, Samuel Jackson, Andy Serkis, or Johnny Depp since they are also known for goofy and eclectic characters.P.s.: I had to overrate the movie a bit due to the haters giving it 1/10.

Yes the film is rather lazy but I've seen so many movies that are worse.For starters this was always going to be a standard sequel where it crashes in on the original but doesnt come close.The main negatives from my side besides an original idea is that what made the first film good was the looney toons characters played a main part in the story, this film suffers a lot from sidelining them as a supporting role and instead focus on a boring villain.",Space Jam - A New Legacy

Were there any good moments? Not really. But this movie isn't made for 35 year old me. It's made for the kid in me. And I'm sure the young me would have thought this was a great movie.

The animation and CGI in the film are great. I didn't think that I would get used to the hyper realism animation that the Looney Tunes turned into halfway into the film. It was well done. I just wish that they would've had Pepe Le Pew in the film and showed Lebron bonding with The Toons.

Shoved every bit of IP they own into our faces (why is this becoming the norm?) in an overlong (2 hours+) movie. I was hoping for a new, updated Jam, but this movie just made me feel like Jelly.",Space Jam - A New Legacy

It had all the Loony Tune characters, plus several other Warner Brother characters. It was a little long, but I think it's better than what people are giving it. I am glad I saw it, just give it a chance.",Space Jam - A New Legacy
786,fatcatcorpse,Ruined by romanticizing,4,19 July 2021,"I expected this movie to be a complete blast and was hoping I would be happy throughout the entire film as I was with the original Space Jam regardless of how many times I watch it.The Looney Tunes in the film were a blast. Believe me, they're charming, they're cute, they're funny. They're entertaining. They did butcher Lola, Granny, and Marvin severely but outside of those three the Looney Tunes maintained their charm and cuteness they've historically had.Had the movie not made Lebron's child the antagonist and romanticized Lebron the entire time it would have been significantly more enjoyable and as a result of that I can't justify giving this film more than a 4/10.Lebron was cocky, awkwardly romanticized and put on a pedestal the entire film.. this wasn't the case with Michael Jordan in the original and that's why he was so fun to have in the film. In the original Michael was just ""He's great!"" ""We want to learn from you"" and besides that it was focused on EVERYONE and their importance.",Space Jam - A New Legacy
787,simonmerkus,Wanted to love it but hated it,2,24 October 2021,"I went in because i wanting to love it but ended up hating it, its about a guy who kidnaps about a hundred people, threatens to kill 20 people and tells you if you win a basketball game you can leave, but he cheats because he doesn't want people to leave but he loses and he brings them back home but why?

789,Tmatt9,Bad acting all the way around,1,30 July 2021,"We all knew LeBron couldn't really act and he is sort of exempt from actually putting in a good performance. He's LeBron just put him in the movie and surround him with good acting and it would be ok. Nope. Don Cheadle(an extremely good actor) puts in a subpar performance as an antagonist. The voice distortion they give him when he gets upset/angry throughout the movie sounds BAD almost like they went with the first filter they came across in post production and were just like ""yep that's good let's move on""The most glaring performance however is from neither the protagonist or antagonist but from the most important character in the movie, Bugs Bunny. Not sure why they didn't just let Billy West do the voice again as he is what Bugs Bunny is supposed to sound like. The guy they got to do it this time sounded off the entire movie and it really sticks out.I watched this movie twice just to make sure what I watched the first time was as bad as I thought it was and it is. I'm sure kids will like it but this does a bad job as a sequel for fans of the original(which would be the parents of those kids)",Space Jam - A New Legacy

It was a better storyline than the first one. I loved the first one, I saw as a kid and the soundtrack of the first one was awesome. This one had better CGI obviously and storyline. Don Cheadle was a great villain. Lebron did better than MJ acting wise but they aren't actors. People are just going to leave negative reviews because they don't like Lebron. If you are wanting an Oscar winning film then you are wasting your time. If you want a fun and entertaining movie for the kids the definitely see it.. the rap battle, the cut scenes from WB movies, all that was fun and awesome. If you read the 1/10 reviews it's filled with crybaby haters that are against Lebron's politics. Noon way is this movie a 1 out of 10. The hate is real. A lot of these haters can't stand Lebron and hate everything he does! They even say that MJ was a better actor! Lol that's laughable!",Space Jam - A New Legacy
792,BadNewsBlack,Just turn off your brain and enjoy the nonsense,6,17 July 2021,"Well, that movie wasn't as bad as the others are saying but it's not going to win any oscars anytime soon either. The movie is ludicrous as to be expected, as the plot is razor thin, but if you just came to watch just the Looney Tunes like I did and just wanted to see how this one fairs to the original then you might actually be able to enjoy the movie a bit.The Plot: What plot? The plot is so barebones that it might as well not exist. If you've seen the trailers then you know what to expect because there's no twists or turns to speak of at all. LeBron goes to a Warner Bros. Meeting, they pitch him to be the face of the brand, he doesn't like fun CGI, his son gets abducted because he's smart, and to win him back from Don Cheadle he has to get the Looney Tunes back in action. That's it. The plot is actually funnier if you imagine the woman playing his wife in this movie as just Michael Burnham going into a Looney Tunes holodeck program. The story stunk so bad that when my co-worker asked if it was worth watching, she told me that I wasn't selling her the movie well enough to go see it.What I Liked: I liked the cameos of the various Warner Bros. Brands including Superman, Wonder Woman, and even Rick and Morty (didn't know they belong to them?). The Tune Squad broke up since the first film and went to the other brands to branch out on their own, leaving Bugs by himself in the Looney Tunes world (Daffy is in Metropolis, Speedy and Granny in the Matrix, Lola in Themyscira, etc.) There's also the hilarious puns on the Goon Squad antagonists (Klay Thompson as the splash man and Damian Lillard as a time god with Dame Time were my favorites.) LeBron himself is even parodied as being all work no play (even though anyone who watches him can see that he plays with finesse), and they poke fun at the fact that he's obsessed with forming superteams and that he's always abandoning his old ones if they're not good enough.What I Didn't Like: There's an awful lot of pandering for LeBron, so much that it'd make MJ blush. He's constantly referred to as the king and the antagonist wants to merge with him or something solely because of said title. At one point someone refers to him as the greatest athlete in the world (I respect LeBron and love his athleticism but, c'mon). The CGI Looney Tunes were a bit creepy to look at when I first saw them in the trailers and even in the movie I still didn't like them (they didn't like their look either which I found amusing). Also for a kid's film there's quite a bit of swearing so you've been warned. The acting from everyone except the Tunes was awful.What I Thought Was Weird: Zendaya as Lola was a weird casting choice but she did a good job regardless so can't really complain. Pepe Le Pew missing will always get me upset and it still feels weird that he's absent because the cancel culture didn't like him. Also Ernie Johnson as a play-by-play commentator (did Kevin Harlan and Marv Albert turn this role down?) Don't expect a cameo from Jordan or any other player from the original film.The Verdict: If you liked the first Space Jam, chances are you'll either like or dislike this one. Don't expect anything mind blowing (except for maybe how dumb the plot is), and just watch the Looney Tunes do their thing, and you'll be just fine. At least I can wash my Space Jam shirts now.",Space Jam - A New Legacy
793,mfrey-42921,Wannabe!,3,18 July 2021,"A sad attempt to rekindle the popularity of the original. Lebron James just wants to be Michael Jordan but he's nowhere near as authentic and doesn't have even half the talent or charisma. The film throws in Superman, Harry Potter, The Matrix, and every other nostalgic thing from Warner Brothers in order to distract you from just how bad it really is. It doesn't have nearly as many laughs as the original, and just tries too hard to be better and crams so much into it that it just becomes visually overwhelming and noisy.",Space Jam - A New Legacy
794,jacobharvey-87269,"A long, distracting WB commercial making a slam disappointment.",4,16 July 2021,"Yes, I have seen the first Space Jam and it was... meh. But certainly better than what we got here, especially as a smaller filmmaker.I do have good things about the sequel, though. The animation is great! I like how it keeps the usual charm of the Looney Tunes and is the best part of the movie. More specifically the 2D animation... the CGI is okay.I also liked the last 25 minutes, that being the basketball game's final quarters where the Looney Tunes get to be their usual selves which is entertaining and sometimes, even funny to watch.With that said, there are problems that make this a slam disappointment.The acting isn't the best, but hey, at least it isn't like 2003's The Room.The plot is like the first film, mixed with a message hammered into your head: Looney Tunes gathering together to play basketball with a superstar, the team wins, etc. The message of being yourself is fine enough, but what seriously bothers me is that every 5 minutes of the movie, it's ""You've got to get your son back!"". I know this is a kids movie, but that is a poor excuse for any movie. Kids have more vivid imaginations and would get the point after just one or two times, let alone nearly 10.Sooo, what gives the movie a 4 out of 10 for me? The overuse of IPs! I am not kidding when I say this but I kept getting very distracted by these pop-culture references (although the cartoons being added into WB films like Mad Max: Fury Road or The Matrix sounds like a cool idea at first) as well as Warner Bros showcasing every franchise, brand and character they own! Even getting Rick & Morty (a show intended for Adult Swim, btw) to have a cameo. Kids aren't going to get every reference and the fact they play specific music for Harry Potter or whatnot feels rather cringy to me. It feels like I'm watching a 2 hour long WB commercial for their stuff; that it's my biggest issue of the movie.Yeah, this is a 115 minute film! Imagine Warner Brothers shoving their IPs into your face for that long, including smaller details in the background for money to get their products or see them. Sure, kids may enjoy the animation and other aspects but honestly, WB shoving in their IPs (including their own logo seen at the start of their films) just makes me not enjoy it enough to be called good. There are some good stuff but everything else was distracting or just plain not good.With that, a 4/10 is good in my book thanks to the repetition (including the plot) and Warner Bros making a hammering, promotional commercial rather than, oh idk, a true Looney Tunes sequel. I don't care for huge promotional stuff, I'd rather entertain with something actually fun, like a live basketball game.",Space Jam - A New Legacy

What did you expect? Titanic?No, it's not better than the original Space Jam, but how many sequels are better than the original? No, the acting is not great, and yes, a lot of the plot makes no sense whatsoever. But it's just a hokey little kid's movie people. The special effects were amazing, and it put a smile on my kid's face. It ended up being a good little outing for me and my daughter, who wasn't born for the original Space Jam, but I've watched it with her many times. I knew the remake wasn't going to be epic, but it was cool to watch something with my kid that was a part of my childhood, so to speak.I'm not saying everyone should fall in line and love the movie like sheep, but people on here are being way too harsh and looking at this the wrong way.

804,joeconrad-14797,"Not as good as the original, but not bad",6,20 July 2021,"It's tough to review Space Jam 2 without considering who (and what) this movie is for. It's targeted for children, and nostalgic adults who love MJ's classic Space Jam movie. Space Jam 2 attempts to balance the line between the nostalgic, older generation of 90s kids with the instant gratification-seeking, fortnite-playing, younger generation. For the latter audience, the film is stimulating, constantly active, and (probably) satisfying. While SJ2 performs admirably with kids, it's misses a golden opportunity to achieve immortality alongside its prequel. Space Jam 2'a greatest downfall is it's lack of willingness (or ability) to be self-aware or nostalgic. A half-hearted shtick which employs Creed's Michael B. Jordan teases the possibility of connection to the original Space Jam film (wait that's not Air Jordan!), but any expectations of clever homage are aroused without being bed back down. MJ is not in this film. References or bits from the original film are extremely limited. Charles Barkley and Shaq don't make an appearance, though their TNT colleague Ernie Johnson plays significant minutes alongside consumer film staple, Rod Williams (Get Out). The centerpiece of the movie is, of course, the high stakes basketball game between the Tune Squad and the Goon Squad. Despite Lebron's stiff (but unexpectedly okay) acting, he plays the superhero athlete role admirably. Lebron's best moments happen physically on the court. The Looney antics of the animated players, as well as the suped-up video game elements simply add to the great entertainment. The game is just flat out fun to watch. Space Jam 2 is NOWHERE near as good as Space Jam, but it is a fun, positive movie for kids and basketball fans to enjoy.",Space Jam - A New Legacy

839,tfitz24,Fails where the original Space Jam succeeded--being a watchable movie,1,20 July 2021,"The original Space Jam, if we remember, was this super exciting movie where we got to see the Looney Tunes intellectual property outside of their domain and interacting with the real world and THE Michael Jordan. Real celebrities and sports stars played themselves in the movie. It was meta, self-referential, and irreverent towards pop culture at the time. These concepts were really exciting in the 1990s-look at what Scream did with horror cliches, and what Casper did with celebrity cameos around the same time period. We loved it, and Space Jam capitalized on all of this stuff while still giving us a fun, watchable movie. The unfortunately can't be said for this new Space Jam.The original Space Jam managed to fit a pretty lean, economical screenplay around these pop culture references and goofy distractions--there's a very, very clear three-act structure with some A, B, and C storylines running throughout that generally all carry through pretty clear arcs and wrap themselves up sufficiently without much head-scratching afterwards. You can go back and watch the original and see that it is well-paced, there's nothing that feels unnecessary that makes the story drag or raise a bunch of questions, and it does a satisfactory job of just being a fun movie. It's an extremely easy watch. It's not a ""good"" movie, but it's a well executed family fun movie that hits all of its beats and gets out without overstaying its welcome. The acting is lousy and it feels like a cheesy 90s time capsule, because of course it is. But it is entertaining. It does its main job of just being a watchable movie.Going into the new Space Jam, I expected nothing except a watchable movie and getting to see Lebron goof around with the Looney Tunes, as well as the occasional pop culture gags/distractions.What I got, however, was a really, really tough watch.Lebron is written as a mean, domineering, out of touch father and his very first introduction onscreen is extremely unflattering as a result, which makes our protagonist highly unlikable from the very start.MJ in the original Space Jam was written as not only a loving father, but they managed to also successfully portray the greatest athlete of all time as an underdog, and we totally buy it. They even leveraged the actual events of his real life into the story to ground him and make him likable, and it paid dividends in the final product. It was a very, very shrewd way of using a meta approach to effectively drive storytelling forward. In this case, Lebron is kinda rude and makes his own kid resent him as a result. There is no attempt made at grounding Lebron's character in any way like MJ was. Lebron doesn't need to be an underdog per se, but give us something about him as a real person to root for at least. We got nothing from this screenplay in this regard.A little later on, the main conflict arises and I watch Lebron get sucked into the serververse by Don Cheadle to go on a frantic search for his kid. I'm basically going ""wait, why is he suddenly so emotionally invested in this? He has been nothing but cold, mean, and distant with this kid the entire time."" There was nothing particularly meaningful developed between Lebron and his son before the kid goes missing, so it's tough to buy that Lebron is just devastated that the kid is gone. On top of this, a completely unnecessary and extremely poorly fleshed out wrinkle is added as a way to raise the stakes--he has to find the son or else his millions of instagram followers get stuck in the server forever. The social media followers were and are never a part of the story and are simply thrown in to raise the stakes because the kid being gone clearly wasn't enough to get an audience invested (this is being used as a crutch for poor character development). It's a tough narrative sell and I don't buy it.In Space Jam 1, the motivations were incredibly simple yet effective: Michael has to get back in time for his baseball game. His family, who he deeply loves, will worry about him. The NBA players will lose their talent if he doesn't. They will all be slaves on Moron Mountain. All of these things are sufficiently developed and explained beforehand, so when they are used as leverage to raise the stakes for MJ, we totally buy it and are invested. These stakes feel real and scary, and we root so hard for the Tune Squad as a result. This new Space Jam story makes the old Space Jam screenplay feel like an economical masterpiece on par with Die Hard.I don't worry about the son's plight in this new Space Jam, because every interaction with the most important adult in his life (the movie's protagonist Lebron) that he's had up to this point has been extremely negative and the villain is the only adult in the movie who overtly connects with him on a personal level and encourages him in his pursuits. Being stuck in the server forever with a very supportive Don Cheadle and his cute lovable Pixar-style sidekick looks and feels like a far better option here--it doesn't feel like he's been kidnapped or is being held against his will whatsoever. The son is very, very clearly enjoying his time in captivity and it just kills the sort of damsel in distress archetype it's shooting for here. It's really, really bizarre to see a kidnapped kid enjoying his time and never, ever once asking, ""where is my dad?"" or maybe saying, ""let me out of here, I want to go home."" What is going on here?The movie is absolutely loaded with forced, hamfisted, and genuinely corny (not in a funny dad joke way) references to existing Warner Brothers IP. I believe I counted four (4) overt references to The Matrix of all things (remember in the late 90s when it was common to see a Matrix slo-mo bullet dodge reference? It obviously got old quickly, even back then). These all honestly get very old, very fast. There's too much, none of the references are creative or particularly funny, and they really do make the movie drag along more than it already is. It all just serves as filler. The same goes for the insane amount of CGI effects in this movie. I marveled at it, not only for how much work went into it by the artists, but also at how utterly unnecessary it was and how much it dragged out scenes to be way longer than they needed to be so that we could wait on actors to wave their hands and arms all over the place to interact with the CG stuff. If there's any way a CGI thing can be used, it is. There's zero discretion in this regard. It's pure filler and incredibly distracting most of the time. With all due respect to the artists and the hours they put in, its a huge technological achievement but incredibly over the top as a result. You really get the sense that this is what the movie is built around, rather than all of it being built around a movie.The original Space Jam has occasional cameos and some breaking of the fourth wall, and uses the Looney Tunes IP and some minor corporate product placement as part of the meta/self referential pop culture shtick it was doing. Some of these ideas and sequences have aged better than others, sure, but none of it feels unnecessarily forced or crazy over the top and it all went over fairly well originally without detracting from the story or taking time away from developing characters. They were built around the movie--the movie was not built around it.TL;DR: Ultimately, the new space jam fails where the original Space Jam succeeded--in being a watchable movie.",Space Jam - A New Legacy

But Cheadle says lets play basketball and I'll even use my cheat code to take away points..only once though. That part of the plot was weak. The original kept the plot simple. This one did too much.

The acting is mediocre at best, at least from the main character. Voice acting is fine. They're both completely watchable, in fact they are fun movies.I'd say the main thing that separates these is time. We have more realistic CG animation now, which makes this movie look higher budget than the original. I was surprised to find out that the difference in budget is not /that/ large (when accounting for inflation).

I really feel sorry for actors like Don Cheadle and Michael B. Jordan who somehow got roped into doing this snooze-fest. My guess is that they were fulfilling some clause in their contracts or just owed someone a favor, because no one in their right mind would have read this script and used it for anything other than toilet paper.

In fact, disgraceful at best.They got the nerve to have LeBron James look like he's so great, despite him being controversial in real life, and being the worse of many dull characters in the film. It pains me that people give Michael Jordan so much unfair crap thrown at him for his performance in the original film. I though MJ was really good in the film, because one word can really describe how MJ is in Space Jam, and that is ""genuine."" LeBron doesn't feel genuine, and it doesn't help that the supporting cast weren't as good either. They're all trapped in this massive, corporate mess of a story that devoid of logic, even by Looney Tunes standards.Speaking of Looney Tunes, some of the characters were okay for the most part, but characters like Granny, Porky Pig (because that cringy rap battle), Lola, and Bugs Bunny were basically ruined. Lola's character literally doesn't have much going for, despite having more screen time than the 5 minutes of screen time she had in her (much better) debut in the original film. Yeah, she's not the worst of the bunch, but I'm not supporting a progressively dumb redesign choice from the mind of Malcolm D. Lee, who clearly didn't understand Space Jam, or Lola Bunny to begin with. And, having Lola to consult the help of Wonder Women pretty much ruined it more for me. She's already a strong female character, you don't need her to have this pointless ""development"" for her character to ""grow."" As if The Looney Tunes Show from 2011 haven't screwed her character up enough, by making her into that stupid blonde stereotype, voiced by Kristen Wiig (nothing against her, but she's not all that to me as Lola)... Anyways, Bugs in this movie, despite me liking him, I mean he's the most iconic character ever, but they literally tried to kill him. Not only in the many dumb moments, but the ending to where he performs ""the glitch move"" and dies. But, of course despite explaining stuff like this literally in the past, including the original Space Jam, Bugs is alive and well, making that cheap, sappy, and manipulating moment of sacrifice completely pointless!I don't want to make this way too long than it already is, but if I were to speed things up like the hilarious time-lapsed Don Cheadle (Al. G. Rhythm) introduction scene, here's what else sucked hard in this film. Al. G. Rhythm is a crappy villain with broken motivations, an attention-seeking attitude, and The Mummy Returns-like CGI near the end, the Goon Squad were rushed-CGI cringe. The soundtrack was forgettable, but slightly decent in some areas, despite not being nearly as awesome as the original Space Jam album, and James Newton Howards score of the original as well. The overuse of WB IPs (mostly a bunch of R-rated ones in a PG kids movie) were very distracting, and honestly one of the worse parts of the plot. I know Pulp Fiction was referenced in the original, but that was a pretty funny gag that worked for the film, and its characters. Lebron's son should've been the most interesting character, but all believability is thrown out with how fast he can make an advanced-looking video game within the supposed months and weeks he spent on. Seriously, that bugged me before the plot even settled in! And, the biggest kick in the balls for me, as a fan of the original film was the god-awful Michael B. Jordan scene, as it's a joke of hyping up Michael Jordan's grand entrance. One of many reasons why this film is very disgraceful. In fact, I should say this film's more disrespectful. It definitely takes the cake as one of the worst films of this year.One more thing I would end this off. Space Jam, to me is a good film no matter what the case may be. I know it's not perfect, and that's the point. Literally, there's so much to love about this film, and it was made by better people that at their very best knew what movie they were making. It may seem like a gimmicky cash-grab to others, but it's so enjoyable and fun that you care less about what the studio wanted to do with the film, or what the nay-sayers say about it. This disrespectful standalone sequel is not Space Jam, and it dang sure ain't no great family film. It takes too much and throws it all in the kitchen sink, and screws a lot of things up. Almost everything about this movie is everything I feared it would be, and I'll definitely not be watching this travesty again.2.5/10 for having a few good things, but the rest of the movie being nothing but total nonsense, and idiocy that goes along well with The Tom & Jerry Movie of 2021. Pure utter garbage. I'm sorry, but this movie sucked. The original is the best, hands down.",Space Jam - A New Legacy

Bad writing overall and a huge woke let down ,when are writers going to learn.",Space Jam - A New Legacy
897,cjmbusiness,"While having it's moments, ""Space Jam: A New Legacy"" lacks the personality of its predecessor.",4,19 July 2021,"*Some spoilers for the original ""Space Jam,"" and ""Space Jam: A New Legacy.""When I was eight years old, my younger brother and I fell in love with the original Space Jam. We had grown up on watching ""Looney Toons"" every morning before school and on the weekends, and seeing that combined with the greatness of Michael Jordan was something to behold. I've seen the movie countless times, and I still enjoy it to this day. As I've grown, I've been able to recognize that ""Space Jam"" is, in fact, not the perfect movie I once thought it to be. Let's be honest, MJ isn't a very good actor, the writing is funny at times, and the story is lackluster. However, the things that carried ""Space Jam"" to cult status were:A. That absolute banger of a theme song.B. Solid replication of the original ""Looney Toons"" magic.C. The authentic message and overall heart that the movie has.The same cannot be said about ""Space Jam: A New Legacy.""To me, and probably a lot of audience members, extreme corporate influence takes away from the authenticity of a film. It felt like non-stop, Warner Brothers were constantly reminding me about all of the things that they own. There's moments in the movie that make you forget you're watching a movie about one of the greatest basketball players of all-time playing the sport alongside a group of zany, iconic characters, and feel like your HBO cut away to a five minute commercial break where they show you all the other things you could be watching instead. It left a bad taste in my mouth, as if Warner Bros. Were gloating that they had the rights to all these properties. The cheapest way to try and mooch points from your audience is to hit them with non-stop nostalgia instead of coming up with original scenes. Instead of trying to etch iconic moments into the ""Looney Toons"" lore, they just throw out the ""Foghorn Leghorn is in Game of Thrones gag"" or ""Speedy Gonzales and Granny are in The Matrix gag."" Frankly, it's insulting and cheap to try and act as though those jokes are funny or original. Those properties have been parodied millions of times, and by adding on to the pile, you're just beating a dead horse.In the original ""Space Jam"", Michael Jordan has a great chemistry with the toons. While it is a bit silly and cheesy at times, it absolutely captures the essence of ""Looney Toons."" The jokes are genuinely funny and it feels as though there is substance there, with or without Jordan. In the original, the Toons have quotable moments that have stuck with me for years. However in this movie, the Toons lack their iconic personalities except for in little, forgettable bursts. There isn't a single moment or quote from the toons that I remember, and I just watched the movie 30 minutes ago. I felt genuinely robbed of seeing some of my all-time favorite characters come back to life on screen. Just because Bugs Bunny says ""Eh... what's up, Doc?"" doesn't make him Bugs Bunny. It felt like nothing more than a shallow interpretation of the characters that are so profound and lovable. The original was Michael Jordan AND The Looney Toons. This movie is LeBron James (and the Looney Toons are kind of, sort of around.)The message portrayed in ""Space Jam"" was genuine. People idolized ""His Airness."" He's one of the, if not the, most prolific athletes in American History. There is a reason the phrase ""Be Like Mike"" was used. People wanted to be like Michael Jordan. He's successful, charismatic, and the definition of a man who would do anything to push his team to the top. The Toons come to find out that they can't beat the MonStars if they try and replicate Jordan, but instead find themselves discovering the individual things that make them unique and special to access their true strengths. The message was to believe in yourself and be confident in your own abilities to be the best person that you can be. The movie never directly spelled it out for you, but even as a child, I fully understood the message. I think the writers for ""Space Jam: A New Legacy"" wanted to make the message as clear as possible, because it was though every five minutes there was some dialogue about 'I don't want to play basketball! I want to be a gamer!"" or LeBron saying something about fundamentals and making his kid do something he didn't want to do. Being hit over the head with the message the entire movie really doesn't make me appreciate the lesson that they're trying to sell.To say this movie was unwatchable is false. It's no masterpiece, and it certainly isn't the original, but it has it's enjoyable moments. I found that there was little moments that made me genuinely smile or laugh. LeBron poked some fun at himself here and there in reference to old memes which were funny at times. I've seen a lot of people in these reviews talking about how ""LeBron is the worst actor they've ever seen"" and things like that. No, LeBron doesn't give an Oscar worthy performance in this movie. But, if you look back to the original, neither does Michael Jordan. It's not really about that, and to me, it's unfair to judge either of these movies based on the performances of James or Jordan.As a fan of the original, I will most likely be seeing this movie again. I'll put it bluntly. The story is uninteresting, the writing is mediocre at best, and the corporatism is so blatant that it's nauseating. It's not a good movie. There was more times I laughed because of something cringeworthy over something legitimately funny that happened in the movie. Would I say it was a bad experience? No. Even though many of the aspects of a good movie were missing, when you watch this movie, you can honestly tell how much fun LeBron, Don Cheadle, and co. Are having during the production. Don't take it too seriously, and you might find yourself enjoying the experience like I did.Just a few recommendations:A. Don't see this movie in theaters. Watch it at home with friends or people who enjoyed the original. Being able to poke fun at some of the cringeworthy moments really added to my experience.B. Keep at least five bottles of Pepto Bismol on standby, just in case the sheer amount of cheap nostalgia goes straight to your stomach.Bonus points for the ""Big Chungus"" joke. The meme is beyond dead, but I respect that you left it in there.4/10.",Space Jam - A New Legacy

918,holdencaufield-79945,I Can't With Most of You,7,20 July 2021,"First and foremost, let me begin with that this forum is for reviewing movies and television, not for the MJ vs. LBJ GOAT debate, or to degrade and express your hatred for LeBron. There are other forums for that, so seek those out and debate and express to your hearts content.Now, with that being stated, to all of the adults trashing this movie, just lighten up and quit taking it so seriously. To quote the Joker, ""Why so serious?!"" Animation shouldn't be taken so seriously. I'd explain, but it should be common sense. I admit that I do it from time to time, but then reel it in as I remind myself what I am watching. To me animation falls into 3 categories: 1. Animation for kids only, 2. Animation for adults only, and 3. Animation for adults and kids alike (and this sometimes happens because the writers throw in little something somethings for the adults). I see this movie as falling under category #3. For those who were looking to just be bathed in nostalgia, the nostalgia is there, you just missed it because you were too busy complaining about all of the modern touches and WB placements. Bugs and the gang are on point with their looniness, and I found heart where no one else apparently found heart. This movie is what it is and what it was supposed to be - just mindless fun- just like the original was.And for all of you harping on Lebron's acting and all of WB shameless plugging, I have this to contribute: MJ was also no prize winning actor either, and the shameless plugs are part of the humor and a way for WB to poke fun at themselves (these are the jokes people). And as a bonus, the script takes shots at LeBron too.Is this an Oscar worthy movie? Definitely not. Is this the best movie ever made? Nope. Is this the worst movie ever made? Once again, no. Critiques and criticisms are fine and welcomed, but it definitely doesn't warrant the comments of those just spewing their hatred and contempt for LeBron. This movie was obviously made to satisfy a new generation, not to satisfy the older generation, and to that, I would say success was achieved.THAT'S ALL FOLKS!!!",Space Jam - A New Legacy

924,ergowend,Agree to disagree,7,18 July 2021,"It appears my feelings about this Space Jam are not exactly shared among quite a few users on this site, but I actually loved it. Does my love for LeBron bring a little bias to this? Sure it does, but no more than the back in the day Space Jam had people (myself included) wide eyed and holding our breath to see the basketball phenom of that time, Jordan, play himself alongside an equally preeminent cast of Looney Tune characters. I have seen more than a few comments about LeBron's acting and let's just say he's no DeNiro, but I also find it silly that people were expecting him to be. Jordan was awkward and clumsy with his delivery of lines in the original and, let's be honest, struggled even in commercials for taggless Hanes tees. That really was not the point though of Space Jam and mattered as little then as it does in this latest revival. LeBron actually does a surprisingly good job and in my opinion has better acting chops overall. Many have also pointed out the amount of advertising...and oh yes...it is shameless in this one as it seems someone got a bonus in the writing room for how many times they could put the words Warner Brothers in the script. But the first was no innocent and was borne literally out of a commercial for Nike. The plot is cute and relatable, although any sports fan might find it implausible being LeBron's son and not wanting to take advantage of that elite coaching. But, I digress. It is a self promoting studio project and has the feel of one as a steady stream of film critics have pointed out and so it relies heavily on people's good memories of Looney Tunes, childhood movie character cameos, and the hope we are all giddy to see how many we know and cheering when we see our childhood faves. At 50, though, I guess I am at the age where I actually found that enjoyable and nostalgic. One downside is the heavy use of CG which make the aesthetic kind of rough compared to the 2d moments, but Don Cheadle as AI G. Rhythm, King of the Serververse, is so good it makes you forget a little. This movie is family friendly for sure and it features not only other NBA stars like Anthony Davis, but it has some WNBA stars like Diana Taurasi as well.

939,BryanMaurice,Don't listen to the hate,8,16 July 2021,Is LeBron James the best actor?? NO... however neither was Michael Jordan.. James was funny and entertaining and even showed a bit of range with emotions. It wasn't supposed to be a scene for scene copy of the original (at 33 I still love the original) it's literally A NEW LEGACY. . It had the original animation mixed with a new 'upgraded' animation which was a STORY PLOT and one that even annoyed Bugs Bunny in the movie. The movie was entertaining and funny and Don Cheadle stole the whole freaking show. Bunch of real cool cameos and an AMAZING VILLIAN. All in All 8/10 domt listen to the hatr. It wasn't perfect but it was a good movie and I even laughed hard at a few spots with Don. Go see it!!,Space Jam - A New Legacy

Great reminder to parents to find that balance to push your kids while allowing them to explore and understand who they are. LeBron did a decent job as an actor. Seems like most of the reviews are from people who just don't like LeBron. Not sure why someone who doesn't like him would watch the movie, but to each his own.

I think he tries too hard to be an actor when he should just stick to back. I really only watched it because I love the Looney Tunes characters. It would've been a lot better if Michael Jordan (not Michael B. Jordan) had made an actual cameo and helped with the last quarter of the ""basketball game"". Now that, would have been epic.If you ignore all the ""King James"" or the ""LeBron James is the best"", etc. Etc.

Had they left the ending like that and not bringing certain character back, it would have been probably even better, but that was never going to happen. There are definitely parts that made me laugh hard like that Jordan cameo brought by Sylvester, Kong's reactions to not being the most powerful of the Warner Verse (Godzilla would have something to say about it anyway), or Daffy Duck getting in big trouble with no other than the Justice League. The film is full of this funny moments, many crossovers from other WB properties, by the way, Lebron is a hufflepuff and he knew it, or he considering his best team to beat the Goond Squad (Iron Giant, Kong, Batman, Superman and Trinity) I felt like Daenerys and one of her dragons would have helped but he got Foghorn Leghornd instead!!

It has no character, no plot, the actors try their best to make it funny but the actual plot is despicable it's just stupid!

I also really liked the looney tunes in this they weren't annoying they just spiced up the scenes they were in the only issue I had was the main plot and AI thing was really dumb and not in a cute or cartoony way just in a stupid and lacking in substance way.

Temper your expectations, and the end result is an enjoyable viewing.LeBron James is the superstar name, but the movie is all about the kids. The recurring theme is a great message.The Tunes are fun, but the character introductions are superficial and feels more like a nostalgic parade for adults, rather than a chance for kids to grow fond of them.

It's about the heart, heros, family, goodness with a hearty mix of nastalia for Looney Tunes and basketball ""greats."" (as in, even I as a non-basketball fan knows the name LeBron) My son (27 yo, autistic) has giggled and laughed so much throughout this movie. It has my utmost respect. I Iove to hear my son laugh.

Yes it's nothing like the original space jam but nobody said it was suppose to be, I personally think LeBron James did well for his first starring role. My little one loved it and it kept him engaged because end of the day it is a Children's movie for the little ones not adults and the way it's made it appeals to children. He gave it a 10/10!m and thoroughly enjoyed it! Honestly I feel the reviewers were too harsh and did not take in account that it is for the younger generation and should Just take it for what it is.

I really loved this movie, and for several different reasons! The reasons may be a bit hard to explain, but they're, of course, positive, and I'll try my hardest to explain in a moment! Most people don't like this movie mainly because they think it had bad acting, and because the movie was more like a ginormous commercial rather than an actual movie with story, but those are almost the only 2 major problems, and besides, it was more of just like showing ads in the background than like fully showing a commercial, therefore I didn't care and almost didn't notice until lots of people been saying stuff about it, and most people may not notice, too. But, or ""and"", this doesn't make it bad, at least not completely. There was still lots of great things about this movie, such as life lessons, comedy, action, adventure, other awesome and interesting things that happen, and so much more! There is even a large combination of live-action and animation with great CGI and special effects! This movie is family-friendly as well. Take a look at paragraph 2 for more examples, but they may have spoilers. The reason why I give 9 stars instead of 10 is because of a couple small problems, and I feel like the movie could've been a bit more somewhat better, but yeah.One of the reasons I love this movie is because of its surprising special effects, along with both animation and live-action with CGI combined! So if you only like one or the other, or both, this movie can be for all of them. And another, is that. In the movie, the main-key character of the movie, Lebron, goes on an epic adventure through a computer-like universe of many different movie and TV show planets and worlds, called the Server-verse with the Looney Toons characters to get the gang back together since they were separated, and once they were all back together, they later, have an epic whole-new-level game of basketball, and must win if Lebron is going to go back home and the Looney Toons characters not to get deleted, they play against an enemy team, called the Goon Squad, with each player in that team with their own elemental abilities and powers, and the Looney Toons characters using their abilities as well. So basically, has an epic and, somewhat, unpredictable plot (In some ways at least)! It is also like an enormous crossover of hundreds of different kinds of characters and cameos! This movie also has a fine amount of life lessons as well, like, for example, Lebron developing a better relationship between him and his son from certain things. This movie is full of all sorts of great things, but it has too much hate and I wished that it had more love, and that people would focus more on the movie's good things and elements it provides. I love this movie and may never forget it! (Please, God, let there be more love for this movie, or in the future or something, at least!!!!) It is NOT complete garbage.",Space Jam - A New Legacy

1009,marionray,Space Jam: A New Legacy (2021) (my review of facts about AL-G Rhythm),10,31 October 2021,"Marion D. Ray (marionray76@gmailcom):My review of facts about AL-G Rhythm:i always know, remember and like Don Cheadle, the MCU actor of Colonel Rhodey Rhodes, a.k.a Iron Patriot and formerly known as War Machine, the only true best friend and ex-sidekick of the ex-leader of the greatest and mightiest superhero team, The Avengers, and late inventor, engineer, philander, womanizer, philanthropist and superhero, Tony Stark. A.k.a Iron Man. Also called the Invincible Iron Man and Iron Avenger himself from the past by last movies ago in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.And he played AL-G Rhythm himself in the whole sequel too, the sentient, autonomous, self-aware, evil, malicious, dark, arrogant, egotistical, short-tempered, envious, bitter, vengeful, abusive, dangerous, threatening, deceitful, manipulative, tricky, traitorous, Ching Chong, fame-seeking, attention-seeking, recognition-hungry, power-hungry, power-mad and truly god-like superpowered artificial intelligence with a variety of truly god-like superhuman powers and truly god-like abilities of his own, true omnipotence and true omniscience who is always so bent only on and always been trying to achieve fame, attention, recognition, world and machine domination, power, technocracy, robotocracy, machine supremacy, machine control and machine tyranny.AL-G became and was so sad over how humanity are always unaware of and not acknowledging him and what he does with his powers and abilities.And now he hates and reviles humanity for ignorance and always trying to richly force humanity to see, know, pay attention to, acknowledge and respect him and acknowledge what he does and then conquer and rule the world just like both Master Control Program and Ultron from Disney and Marvel always plan and try to do and achieve in TRON, the 1982nd Disney sci-fi movie i always watch online and Marvel's comics, animated series, animated movies and Marvel Cinematic Universe movies.Because he's like Master Control Program and Ultron similarly for trying to achieve machine domination in evil, malicious, dangerous, threatening, vengeful, abusive, power-hungry, power-mad and tyrannical ways and he doesn't want and want to conquer and rule the entire social media space.Steps of AL-G's attempted achievements of his present and future goals:
Buttering up and manipulating the Looney Tunes and all the other Toons in Tune-World into moving out to, residing and exploring other universes and blasting them all off to other universes with the rocket just in case if they all ever get and stand in his way and the way of his plans and goals. (temporarily succeeded and foiled by both LeBron and Bugs via using Marvin's ship to find the rest of the Looney Tunes and convince them about what AL-G did to all of them and join him and Bugs for playing for their and humanity's freedom and lives in the superpowered basketball game AL-G did created in Tune-World, named The Sever-Verse Classic.)Convincing the best and greatest USA, NBA and ESPN basketball player, champion and superstar ever, LeBron James himself, in the Warner Bros Studio into joining a latest computer, scanning, digital and virtual warping technology project he dismissed and called as a straight-up, worst and stupid bad idea AL-G's secretly working on and he's ever heard, Project Warner 3000. A computer, scanning, digital and virtual warping technology project he's masterminded and secretly working only on for world and machine domination instead of making LeBron's life only as a ballplayer, champion and superstar very easier, revolutionizing the entertainment industry and making mindblowing entertainment indefinitely worldwide, being scanned and cloned only for creating the perfect partner of his own for the launch of the revolutionary and incredible computer, scanning, digital and virtual warping technology that he masterminded and will combine and use with LeBron's basketball fame richly for himself, carrying out his plans and achieving both his present and future goals all along, named Warner 3000. (failed, as AL-G got enviously mad at LeBron and both the studio's two staff members in the board room for dismissing his project and humiliation as a mistake.)Teleporting LeBron and his youngest kid/child prodigy son, Dominic ""Dom"" James himself, the special, young and youngest kid/child prodigy who was aspired to be a video game maker better than a ballplayer like his dad. Into the real multiverse of AL-G's own creation, The Sever-Verse, also called The Warner 3000 Sever-Verse. By using his truly god-like technopathy on the elevator and Warner 3000. (succeeded, as LeBron and Dom had that blowup argument of basketball and video game aspirations with each other in the studio and AL-G took advantage of it.)Kidnapping Dom and took him to his own home universe. (succeeded)Making a deal with LeBron and forcing him and the Looney Tunes as the Tune Squad into playing a superpowered basketball game of his creation in the Looney Tunes' home universe and based on the video game Dom made, designed and programmed for everyone at home and will produce and release worldwide, named Dom Ball. Named the Sever-Verse Classic. In the Looney Tunes' home universe against both him and his own team of superpowered cloned minions, The Goon Squad. As a way to get Dom back and AL-G to teleport them back to our home universe. (succeeded)Psychologically and emotionally manipulating Dom into unknowingly becoming his unaware pawn after he kidnapped him, before he upgraded him with basketball intuition and joining him in his quest for world and machine domination and trying to psychologically and emotionally use him to unknowingly help him in his quest, help carry out his plans, help achieve his present and future goals, create the Goon Squad only for him so he'll program all five of them by and only for himself and digitally materialize them to life, digitally materialize the Goon Squad to life only as superpowered clones of Anthony ""Andy"" Davis, Klay Thompson, Damian Lillard, Nneka Ogwumike and Diana Taurasi and his own team of superpowered cloned minions, help fulfill his destiny of world and machine domination and upgrade and evolve himself into a truly invincible, unbeatable and unstoppable superpowered artificial intelligence by playing his resentments to his dad and manipulating his aspirations of becoming a video game maker after that whole blowup argument between LeBron and Dom in the studio and before going to video game development and design camp in the weekend and the end of the whole sequel and selfishly forcing him into playing for him and against the Tune-Squad as the first part of his plans and goals and without becoming himself, which he'd forbidden Dom to as a mistake. (temporarily succeeded and failed, because the step's so selfish for Dom.)Because as i seen both the whole blowup aspirations argument between LeBron and Dom and the upgrade online, spoiled it and reviewed it before LeBron and Dom are teleported by AL-G via his technopathy as Dom doesn't need a coach and all he needs is a good and better dad.Deleting the Looney Tunes, the James Family and humanity as other people with their phones into extinction forever if he fails to richly force humanity. (all failed, as AL-G got turned into a poster by the Stepback move as he just did upgrade and transform himself into a superpowered basketball player and erased from both existences by his ex-minion Pete.)And Bugs just did the Stpeback and survived it very good in that game because toons from his own home universe can and will survive anything.",Space Jam - A New Legacy
1010,BallerinaPig69,No,1,16 July 2021,"No, just NO!To sum it up terrible acting, directing , writing and average visual effects. Checked how much the budget for this film was and couldn't believe 150 Million dollars for this. What was the money spent on? The script was awful, the effects of the movie weren't even above average. It was just a bad film.You will recognize: some familiar faces in this film like LeBron James and Don Cheadle which surprised me that Don Cheadle one of the greatest actors in Hollywood saw this script and signed up for this.It's not even the type of movie that you can watch that's bad and have a good time with, it's just basically watching a special effect basketball movie with social media references. The moments you will remember from the film are in the trailers. It felt like a straight to home video release, the story was cliche and boring.If you want to check this out for the curiosity or if you're a LeBron James fan then try sit through this two hour headache of a movie, I recommended missing it. 1/10.",Space Jam - A New Legacy

1015,jaunis111,Bollywood level movie with hollywood CGI,1,28 July 2021,"As I was a fan of the first movie, I thought what they will do, will they continue a first movie story with a new basketball star or what will happen.Well nothing happened.I am not that easily bored with movies, but this was won a Oskar for being so boring, that I could handle it only for 5 minutes.I tried watching it to the end, but had to have breaks, just like in basketball.Cause lack of story, lack of logic, lack of first movie fun parts destroyed everything I liked in the first movie.Rather call it James Jam, but not Space jam.Visual effects were pretty nice, but as a story is so poor it kinda made me remember Bollywood movies, who pretty much have same story quality.At the end everyone comes to watch this movie of James, but the funny part the part in the movie where James sits and reviews the movie project of WB and says wtf, well I guess many people can say about this movie too.",Space Jam - A New Legacy
1016,spudit2003,Better than the original in most ways,8,24 October 2021,"I am surprised how low this has scored, its not a bad movie, not even a bad space jam. It works for those who it is aimed at (kids!)I have enjoyed the original Space Jam since I was a kid, but had no particular attachment to it, nor a huge desire to see the new one.As my kids have recently been introduced to the looney tunes (via the golden collection dvd boxset) and really enjoy them, they wanted to see the new film.Although they had seen the original once, it was a while back, so we watched it again the night before.Both the children and the adults enjoyed the new film at least as much as the original. My main criticism of the new one is how long it is before you see any looney tunes! My daughter (5) was getting restless, so they should have shortened the back story a bit and maybe had more incidents of the looney tunes popping up to remind the kids they were watching the right film.The kids particularly thought the new one looked better. The adults enjoyed the story more, although I wonder how much sense the children made of the slightly abstract concept of a computer world and a personified algorithm - a very topical theme but possibly a little deep for younger ones.I think that a particular merit goes to including more of the looney tunes characters in the game, and being quite creative with the game, something that doesn't happen much in the original and is limited in who you see. My children have their favourite characters, but my sons (roadrunner) makes fleeting appearances in the original, but plays a much more major role in this one, as do many others.I would also like to comment how it's nice to see a mainstream kids film with a majority black cast. Living in a very white area, my children have asked why some people are brown, because they are so rare, so I think it's good they can see films about things they like (cartoons), rather than the all too common tokenism of minor parts being filled by black actors.",Space Jam - A New Legacy
1017,blankcur-1,Not as bad as I thought it was going to be.,4,19 July 2021,"I watched it with my kids (10) and one made the point that although this seems to be a Space Jam for a new generation, they were very familiar with the previous Space Jam.IMO, even though the plot made no sense, it had some funny moments (Bugs and Co were good) and the lesson was good, especially for parents. Let kids do what they are good at and manage your expectations of your kid.I would also say that the Ready Player One-ish callback attempt worked for me and helped keep it interesting, because, as I mentioned above, there really isn't any coherence of a plot, or anything that may be attempted to be called one.",Space Jam - A New Legacy

I laughed, I was hit with nostalgia, and I enjoyed watching it. I felt like a kid again.Don't give this movie a critique based on story lines, character development and exquisite acting ability. That seems like what a lot of reviewers have done. Have we all been beaten down so badly as adults that we have to rubbish this movie so terribly? Apparently so.Will it ever live up to the OG? Of course not; nothing ever will. For me though, it was enough to put a smile on my face and have my favourite bunch of looney's entertain me for a short time.",Space Jam - A New Legacy

Unfortunately Lebron will never be as great or as majestic as Jordan was. I'm really not sure why they've decided to cast Lebron and not someone else, e.g. Curry or KD.The only thing lebron can act really well is performing a flop on a court - that, desrves an Oscar.Lebron, if you are reaing this (highly unlikely) - it's not about how many points you have, it's about how you score them.",Space Jam - A New Legacy

The Toons have funny banter. The scene where they get the wrong Michael Jordan is funny as hell, I LOL'ed. Lil Rel Howery as an announcer was great. It's overall message (to me) is to accept your kids (and people in general) for who they are and to appreciate their different strengths or passions.My kids have watched this movie three times already and my 4 year old daughter now wants a ""LeBwon James birfday pawty"". Most kids nowadays haven't heard of or aren't familiar with the Looney Toons characters, and this movie has helped bring 'em back in the fold.Once again, it's a kids movie.

1044,richterboy9-533-223780,Why does it take so long to meet the Toons?,4,22 July 2021,"The toons are the reason to come see this thing!In the Original MJ made a few hoops as a kid talking about his dreams with his father, jump cut to him owning his future. Bam. Boom. We got it him under two minutes and we meet the toons All of them together, Michael pops up like twice in between loony mayhem. In this one, Lebron is Has to do A handshake with his mother and get some backstory, (which won't be showing up later). He plays more than one game under the worst athletics coach in his schools history, and 5 minutes later we meet his kid Who has a whole lotta backstory, and a half hour later we meet Bugs, The one and only toon in all of toon world. Why does it take so long to meet the Toons!!! The Toons are the reason to come and see this thing? Why would it take so long too See them ?!?!When you finally do you half to wade through a half hour of commercials, And then when they finally get together they're not Toons Anymore. They're some weird, angry mob made of money Swimming in Subscription services. It's until the end it finally becomes a Pepsi Commercial.Daffy has a few good lines, as do the rest of the toons, and the Basketball game was creative. The video game aspect was creative and cool. There wasn't a whole lot of banter and one of the reasons for that is you din't get to know who the enemies were. Not really. They got a freeze frame introduction but there was no individuality. All the personality was in Al and Lebron's kid. They tried so hard to make us care about this story and I did not. Something about creating a video. Al-Gor-rythm wanted something, I think It was to win a Basketball game. I'm not really sure why... it sounded really convoluted and therefore important so I just went numb and accepted it. They played basketball the banter just wasn't there. There was no back and forth and back and forth it just kind of swung one way once, held that spot for a moment and then went the other way.I guess You can change Lola's design, They changed everyone else's and to be honest, as they tried to go for a much more dramatic tone her new design seemed to fit this new film a bit better, She didn't crack a single joke so why give her anything that would make Bugs go GaGa? I expected her to make more than one basket... or at least score some style points with it. I mean she was the only person on the team to score a total of 2 points. Lebron score 37 or whatever on his first shot. Story wise they gave that shot to Lola because they needed to bring the game closer so that the toons only needed one more basket to win, (it was like 1038 to 1035, Lola brought them to 1037), but Wiley Coyote got like 600. Why not let Lola earn some style too, being the only baller on the team. She friggin coached them!It just didn't have any wit or charm in it. I mean their was some wit, but it came sandwiched in a lot of greed. And I don't want to be sold a subscription to HBO MAX. I want to see my Toons. I bought the ticket which means the previews run before the beginning and not throughout the entire film.

I struggle to understand how an actually awful film like this can get released. Surely executive producers/producers/writers etc couldn't actually have finished this and thought, ""hey, this is great"".It's a money grab and nothing else. There's nothing to save it either. The acting? Terrible. Direction? Terrible. Porky Pig rapping? One of the worst things I've ever seen.I wish I could give it 0 stars.",Space Jam - A New Legacy

I think most of the reviewers here are trolls who hate Lebron, such as one comment which says ""haven't seen the film just hate Lebron"" jeez grow up. Lebron actually did a really decent job in the film and I was surprised, he comes across as probably a better actor than MJ in the originally in my opinion. Anyway all round quite a decent film and worth a view!",Space Jam - A New Legacy
1057,jrharrison09,"Lebron is no Jordan, and no actor as well",1,17 July 2021,Lebron fell way short in trying to fill the shoes of a real legend and many unnecessary scenes added for Lebron's ego. The looney toons in CGI was a slap in the face to the original.,Space Jam - A New Legacy
1058,lovelyfish1,The Original Space Jam isn't as good as you remember,6,17 July 2021,"I rated this at 6 stars because the original has a 6.5 rating. I think people need to rewatch the original because it's just as bad as this one. This movie is exactly what I expected (except it's missing a space jam song remix). I don't know what everyone was expecting... it's a live action Looney Toons movie, with an athlete as a main character. It wasn't going to be great. I feel like it is an original movie that doesn't copy too much from its predecessor, yet conveys similar feelings. Yes WB was doing a bit of ""hey, look at all the properties we own!"" but that didn't bother me too much. They were self-aware about it, and it made sense in the movie's context. I also felt like as an adult it was fun to see references to movies such as the matrix, that kids wouldn't recognize.It is not a well-made movie. The acting was ok, and plot was simple. However the theme of ""be you"" (and for parents to encourage kids to pursue their dreams) was wholesome. I laughed and smiled at references to my childhood. Overall, I enjoyed this movie. To me it's just as good as the original and should be treated as so.",Space Jam - A New Legacy

1062,stephenmontoya52,Well...,6,17 July 2021,"So I did like it. But not enough to watch it again. I'm glad it was streaming on HBO max and I didn't necessarily spend money in a theater for it. I think this movie would be great for KIDS. Some cheap laughs that keep them entertained, but nothing beyond that. I loved the original one as I grew up watching that movie time after time. This did not live up to that expectation, HOWEVER. I think people are being alittle too harsh on it. We can all agree that lebron is definitely not an actor, and his acting skills serves as easy ammunition for the lebron haters out there to chop this movie up. I'm no lebron fanatic OR a hater, I just think people are letting their emotions take over their review of the whole movie. Again this was not a great movie nor would I want to watch it again, I just don't think it's as bad as everyone is making it sound. BTW yes, there is a lot of obvious advertising lol.

He made the movie purely centered on him and his horrible acting. The script was weak. What's with all these WB characters? It's Space Jam, don't ever complicate it.I'm trying to find the words to explain, but basically... my wife and I (who both grew up loving the first movie) turned it off 2/3 the way through and put on the original simply to see if it was us who aged or if it is the new movie that is terrible. Ten minutes into the original, we immediately realized it's the new movie.... as well as Lebron who ruined the ""legacy"" for a new generation.3 rating is for Michael B.

The plot is horrible, but it provides a vehicle for funny moments and jokes. The story and character development present in the original Space Jam are not here, and are instead replaced with fun references. For people who have only seen Space Jam before this, this turn may come as a surprise. But, for those who've seen Looney Tunes: Back In Action, this is more of the same. Loose/nonexistent plot with really fun comedy set pieces. This movie was enjoyable, but if you want to see this type of movie turned up to 11, watch Back In Action.",Space Jam - A New Legacy

You know... people with a sense of humour that doesn't allow them to find things funny? Boring people.If you haven't already; Go. And. Watch. This. Movie. It's absolutely brilliant, hilarious and what I love most is the power of Warner Bros is there's SO many Easter Eggs and cross overs. (Including the best cross over I've ever witnessed)It's very cleverly done and executed and works so well.Hats off to everyone involved in making this movie, including Lebron (who isn't even an actor, and played the roll very well)And to finish my review; this movie is absolutely brilliant, and I never do this but, I'd go and watch this again tomorrow.

And then I heard the Wonder Woman theme and and I almost had to turn of the TV because I was disgusted to watch.I disagree with people saying the movie was just a 2 hour advertisement because it wasn't. The movie was just a complete Cliché.The plot is so generic and boring that I can not tell if the writers were trying to make it a cliché or they were just that bad. This movie is going to make a lot of serious movie fans angry. Mad Max Fury Road Cameos, Matrix Cameos. Only one good thing I can say about this movie because I wanted this review to be fair. The CGI was great. Some of the best I have seen in a while. But still not worth it.

All of the acting was weak, especially the dialogue with LeBron and Dom. The biggest moment for me was the Looney Tunes, I loved them so much as a kid, and I still do... even though they were fully CGI for the main event.The thing I want to mention the most was the cameos and the references. It makes Ralph Breaks the Internet feel like a Minecraft server with custom pop cultural skins... I don't know why I said that... let's just move on.Overall, I did not think this film had ""flew like an eagle"", it was just extremely Looney. Ey? Ey? Looney?

If you disregard the 1 and 10 ratings, the curve peaks at a most common rating of 6. That sounds about right. LeBron's acting is better when he's acting tough than when he's showing a softer side.

It's a bunch of garbled up junk full of bad acting and plot. Lebron doesn't even know how to act and whoever was his acting coach deserves to be in a totally different industry. Lebron is all about money and fame and has completely lost his heart for what brought him into who he is now. He saw the opportunity to make a few million dollars and literally ripped off Warner. At least Michael Jordan played his role in space jam whole hearted, probably because Michael didn't forget where he came from and never has...

Even Rick & Morty made an appearance! My Dad and I laughed throughout the movie.I rarely write reviews but felt compelled to help recover the negativity.

At one point, this same group was giving ""Black Panther"" 1 stars stating ambiguous reasons trying to hide the fact that they simply didn't like a black hero having so much influence.

Also loved a few of the WB universe tie ins!Not sure if I would have spent money to see it in a theater but glad I had HBO streaming. Your kids will love the movie! If you're an adult hoping to have the same nostalgia as the original movie, skip it or let that go from your head before going into it.

1124,jacktopple,Entertaining Movie,7,18 July 2021,"The movie was entertaining! The plot was thin and predictable, but before watching, I knew that would be the case based on the first Space Jam. I appreciated and enjoyed the nods to athletes and coaches like Bobby Knight, Vince Carter, Bill Belichick, and so on. The CGI and visual effects were great. I respect the art. A lot of people are comparing LeBron and Jordan. They both are not actors so to expect either to be good is unrealistic. I enjoyed the movie for what it is and would suggest others do the same. Enjoy it. If you are looking for Academy Awards level acting, then this is not your movie. If you are looking for a fun and entertaining movie, this fits the bill.",Space Jam - A New Legacy

People are saying its not like 1996 you need to understand thats 1996 and this is 2021. Everything changed. Yeah for all those adults who loves old movies and says new modern movies s*** will do not like this movie. And people talking about logic and story.

So of course I probably have a biased opinion but I have a feeling the people rating this film at a 4/5 are just wanna be critics and not true basketball enthusiast which is sad if you ask me cause some opinions shouldn't count, I'll also add I appreciated the dad jokes and work ethic vibes from Lebrons first main man role (by the way I'm a warriors fan). Anyways this movie was bound be a difficult sequel to even be considered as good as the original that said don't believe what you hear see or read about this movie it was made for and by somebody from the 90's kid era, lastly I think it's a strong/based on truth story that will be build a positive outlook for right viewer not to mention an awesome cast, check it out and appreciate that this was even a possibility.

There are alot of clever jokes made that has probably gone over the heads of people looking to decimate the movie no matter what. Most of the bad ratings are coming from people that hate Lebron James for whatever nonsensical reasons. Nobody went in thinking Lebron was competing for a Oscar or that Space Jam was trying to win an Academy award, if thats what you're watching a movie called ""space jam"" for than maybe you should get a life or a personality.

1145,joostschoonakker,Just a very bad lame and boring movie,1,19 July 2021,"Storywise its just the biggest bull.... ever and could easily be made up by a kid from 7 years old.Its wouldnt be that bad if the story was simple because its the looney tunes but its just bad and annoying just like the acting of lebron and his weird fake kid
The main villian who also creates most of the story is super annoying not funny at all and does not act well his robot friend looks like .... and aint funny. The goonsquad are very forgetable and you only see a couple of them doing a trick during the game and thats all. No soul no real chacter. All the cameos are not more than in the trailer just a flash of them getting by no lines no jokes nothing. Ow and half of them look like cheap dressed up comic con visitors not the real deal. The looney tunes are not in good shape. They only have a handull of real jokes in the whole movie. They get together (only all right part of the moment when they all get picked up from different movies) and than theres the game already . The game didnt had a lot of good action or exciting moments. Just a couple of goofy moves from the looney tunes but it doesnt really feels like they are playing a full game because the choreagraphy and directing is very bad. Also the whole part with the game looks way to flashy and fake with all the ugly CGI and all the real people badly dressed up on the sidelines combined with CGI characters just 1 big mess. The commentators of the game are 2 morons who are not funny at all and very annoying. The looney tunes look bad in CGI and made me sick but ofcourse they had to do it the lame way. If they just did the rogger rabbit and space jam 1 style it would be great but even in toontown they where to lazy to pull it off and made lebron into a cartoon. Ow and the music in the movie is bad as well.That looney tunes footlocker commercial they did some years ago and the other one with the monstarz both with blake griffin where much better space jam follow ups than this messed up movie.",Space Jam - A New Legacy

Don't be like these people.This movie isn't Schindler's List but it is incredible for children - full of vibrant colors, cool sounds and an easy to follow along story line with an emphasis on family values. Lebron isn't Daniel Day-Lewis but is absolutely on the same level of passable athlete acting as MJ. If you're a DC, Matrix, Mad Max or any WB property fan you'll absolutely enjoy the references.

He was far from anything funny in this movie. If your gonna make a sequel to an original movie and make it similar to it. At least copy the good parts of the original. All the cameos in this one were terrible. They barely show the basketball players. They didn't have any funny random people like bill Murray. Then of course there's the problem with fhd story or lack of story. Just not sure how they let a movie like this even made. They're to worried about offending anyone they forgot to make s funny clever movie. I couldn't believe it was 2 hours long and didn't have anything interesting to offer. Please stop making movies like this if your not gonna have a good script.,Space Jam - A New Legacy

When I first saw the sequel I was excited but with a small hint of questioning they're method of showing as many characters that WB has. This was literally Ready Player One, and Ralph Breaks The Internet again with all of the references to games and movie characters. It just too much, like really Warner? You couldn't think of any ideas for the sequel but instead of advertising. Like the part where the Looney Tune characters go into different movies, that could literally be split into shorts and put onto HBO Max. The acting wasn't really great and I'd rather have the Tunes stay in 2d as like the original. This movie hurts my head.",Space Jam - A New Legacy

1171,draxmoore,Meh,5,17 July 2021,"The acting and plot were sub par but I figured this would be the case going in. Lebron's acting was so bad I found it funny and I think that that is part of the charm of space jam. While some people disagree with the use of CGI instead of traditional animation I actually thought that it was quite good. The colors really popped and some of the animation really blew me away such as the Wet-Fire goon. What I'm most disappointed with is the lack of references or cameos of other Warner Brother properties. Most of the time characters from other properties were just standing on the sideline and while it was fun to pick them out of the crowd I really wish they had done more with it. I think the Lego movie did an excellent job with this and I was hoping for more something like that. Overall, I think kids would really enjoy this movie and as for me I'm glad I watched it. However, I don't see myself ever giving this movie a rewatch and sadly my nostalgia for the original space jam combined with the other problems I mentioned make me a little upset with this film.",Space Jam - A New Legacy

Forget about story telling, let's gather to witness the greatness that is LeBron. With a capitol G. This is a huge middle finger to the original Space Jam. Michael didn't have to shove his reputation down your throat because his reputation preceeded him. He's the best, that's it. LeBron tries to recreate that here artificially. He doesn't have the weight or presence that Michael had, so he's over compensating. Why make a second if it's not for story? Can Hollywood really profit off of such a failed story if they throw in some characters you know? Get ready for the commercial about LeBron that is space jam 2.

Sure it's a fun movie to watch with your family and friends, with cool animations, but the only reason I watched this movie was for the references of other movies/TV shows. And I'm gonna be honest it's not worth it. I had to see the first one before watching this because I have never seen it and i did enjoy the first one a lot! I guess i expected something great from this movie because of the original. I'm not saying i didn't enjoy it at all it just has a lot of flaws. In my opinion Space Jam: a new legacy has the same problem that Space Jam (1996) had. The acting. Both of the main actors were basketball players. And so their acting felt unnatural and it made both of the movies worse because of that. Also the story was really predictable and sort of a cliche.

Space Jam is by no means A masterpiece; however, if you are a fan of the classic Looney Tunes cartoons, you will enjoy the Looney Tune references in this movie. It also has a lot of 'cameos' from various movies spanning the 1960's through today - off the wall cameos from old Warner Bros. Movies (not just cartoons) that see fun to spot. (Easter Eggs?).That being said, I took me, nephews, to the movies today, and my choices were Space Jam and Baby Boss. I was dreading either movie.

This movie is a great kids movie and if we gave kids the opportunity to review this movie on here they'd give it a great review.I think most people reviewing this need to be practical, this wasn't meant to be an Oscar winning piece.

It's basic, uninteresting and I confess I was just there for Looney Tunes. With that purpose in mind. We had some laughs and fun!It it a money oriented/ Advertisement movie? Definitely.But the tons of reference to Warner Brothers titles kept me entertained even when plot lost interest. People here say it's for 3 years old, it has the basic kids movie formula, but you miss these cartoons, you will have some fun along with your kid. Come on, this is no Emoji Movie.

1217,jesusmorenoetx,Not for 90's kids,6,17 July 2021,"If you grew up with the original Space Jam, this movie isn't for you. It doesn't even feel like Space Jam. Warner Brother's obviously wanted a quick cash grab and decided to make this along with merchandise to sell to the public. Look, this is a movie for kids who didn't get to experience Space Jam in the 90's and I think for them at least, it'll be an enjoyable experience. It has some good animation and a couple of decent jokes thrown in, but the story is lackluster and LeBron doesn't come close to playing his part the way MJ played his. Overall, for me being a huge basketball fan and a fan of Warner Bros, it was a decent watch. A nice family film to go see with your kids or your siblings. Original Space Jammers will be disappointed and dissatisfied with this iteration of one of their favorites, but as the title suggests, it's a new legacy and that means a new generation will come and find enjoyment in this film. I will definitely give it another watch someday, but I've had enough of it at this point. Decent film, good animation, terrible story, terrible acting.

1223,danhennen,"This was better than ""Good"" it was ""Good enough""",9,17 July 2021,"I'm grateful for Michael G(Goat) Jordan. I consider him the ""Savior"" of Basketball, an all-time great. Basketball was a dyeing sport and in comes this guy just flying and twirling through the air and taking down everybody like it's no big deal, all except his nemesis, John Michael Wozniak, his security guard. Michael paved the way for more players, more talent, more shoe production, more jobs, more money, just MORE. And just like anything we humans deem precious and or profitable to us, we want to keep it alive and keep it going but not only that, to add more to it.The title of this movie says it all. Michael left his legacy and movie for basketball and now Lebron gets to add to that. Just like the first ""Space Jam,"" this one was just as nostalgic and silly.From all the trailers leading up to this, I was hyped, and every part of those trailers that got me there, experiencing it all made it that much better. Visually, I give it a 10. The Looney Tunes were still looney! There were so many movie and tv show cameos that brought out that nostalgia and smiles. Don't go in expecting to be wowed or anything. The acting was of course not the best but it wasn't the WORST. There was a heartfelt moment that Lebron had with his son which felt very real, so props to him for that.This is a great movie for kids and families..... so, Lakers fans.",Space Jam - A New Legacy

This movie absolutely blew me away. I love how it included different WB franchises we know and love such as Harry potter, DC, Matrix, Austin Powers etc and had some characters watching during the game such as Pennywise, Joker, Voldemort, Fred Flintstone, Mystery Gang, King Kong etc. But in my opinion, this movie nailed it with the plot, characters, visuals, animation and music. I also loved how the movie transitioned between live-action and 2D animation, this movie respected the original Space Jam and the original Looney Tunes characters while having a different lead in this film. The switch between Jordon to Lebron I didn't mind (also that scene with Michael Jordon in the film was hilarious but made me annoyed a bit!) but all in all, this movie really blew my expectations away and was definitely worth the money to see this.

1267,warxjay,Movie was good,8,16 July 2021,Good movie not sure why so many people are hating. I honestly believe there is just to many bias people not giving it a chance because it's not there childhood idol Jordan playing in they film like they original. They did a good job and it will be a classic for they new generation.,Space Jam - A New Legacy
1268,consolashobbygames,THE MOVIE IS AMAZING,10,16 July 2021,"When the movie started, it started with a very weak LeBron performance, but that's normal. LeBron IS NOT AN ACTOR. For me, the movie has fulfilled everything and more. I love all the references they have added from Warner movies. 100% recommended for the whole family.",Space Jam - A New Legacy
1269,mrpychchef,Fun! and full of surprises and easter eggs,10,16 July 2021,I feel sorry for all you sad people writing bad reviews on this movie its a fun movie with heaps of Warner Bros things thrown into it to give it a nosalic feel and make you laugh lighten up you sore losers its a fun kids movie not a movie master peace and give Lebron James a break NBA star going actor what do you expect haha f me.

1271,crashbandicootfan-03472,Good movie. But it has its flaws,7,16 July 2021,"It is a good movie but not as good as the original. Really enjoyed it, though i'm still mad that they removed Pepe Le Pew.. Also Marvin the Martian didn't even appear as a player. I was waiting for him to have more screentime, he just got like 2 seconds of screentime. Liked this movie, but it was not my cup of tea. I still would prefer watching the original Space Jam over this. Lebron James is not bad, but to be fair i missed Michael Jordan, he was really great. And i also miss the Nerdlucks and Mr. Swackhammer as villains but it's fine. A good movie, but not really a great movie. Another thing i kinda didn't like were most of the CGI models, they're all fine for me but Lola Bunny looks creepy and uncanny, i would preferred if they kept the cartoon designs for the Looney Tunes characters, just like the original Space Jam, or Who Framed Roger Rabbit.",Space Jam - A New Legacy

Not in the slightest, but nor was the original, just how it was supposed to be. This is literally a kids movie, so don't read into the negative reviews left by grown adults hahah.

1275,rdugan-64736,"Poor acting, poor dialogue, non-existent plot",1,16 July 2021,"JLB is a good basketball player, and he may have done a better job acting if the script had been better written. The script could have been phenomenal if they had done a better job with the plot design. But the writers, director, and producers were more focused on money-grabbing that there is no plot, and the movie was pulled into too many directions.The father-son relationship was so skewed by all of the different things the writers/producers/director wanted to do, that the underlying tension between them wasn't resolved. As for the Looney Tunes and LeBron, there is no connection between them, there is no respect shown, no give and take in their interactions.As for Don Cheadle, he did the best he could with what he was given, but his performance was lackluster because the dialogue was not well developed.",Space Jam - A New Legacy

Lebron's acting was on par of Jordan's so no need to compare. Gave me just as much excitement as the original when I was a kid... Realized it's not for my generation right away so wasn't hard to let go and enjoy a family flick. Overall gave it a 10 for fun story, cgi, classic characters, Easter eggs and overall good time!",Space Jam - A New Legacy

1283,millertron-92963,Decent sequel,10,16 July 2021,Great kids movie but the only thing wrong with it is Lebron acting but it kinda reminds you how bad Michael Jordan acting was in the original space jam.,Space Jam - A New Legacy
1284,HonestMJFan-6,Far better than the original,10,16 July 2021,"With new technology and a true lesson that needs to be taught, the new Space Jam feels necessary and futuristically fun. LeBron shines on screen with about as much charisma and star quality as any athlete turned actor. Well known characters and silly worlds allow for a family fun adventure that is sure to have the kids excited and the parents content. LeBron is sure to pass on an important lesson about fatherhood and remains a powerful voice for good after this movie.As a player, a humanitarian and now as an actor, LeBron has surpassed MJ in every conceivable way.",Space Jam - A New Legacy
1285,joshgordonisgood,Not Great by any means - but very pleasing to watch.,7,16 July 2021,"I will start this review by calling out the vital thing holding this movie back. Lebron James's acting. Now, to be honest, I thought he would be even worse than he turned out being. And for the most part, the writers did a great job of, almost, hiding his lack of acting skill, by not giving him to many emotional lines etc. But that being said, whenever Lebron did need to perform these types of scenes, it sometimes became hard to watch, notably at the start of the movie.That being said, I did find myself enjoying this movie. No, the plot isnt one of great twist, amazing originality, and amazing character development - But it didnt need to be. What the movie does well, is implementing good references and jokes without them feeling forced. Especially as somebody who watched basketball, i really found myself enjoying all the easter eggs during the game. Keeping me entertained and maintaining my focus.There is alot the movie does poorly how ever, but overall, im satisfied, i didnt expect them to reinvent the wheel, nor blow me away, but i was entertained and can see myself watching this movie again down the line. I feel it will have the same nostalgia factor as the original.",Space Jam - A New Legacy
1286,bradthadchad,Straight Trash,1,16 July 2021,This is quite possibly the worst movie in the history of movies. LeBron is just trying to be like Jordan and this is a blatant money grab by Warner Bros to stay relevant. LeBum needs to move on and accept that he's an overrated guy who the league babies to make him feel better. Absolute dog water film and player.,Space Jam - A New Legacy
1287,alexisdegross-02850,Bring back a lot of memories with new ones,10,16 July 2021,It was really fun viewings the movie especially the Easter eggs and all the licenses that Warner brothers have for me looking this movie and the first space jam.for me Lebron James still need to learn a little more of acting but was great I really love the movie thank you.,Space Jam - A New Legacy
1288,hjediah,Forced at times,7,16 July 2021,"Not bad based of the first space jam, just didn't like how Lebron was forcing jokes at times that weren't funny, but other than that it wasn't bad.",Space Jam - A New Legacy
1289,oskarlitewka,It's a dumb movie but I had a lot of fun,8,27 August 2021,"I don't think that this movie is great, but it's no near the worst movie ever made
like 1 or 2/10 is an exaggeration. Not saying people don't have valid points but that I think the movie gets a bit too much hateCritically it's like 4/10 but for the enjoyment I and my sister had while watching it, it's 7/10
just like the first Space Jam was like 5/10 critically but for the enjoyment it has a higher score for meAlthough I must admit I've watched this movie not in English, I watching it with a Polish Dub and I feel like it makes the movie better, just like with the OG Space Jam I thought the Polish dub made the voices of the characters for the most part better, at least in my opinion. So while I heard LeBron isn't very good as an actor or that Zendaya doesn't fit Lola I can't confirm that since their voices were different.I do think some of the jokes were...not greatI can admit it's a dumb movie that isn't great and that there's a lot of things that associated with this movie that I can see why many people hate this movie so much
but despite that I just can't help but like it.",Space Jam - A New Legacy
1290,khaichansangvaiphei,Family movie,10,16 July 2021,"Definitely recommend it, one of the best Movie to watch with friends and family. The First Movie was a classic and definitely can't be replaced, but that doesn't mean the sequel can't be as great as the first one. The acting skills of Lebron is also a must to witness, it's definitely not the best but as an athlete, he's acting skill is pretty amazing. The movie is filled with humor and inside jokes for basketball fans. Simply put, it's a complete package.",Space Jam - A New Legacy
1291,daeves,everyone always hates on lebron,10,16 July 2021,"I am tired of reading all these hate comments. This movie is great. It has a great theme. I mean its 2021 of course it's going to be a more modern movie. People just find so many ways to hate on lebron on everything he does. He isn't even a terrible actor. This movie was for laughs and for family to watch. People just get mad that lebron is so successful (and well deserved). If you are thinking of watching this movie, you for sure should.",Space Jam - A New Legacy

1296,zpamperin,Serious,5,16 July 2021,I thought the movie was fun and definitely enjoyable time watching. The thing about the first movie is no it wasn't good the plot didn't make a lot of sense and that's part of why I loved it so much but this movie wanted it to make sense and added that Lebron wasn't a good father which makes for an uplifting story at the end but I just felt like it wasn't needed. I wanted to just be able to enjoy myself while watching the movie but the dad dynamic made the movie too serious in my opinion. It is a pretty forgettable movie but I enjoyed watching.,Space Jam - A New Legacy
1297,daveyj1,Starts slow... but becomes a really fun ride,8,16 July 2021,"The best thing about this is that it doesn't take itself too seriously. It's a ridiculous premise and yes, one giant Warner Bros promotion for all of its own properties. But none of that bothered me... because it's in on the joke, winking at us the whole time.The only real problem I had was there was way too much exposition at the beginning to setup what is a ridiculous and implausible premise that was going to be LOONEY to begin with. We could've had the same story beats at a snappier clip.Once we get into Tune World/The Serververse... this thing is a blast!Also, Lebron's acting improves greatly when it's for the sake of comedy. He's got great comedic timing... but he is NOT a dramatic actor. They spent way too long on the buildup... and I'm sure that's why a lot of reviewers have been down on this.But once the real fun begins, it's a truly great ride, especially for the little ones and the NBA fans.",Space Jam - A New Legacy
1298,reptarox,No bill,7,16 July 2021,Decent enough the kids enjoyed it that's what I care about. The original was god awful bill Murray saved that movie lebron just didn't have a bill Murray. Acting wise he isn't very good but I mean neither was Jordan. Animation was nice though. I can't stand to watch the original as an adult but I can enjoy the animation quality on this but probably won't watch it again.,Space Jam - A New Legacy

1303,dabedgarcia,What WB couldn't fit into Ready Player One,1,16 July 2021,"This movie is bad if you are over 12yrs old. Not that the first was great, but this one is terrible. For one, it has nothing to do with space. The first 30 min is how much Lebron showcases better acting hurt on a basketball floor, than he does in a movie. The montage of rounding up the other toons is basically WB showing off their dvd library. The only realistic part of the movie is when the son realizes the Toons are going to win and he switches sides to be on the winning team. Classic Lebron James. Oh and don't mind the 100 or so Nike plugs in this movie either. They are not subtle at all. Just bad writing, bad acting and the majority is CG for some reason because I'm sure Lebron phoned this one in.",Space Jam - A New Legacy
1304,tking-97404,Not as bad as I thought!!,8,16 July 2021,"This movie is nothing like the original for a number of reasons! The first one was set in a different time and era. We are in a world now where artificial intelligence is real and the video games are new norm. If you are looking for nostalgia, you won't find it. If you watch the movie with an open mind and not try to compare it with the first movie....you just might enjoy it.",Space Jam - A New Legacy
1305,ziokim-93151,Wow!,10,16 July 2021,"Space Jam is easily a contemporary masterpiece. Dom James is one of the greatest written protagonists and we see this through his self discovery and the beautiful parallelism between Lebron and Al G Rithim, the antagonist of the story. Rithim represents manipulation and control in a world filled with fun and joy. It is also fantastic to see the development as a father in the modern superstar Lebron James. Truly fantastic!",Space Jam - A New Legacy
1306,fwebster-12980,"Wow, just wow.",1,16 July 2021,"Dame time, and Lebron thinking Michael B Jordan was MJ to save the day. These were the 2 scenes that made my attention span perk up.I know Michael Jordan getting sucked under a golf course to the Looney tune land is cheesy, but getting sucked into a computer to play a basketball game... I'm sorry I just don't understand why. Kids are going to love this movie because of the digital wow factor. But I mean they could have come up with a better story. LeBron should have stayed in Cleveland, because he doesn't belong in Hollywood.",Space Jam - A New Legacy
1307,joaquinandmegan,Why did they even try?,1,16 July 2021,I was all hyped for this movie for nothing. I guess the kid in me was excited since I grew up watching it but they wasted lots of time with this movie because it definitely shouldn't even get one star it's not worth the hype and yes has a good story line but definitely not a space jam movie and makes space jam fans all excited just to be let down.,Space Jam - A New Legacy
1308,birdperson113,Incredibly fun and refreshing,10,17 July 2021,"Man, it's pretty hard to be excited about a movie with so many bad critiques, but after watching it I can confirm that it's mostly LeBron hate.This movie is very fun with humor for young adults like myself and I'm pretty sure that kids would like it too. LeBron impressed me to be honest, he was a very decent actor.My advice for other reviewers: stop being in your feelings so much and be objective, it's just a kids movie after all.",Space Jam - A New Legacy
1309,ohsnap-01612,A fun and enjoyable film,6,17 July 2021,"As a stand-alone feature I'd say it's pretty decent. The humor and comedy is great, with the cartoonish antics and the Tunes themselves in particular being a highlight of the film. The cameos and references to some might come of as pointless and/or shameless, but for me they were a highlight of the movie. If you enjoy Looney Tunes or any classic animation or that style of humor, then you will find plenty of enjoyment in this film.",Space Jam - A New Legacy

It's just a commercial for LeBron James Internal struggle to compete with Michael Jordan. LeBron act is spiritless at best.I like LeBron James as a basketball player and really enjoyed it during the year watching him play.

1323,Letswatchit,Pretty good remake,10,17 July 2021,I didn't know what to expect originally but I think Lebron did very good for his first film. It started out a little slow but picked up in the end and was worth the watch . I honestly would give the movie an 8 but rated it a 10 because all of the old heads were rating it a 1 . And tbh anyone who rated it so low couldn't have watched the movie because it deserved way higher rating than that . I usually hate remakes but this one was pretty good . I kind of wish Micheal Jordan made a small appearance at least but it's okay . The movie definitely appeals to the newer generation but I still appreciated it as a 90s baby.,Space Jam - A New Legacy

My daughter would say it was a 10 though(she's 9 and doesn't even like basketball!) any one rating it less than a 5 in the comment section are just haters, and as Granny says ""Haters gonna hate!"" due to whatever ignorant and sad reason they dislike or hate Lebron. Lebron's acting is much better than MJ's, but leaving comparisons aside, My daughter and I enjoyed it, I laughed so many times from references or lines throughout the movie and those of lebron poking fun at himself via Don Cheadle commentary. Cheadle played great kids villain, much respect to him and what he did. 1st space jam was a really good kids movie. This one is a Great kids movie, not a knock on MJ(not his fault) Just CGI was amazing, writing was better, more entertaining for adults and much funnier than the original. Overall a great kids movie storyline. That will be this generation of kids space jam they watch. Best kids movie of the last couple years easily!!!",Space Jam - A New Legacy

Michael Jordan was a TERRIBLE actor. So for those giving this movie a hard time because Lebron isn't a professional actor need to get off their high horse. This movie is fun and has lots of personality.The negative reviews for this movie are stemming from the same nostalgia that makes original Star Wars fans so cynical about the new movies.This movie was entertaining and worth watching. Stop comparing it to the OG Space Jam that you watched as a KID and remember this movie, like that one, is for kids - not for jaded adults.",Space Jam - A New Legacy

I was a kid for the original movie and was so excited to watch this one with my 9 year old. He was cracking up at the Looney Toons and got SO invested in the plot. If you're ready for Space Jam 2, it's a must watch. If you're hoping for some sort of a docu-drama about basketball then you're going to be disappointed. This is a half cartoon/ half live-action movie with Lebron James and the Looney Toons. Know what you're getting into. For a kids movie, it's great!!",Space Jam - A New Legacy

1333,jayronian,DO NOT LISTEN TO THESE REVIEWSS!!,7,17 July 2021,"Most of these reviews are biased people... in all honesty. These are other adults who were kids watching the first space jam and probably idolized MJ. Now they over here reviewing this movie, most likely hating on the one who is in it, LeBron. THE MOVIE IS MEANT FOR KIDS NOT ADULTS. THIS IS A GOOD FAMILY MOVIE FOR THE YOUNGER GENERATION. I mean it really is just sad reading all y'all middle aged adults hating on a movie because of one person. The acting was close to the same of the original maybe a little bit worse to be honest. But KIDS don't care about acting, just like y'all didn't when you watched the damn original. Grow up people!! I liked the original better but to put all this hate on the revamp is sad. LeBron literally idolized MJ as well so I'm sure making this movie meant a lot to him.",Space Jam - A New Legacy
1334,bryancaresia,Never gonna be the GOAT,1,17 July 2021,"Worst movie I've seen since the 90's. LeBron is exactly who we know him to be...a terrible actor on and off the court.

1339,lowkeyhighentertainment,This ain't the 90s anymore; and that's all folks,9,17 July 2021,"I'm going to be honest here. From a future game developer, an artist and a movie classic appreciator.Space Jam 2 was legitimately a good movie.And before you movie credics from the 90s era that probably reviewed this and are upset by my claim. Let's get it straight, it's not the classic. But the classic was catered to us as kids. This movie, isn't made for us now; it's made for our kids. No of our kids know what it's like to sit at the edge of your seat while Michael Jordan dunks the ball, remembers he was the number1 pick in every basketball game. Still our kids respect Jordan as an athlete, but he isn't what wows the crowds anymore; the game has moved on, and new players are making new history. I really think that's what the debate of space jam is about. We had our space jam in the 90s. We had our looney toons in the 90s, the thing is... It's not the 90s anymore. Times change, and so do people.It's like listening to music. NSYNC, Backstreet boys, Metallica, Korn, Tupac... We listened to that music as kids. We loved it, and would roll our eyes when our parents played something like ready for the world, feeltwood Mac, Johnny cash; because those weren't what was now in our era. As we got older though, we respected our parents choices a
And we may even listen to them now and identify it as good music. Same as our kids nowadays deal with Jordan.The movie from a digital standpoint is great, the cartoons are fun as well; and there are so many things from WBs past that show up in that movie as Easter eggs. The movie takes a videogame digital twist, and the bad guys are pretty cool looking. It's what our newer generations like. And it's a mix with the old and new. Take it how it is, Space Jam 2 is a great movie to enjoy with your family.",Space Jam - A New Legacy
1340,carlosjiscool,Unbiased Opinion (unlike the rest of the reviews),9,17 July 2021,"The hate for LeBron James is crippling. The acting, humor, creativity and parallels to the first movie made it super fun to watch. LeBron had some bad acting scenes like the ""hey siri how do I get out of here."" but the best of LeBron's scenes exceed the best we saw from Jordan several years ago.",Space Jam - A New Legacy

1342,ttfjdgxpb,I liked it!,9,17 July 2021,I'm honestly surprised to see so many negative reviews. I thought it was cute & the jokes were funny.

1346,dominicawitt,So many Easter eggs!,8,17 July 2021,"Just saw it in theaters for my anniversary and loved it so much! It doesnt have the same feeling as the first one, but it settles into its own quite well. I was so worried about it trying to hard to be the OG space jam, but they really don't strive for that at all. It's all the warm fuzzy nostalgia mixed with modern day pop culture.As an individual whom uses social media as a huge part of my career I can confirm the algorithm really be acting like that. The villian though isn't really the main conflict though, and he plays a much smaller role than most villans so he's not super fleshed out. It works for this movie. I also loved seeing the traditional cartoon style with live action again, who framed Roger rabbit was a favorite in my childhood, the live action toons were a little off putting at first. Over all great movie, would definitely recommend.",Space Jam - A New Legacy
1347,talloncomcowich,It actually was pretty good,10,17 July 2021,"The reviews do not do this movie actual justice. The acting isnt great, but it's a kids movie and still entertaining. Also the original space jam wasn't ""good"" either. Like, it's space jam, Jesus.",Space Jam - A New Legacy

This film has a great but easy story line to follow for kids and some really awesome call backs to old Warner bros classics for the adults.Jordan fans are gonna give it one star because they're stuck in the past and hate everything lebron does. Truth is, this movie was great. Don't let the Michael Jordan stans fool you.",Space Jam - A New Legacy
1349,kamurphy-89925,Modern yet reminiscent,10,17 July 2021,I have watched this movie twice with my 4 year old who knew nothing about Looney Tunes or King James. He loves it. I grew up watching LooneyTunes cartoons so this is a treat to watch in modern day. It's a relatable story line for any father or parent trying to balance the art of listening and teaching their child to follow their passion with a plan and work ethic. #blackfatherslovetheirfamiliestoo.,Space Jam - A New Legacy

It was moving to see the characters go beyond general resolution to committing to each other's strengths. The different animation styles were really exciting to watch and the villains were so clever!Cookie crumbs galore!If you know you know!Well done LeBron!

1353,djwlee,Haters!!!!!!!!!,10,17 July 2021,Let me start of by saying I hate this generation of people who leave reviews based off of hate. Lebron haters are the worst kind of people. Space Jam 1 was horrible on every level and the best thing about it was R Kelly and Bugs bunny.... This movie is everything Space jam should have been. Was it the best movie ever??? Not at all but it for sure hands down was better than the first one in every way. There were actual jokes in this film and not just cartoons running around in circles. I like that the movie did not go over the top and kept it simple.Conclusion: These movies are for kids and I know for sure kids are not leaving reviews trashing a kids movie so adults in this world need to grow up and stop being petty it's that simple.,Space Jam - A New Legacy

1356,wigwob,Forces myself to finish.,1,17 July 2021,I forced myself to finish this movie. I thought at least my 4yo daughter would enjoy but she feel asleep. I could tell it was a dude 2 mins in when I watched what was basically a Lebron nba commercial. Then we finally see Lebron enter the screen And he speaks...thats when the movie goes downhill. I thought the plot was forcibly made modern with the plot but it is what it is. Would've been better if they wrote the script in a way that brought back the monstars and used newer players for powers. Outside of that the scenes seem all over the place. The dialog is corny and dry. The joke fall flat. LBJ can't act for sh%*. Period. No movie should be centered around him speaking/acting like this one is. Theres clear marketing ads plugs through your the film..like Nike and obviously WB. I wouldn't be surprise if this movie already turned profit just off the ads alone. But whatever. Anyway it's a bad movie.. I hope don cheadle got good money because he's a great actor. Lebron is once again in MJ shadow as this movie and his acting aren't nearly as good as the original. Don't pay to watch this! 1/10.,Space Jam - A New Legacy
1357,trentsiever,Just bad,1,17 July 2021,"Bad acting. I get it, a basketball player talking to a ping pong ball that will later be bugs bunny isn't easy, but it was hard to get over. Jordan was better in the original. And that's a pretty low bar.",Space Jam - A New Legacy
1358,johnsayavong,Bad,1,17 July 2021,"Lebrons acting was not natural throughout.very amateurish.

1363,dalxanda,I don't agree with critics,7,17 July 2021,"I find that everytime a movie gets it ratings, that they don't speak for me. If they love them, I hate them. If it's ""universally panned"" I tend to love them.I grew up on Space Jam, and remember liking it as a kid, but I find that as an adult it's not rewatchable.A New Legacy is not without its commercialism or memberries. Its inherent, and so was the original.Its certainly a very time tested and true story. A father wants whats best for his kid, and the kid doesn't want to do it, because he has his own path. Yep, we've seen this before.But, I find the heart of the movie to be genuine, I find the performances of the actors to be believable, I think the cgi was very well done, and the pacing to be exciting and engaging.Its a good movie worth watching. I don't know what the critics and reviewers were expecting, but maybe... it just wasn't for them. As always.",Space Jam - A New Legacy
1364,quadze,Absolutely Disastrous!,1,17 July 2021,"How come the first movie from 1996 looks way better than this?The style of animation looks terrible! The 2D part of the movie looks like it was made in Adobe Flash back in the early 2000s. The animation is choppy and the lip sync is laughable! How can you mess up the lip sync in such a high profile animation movie? The voice acting sucks, the actors suck and some scenes are so bad and cringy - I could barely watch! It's unfunny and most scenes are irrelevant for kids and extremely boring for adults! But hey! Big Chungus and The Matrix is in the movie! Is'nt that what kids like nowadays?Stay away and spare yourself from this soulless movie!",Space Jam - A New Legacy

I can't understand why this movie is getting such bad reviews! I think it's because people keep trying to compare it to the first one. But it's called NEW LEGACY for a reason. It's not meant to be like the first. As a parent it is so hard finding ""family night"" movies that don't involve cringeworthy moments that make you wish you never let your child watch them. If you have young children and care about what they see and hear, aside from a few curse words here and there you will appreciate this movie. Yes it's all about Lebron but it is centered around family. And tries to teach a lesson about working hard to accomplish your dreams but also have fun doing it. LOVED IT!",Space Jam - A New Legacy

I mean you guys have to be kidding, one of you guys really said ""unrealistic"", really...

1380,adnba-69162,Good Movie,7,17 July 2021,This movie is basically like the original but with a lot of different changes. It was also pretty funny with some jokes and had lots of celebrity cameos. The celebrity cameos were also creative and cool. It had some fake outs and had some recognizable LeBron memes if youve seen them before. Also Dom Ball reminds me of NBA Playgrounds because of the style the game and mechanics when we watch him play it. One problem I had with the movie was the lighting because the people were differently lighted than animated characters which was really distracting. In all it was a fun watch.,Space Jam - A New Legacy

Lebron James best acting is when he was animated, and the looney tunes absolutely carried this movie.Story line could had been better, but it wasn't horrible. Don't listen to these critics most of these people hate lebron because he dont like Trump and speaks out against things they want us to be quiet about. Simple! Watch the movie for yourself, I took my son and nephew and both loved it!!!! Very looney, alot of jokes and shots at lebron career...which is hilarious if you are a basketball fan.

I think some of the low reviews are comparing this movie to the original and many people may have a nostalgia bias. This film is definitely not meant to be taken too seriously as a sports film and is supposed to just be a cartoony kids film to watch for fun. I will acknowledge that most (if not all) of the live-action acting is pretty bad, but the voice acting was good and the animation was phenomenal (except for Al-G Rhythm's transformed design). Some moments were a bit cringey, like Porky Pig rapping or Granny being cool and sassy, and at times it felt like WB tried to forcefully shove in a lot of their properties.

1390,itsjeremie,Comparing zeitgeist to zeitgeist,9,17 July 2021,"Seeing this was on HBO Max I came in excited. Growing up Space Jam was one of my favorite movies, and this has many of the elements that made the original so great.With the combination of Lebron's acting, and some predictability, I don't think I can give this a 10, but I can say I had a great time watching it and loved all the pop culture references.Many of the 1/10 reviews seem to stem from using a binary to rank the two Space Jam movies. The first is a 10, because they like the athlete in it better and it's the original. This one has to be a 1 because it isn't ""as good"". Why does everything have to be a binary? Can we enjoy things for enjoyment sake?I titled this zeitgeist to zeitgeist because movies are made for the cultural time period surrounding them. If you were hoping for what we had in the 90s basketball era, film era, and animation era you've set an unrealistic criteria and you'll be letdown. If you come in expecting a fun family movie with the looney tunes being looney and tons of fun Warner Bros film references you'll come out of this with a big smile on your face.We know Lebron isn't a good actor (sorry Lebron, your flopping in the NBA has proved this) but we understand why he's the right guy for the job. I hope you enjoy this movie as much as I did. More than an athlete.",Space Jam - A New Legacy

1399,Villanellee,"Such a let down, but what do you expect?",1,17 July 2021,Crybaby BronBron is absolutely atrocious on and off screen. If this was made without him it would have been better.

It had nostalgic moments that made the classic good and added a modern/new spin to it as well. People are hating on Lebron's acting?? Come on man! The dude wasn't going for the Oscar award. He was good as expected for the best ""BASKETBALL"" player in the world right now. I haven't given him the nod for the GOAT just yet- I still think MJ gets the nod for now... but I can smell the stank of Lebron haters. People... Rate the movie- not what you think about the person. This movie was wonderful, and my kids who just watched the original and enjoyed it, enjoyed this one just as much- if not more! Good movie. Well done. I would actually rate it a 7 or 8 but given the hate- I'm making it a 10. If you forget the unfair critics noise you will enjoy this movie! Good job Lebron, and all that put in the work to make this a reality 25 years later!",Space Jam - A New Legacy
1401,deandre-14021,Not too bad!,8,17 July 2021,"Watching this movie as an adult, you need to have an open mind, a fan of basketball and looney toons to enjoy this movie. Pretty much a kid at heart. No it's nothing like the 1st and what film is, but using everything in today's culture worked pretty well. I loved how they threw all the Warner bros. Movies and toons together, and also seeing some of today's all stars in monstars forms. It seemed like it would of made more since to use LeBron's actual family instead of replacements.",Space Jam - A New Legacy

Absolutely ruins this movie, he should just stick to bball or maybe try gardening but please not acting. Hollywood can not help this guy, he has about as much on screen charisma as a safety cone. Please do is all a favor LBJ; hire someone to punch you in the face the next time you think it's a good idea to buy yourself a role in a movie.This movie is so bad I don't don't just want my money back, I want money back; dinner and another movie paid for just to feel I broke even.",Space Jam - A New Legacy

1411,narddoggydog,2 hours I'll never get back,1,18 July 2021,"Honestly probably rather watch paint dry than to watch this movie again. The acting was the equivalent of watching 2 pigs roll around in the mud, except I think I'd rather watch the pigs. Lebron pushing his narrative, once again is quite frankly disgusting. I'm all for equality but quit forcing it down my throat like I'm at a reverse colonoscopy appointment.

I was completely disappointed. When people refer to movies as a gimmick, this is by far THEE MOST LEGIT BIGGEST GIMMICK MOVIE I have ever seen. And honestly, I'll just leave it at that. If I HAD to pick ONE thing and say a positive, it'd be that Don Cheadle played the villain well (considering the trash plot and constant need of gimmicks). Again, given this rating is strictly on the movie itself and no comparison etc. Oh, and there was one song I was like, ""ehhh, okay. That's decent.""

I wasn't expecting a master class from LBJ, he is a basketball player after all not an Oscar winning actor. For the 2 hours we watched it was hilarious. Great call back to the WB studios IP, silly storyline but what do you expect when you are meshing cartoon with CGI and live action. Get over yourselves those who just want a reason to criticise. As a black man as well, I loved the authentic blackness of the film. Corny yes, but for me and my wife who are 36 years old with our 3 and 5 year olds who saw and laughed too, highly recommend.

Watched at a $AMC theaters! Lebron James made this movie good and funny! I'm sure if you're watching this with your kids the kids would love it, I'm in my 20's and some of the jokes were funny and kept me wanting to watch the twist on it was good! These boomers don't know how to enjoy a movie anymore they critique any little thing. Seeing all the Warner bro characters around also was exciting and seeing who you can spot!

I love that they used mostly the same characters and new ones as well. Bugs had his own agenda of getting all of his pals back together. Over all we enjoyed it and the plot was great.

Not much a lebron fan but i think the concept of cross over the WB universe is kinda cool, really hope that justice league can play ball too and i think the title should not be named space jam. Plus, that michael jordan half time teased really got me. If u go watching this movie with the idea maybe it will be related to the original space jam then u will 100% disappointed for sure thus give it 1 star and the genre already stated that this movie is family/kids what do u expect. I mean its not that good and not that bad as 1 star. The only thing i hate about this movie is they really worshiping lebron so hard in this movie. I know lebron is a great bball player but come on, mention part of his accomplishment once is enough. No need to bring it every minutes. Overall its not that bad trust me.",Space Jam - A New Legacy

They don't actually care if the story is good or not, just what will they get back for their investment.And that's what this film is in a nutshell. Not a single person who worked on this ""film"" cared if it's good or bad. I can literally picture them sitting around a table at one of Warner's offices saying ""how are we going to steal their cash?"". There's NO saving grace. The acting is awful, and that's putting it nicely. The direction (or lack there of) is just as bad. It's a directors job to push the actors to get the most out of them. However, Malcolm D. Lee evidently didn't care, as the final product is trash. Then again, what was I expecting from the director of Scary Movie 5? Oh and don't get me started on the ""comedy"" (palms face).Lets call this what it really is, a cash grab. I even took my nephews and niece (who're young) to see this and they didn't even like it. They threw Looney Tunes in there because hey it worked once, why not spoil an old films legacy like Hollywood loves to do with lame remakes.I feel most bad for Don Cheadle.

But it's Warner Bros - they're not exactly known for making good movies lately. The villain's plan and the plot set up makes no sense, and I wish the other NBA/WNBA players got more scenes in this. If you're expecting this movie to cater to your 90s nostalgia for the first Space Jam, you'll probably be disappointed. It's clearly for today's kids.

This movie seems to understand what it's about, a silly kid's movie with Looney Tunes characters and the NBA's biggest star, but is that where the similarities end for this sequel? Unfortunately, yes, as Space Jam: A New Legacy just seems to have a lack of flow and consistency (like Khris Middleton). Whenever the movie seems like it's going to develop something, it seems that the scene transitions or the entire atmosphere is completely altered. This movie's pacing is too fast and nothing seems coherent, which seems great for a looney tunes short, but not for a feature-length film. The fast pace makes the movie seem lost at times with new characters being added for no reason and a plot that is easily
forgettable and, at times, unfocused. This movie doesn't make LeBron LeGoat or LeBum, just LeAverage. This movie gets a 6/10 😐",Space Jam - A New Legacy

I had read a review on letterboxd of a man who had seen this movie. The review itself was several long paragraphs that explained the despair this film caused him. The reviewers vocabulary and grammatical prowess was beyond anything i've ever seen for a mailman review before. My friends and I found this review kind of funny, being that it was about Space Jam. We decided we were going to watch the movie just to see how bad it was.WARNING:
IT WAS AWFULThis movie is 2 hours of burning hot garbage. I respect Lebron James as a basketball player, but he cannot act. The visuals in this film are jarring and overwhelming, even the 2d animation hurts my eyes. Throughout the entirety of this 2 hour film I could not retain more than 1 or 2 plot points. The whole movie was essentially a Lebron James and Warner Bros advertisement. I've never found a film that's more of an abomination than this one, I genuinely never wanted to turn off a movie more. The reviewer on Letterboxd was correct, I can hardly hear the word Space Jam without having a panic attack. The dread this film caused me is still effective days later. Please, don't watch this movie. Tell your entire family to not watch this movie. The only people that will like this movie are toddlers.THIS REVIEW IS NOT SATIRE.",Space Jam - A New Legacy

I went into the movie not really having the highest of standards and walked out pleased. This movie is just a total blast from start to finish. Now I do have my issues though. Lebron's acting is not that good but he's a basketball player not an actor. Also how long the basketball game was. The game made up 65% of this film and towards the end of the game it just got boring. Also with the game is all the characters on the sideline. Yes I loved that all these characters from Harry Potter and Hannah Barbera were watching but it took my attention away from the game and was focused on which characters I could spit. Lastly, yes the movie is a big commercial for Warner Bros but so was Space Jam 1 for Nike and the Looney tunes.

The first Jam was WAY better and this was nothing like it. This movie is literally probably good for kids under 5 years old who laugh at anything and wouldn't notice the horrible acting and hack job they did on the Looney Toons.

His family did a good job despite it not being their forte either but I wanted to like Lebron more and I just didn't. He wasn't as charming, humble and comical as Michael Jordan was in the original so overall I found his presence off putting as much as I don't hold it against him.The villain... so here, they were trying to make it 'current' but they didn't need to do that.

The plot was just as simple and full of plot holes. Do people think WB was going for an Oscar nod with this movie? It's exactly what it's supposed to be. A nod to the classic with a ton of improvements. We're so numb to effects today we've forgotten how far we've come from the original. The FX and sound were amazing. LeBron was way more animated and invested in his role than Michael ever was. The jokes were incredibly cheesy. But good lord people...it's the LOONY Tunes. It's always been this way. Watch this movie as the 10-year old that watched and grew up with the classic and you won't regret it. Watch it as an ogre wannabe movie critic who has no business watching kids movies, and you will be VERY disappointed.",Space Jam - A New Legacy
1495,ajvdezign,If this wasn't a remake it wouldn't be as heavily criticized.,6,24 July 2021,"Looking at other reviews of this movie, I had a really good laugh. 9/10 people will say the acting was horrible, but let's get serious- it's a kids movie and it's being critiqued by adults who were children that watched the first one. Rewind, watch the original Space Jam, and tell me that Michael Jordan was a better actor (don't lie to yourself either).This was a decent movie, great for children, with plenty of entertaining bits for adults. The first 45 minutes was amazing, traveling through the ""Warner-verse"". To anyone saying they didn't laugh at all during this movie, you must have had a bad day. Sylvester and Elmer's intro into the movie was hilarious, along with many of the other toons. The Chapelle Show reference was also great.Does it live up to the hype? Absolutely not. Was it a cash grab? Absolutely. One thing is for certain though, the people criticizing this movie and giving it under 5 star reviews need to be criticized and critiqued themselves. If you go into a movie wanting to hate it or already hating it, why are you even giving your opinion?9/10 Animation
4/10 Story (it's a kids movie)
6/10 HumorThe story is very easy to follow, was missing a good supporting lead like Bill Murray to ease L. J. poor acting (He's an athlete, not an actor, take it for what it is). Don Cheadle did a great job playing a villain- and on top of that it's interesting that no one is celebrating the fact that this was a primarily African American cast. As for the plot, the movie also does a decent job at pointing out the complexities of having a career, while being a parent (wanting the best for your child while allowing them to mold themselves into who they want to be is not easy).All in all, I give it a 6, and a solid one at that. It's entertaining, fun to watch with your children, but not something you definitely need to see or add to your immediate watch list.",Space Jam - A New Legacy

It had some kind of sharm, something wich was far absent in this one. Since Into the Spider Verse i´ve been a huge fan of the new animation style some movie makers have started to play with. Its just pure fun and their creativity feels like anything is possible to create. But this just feels like the movie-makers had a meeting for two hours, and made it in just a week.

When we all first saw that movie it hit all the right notes for the person we were at the moment in which we watched it. But it was also ridiculous. I won't ask you to rewatch it yourself because you'll love it again and again the same as me. But I challenge you, get someone who hasn't seen the movie and is generally on uninterested. Have them watch the original and then have them watch the new one. Understand that this movie wasn't made to behoove those who saw it as a young individual. This hit the notes for the target audience and sure the acting isn't great. He's not an actor. Neither was Michael Jordan. But that's the fun you get out of a movie like this.

The movie has the overdone father has to have more time for fun because dad is serious and doesn't believe in son.The CGI characters in addition are uncanny and lifeless just like LeBron's performance in the film. It is sad when the 2D animation has better fluidity than the 3D CGI characters. This film is not worth your hard earned dollar if you do happen to see itThis movie is boring it doesn't hold up to the fun of the original it takes way to long to even show the Loony Tunes in the original it was 15min maybe even less to show them in this film it takes 30 minutes to get to the part of the movie that makes this a hybrid animation film in addition the humor is a severe downgrade this film just has referential humor oh here is a reference and here is one the point in the film where rick and Morty showed up made me wanna cut my head off it was so bad it wasn't even funny it was just like ""oh a reference"" no punchline no joke I see this style of ""humor"" in a lot of movies now a days and it scares meIt is an okay family film if there is nothing else to watch then fine if you are bored on a Tuesday and want to see a film with your kids then this is perfectly okay although they may get bored of it pretty quickly I viewed this film with a friend of mine and he got bored at the 45 min mark and started playing on his phoneI almost fell asleep twice this movie just sorta drags on until it gets to the basketball game the last like 30 minutes the basketball game is the only interesting part of this movie, the point at which buggs ""dies"" is also an overdone trope where you are baited into thinking a popular character dies even though it is super obvious to anyone with more than one brain cell that he is going to be okay because of course he is they have to make more films to make more money F&%* having original ideas screw though just use overdone tropes and overdone cliques this type of referential humor lazy film writing gives me fear.",Space Jam - A New Legacy

We were both energised after the viewing and I would definitely watch it again.Ok bad points I guess shoe horning in every film / show Warner Bros ever made, but it was actually quite fun looking for the different characters from films gone by! I laughed a number of times and we were dancing in our seats.I only watched the original once and it was so long ago i can't remember it, maybe that's important so as not to tarnish watching this!If you can bury the cynic in you and go for a good time then you shouldn't be disappointed.

Space Jam: A New Legacy is about a basketball game that the king Lebron James has to play to save his own son, because he has been catched by the ALG. In the middle of all this he found the looneys, and is with them that he plays.The acting of this film is what you think it is, not to good. But I understand that can be hard to act with just green screen, because of he looney and the other cartoons
Talking about green screen, the CGI of this film really good, we can see that they tried an did it.The humor is good for 7years old kid, but if you are more than ten, is horrible.I give a four to this film.",Space Jam - A New Legacy

1536,ego-lay_atman-bay,Much better than what the reviews say.,8,8 September 2021,"I love this movie, despite what the reviews say, it's awesome.I see people complaining about how bad this movie is, just because they changed a lot, but what if they didn't? People would still say it's bad.Whenever I watch new movies, I don't read any reviews before watching it. That helps me see how great a movie it is. I enjoyed watching it. I loved a lot, and I'm not a sports fan. I love a good movie.One of the reasons why I love this movie is because I can relate a little. The kid loves video games, he loves making video games. (has an amazing setup that I'm kind of envying), but his dad wants him to play basketball. I, on the other hand, love playing video games, I have fun programming, but my mom wants me to do ""useful stuff"" in my life. My mom tries to get me off my computer, but just like lebron, she doesn't see that I'm really passionate about what I do. Just let people be themselves. Let them do what they want to do.Ok, now onto different stuff.Some people have said that this movie is bad because they just turned it into video games, but they're wrong. Get with the times, old people. Video games and the internet are what brings people together (and apart). Plus, making it a video game adds more possibilities. Powerups, stupid scoring system, special moves, so what? That just makes the game more fun.Adding unnecessary cameos? Sure, as long as it's for the laughs.I know I have more to say, but I just don't know how to say it. So, that's my review, and it's only 8/10 because there are some flaws.",Space Jam - A New Legacy

Although I personally don't mind Lebron James in this movie, there's just so many good things about it! The soundtrack, the exciting scenes, the epic moments, and I'm also surprised to see some emotional parts in this movie, such as the halftime scene and Lebron reuniting with his son. However, I have one complaint. Marvin the Martian getting a minor role in this movie was something I wasn't too happy about. Seriously, would it kill the director if we, oh I don't know, PUT HIM ON THE TUNE SQUAD?? Aside from that, the movie was really amazing. The ending where Bugs Bunny was dying was really sad and actually made me cry when I watched this in theaters. Who ever thought that a looney tunes movie would have such an emotional and tearjerking ending? I seriously cannot watch the death scene without crying...
Overall, I give this movie a 20/10 and 1 million stars. And for the toons, thank you for being apart of my life.",Space Jam - A New Legacy

Since it is under the (Space Jam) line of movies, I will compare it to the original. The original if its on TV, I will watch and remember the memorable moments and funny lines from 1996. This movie Space Jam a new Legacy, I hopefully will never have to watch again, if its on TV I will make sure to skip the channel fast. You seriously could not pay me to watch this again.Saw reviews talking about LeBron's acting, and boy was it bad.In conclusion this was a money grab that was rushed together. There is no creativity, its not funny, the animation hurt my eyes and the acting was probably the worst ive ever seen in a movie. The studio will make a lot of money off a rushed movie, and you would have thought they would try to make a movie better than the original but this seemed like it was made to be worse. I wouldn't recommend this to families, adults, kids or athletes. Yikes.",Space Jam - A New Legacy

This movie brings everything that the first one did, except only in a new coat tailored for todays trends and kids, so they can adapt it and assimilate easier and fall in love with the world of Space Jam AND the forgotten Looney Tunes. Just like we did in the 90s.The Looney Tunes are really funny. LeBron does a pretty decent job playing along with other good actors. The graphics are mind blowing and the action is continuous, so the film doesn't feel like 2 hours. The Warner world also adds a great nostalgic feeling to the previous generations growing up watching those characters.This movie is supposed to be entertaining and IT IS! Don't expect a complex storyline from a comeback movie, which has to resemble to its original, which also did not have a deep and complicated story.

1543,wagrram,"It's so bad, it makes the great Don Cheadle look bad.",2,17 July 2021,"You have to respect Kobe Bryant for forging his own path with the Oscar-winning ""Dear Basketball"". I'm sure he must have gotten offers to star in a sequel to ""Space Jam"", and he probably would have done a better job of it than Jordan, but the man had pride. I can't say the same about LeBron after seeing this movie.No one saying the original was better is implying that Jordan could act. I am a fan of Jordan's game, but let's be real, acting wasn't his gift, to put it mildly. The difference was the writers were smart enough to play around it. However, seeing LeBron trying to act is cringeworthy in the purest sense of the word. It's actually stunning to see such a horrendous performance (if you can call it that) from someone who must have had the most expensive acting coaches money can buy.Probably that's why the filmmakers made the decision to have LeBron animated for a good portion of the film, a decision plagued by another confusing issue: the animated character is decidedly lighter-skinned than the real LeBron. I'm opposed to the whole woke culture, but this really seemed bizarre to me.In short, the sequel is not only unfunny and boring, it's also obnoxious and fatiguing. There are tons of gags piled one over the other, but damn near all of them fall flat and they do become tiring. Not to mention the final showdown, the actuall basketball game, is at least 30 minutes long.I would actually encourage everyone to see it. Rarely, if ever, have I chosen to willingly see something this bad. It's an unforgettable experience. My wife concurs.",Space Jam - A New Legacy

The man simply cannot act in any sense of the word unless he's on the court trying to draw a foul.

Lebron's mouth in front of the camera and tweets behind his iPhone have really made the guy unbearable to watch or listen too. He's a fraud. Hollywood is too, so I can see why WB thought this would be a good match. Americans are tired of self-entitled, pompous, arrogant blow-hards that appear to hate their audience.

1603,NathanBlakely,Not as bad as everyone is saying,6,17 July 2021,"Behold, the haters have arrived.It seems everyone reviewing this movie on here has either forgotten that this is a KIDS movie or just wants to hate on LeBron James. What did you expect going into this?Yes, lots of kids movies nowadays (especially PIXAR) do a good job of catering to adults as well. This is not one of those movies, though the average NBA fan will probably at least enjoy the easter eggs. It's cheesy, corny, and silly. Going in expecting this, I was pleasantly surprised. It's a fun, brainless movie. If you expect to see an Oscar-winning movie, you're in the wrong place.No, LeBron is not a good actor. But I actually thought they did a good job maneuvering around it. I know how hard it is dealing with an actor who is not good at acting, and trust me, this could have been A LOT worse.The animation and art direction in this movie was actually pretty good too. Toward the beginning, the 2D animation is really interesting and visually pleasing. Towards the end when they actually play the game, it kinda just becomes a CGI smorgasbord, as one would probably expect going into this movie.The ending is cute, and it's a nice message for kids. If you're not a kid or a basketball fan, this movie probably won't appeal to you.I'm summary, I don't think this movie is a true 1/10 like a lot of people are saying. No, it's not an amazing movie. The plot is only average. But it's really visually pleasing and did have a few good jokes and certainly lots of kids will get a kick out of it.",Space Jam - A New Legacy

Growing up I didn't know anyone that didn't like Space Jam, but even the original got mixed reviews to start with, then it became a classic. What I'm trying to say is reviews are not always right.Have your own opinion.Kids today will love this film, in years to come it could become a classic for them.People need to stop hating on this film and enjoy it for what it is, a great kids film. If you don't like or grown out of kids films, don't hate, just don't watch it!I don't want to add any spoilers but I personally loved all the moments of nostalgia I got from this film.My point is, if you like the original don't be put off by the reviews for this, give it a try.That's all folks!",Space Jam - A New Legacy

A studio that has no idea what it's doing in any genre they produce.This movie is centered around a terrible ""actor"" in Lebron James and that terrible acting stands out when his entire supporting cast acts circles around him. I've seen better acting from this guy on the court during one of his flops.As for the actual premise... well it doesn't make sense either. At least in the original, the tunes had a reason to be involved in this movie. This time, they were just thrown in there for nostalgic purposes catering to the fans of the original. I honestly found myself dying to do chores around the house, than watch this movie. If I wasn't a father with kids at home and didn't have HBOmax, I probably would've never seen this movie.

Respect to Lebron performance, man he is not an actor and imagine that he made all those scenes with a green screen imagining all the Looney Tunes characters, that's not easy. The only critic I have is that writers could have made a different script and including more of WBross HBO Universe, it was fun to see all the movies and series references but maybe including a participation of iconic characters would've cool to see.

Someone posted about how is it believable that he has to win a basketball game to get his son back. HOW IS THE FIRST MOVIE BELIEVABLE IN ANY WAY?

I really want Road Runner to have more screen time, because he is my fav character. And also we dont see many speedy gonzales act here.The relation of dad and son is a bit awkward, but you get their points.

Maybe LeBron never actually watched this movie I mean his friends had to of told him that his acting was really bad but I guess the studio didn't care it's just a sad moment for the legacy of them space jam franchise hopefully they can recover in the future but if I were you I would watch it just so you can understand all the bad things people are saying.

Yes it did use a TON of cameos to capture the audiences' attention from different interest groups (DC, Rick and Morty, etc), but it was entertaining enough for the younger tech generation that understands IT stuff, algorithms, and gamer generation rather than just basketball. As for Lebron James, I thought he did fine if you look at it as him as a basketball player rather than an actor aiming for an Oscar.

Its basically a 2 hour long advertisement for Warner Brothers Studios. It epitomizes everything that is wrong with Hollywood today. Quick buck knowing parents will take their kids to see it. So there's not even an effort into making the story good.This doesn't need to be a franchise. Shouldve kept it with Michael Jordan and that's it. Even Kobe Bryant knew that.

1649,kvsabhinavadithya,I know a 6/10 is extremely generous but hear me out...,6,20 July 2021,"Space Jam 2 is not awful considering its primary audience is kids. Now this doesn't mean that we must encourage movies such as this. But, there seems to be too much hate for this movie as some people are trying to analyze it as a serious film. It's not. The plot seems more adapted to modern day and frankly has more weight than the original Space Jam. Although it feels like a long WB advert/SNL most of the time, it still stays true to the over the top wackiness of the original. For a Space Jam film, this is extremely creative in many areas. Especially when Bron enters the 2D Looney world. Some of the best parts of the film happen there. There are some genuine comedic moments here and there whilst also having an important message about doing what you want. In short, parts of it make more sense than the original Space Jam believe it or not.Could the movie have been better even for a kids film? Yes. Was the length of the film too long? Yes. A massive chunk of the basketball game could've been trimmed out by the editors. Nearly 20-30 mins can be trimmed out. Was there too many WB references? Yes. Almost gets repetitive at a point. But the whole concept of Space Jam was one corporate crown jewel by studio execs to make more money. Will your kids like it? Tbf if they can get beyond the first 20 mins of drama in the film, they will have an amazing time.Both the Space Jam films are not good by any means. The first Space Jam had more charm and better jokes. The second Space Jam captures more heart and has better CGI. New Legacy falls flat on the jokes. Older Looney Tunes fans will miss classic Looney humour. And Le Bron has too much screentime taking away the opportunity for the Tunes to truly shine. Despite all that it's still entertaining in some parts.An entertaining mess nonetheless. It's a Space Jam film with a slightly better plot. Feels like a film which should've come out 8 years ago. There is a much better story hidden somewhere in the film which felt unexplored. But it's not a 1/10 by any means considering it's a Space Jam film. We don't look at movie logic or WB property adverts. Nor do we look at a basketball superstar's poor acting. We look at the jokes and charm of our beloved Looney Tunes characters. Space Jam 2 falls a little short here compared to the original. That being said, WB YOU SHOULD REALLY MAKE A LOONEY TUNES BACK IN ACTION SEQUEL INSTEAD OF DIVERTING THE ATTENTION FROM THE MAIN CHARACTERS IN THEIR OWN FILM!!!!!!Final verdict of the film: Less Looney, less charm, That's all folks?!",Space Jam - A New Legacy
1650,densyl93,Not good at all,1,16 July 2021,"You would think that in times like ours this movie would be more diverse. The original was WAY more diverse in a time when it didn't need to be.

1651,zildjianelite,Ignore the hate,10,8 August 2021,"I very rarely write movie reviews because I feel that everyone should approach each film with a clean slate and open mind. What entertains some might not entertain others. And don't get me started on ""critics"" whose opinions I rarely agree with.However I felt compelled to help counter these downright hateful and biased reviews for Space Jam: A New Legacy. I had a ton of nostalgia and remember loving the original as a kid. When I go back to watch it as an adult it mediocre at best and not good acting. I had my children watch with me to get them excited for the new one and they hated it so much they couldn't sit through half of it.However they have watched A New Legacy at least ten times and I'm sitting here as it plays on the TV yet again. It's targeted for kids and it definitely succeeds in that way!Some great things about the movie:
All of the WB references and cameos that the whole family will love. Harry Potter, DC Heroes, Scooby-Doo, Lord of the Rings, Austin Powers, even Pennywise just to name a few.Family theme. The storyline highlights that everyone has different interests and talents and they should be celebrated. Even if they are different than what you want for them. This is a good lesson for parents. In the beginning LeBron is trying to force basketball on his son, but realizes that there's more to life than basketball in the end.Modernized story. Instead of villains who possess players in their sleep, this story chooses a plot that appeals to today's youth. Technology and video games gone wrong.Looney Tunes. The Toons are so well animated and so funny! Their shenanigans are just as good as the first movie, arguably even better. Lola is a strong and fearless female. Bugs is great. Granny is hilarious. Wile E Coyote and Roadrunner are still going at it. Every Looney Tunes character is in their element and adds great comedy and entertainment to the film.Comedy. Even if LeBron is not a trained and award winning actor, he does a fine job of delivering those comedic moments. There were a few times I giggled, and several times my kids always laugh out loud.Minority cast. All of the main characters in this film are black and that is something to be celebrated. Representation matters.Feel good ending. Who doesn't like a good happy ending? There are lessons to be learned about family, priorities, empathy, and individuality. I can get behind all of that.Overall this is not a 10 star film. More like 6-7 perhaps, as others have said. But I definitely can see that, as anticipated, LeBron's haters jumped on the opportunity to attack him via this film's reviews. Even that is hard to understand, since in real life he is a stand up guy, a family man, a good father, a faithful husband, and is doing countless acts of charity for his community. I don't watch basketball, ever. But stats are stats, he's one of the GOAT. I feel bad for the people who took time out of their day to trash talk a KIDS movie because of their own biases.To those of you trying to decide if you want to watch this film, I say ignore the haters, give it a chance and an open mind, and make your own judgements. If you are expecting an exact remake of the original, it's not that. It is modernized and adapted for current times. Give fun a chance, you might actually enjoy it!",Space Jam - A New Legacy
1652,mustangdreamin,LeBron selling LeBron,1,21 July 2021,The first 20 minutes of this film talk about how amazing Lebron is and the remainder is terrible acting by him. There's a scene where he needs to be emotional and I'm embarrassed for him and his acting. One of the worst heartfelt moments I've ever watched. I expected more from Warner Bros and was very disappointed. Don't waste your money unless you really care about how Lebron thinks he is.,Space Jam - A New Legacy

The first 25 minutes we get a ton of majestic views of LeBron's house and hear him go on and on about how hard he worked to get to where he is. It's not done with any substance or charm. It's just shoved down our throats for the sole purpose of exalting LeBron James.

I had a great time! I also gotta say the this movie is visually beautiful, the effects were amazing the looney tune look beautiful with the 3D animation style. It's not the best movie ever, it's not amazing an incredible but it was joyful it was fun! I had a lot of fun and to me, that makes for a good movie. There are movies that are meant to put a lot of focus on, movies that are well Oscar worthy, attention to the story but this isn't one of those films, this is a film where you can just sit back grab your snacks, lay back forget about all the crisis in this world and have a great time!",Space Jam - A New Legacy

1696,Impartialcritic,go kick dirt lebron haters,10,17 July 2021,"This movie was highly enjoyable and a fun watch for committed basketball fans who have followed LeBron's career and appreciated his greatness overall. That being said it is a goofy kids movie and definitely hits on that front. A lot of the references may go over the average viewers head, but overall it is an enjoyable and goofy experience certainly surpassing the original. LeBron does start the film off with some terrible acting instances including several late reactions and unnatural deliveries, but as a amateur who's had very limited experience aside from on court antics as some may say it's endearing and he does pull it together after spending much of the movie as a cartoon. Overall I'd give this movie a 6 or 7 out of 10, but I had to inflate my rating of it with all the butthurt conservatives, jordan/kobe stans, and just outright haters attempting to derail the film prior to even watching it with just 1 star reviews.

Also the animated was terribly bad since which is funny since first movie was miles better than this film even tho it was made back in the 1990s. The jokes make seems funny to a toddler, but to the targets audience it's was just not funny at all and the way story is set up is terribly awful.

It was actually quite funny and probably enjoyable for children. The movie was good. I could watch it all the way through without stopping it and saying, ""Wow this is horrible.""

1709,tchiura,I'm a diehard Jordan fanatic but this movie won me over!,10,18 July 2021,"Screenplay is phenomenal and the plot has an appropriate depth for a kid's movie. Only negatives I can think of; LeBron isn't lead actor material (maybe just yet). Director seemed to overlook this while shooting the family-centered scenes. Where LeBron really excelled was bouncing his dialogues off seasoned veterans like Don Cheadle and Bugs. We've seen from the film ""Trainwreck"" LeBron is already a much better actor than Michael Jordan. Editing team could've done a better job on that small matter. If I'm being super picky maybe we deserved a game winning block since that's LeBron's signature play. Outside that I had a really pleasant time watching this movie. The CGI and music combination can only be described as euphoric. Movie embraced its corniness and dry humor. Even got a chuckle out of me with the expected Michael B. Jordan cameo. Eernie Johnson and Lil Rel ""basketball commentary"" was undoubtedly the movie's unsung hero. Daffy Duck referring to Al G Rhythm (Don Cheadle) as a ""son of a glitch"" is probably my favorite line. Innuendo jokes about LeBron's super team building skills are more endearing than you would expect. Goon squad characters even brought their own fun and uniqueness for each member (in particular Chronos/Dame was an epic character) unlike the original Space Jam Monster squad. The film's digital conscious theme is so appropriate for a 2021 release. You've got Porky Pig rapping, Tweety Bird dunking, Granny out-dueling father time and LeBron James being trolled by Bugs Bunny, what more could you ask for? Ending is logical and leaves you feeling warm, what more can you ask for? In conclusion, ""Space Jam: A New Legacy"" is a vibe.",Space Jam - A New Legacy

I could even go back and watch it today and it isn't terrible.This movie is almost unwatchable. From about 10 mins in I felt like turning it off but I powered through it for my kids sake hoping maybe they saw something in the remake that I didn't. After they movie they agreed it was horrible...It wasn't even worth the free view on HBOMAX. I feel really bad for people who spent money watching this in a theater. The storyline was bad. The acting was bad. You had no connection with any of the characters.

Of COURSE it's unrealistic. Does this movie match its predecessor? In tone, yes. In story beats, yes. In special effects, A New Legacy WAY outclasses the original.LeBron obviously had some big shoes to fill. LeBron is not an actor, and he knows it, and it shows. However, neither was Michael Jordan. I feel like nostalgia speaks for a lot of people who think Michael was a better actor than LeBron. They are equally bad, but considering the circumstances they both had to act under - alongside imaginary, animated characters - they didn't do a terrible job, either. Honestly, LeBron's acting was better alongside the Looney Tunes than with his fictional family.Does it mean it was a great movie? No. It was a 2-hour ode to Warner Bros. Studios and its many properties. It was a cookie-cutter plot taken straight from the original. But the movie did enough different to make it its own, and kept it relevant to the time it exists in. Space Jam: A New Legacy may not be for those seeking a ""realistic premise,"" but it's fun enough that it holds its own and makes for a wild ride.",Space Jam - A New Legacy

Don't get me wrong, growing up in the 90s I loved the original, and this movie not only makes it's own stance but brings accolades to its predecessor. This is not a reboot and does not pretend to b, but draws on the original and builds upon it. I see a lot of people criticizing this for not having heart like the original, however, rewatching the original and comparing to the sequel, I would argue this had a lot more heart to it.The original, was so focused on how great Michael Jordan thought he was, that he was the only one that could save the day. On this movie, it was not only about saving LeBron's family but also about being who you are and pursuing what you love.There were a lot of great throw backs and references to the first, not negating the first movie. But there were also a lot of great references to the WB universe as a whole. Anyone who enjoyed Ready Player One could relate to all of the Easter Eggs and could see past the anger for the sequel.I get that not everyone is a fan of LeBron like they were of Jordan, however, unlike the first movie, I didn't feel like this was a LeBron fan movie, like the first was a Jordan fan movie. This movie had a lot of heart and I enjoyed watching this with my son.",Space Jam - A New Legacy

Obviously LeBron is not a professional actor, although the performance he delivers still feels authentic and true to him self (based on what I have seen of him on the court in real life). I personally am a fan of the NBA and loved seeing some of my favourite players in a high budget film. Furthermore, there were countless scenes that I found very amusing and I even enjoyed the seemingly endless amount of Warner Bros pop culture references.

Now I'm in my 30s and when I heard a sequel was coming with Lebron James I was actually excited to watch it. But this movie is just a stinking pile of trash all it is is the Warner Brothers just showing all the good things they have done in the past and trying to say they are still relevant in the wake of Disney plus. I'm sorry but they are done and this movie proved that weak acting and poor writing ruined what could have been a good movie.,Space Jam - A New Legacy

But the movie was fun and it was cool to see all the DC and WB characters. The cartoon LeBron tattoos were kind of weird but the actual basketball game with all the animation is next level.

The acting is terrible and has zero nostalgia to the first movie. I absolutely hated this movie from beginning to end. Please boycott this movie it has nothing to offer to anyone. What a waste of time. Kid friendly? Sorry Rick and Morty and Pennywise the clown from it? Show your 5 year old kid It 1 and 2 and expect them to sleep for the next 10 years. What a joke.

1754,awhollon,Take it easy guys!!!,6,17 July 2021,"Look...this isn't the best kids movie of all time, but it most certainly is not the worst! I am a 90s kid and 100% grew up on and LOVED the original. But honestly, I don't know anyone my age who didn't. We literally used to watch this in school! Please remember this was back in the day when movies (especially kids movies) were not so readily available and at our fingertips. And of course anything that included Michael Jordan at this time was an absolute home run (unlike his baseball career). See what I did there....I feel like there are more Lebron James haters than there are Space Jam 2 reviewers.Keep in mind, this is coming from a now, mid-thirties, Space Jam 1 enthusiast, but I really did enjoy this. Maybe it is because I was with my 6 year old daughter, who I constantly observed laughing and smiling from ear to ear while chomping on gummy bears, but I personally felt very entertained the whole time. The filmmakers really did a great job stuffing in ""adult jokes"" and throwbacks to the original. Not to mention the bright yellow suited 'Mask' character....what a fun treat.In summary, is it as good as Space Jam from 1996?? This ""old man"" says no. But is it worth checking out?

1761,teacherjasonhershey,Let's be honest about the movie 🍿🎥,7,16 July 2021,"Let's start with the elephant in the room. Most adults want this to reflect the original Space Jam and are comparing the new one to that. That's why most reviews say something to the respect of ""Not as good as the original"" or ""Lebron is trash and not a role model"". (Liking his basketball game is one thing, but there's a whole city of kids that will beg to differ on the second) When You do that, you're already preparing yourself to be disappointed. Take all reviews with a grain of salt and realize the hidden bias that is naturally engrained.I was fortune enough to catch a sneak peek courtesy of the I-Promise School and Warner Brothers. I gave it a 7/10 and I'll tell you why without getting drug down into the weeds with this review. The movie starts off slower than I would of liked, but it's important in setting the tone of the movie. Let's be honest though, who remembers the first part of the original Space Jam, it's all about the basketball game. This movie does not disappoint. The graphics are better, the game is entertaining and if you watch and judge this movie on its own merit, it's entertaining for adults and kids.Lebron isn't the best actor, and some of the early part seems stretched and forced, but the kids are charismatic and in the end, it's a story about family and dreams.Try not to compare this to the original film because nostalgia has a way if distorting your perception.",Space Jam - A New Legacy
1762,kaden-56913,It's better for every reason that is not Lebron,3,16 July 2021,"Lebron James cannot act at all, any scene he is in he overacts or he does not believe what he is saying enough, youtube actors are more believable than him. There isn't much else bad about this movie other than the name of their little Warnerverse being called a serververse, Warnerverse is a better name. The advertisements are barely even noticeable, but the way they talk about Warner brothers and the way it is a Warner brothers movie is just discomforting. The movie is unrealistic in the way that their bodies disappear when they go into a virtual world, and they are just sucked in through their simple phones camera. Other than those things the movie is mostly fine, a little cheesy in some parts but what movie isn't.",Space Jam - A New Legacy

This is offensive beyond recognition. Another unnecessary sequel to a beloved classic masquerading as an obvious hollywood cash grab. Do yourself a favor and stay far from this ""film""",Space Jam - A New Legacy
1783,vivianasonnier,I didn't wait 25 years for this...,1,17 July 2021,"I loved the original Space Jam, it's not the greatest movie ever, but people of all ages can enjoy it, I loved the silly storyline, and it wasn't solely focused on Michael Jordan. For years after watching the original movie, I was hopefully they would make another sequel maybe with the next NBA superstar of our time.In the original we got to know Michael's family and friends. Michael was portrayed as a happy, humble and as a true family man. Lebron, although realistically, was not humble, not friendly, not happy, and not much of a family man despite the movie being about his son.In real life, Lebron James is the most unlikeable and egotistical basketball player of this generation. Unlike Michael Jordan who was genuine, charismatic, humble, and didn't let fame get to his head, the same can't be said about Lebron. Please don't waste your time watching this movie, the story line is ridiculously cheesy, Lebron gets his son kid kidnapped by the villain who comes from a different dimension, Lebron gets lost in the matrix, ending up in the Looney Tunes universe where he has to team up with the toons to play a game against his own son to get him back.The movie is filled with lots of homage and movie references like many things these days because there's not much creativity in movies it seems or at least people who have creative ideas aren't hitting the mainstream. The movie was boring. Lebron's acting was not very good, seemed like he hardly tried. The voice acting of the Looney Tunes characters were fine, but so much of their dialogue went to waste. Zendaya surpassed my expectations as Lola Bunny voice acting wise, it wasn't like the original or better but it sounded OK. All of the jokes I heard in the movie, in my opinion fell flat, there was no comedic timing whatsoever. The only good thing I could think about the movie was the good CGI and animation.I think this movie would have been better made if it was either made in the 2000s or even in the future with a different NBA player. Choosing Lebron was a mistake.",Space Jam - A New Legacy
1784,scottmunro-08789,Set Politics Aside,6,17 July 2021,"Look, I don't like what LeBron James has espoused politically or culturally. That being said, for the most part my son an I enjoyed this movie. I would have given this movie a higher rating if it weren't for the distracting background actors who just keep doing the same monotonous stuff over and over. The graphics were on point. LeBron was actually pretty good here (hard for me to give credit here). But, the background crowd doing the phony cheering (read: horrible acting) took me out of the movie. There is a ""Michael Jordan"" twist that hits its mark. Also, the father-son relationship was compelling. Don Cheadle nailed his part as the villian. I just wish the producers had paid attention to the little things. This is a first, in that, it got all of the big things right, but screwed the pooch on the little things. The background characters, a motley crue of WB characters, were terrible! So much so, that it was distracting. Same moves over and over, terrible ""just act like you're cheering and we'll cut you a check"" acting. This could have been a great movie had they paid attention to the little things. That being said, my son and I enjoyed it as a little ""boy time"" together. Also, and I can't stress this enough, Don Cheadle is a truly great actor. He is the best part of this movie!",Space Jam - A New Legacy
1785,jinobass,I love MJ over LeBron in NBA but SPJ2 is a Worthy Sequel,7,16 July 2021,"I love MJ ...no doubt He's da GOAT,and Kobe,LeBron is next in line along w/Kareem,Wilt,Majic,Shaq,Bird,and so on.But I have to be honest and give a unbiased review that makes sense,'cause I'm a movie lover.LeBron might not get nominated for a Oscar but he did a great job considering its his first blockbuster Movie. I'm sure he took acting lessons and put hard work and committed his time to make the movie and it shows.MJ had Spike Lee making Air Jordan Commercials and that probably helped MJ's early acting career leading him to SJ.But Lebron's script was more challenging, it contained a serious scenes, serious role.The writers needed little more work to make the plot work.Most importantly I felt the heart of the movie was there and that's what I look for and it was definately there.Animation,2D,3D,SP. FX flawless.It was entertaining regardless what other's are saying, and I Loved the first SJ w/MJ but I don't wanna compare them, it's a totally different Movie.It really doesn't make sense doing that ....
we all have our opinions and that's what makes us unique right?I always watch the movie by myself first, make sure it's worthy...then watch it again with my kids.I'll do that tomorrow.So don't let some review/opinon ruin your movie, see it for yourself,
it's Bugs and da looney Toons w/bunch of Humor!And Don is always brilliant! Enjoy.",Space Jam - A New Legacy
1786,sylvainnc-09450,I wish I could give it a 0,1,17 July 2021,Lebron cannot act in a movie. He is better at flopping on a basket ball court.,Space Jam - A New Legacy
1787,joshuavandenbroek,It was great,8,15 July 2021,Great movie. Lebron did alright for a athlete and also ignore some of the 1/10 reviews cause most of them are Lebron haters and you can clearly notice it.,Space Jam - A New Legacy
1788,tysonbednar,Embarrassing,1,24 July 2021,"I went into this movie with low expectations but it was even worse than I imagined. Terrible acting all around, including from Don Cheadle which I think says more about the writing and set vibe than him as he's usually good. I'm sure it was hard to act across from someone as flat as Lebron, who throughout looks and sounds like he doesn't want to be there. Michael Jordan was no Juaquine Pheonix but you at least got the sense he was having fun like a dad in a home movie. Lebron's ""Looney Tunes"" scream as he falls down a cliff is pathetic. If I was the director I would've wanted to ADR Lebron with a sound alike, or perhaps get an actor to play his role and deepfake Lebron's face onto him. No matter how bad this would look it would be a more human feeling character. After seeing Kevin Garnett in Uncut Gems ""he's an athlete"" isn't good enough to excuse a bad performance anymore. Story is absolutely nonsensical - and I mean nonsensical, not fantastical. I understand this story deals with stuff that doesn't happen in real life but the progress of that story is so all over the place it's barely even there. We don't even get any good slapstick from the Looney Tunes. Animation was stiff, with none of the kinetic flow and visual playfulness you get from the original shows. Colour and line work look like it was done in Flash. The voices are off but I think that would've been less annoying if the personalities were there. Constant references to other properties were shallow and eye-rolling. The ""Server Verse"" and enemy basketball players have the aesthetic of a phone game. Warner Bros. Character surrounding the basketball court was distracting as everyone looked like poor cosplay versions of themselves and the extras were clearly just told to move around and look busy constantly because the crowd doesn't react appropriately to what's happening in the game. Also, weird choice to have the gang from A Clockwork Orange in the background of a kids movie. I understand that ones ""for the parents"" but if you've seen that movie you know it's pretty jarring to be reminded of it while trying to enjoy Bugs Bunny.",Space Jam - A New Legacy
1789,isaacgolden,Great family film.,8,17 July 2021,"My family and I loved it, better then part one. Did not disappoint and animation was amazing.",Space Jam - A New Legacy
1790,austinstepsgleave-52053,"Big LeBron fan, not a fan of this Movie",2,19 July 2021,So many things showed up in this movie & just made ZERO sense. Matrix? Mad Max? LeBron being brought out as a bad parent? Terrible movie & I am sad because I was hoping it was a good one. We didn't even get into basketball until the last 40 minutes of the movie. The animation on cartoons.... I have seen better graphics in 2012 & it's 2021. All around an epic fail from what could have been a good movie. Upsetting because it should have been epic. Maybe they should have collaborated with Sony & Jumanji & figured some stuff out but it honestly seems like they just pushed this out knowing it was a terrible take but millions would watch.,Space Jam - A New Legacy
1791,cfse,Doomed since Casting!,1,17 July 2021,"So much potential, i loved SJ1 growing up, even this New Legacy I liked all the looney tones scenes, but OMG why why did Warner cast LeBron, he is horrible, this movie was doomed since the casting!! So sad.",Space Jam - A New Legacy
1792,ryanchrisey,Save your time,1,17 July 2021,"They shouldn't have even labeled this movie space jam, it takes away from the original movie, the mixed cgi and lack of a story line made this probably one of the worst movies I've seen all year, lebron acts better when he flops, on the movie screen he's a robot.",Space Jam - A New Legacy
1793,talentedcomedian,Absolutely one of the worst movies I've seen in a while,1,17 July 2021,"Please, for the sake of your time and sanity, don't watch this movie.",Space Jam - A New Legacy
1794,giulianomorgan,You ruined a perfect movie from my childhood,1,25 July 2021,"Screenwriters. Please do note that they need to be recruited, hired an well paid. If the screenplay turns out as a piece of human excrement please discard it and do not lose the viewers time. Producers, please, please, oh please, never work in the movie industry again.",Space Jam - A New Legacy
1795,jonathanmtn,Not worth the tickets!,2,19 July 2021,"My two sons, both under ten years old, watched this with me in the theater. Halfway in, my nine-year-old asked if he could use my phone to play video games and my six-year-old fell asleep. This is absolutely the worst remake I've ever seen. Please don't waste your time.",Space Jam - A New Legacy
