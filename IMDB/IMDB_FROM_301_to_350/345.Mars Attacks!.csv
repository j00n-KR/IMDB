0,MartinHafer,A pleasant little time-passer,7,31 January 2008,"This film is a homage to sci-fi movies of the 1950s and 60s--even down to the design of the aliens who were taken from the obscure ""Mars Attacks"" kids trading cards from the 60s. At a gentle send up of the genre, you see many of the expected clichés and dialog--there are not major surprises here.I heard a lot of very negative comments about this film when it came out and perhaps that is why I was pleasantly surprised to find that it wasn't bad at all and nearly earned a 7 from me. Despite negative hype, the film is far from dull and quite fun. Sure, there's not a huge amount of depth to it and it won't change your life--but so what!? Some times it's okay just to watch a silly film like this and enjoy it on a superficial level. The only serious negative about the film is that the plot, in part, was actually stolen from ATTACK OF THE KILLER TOMATOES if you can believe it (who in their right mind would want to pilfer plot elements from THAT film?!?). The whole Slim Whitman angle is a knock off of the Donny Desmond ending and I can't believe they just lifted the ending from one film and slapped it on MARS ATTACKS!. That's why I ultimately chose to give the film a 6.",Mars Attacks!
1,TheLittleSongbird,"Love it or hate it, I liked it, and consider it Burton's most underrated",8,4 October 2010,"While he has been hit and miss recently, I like Tim Burton. Mars Attacks! is not his best(Edward Scissorhands), but far from his worst(Planet of the Apes)- in fact Mars Attacks! gets my vote as Burton's most underrated film. Mars Attacks! is a film you love or hate really, but I like it and consider it underrated and somewhat as a guilty pleasure.The film does have a slow start and it does take a little too long before the fun starts. What I loved about Mars Attacks! though was its smartness, fun and in some ways uniqueness. It does make the most of a bubble-gum card story, and works brilliantly as a biting satire, and is further advantaged by some excellent visuals not only in the computer-generated bug-eyed Martians but in the photography, make-up and sets, wonderfully clever sci-fi references, a smart script and a quirky score from Danny Elfman. Tim Burton's direction is also great, and the acting is all fun. While Jack Nicholson, Glenn Close, Danny DeVito, Martin Short, Pam Grier and Annette Bening are a lot of fun, the best performances come from Pierce Brosnan who is hilarious as a presidential adviser and Lisa Marie who is weird yet wonderfully creepy and seductive as the disguised alien temptress. Overall, I really enjoyed this film. It is not Burton's best, but it is better than most of the stuff he's churned out this past decade-Big Fish and Sweeney Todd are the only ones so far that had the charm and uniqueness that made me love Scissorhands, Ed Wood, Batman and Vincent so much. 8/10 Bethany Cox",Mars Attacks!
2,bkoganbing,Everyone gets to strut their stuff,5,25 July 2018,"Mars Attacks is not a great film. It's all right, but sad to say some of the comedy
doesn't quite come off. But this is one of those films where if you were lucky
enough to get cast in it you got the opportunityto give out with some shtick or
overact outrageously. Jack Nicholson got to do it twice as he was cast in two
different roles, as president of the United States and as a Las Vegas operator.Nicholson is served better presidentially. Can you imagine Jack Nicholson in that
familiar nasal twang trying to reassure the nation even after the aliens have
blown up Congress. It's what people remember best from the film.Pierce Brosnan is cast as the ever calm scientist who knows his field will provide the answers. All that's left of him is sheer intellect.My favorite is Martin Short who gets a Martian through White House security.
He's Nicholson's press secretary and he sneaks a disguised Martian past White
House security. Poor Short thinks he's getting a little something something
and is he ever surprised.I also Paul Winfield who is modeled on General Colin Powell as the emissary
President Nicholson sends to greet the Martians on the Nevada desert where
they've landed. He's got a nice running rivalry with Rod Steiger who is a general along the lines of Buck Turgidson from Dr. Strangelove.The whole component doesn't quite gel. But lots of funny bits should keep the
viewer interested.Can you imagine the current president trying to reassure the public after an
alien invasion. Not non-Americans, real aliens.",Mars Attacks!
3,Leofwine_draca,Refreshingly mean-spirited,7,25 August 2016,"Tim Burton's sci-fi spoof was a massive flop on first release; this was because audiences were expecting a straight science fiction film, when what they got in fact was a comedy. People either love or hate this film, there is no in between, and thankfully I'm in the former camp in this case. As a comedy, Burton's film is wonderful. A star-studded cast of famous faces send themselves up shamelessly, all of those tacky alien invasion pictures of the 1950s are referenced and paid homage too, and on top of all this, we have loads of excellent CGI effects to contend with. The comic book feel of the film comes from the rich, bright colours, everything looks fake and tacky, and it's meant to.Along the way we get take-offs of WAR OF THE WORLDS, EARTH VERSUS THE FLYING SAUCERS, and INDEPENDENCE DAY. The Martians themselves are a delightfully mischievous little bunch who enjoy mass destruction and sadism. Comedy highlights include a scene where one such Martian runs through the burning streets with a tape playing ""Do not run. We are your friends!""! The bulging brain and eyeballs of these creatures make them very distinctive and difficult to forget, and as a bonus they're excellently animated too. The UFOs are also wonderful.As with any comedy, things are hit and miss, but as a whole this film is a success. It's difficult to believe the ensemble cast assembled here. Jack Nicholson overacts in not one but two roles as the president and an entrepreneur. Glenn Close appears briefly as his wife before being crushed by a falling chandelier. Annette Bening is an annoying New Ager who sadly doesn't get incinerated by the aliens. Pierce Brosnan plays a clichéd British scientist who ends up minus his body in one of the film's many odd and unique moments. Sarah Jessica Parker is the braindead chat show host who gets her head attached to the body of her dog. Danny DeVito is an obsessive gambler who fails to impress an alien enemy and gets fried. Michael J. Fox loses his hand. Martin Short mistakes an alien in disguise for his newest girlfriend and has his finger chewed off for his troubles. Rod Steiger goes way, way over the top as an antagonistic general (""Annihilate! Destroy! Kill! Kill!) and gets shrunken and then stepped upon. Lukas Haas (all grown up from WITNESS) is a dumb teenage hero. Natalie Portman is the president's daughter. Tom Jones cameos as himself. Jim Brown and Pam Grier come back from the '70s. The list goes on.Everybody sends themselves up and acts appallingly. They seem to be having a really good time and this feeling rubs off. Burton also doesn't skimp on the violence, revelling in burning cattle, destruction (the stone heads on Easter Island turned skittles is a good one), people being ray-gunned and turning into multicoloured skeletons, amputations, and various other gory highlights, all in the spirit of the original sadistic Topps trading cards of the '60s. Ever wished that dog in INDEPENDENCE DAY had bought it? Here's your chance to see a canine fry. As a satire, MARS ATTACKS! has a winning formula and should be seen by any good-natured science fiction addict.",Mars Attacks!
4,SnoopyStyle,fun invasion Burton style,8,6 February 2016,"The Martians are coming! President James Dale (Jack Nicholson) tries to peacefully greet the newcomers relying on Professor Donald Kessler (Pierce Brosnan)'s advise. The White House includes First Lady Marsha Dale (Glenn Close) and daughter Taffy (Natalie Portman), Press Secretary Jerry Ross (Martin Short), and General Decker (Rod Steiger). In Vegas, former boxer Byron Williams (Jim Brown), Barbara Land (Annette Bening), Danny DeVito, Tom Jones and others form a group. TV exec Jason Stone (Michael J. Fox) and his girlfriend TV personality Nathalie Lake (Sarah Jessica Parker) cover the initial meeting. It turns out that Richie Norris (Lukas Haas) and his grandma Florence hold the secret to fighting the Martians.Director Tim Burton brings a fun light-hearted style to the Alien Invasion genre. It's a sly spoof. Obviously, he's not going for the over-the-top spoof like Airplane!. He's hitting it in a light, fun and subversive way. It's a lot of wacky stuff going on. There are a couple of laughs but this isn't a series of comedic jokes. The great thing for me is the disturbing jokes the Martians like to play. This is a fun time with an often-used sci-fi story.",Mars Attacks!
5,claudio_carvalho,We Come in Peace!,9,28 August 2006,"When the USA satellites photograph many flying saucers coming to Earth, the American President James Dale has a meeting with his advisors. He is convinced by Professor Donald Kessler (Pierce Brosnan) that Martians would be a developed culture and therefore peaceful by nature, in spite of the warnings of General Decker (Rod Steiger). The authorities, some civilians and the press prepare a welcome committee for the aliens, but they realize that Mars is actually attacking Earth.""Mars Attack!"" is one of the most hilarious and entertaining movie of Tim Burton. Using a parody to the sci-fi of the 50's and like a shotgun, he criticizes the politicians and their greed to be popular; the arrogance and lack of humility of some intellectuals; the lack of sensibility of the army; the lack of ethics in the press; the shallow behavior of the first lady; and some silly cults. In the other side, he highlights the importance of friendship, loyalty and love. I particularly like very much the characters of Jack Nicholson, Pierce Brosnan and Rod Steiger in the cast that is actually a constellation. Unfortunately Jack Black dies in the very beginning, because his character was also very funny. This movie is one of my favorite cult-movies, and a great homage to Ed Wood (""Plan 9 from Outer Space""). My vote is nine.Title (Brazil): ""Marte Ataca!"" (""Mars Attacks!"")",Mars Attacks!
6,mark.waltz,Ra Ra Ra Ra Ra Ra.....,7,14 April 2014,"O.K., so there's no proper spelling probably for the comical ranting of the Martians here which after hearing makes American First Lady Glenn Close declare, ""Well, they are not eating off of the Van Buren China!"". An all-star cast of famous actors, from octogenarian Sylvia Sidney down to teenager Natalie Portman, fill out the roles of the humans fighting against the invading aliens, all from the mind of director Tim Burton who brings the classic comic strip to life.There's no time for boredom in this comical disaster movie spoof, and very little ""exposition"", one of the biggest complaints on recent films like ""2012"" where family drama had to take focus until disaster struck. There's no family with estrangements, no couple on the outs, just the fantasy of what might happen if the green aliens we have always wondered about decided to attack Earth and destroy humanity.Along side Close as the president is Jack Nicholson, trying to remain together, but horrified as the crisis grows. Nicholson also plays the seemingly sleazy Las Vegas hotel owner, with Annette Bening as his alcoholic wife who is thrilled by the potential of the Martian's arrival. The closest you get to family crisis is Washington D.C. bus driver Pam Grier's discovery that her teenaged kids are skipping school to play video games and husband Jim Brown's absence as he works in Las Vegas, as well as the Kansas trailer park family of sweet Lukas Haas who is shocked by the sudden taking of one of their own by the Martians.""They blew up congress!"", grandma Sylvia Sidney laughs, and don't count this old lady out. The star of classic movies like ""Dead End"" and ""Sabotage"" in the 1930's was making a name for herself 60 years later by nice roles in this and ""Beetlejuice"" for director Burton, and here, he gives her a great little part with lots of surprises in it. There's also Sara Jessica Parker, Danny DeVito, Martin Short, Pierce Brosnan and Michael J. Fox, as well as a cameo by Tom Jones who gets into the plot as himself. Lots of one-great liners, a fun combination of animation with live footage makes this a must, and one you may find yourself attacking again and again.",Mars Attacks!
7,gavin6942,"Does Not Hold Up Over Time, It Seems",6,4 June 2012,"The Earth is invaded by Martians with irresistible weapons and a cruel sense of humor.I first saw this film as a teenager in the movie theater, back in the 1990s. And I liked it, I found it to be another triumphant win for Tim Burton, one of his better films. And then I went fifteen years without seeing it...Watching it again, in 2012 as a man in my 30s, I was just not impressed. The animation seemed dated, the movie was not as funny as it could have or should have been. It was nice to see an early, thin Jack Black. But really, now, I have to say in retrospect that this might have been the film that started Burton's steady decline... because other than ""Big Fish"" and ""Sweeney Todd"", what has he done since that was worth my time? I know some people see this as a misunderstood film. And maybe it is. I understand the camp, the cheese, the 1950s throwback feeling. And I appreciate the inclusion of Tom Jones. But, I just cannot see this on par with Burton's earlier work. Roger Ebert says, ""A movie like this should be a lot better, or a lot worse."" And that is exactly my issue with it -- the movie is too good to be bad and too bad to be good.",Mars Attacks!
8,lee_eisenberg,Why didn't people like this?,8,9 August 2005,"When ""Mars Attacks!"" first came out, it was widely regarded as a failure. WHY?! Okay, so it was another movie about bug-eyed aliens invading earth. But the whole thing was so cool! More than an invasion movie, it casts a new look at our own world. The sardonic president (Jack Nicholson), his sarcastic wife (Glenn Close), the over-confident professor (Pierce Brosnan), an over-patriotic general (Rod Steiger), the goof-ball press secretary (Martin Short), the brainless reporter (Sarah Jessica Parker), her jealous husband (Michael J. Fox), a greedy developer (Jack Nicholson again), his new-age wife (Annette Bening), an obnoxious gambler (Danny DeVito), an ex-wrestler (Jim Brown), and Tom Jones all make for more than an experience. Of course, the real stars are the martians. With exposed brains and skull-like faces, they are real tricksters. Above all, ""Mars Attacks!"" was infinitely better than, say, ""Independence Day"". The latter was just an excuse to blow things up and glorify the military; the former was campy as only Tim Burton could do it.Oh, and another thing: who would have ever thought that the Amish boy from ""Witness"" would play grandson to the woman from Alfred Hitchcock's classic ""Sabotage""? I guess that Sylvia Sidney is the only person who's worked with both Hitchcock and Burton.",Mars Attacks!
9,jboothmillard,Mars Attacks!,9,9 March 2005,"Tim Burton (Beetlejuice, Batman, Edward Scissorhands, Sleepy Hollow, Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street) directs an all-star cast of actors to face a load of Martians attacking the earth. Jack Nicholson is President James Dale (and Art Land), who tries to make peace with the Martians, but after two attempts he decides that they are hostile. People in the White House are trying to help him, including Prof. Donald Kessler (Pierce Brosnan), General Decker (Rod Steiger) and Jerry Ross (Martin Short). Elsewhere, people are trying to survive, e.g. Byron Williams (Jim Brown) is trying to get back to Louise (Jackie Brown's Pam Grier) and her two boys. Also, the Martians are taking people and animals, they take Natalie Lake (Sarah Jessica Parker) and put her head in place of her dog's. Also starring Glenn Close as First Lady Marsha Dale, Annette Bening as Barbara Land, Danny DeVito as Rude Gambler, Michael J. Fox as Jason Stone, Lukas Haas as Richie Norris, Natalie Portman as Taffy Dale, Lisa Marie (Burton's fiancée at the time) as Martian Girl, Sylvia Sidney as Grandma Florence Norrie, Jack Black as Billy Glenn Norris, Joe Don Baker as Richie's Dad and Sir Tom Jones, who was number 87.

10,Woodyanders,The status quo gets its long-deserved brutal comeuppance,9,22 March 2010,"Tim Burton's blithely anarchic big budget sci-fi alien invasion treat serves as both a lovingly campy'n'cartoonish homage to 50's cheapo science fiction schlock and, more importantly, a sensationally savage no-holds-barred wholesale satirical trashing of the more negative aspects of Americn culture. Jonathan Gems' unsparingly caustic script takes ferocious potshots at a wealth of worthy targets: rampant greed (Las Vegas, that quintessentially all-American den of sin and vice, gets demolished by the Martians), smug politicians, hawkish military goons (Rod Steiger hits it out of the ballpark with his inspired portrayal of gung-ho General Decker, who desperately wants to nuke the alien invaders into oblivion), kooky religious fanatics, opportunistic media parasites, low-life white trash survivalists, nerdy scientific brainiacs, and even bleeding heart liberal pacifists (Paul Winfield delivers a wickedly spot-on caricature of Colin Powell as the benign General Casey, who naturally gets killed first). Moreover, there's a strange biblical moral purity at work: A majority of folks who get annihilated by the Martains are loathsome conformist creeps who deserve to die while the survivors are an engagingly loopy bunch of fringe oddballs (in other words, the meek inherit what's left of the Earth at the end of the picture).The all-star cast have a ball with their colorfully broad roles: Jack Nicholson joyfully goes to town on his dual parts as the smarmy President James Dale and sleazy Vegas hotelier Art Land (the casting of Wacky Jack in both roles suggests that scuzzy politicos and no-count businessmen are two sides of the same low-rent coin), plus there are lively and enjoyable contributions from Glenn Close as snooty first lady Marsha Dale, Annette Benning as dippy New Age space case Barbara Land, Pierce Brosnan as the pompous, pipe-smoking Professor Donald Kessler, Danny De Vito as a jerky lawyer, Sarah Jessica Parker as ditsy talk show host Nathalie Lake, Lukas Haas as likable working class schmoe Richie Norris, Sylvia Sidney as feisty, senile old bat Grandma Florence Norris, Natalie Portman as sweet first daughter Taffy Dale, Jim Brown as reformed ex-boxer Bryon Williams, Martin Short as slimy presidential secretary Jerry Ross, Michael J. Fox as shameless scoop-chasing reporter Jason Stone, Joe Don Baker as crude redneck Glenn Norris, and Jack Black as cowardly good ol' boy Billy Glenn. Burton offers plenty of splendidly subversive touches: two video game addict boys prove to be more adept at killing the aliens than the army, the Martians slaughter the elderly residents at an old folks home, Tom Jones as his own hip self gets to be one of the heroes (!), the president boldly quotes Rodney King's infamous ""Can't we all just get along"" speech when he meets the Martian leader face to face (and winds up being bumped off any way!), and Slim Whitman's high-pitched yodeling proves to be the aliens' Achilles heel. Lisa Marie has a memorably sexy bit as the otherworldly, yet enticing Martian girl. Danny Eldman provides a spirited theremin score. Paul Suschitzky's glitzy cinematography gives the movie an appropriately garish look. The CGI effects are perfectly tacky. Wonderfully nasty and twisted stuff.",Mars Attacks!
11,ccthemovieman-1,Outstanding Entertainment; Burton's Most Underrated Film,10,29 November 2006,"What a wild movie! I've begun to appreciate this more and more with multiple viewings. I think it's Tim Burton's most underrated film. Unlike many of his previous films, this seems pretty impartial when it comes to the satire: everyone gets it here, not just the usual Christians. Here, New Ange devotees and Liberal advisers and generals are also made to look stupid. This is probably one reason the national critics - who are overwhelming Left Wing - didn't like this movie. They weren't used to the same abuse some of us put up with all the time.Politics aside, this is one funny movie. It's a combination of science fiction, drama and comedy. It's a parody of the 1950s flying saucer films except it has 1990s color and good special-effects. Burton was a fan of those corny '50s sci-fi films so he made his own!The story quickly moves from one character to another, from the low-key President of the U.S. played by an unusually-reserved Jack Nicholson to the wacky New Ager Annette Benning to Martin Short with his goofy smile....well, there are so many characters here - most of them completely whacked - it's too many to mention. The diversity of these people and the subtle humor in which they are all presented is just as much fun to watch as the special-effects. The Martians are a real hoot. They have to be seen to be believed.I didn't like all the characters but, most people won't either. For me, showing elderly people as senile (Sylvia Sidney's role) is mean-spirited; Rod Steiger has the stereotypical war-mongering General is getting tiresome and the obvious politically-correct role for Jim Brown also went overboard. All in all, however, this is about as entertaining a film as I have ever found, nd one that gets more enjoyable with each viewing.....which is why I rate it so high.",Mars Attacks!
12,rmax304823,Slim Whitman Saves Planet.,3,15 November 2008,"A cast of thousands! This spoof of 1950s science fiction movies should have been a huge hit, what with its many allusions, in-jokes, and contemporary references -- not to mention that cast: Jack Nicholson (in two roles) through Sylvia Sidney and who knows who else? The Martians are short green creatures with huge heads and they come to earth in flying saucers, claiming ""We come in peace,"" then they mow everyone down with ray guns and blow up national monuments and destroy the world's governments.Big wigs like President Nicholson and the blustering general Rod Steiger perish in Washington, while in Las Vegas it is discovered that senile Sylvia Sidney's favorite music -- a parody of Slim Whitman's early 1950s hit, ""Indian Love Song,"" turns the invaders' monstrous brains to jelly. The planet is saved. A handful of heroic survivors are awarded medals in the ruins of Washington by Natalie Portman as the president's daughter while a mariachi band, the only musicians left alive, play the national anthem.The iconography of the alien ships and their exploits are directly derived from ""Earth Versus The Flying Saucers."" They perform variations of some of the same tricks, like knocking over the Washington Monument. But new tricks are added. They recarve the faces on Mount Rushmore and bestow Martian features on them.There are wise cracks aplenty. Danny DeVito approaches an alien and shouts, ""Wait a minute. I'm a lawyer. You want to conquer the earth, you need lawyers, right?"" As the president, Nicholson makes a tear-jerking speech to the Martians about joining forces in friendship. He winds up his pitch with, ""Why can't we all just get along,"" the most famous statement to emerge from the Rodney King business of the early 90s. And Nicholson, in his other, Las Vegas, persona, is making a pitch to some investors to build more hotels. ""After all, the Martians come here, they gotta stay someplace, don't they?"" The investors include only Texans, Arabs, and Japanese.I'm afraid I didn't find it at all funny. Maybe because so much of the film was a special effects charivari focused on death and destruction. One loud mouth vaporized might be funny. Repeated vaporizations, running into the dozens, are no longer amusing. As the president, Nicholson isn't vaporized. Instead he shakes an alien hand, the hand detaches itself, slips around into his back, and a cone-like object punctures Nicholson's chest and extends a few feet outward before Nicholson drops dead. This is funny? To me, it seemed like an excuse for overblown digitalization, like the blowing up of cities.My disappointment might have something to do with a personal quirk too. I've always found clowns to be more disturbing than funny. They strike me as human beings with gross physical deformities and a bizarre taste in garments and accessories. But, then, I don't know. I enjoy Monty Python, Mel Brooks, and many of the other send ups of genre movies. I even liked Slim Whitman when I was a kid.Well, what can I say? Try it. Maybe you'll like it. I didn't.",Mars Attacks!
13,Tweekums,Comically gruesome invasion film,8,10 April 2011,"This film by Tim Burton with an almost all-star cast takes a little while introducing its large cast but when the action starts it is hilarious if a little gruesome. Watch Jack Black being zapped by a ray gun! See Sarah Jessica Parker having her head swapped with that of her Chihuahua! As the Martian attack progresses they kill generals, politicians and ordinary Americans using a variety of methods; most of which seem to amuse them as it will the audience and just when it looks as if Earth is doomed a very surprising weapon is discovered to combat them.Once the action starts this film is hilarious and it will probably amuse most older children and adults. The effects were done in a comic way that matched the tome of the film; I especially liked the look of the Martians with their tiny bodies and huge heads. It might not be suitable for younger children as some scenes are a little gruesome such as when somebody is left holding a severed hand and another scene where somebody has a finger bitten off; there is also a small amount of swearing some parents might not approve of. The 12 certificate the film was given here in the UK seems about right; my twelve year old nephew laughed frequently when watching it and none of the more gruesome scenes bothered him.",Mars Attacks!
14,BA_Harrison,"Mars Attack, ack, ack, acks!",8,1 August 2010,"Tim Burton's wickedly funny homage to classic sci-fi films of the '50s sees Earth under attack from ray-gun toting martians with goggle-eyes and over-sized craniums.I might be going against popular opinion here, but I reckon that Mars Attacks is one of Tim Burton's best films: it features none of the director's trademark goth trappings that I find so tiresome; it displays a delightfully deviant sense of humour; the amazing cast (including BA_Harrison faves Christina Applegate and Pam Grier) have an absolute blast with the camp B-movie style material; and perhaps most importantly, it doesn't star bloody Johnny Depp (any more so-called quirky performances from that guy, and I swear I'll never watch another Tim Burton film in my life!).My only minor criticisms would be that the film is rather slow in getting to the fun stuff, taking a little too long to introduce its huge raft of characters (which range from Luka Haas' trailer trash family right up to Jack Nicholson's President of the United States), and that the CGI effects look pretty crude by today's standards (but I suppose, if truth be told, that the same could be said of Ray Harryhausen's work—but we still recognise his films as works of genius).Next time I emerge from the cinema disappointed by the latest Burton blockbuster, I must remember to immediately pop in Mars Attacks to remind myself how good the guy used to be.",Mars Attacks!
15,moonspinner55,Amazing actors stuck playing ignorant yokels...,1,31 July 2002,"After a first contact meeting in the Nevada desert between the U.S. President's science aides and the Ambassador of Mars doesn't go well, the President and his advisers suddenly find Earth at war with the intergalactic creatures. Rarely has a modern movie collected such an eclectic group of actors in one place. This is, of course, a testimony to the reputation of director Tim Burton, but Burton doesn't set up a very appealing showcase for his amazing cast. We're primed to laugh at who they are (their personas) rather than who they're playing (a bunch of idiots). Martian invasion movies from the 1950s were supposed to be scary but were instead funny and maybe a little campy--this one wants to be funny, but is instead condescending and mean-spirited. Usually, Burton's strengths as a filmmaker (eccentric bits of whimsy and character interaction) save the day; with ""Mars Attacks!"", he's coasting on shtick (pitched far too high) and relying on caricature-driven mayhem to carry the plot (concocted by screenwriter Jonathan Gems) and the players (willing stars, by the way, who were probably hoping for a slam-dunk). It doesn't work. Even the cartoon-derived violence is heavy-handed. NO STARS from ****",Mars Attacks!
16,Quinoa1984,Weird and funny in a wonderful way,9,27 September 2000,"This is one of the weirder films I saw as a 12 year old. And hey, who better to deliver goofy, 50's alien spoof hijinks than the director of weird, Tim Burton. He brings a 50's type of story that can be considered a comedy back then and now. Here, a President (Jack Nicholson) has to deal with aliens from mars coming in flying saucers like you would see on hubcaps. At first, every one of the cast members (including Nicholson in two differed roles, Glenn Close, Natalie Portman, Jim Brown, Pierce Brosnan, Martin Short, Sarah Jessica Parker, Michael J. Fox, Annette Benning, Danny DeVito, and Tom Jones who gives a funny cameo) thinks the martians are here for peace.Yeah, peaces. It starts to get weirder every time you watch it, but it also incredibly funny to hear these mars people talk (and some New York voters for senate might agree that the martians sound very similar to the speeches by Hilary Clinton) as they put Pierce Brosnan's and Sarah Jessica Parker's head in jars. Some might wanna beware, but for others, it is the treat of the year.",Mars Attacks!
17,BandSAboutMovies,More Ed Wood style science fiction!,7,17 February 2019,"In 1962, Topps put out a card series called Mars Attacks! Kids loved them. Why wouldn't they? Every card shows horrific depictions of humans, Martians and animals shredded, blasted and annihilated into oblivion, along with plenty of implied sexuality. Parents went crazy and the cards were pulled from the market, but not the memories of the monster kids who dug them so much. 34 years later, Tim Burton finally succeeded in bringing it to the silver screen.This is a star-studded affair that seems to delight in massacring every actor it gets its hands on. Imagine the star-studded Irwin Allen disaster movies of the past, but put in aliens with laser guns shooting everything and anything in their path. Want to see Jack Nicholson die twice as two different characters? This movie has you covered. Interested in seeing Glenn Close get murdered by a falling chandelier? Tune in. How about seeing Jack Black get blasted into a glowing skeleton? This is the only movie I can think of where that happens.The Martians are the real stars here, making duck like noises and going bonkers when doves of peace are released, they slaughter everyone in their path, including Michael J. Fox. They take his girlfriend Nathalie Lake - and her pet chihuahua - hostage and switch the heads of her and her mutt. Oh yeah - they also behead Pierce Brosnan and hang his head upon a line, keeping him alive.To say this movie is ridiculous is an understatement. Kids who love video games end up being our nation's greatest hope. A nuclear attack is turned into a hit on a Martian bong. Jim Brown plays a boxer - who has Pam Grier as his ex-wife, of course - who is dressed as an Egyptian and who knocks out aliens throughout Las Vegas along with Tom Jones. And the real secret to defeating the Martian menace? Slim Whitman's voice.I love that this movie reduces casting to ""Can you get us someone like Jim Brown,"" and then they just got Jim Brown. Joe Don Bake, Martin Short and Rod Steiger even show up!Interestingly enough, in 1982, Howard Stern did a sketch during the first week he was on the air at WNBC. In ""Slim Whitman Versus the Midget Aliens From Mars"", Whitman's singing was used as a weapon against invading aliens. Years later, when Tim Burton was on the show, Stern told him about the sketch and Burton replied, ""You should have sued me."" Perhaps that's why Eric the Actor was always taunted with the music and ""Ack! Ack! Ack!"" Martian language from this movie.",Mars Attacks!
18,Coventry,Misunderstood ???,8,7 January 2004,"There's one guarantee in life : When you're reading 5 reviews on Mars Attacks, FOUR of them are negative ones! Why, I ask?? It's really hard for me to believe that all these movie-lovers fail to see the film like Tim Burton intended it. Mars Attacks! is a great film and - above all - a very effective parody. Burton takes the opportunity to spoof and laugh with almost every form of nowadays filth...Politics, religion, the army, television, greed in Las Vegas and God knows what else. Mars Attacks! is the purest form of cinema anarchy I've seen so far, and I really want to encourage you to see it again if you didn't like it the first time. Tim Burton is a genius. Practically all movies he did before ( and after ) Mars Attacks! prove that. Do you really believe that he would deliver a failure? Or do you think the entire brilliant cast would agree to starring in an inferior production?? They all acknowledged the genius of this movie...why can't the audience do the same?Mars Attacks! is a very remarkable achievement for yet another reason. This very well might be only film that cost a fortune in order to look cheap! Burton probably wasted a huge budget to make the settings and the design look like they did in the typical 50's Science Fiction movies. Burton is a big fan of these movies and he saved  neither money or trouble to make his satire look like those films. The direct tribute to Edward Wood in the opening credits is an obvious example of this as well, I think. Perhaps, this would be the only real thing you can accuse Tim Burton of...Mars Attacks! is a very personal project of his. I really doubt he worried much about the question whether Mars Attacks! would become a success or not. He told his tale and he clearly enjoyed doing so...Why wouldn't you enjoy watching it then?

19,Theo Robertson,Too Silly,5,21 July 2002,"MARS ATTACKS! gets off to a good start with a massive barbecue followed by a really good title sequence that will leave you thinking this is going to be a classic SF comedy but don`t allow yourself to be fooled because after the opening credits we are introduced very clumsily to the characters , a retard president and family , Bimbo newsreader , Vegas wiseguy , burned out boxer ,naive scientist , redneck trailer trash , warmonger etc all of whom are camp stereotypes and most of them are superflous to the very thin plot, there`s just far too many people in this film , and all of them are completely stupid beyond beliefI`m also irritated by the fact MARS ATTACKS claims to be a homage to all those 1950s B movies but has decided to be set in a sort of comic book present day where Leon Spinks , Buster Douglas , Tom Jones and Colin Powell exist . If you`re going to do a homage to 50s films shouldn`t you set it in the 1950s ? Most of the cars and fashions resemble those of that era but other parts are contempary which is silly and unexplained, but silliness dominates this film , people never act as you would expect them to and get ready for the most stupid cop out ending ever seen in a sci fi filmMARS ATTACKS ! does have a couple of good points . As I said the opening credits are good as are the humans getting exterminated SFX though this becomes over used long before the end of the film . The most successful aspect of the film is the Martians themselves who are very very well designed and memorable , but when you stop to consider that the only other memorable thing is the sheer silliness of the film maybe I`m not saying much , and the bad does outweigh the good",Mars Attacks!
20,LeonLouisRicci,"ACK ACK ACK (Translated) ""Do Not Run We Are Your Friends""",9,13 October 2012,"There is just one Scene after another that is a Colorful, Bizarre, Twisted and Unique Tim Burton Vision of Life, here, and on Mars. The movie never lets up and is based on the equally Colorful and Beautifully Bent Trading Cards put out by Topps in 1962 painted by the great Pulp Artist Norm Saunders. The Film is a faithful adaptation and includes most of the Card Images all presented in sharp Primary Colors and given a respectful representation. This is a Top notch Black Comedy, Funny, Violent, and Irreverent.It is favorably factitious and an Amazing Adventure with a Lurid and gross Artistic quality associated with the Director's Style and in-sensibilities. The stellar Cast is not necessary but all seem to be having a lot of Fun. The Visuals are the Star but the Script is less impressive, the overall effect is Cutting Edge Cinema that has an Appeal for the decidedly Off Key Karma of the Underground but marketed for the Main Stream.The Film's detractors are left with not much to complain about (but they do) except the Movie's Brazen Belief, a Design of the Different for the Normal among Us. No Sale... for Them it is Ridiculed and Unappreciated.",Mars Attacks!
21,poolandrews,"I loved it, even though I'm aware many don't...",8,22 July 2007,"Mars Atttacks! starts as the president of the United States of America James Dale (Jack Nicholson) is informed that the Hubble telescope has photographed 100's of Martian spacecraft orbiting Earth, he makes an announcement to the nation on national TV to inform the public. The Martians broadcast a message which is translated into English & are discovered to be landing co-ordinates in the Nevada Desert, a welcoming committee is organised to greet the Martians when they land. At first all indications seem to point to the Martians being peaceful but that doesn't last long as they begin to zap & kill anyone within sight & then mount an all out attack to take over the Earth!Co-produced & directed by Tim Burton I remember Mars Attacks! being one of the very first DVD's ever released here in the UK, in fact I think it was in the very first wave of releases by Warner Bros. over here who along with Colombia were the only major studios to support DVD upon it's initial launch in the UK & I also remember I got it free when I brought my first player all those years ago (I can also remember how impressed I was with the picture quality which we now take for granted) & frankly I loved it then & I still do now. Anyway, the script by Jonathan Gems is funny, smart, fast paced & a whole lot of fun. Now I think you need to be of a certain disposition to enjoy Mars Attacks! as it's going to appeal to horror/sci-fi fans & not just films of that type from the 50's either although one senses that's where most of the inspiration for Mars Attacks! comes from. To 'get' Mars Attacks! I think you will need to have a basic knowledge of sci-fi films & actually like them otherwise this is not going to appeal to you at all, there are some very funny scenes here as well as some exciting ones in particular the Martian invasion at the end. One major problem is that the script tends to go from character or set of character's to another very haphazardly without giving much time for them to develop & never really settles on any particular person or group so it's difficult to get attached to anyone. Still Mars Attacks! is more about the Martians than humans, I think it's absolutely fantastic with a weird sense of humour & is great fun but I seem to be in the minority unfortunately.Director Burton does a great job & he obviously has lots of fun here, the design of the Martian flying saucers to the big brained Martians themselves, to the 50's look of the Army even though it's set in the late 90's which is a contrast I rather liked. I liked all the little touches in this film & the sneaky little homages, how the Martian rays guns would strip peoples skin & leave behind a red or green skeleton, the way the Martian dressed as a woman infiltrates the Whitehouse & it glides along rather than walk & countless other little touches here & there that you probably need to be a fan-boy geek to appreciate. The CGI computer effects are excellent & are more or less as good as anything that has been made since.With a budget of about $70,000,000 Mars Attacks! bombed at the box-office making less then $10 million back over it's opening weekend which is a shame as it is well made with high production values, great effects, an eerie 50's inspired score by Danny Elfman & some fabulous 2:35:1 widescreen (please, please see it in widescreen if you can) cinematography. The all star cast do OK but they sort of ham it up a bit too much, Jack Nicholson, Pierce Brosnan, Sarah Jessica Parker, Michael J. Fox, Natalie Portman, Danny DeVito, Annette Benning, Glen Close, Martin Short, Rod Steiger, Joe Don Baker, Jack Black, Pam Grier & Welsh singer Tom Jones go to make up an impressive cast list.Mars Attacks! is, in my opinion, a wonderful playful & fun sci-fi homage that stands up as a pretty darn fine film in it's own right. Unfortunately not everyone agrees with me & I'm aware more people dislike Mars Attacks! than actually like it so while I give it an 8 stars out of 10 it's an impossible film for me to recommend. Probably made by fans for fans if you know what I mean.",Mars Attacks!

23,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,"""Can we do interviews?""",7,30 January 2010,"If you have seen a Burton film before, you have an idea of what to expect. On the other hand, if you have not, it is a little difficult to determine if you will enjoy it or not. What I can say is that this is *not* mainstream or Hollywood. If anything, it mocks the traditions of such. This is tasteless, sick, twisted fun, spoofing and satirizing the army, politics, the media, religion, etc. It also contains homages to the campy sci-fi flicks of the 50's, though you really don't need to be particularly familiar with those to get into this(I'm not, and I laugh my head off). This was my second viewing, and the other time was at least half a decade ago, and yet I remembered nearly everything(and the humor still ""worked"" for me, in spite of me knowing the punchlines). That doesn't happen all that often. The comedy is *hilarious*(with some exceptions that miss the mark), with silly and goofy material, absurdity, brilliantly written dialog and absolutely *no* holding back. This has a magnificent cast(all of them clearly in on it, aware of what the final product would be) and the characters are distinguished and memorable, and all the archetypes are there. The acting is spot-on for nearly every performance; Tom Jones isn't entirely convincing, but it doesn't get to be terribly bothersome. This never stands still, there is a ton of energy in it, and the pacing is fast without being overwhelming. The special effects are good, if you can tell that CGI was relatively new at this point, and the integration between the FX and the live-action elements is reasonable at best. There is plenty of moderately violent and disturbing content, a little mild language and brief(not graphic) sexuality in this. I recommend it to anyone who can imagine that they'd like it. 7/10",Mars Attacks!
24,neil-476,Beats the opposition,8,2 March 2011,"In one of those amusing coincidences which besets Hollywood from time to time (almost constantly, it seems), two major movies about alien invasions come out within a short time. One is Independence Day - Roland Emerich's gung ho (and intelligence insulting) straight faced tale of a few brave people standing up against unimaginable might and technical superiority, and winning the day by dint of sheer spunk. The other is Tim Burton's Mars Attacks!, a goofy and subversive take on the same tale.Mars Attacks! is by far the better film. It knowingly punctures every pompous second of Emerich's bombastic effort, and does so with a smirk and a wink. Emerich gives you a vomit-inducing speech by Bill Pulman's President - Burton gives you Jack Nicholson's Presidential idiot (a part which actually suits Jack in over-the-top mode). There is a host of well-known faces turning up to play cameos, and most are very funny.And let's not forget the martians (and, indeed, the special effects generally) - priceless!

Fox: Satire of alien invasion films where little green people invade earth. They have ray guns that can fry people into skeletons. The title is a satire onto itself presenting a media frenzy. Great idea with a clever solution that bares resemblance to Attack of the Killer Tomatoes. The structure is such a mess that one must wonder if director Tim Burton allowed everything to run amuck while the cameras run. Burton is a visual genius with such films as Beetlejuice and Batman but here the visuals are plainly the only element of function. The gigantic cast is a waste including Jack Nicholson as the President and Vegas hotel owner. Glenn Close plays the First Lady. Natalie Portman plays their ignored daughter. Pierce Brosnan plays the President's chief of staff who is abducted with Sarah Jessica Parker where the aliens remove their heads and place them on the bodies of dogs. Michael J. Fox plays a reporter or media personality who doesn't last long in the celebrity wasteland that this film becomes. And the list goes on but many of them are nuked before we care. The film seems to be a parody take on old alien invasion films and the spirit is there but the payoff seems to be off target. The visual effects and production are a payoff but the story turns to guck. Score: 5 / 10",Mars Attacks!
26,Aaron1375,This is an invasion that should have been a lot funnier.,5,5 September 2010,"When I saw the trailer for this film prior to ""Independence Day"" I thought that this looked like it would be a really funny movie. Little did I know that the film ""Independence Day"" would have almost the same amount of laughs that this film contained within. The problem with that is that ID4 was not a comedy and this one marketed itself as such. This film seemed more interested in having as many stars as possible in the film and having Nicolson play not one, but two mediocre characters. There are laughs in this one mind you, as it certainly was not all bad. Heck, if it was trying to be a more serious endeavor it would have been a success as the little green men and their war machines look absolutely great. I also laughed a lot at them as they just looked and acted funny, like when they started laughing when we sent them a note saying they may have misinterpreted the dove. I think it is a shame that these creatures that did not really speak English were funnier than all the actors and actresses in this movie. Though I think you were supposed to be actually pulling for them as who would not want to see congress wiped out so we could start from scratch. The ending is interesting as it came up with a clever way of solving the problem and most of the more annoying characters were dead at that point. So basically a alien invasion movie that should have provided more laughs, but as is it is tolerable to watch and at times it is worth a chuckle or two.",Mars Attacks!
27,Mr-Fusion,I wanted this to be good . . .,4,22 June 2016,"There's something warped about ""Marts Attacks"" no mater how you look at it. For one, it's based on a line of trading cards - which actually sounds reasonable with the Hollywood culture of today, but certainly not that of 20 years ago. The bad guys are big-headed martians who speak in ""ack-ack""s. And they threw a lot of money at this thing; it looks expensive.But this script is terrible. How can you cast every actor working in 1996 and have such awful writing? There's a staggering array of talent here that's wasted on flat material. There are glimpses of solid comedy; like the martians vaporizing all of Congress. And I do still like Jack Nicholson's ""I want the people to know that they still have 2 out of 3 branches of the government working for them, and that ain't bad."" (the government cynicism here is tickling).But aside from a couple of nonverbal gestures from Rod Steiger, this is shockingly unfunny.4/10",Mars Attacks!

The Legendary Filmmaker has churned out some of the most morbid/dark subjects with zeal before, but this comic sci-fi flick, has to be his most absurdest to date.'Mars Attacks!' Synopsis: Earth is invaded by Martians with unbeatable weapons and a cruel sense of humor.'Mars Attacks!' is pure insanity. You see martians causing hell on earth, while the human characters are all caricatures. This isn't a film that should be taken seriously, mostly because, it itself knows how over-the-top & gleefully silly it is.But, thats not a bad thing. 'Mars Attacks!' works tremendously well for the genre it follows. I laughed at places & I was engrossed by its comical characters. Yes, at times, I was like, is this happening for real? But Burton & co., give us some delicious moments to cover its flaws.Jonathan Gems's Screenplay isn't full-proof, but it works nonetheless. Burton's Direction is over-the-top. Cinematography & Editing are average. Special Effects are ingeniously done. Make-Up is nicely done.Performance-Wise: Of its ensemble cast, its Jack Nicholson, in dual roles, who takes the lead & is a joy to watch. The legend dons the role of the paranoid president well, but is a hoot as the greedy developer of Las Vegas. Martin Short as the sleazy press secretary, is in terrific form. Annette Bening, as the deranged women, is top-notch. Sarah Jessica Parker as the feisty TV star, is excellent. And Pierce Brosnan as a science expert, is highly effective.

The funny lines and crazy sight gags are sure to please those that are into odd-ball comedies.

31,Red-Barracuda,A pleasingly mean-spirited comedy from a big Hollywood studio,8,8 February 2017,"I saw this when it first came out and remember thinking it made for such a refreshing contrast to the awful Independence Day which had come out slightly earlier that same year. Where I found that latter film to be an exercise in sustained annoyance, Mars Attacks was a genuine, interesting oddity. On the surface it was another sci-fi comedy but in reality this was a very weird film to be given big budget treatment by a major Hollywood studio. It was pretty commendable that such a risk was taken in throwing all this money at something which was such a personal vision of its director Tim Burton.On one level this is a parody of earnest 50's sci-fi movies but it's equally ram packed to the gunnels with black comedy. It's also an ensemble film with a huge cast of star actors and actresses but I don't think I can remember any other film which so wilfully enjoys killing off its A-Listers. Burton also seems to relish destroying Las Vegas and having the aliens run riot in Washington D.C. Its anarchic nature is unusual for this type of high budget movie that's for sure. In general, while certainly uneven, this is a comedy with a way higher than average laugh ratio, with many very funny moments sprinkled throughout. Many of this humour revolves around the Martians themselves who not only look hilarious with their huge brained heads but they also elicit laughs as soon as they open their mouths and bark 'Ark!...Ark!...Ark-Ark!'. Their general behaviour, too, was side-splittingly nihilistic – shooting the dove of peace, laser-blasting human beings whenever possible (usually after pretending they were being nice) and having the audacity to tell running crowds 'don't run we're your friends' while firing their guns at them! Too funny.This one has unsurprisingly developed a very Marmite reputation. Some love it, many hate it and there is very little opinion that falls in between. But its very individuality and the fact it was so markedly different in tone and attitude to the monumentally irritating Independence Day are reasons to treasure it as far as I'm concerned. Burton himself is a very hit and miss director but I reckon this has to go down as one of his most bold, original and enjoyable efforts.",Mars Attacks!

33,sddavis63,"After A Slow Start, This Becomes Quite Enjoyable",6,2 April 2016,"My first impression of this film from director Tim Burton is that it was pretty slow to get started. Indeed, it takes quite a while before Mars attacks anything or anyone. But once things get started (about 30 minutes or so in) this turns into a decent comedy-action movie that's fun to watch. Not a great movie by any stretch of the imagination, but fun and witty, including some decent political commentary that seemed to skewer conservative and liberal alike, as the general (Rod Steiger) takes a ""nuke 'em"" position before there's even contact, while the professor (Pierce Brosnan) is convinced that it's all just a misunderstanding that can just be talked out, even as the Martians are busily incinerating the entire human race! And no one seemed especially upset when the entire Congress was wiped out!This has a truly stellar cast. Aside from Steiger and Brosnan, there's Jack Nicholson as the President, Glenn Close as the First Lady, Martin Short as the press secretary. There's Annette Bening, Michael J. Fox, Danny DeVito, Tom Jones, a young Natalie Portman, Sarah Jessica Parker. There's more. The credits that open the movie go on and on and you know all the names. And they all take this just seriously enough, while also clearly understanding that it's all tongue in cheek stuff.I liked the Martians. They're cartoonish - in a creepy kind of way - which fits Tim Burton perfectly. I also thought that the action (once it got going after that slow start) was pretty well done and the special effects weren't bad either. It's ending is a clear and well done spoof of ""War of the Worlds,"" as the Martians fall before a power they couldn't cope with. (You'll have to watch this to find out what that power is.)It's not great, but there are worse ways to kill a couple of hours on a lazy Saturday afternoon. (6/10)",Mars Attacks!

35,ElMaruecan82,The Martians are Coming! The Martians are Coming! ...,8,26 December 2013,"I remember when ""Mars Attacks"" came to theaters in 1997; one year after ""Independence Day"". The similarities between the two movies were blatant, and I couldn't believe that Tim Burton didn't intend to make a parody of Roland Emmerich' blockbuster. Two films featuring Aliens' invasions, Earth destructions prevented in-extremis thanks to a cleverly hidden McGuffin, with an all-star cast and heart-pounding sequences of buildings exploding and crowds panicking, there was no way that Tim Burton didn't take his inspiration from the first film which I enjoyed so much I enjoyed the second even more.It's only later that I learned that the films were actually released on the same year, that Tim Burton had no idea of the other project and simply made his tribute to the good old Sci-fi B-movies that nourished his childhood and inspired his masterpiece ""Ed Wood"". You know, these movies with fake-looking flying saucers and weird-looking green creatures supposedly coming from the Red Planet. I guess ""Independence Day"" looked the same because of a similar inspiration. The difference is that ""Independence Day"" takes its stuff seriously but the viewers didn't need to and enjoyed the film for what it was, an action-packed adrenalin-inducing spectacle and ""Mars Attacks!"" take for granted our detachment and make fun of it, with us.The result is a hit-and-miss for each movie, while ""Independence Day"" was a ground-breaking movie on the field of special effects, through notably the unforgettable destruction of the White House, the Empire State Building and many other cultural landmarks, the film suffered from its own heavily patriotic undertones, reaching the peak of ridiculousness with President Bill Pullman's inspirational speech about the independence of the world coinciding with the National Day, as to suggest that USA works like the world in microcosm, not the likeliest attitude to appeal to international crowds. However, we would accept it since only Hollywood can make such films, they deserve to make their country the real star.The second criticism was the portrayal of the Aliens who looked like some mixes of the Aliens, the Gremlins and giant octopuses, making impossible to believe that these animalistic creatures would be capable of building these sky–covering giant saucers, especially since they were supposed to work like 'computers'. One quick glimpse on Tim Burton's poster proves that his Martians, no matter how cartoonish they look, make more 'believable' invaders. They look like human skulls with giant heads (more room for the brains I guess) they're ugly, even scary, but you can take them as 'people' from other planet, and if they talk the talk (a successions of 'dak dak' translatable to English), they also walk the walk.But that's a superficial judgment, on the content, Tim Burton, with his predilection for Black Humor mocks all the archetypes of the genre, starting with the so-called superiority of humans in general and Americans in particular. The White House is destroyed; the President is totally defenseless despite his General's coercions to launch a nuclear missile on them. And nothing seems able to destroy their Martians; a flag-brandishing soldier gets immediately laser-ed and turns into a skeleton. That's the kind of stuff you'd never see in ""Independence Day"", the fact is that there is no lovable, no charismatic, no hero in ""Mars Attacks"", not in cinematic standards anyway.What we have instead is a great all-star cast taking each role with fun and innocence. Pierce Brosnan is a charming and distinguished engineer who seems both fascinated and pleased by the new arrival, Annette Bening is a peace-loving dim-witted woman who believes the Martians will bring peace; Michael J. Fox and Sarah Jessica Parker (in love with Brosnan's character) are the obligatory scoop-driven journalists. Martin Short is the constantly excited White House Public Agents and Jack Nicholson plays a dual role as a Las Vegas crook and the American president, curious to meet these creatures while the disgusted First Lady (Glenn Close) would refuse to serve eat off the Van Buren china. They have (naturally) a daughter, played by a teenager Natalie Portman, who wouldn't care less if Michael Jackson was coming.All these people, and many more, from the underground side, Joe Don Baker as the redneck father of the ill-fated soldier (Jack Black) and a donut shop working boy (Lukas Haas) he treats like a bum (who'd inevitably turns out as a hero) thanks to the help of his grandmother (Sylvia Sidney) whose main leisure consists on listening to Hank Williams' songs. This colorful gallery provides many different reactions toward the Martians' coming until the Leader destroys a beautiful dove, suggesting that the Aliens hate birds. He also kills General Casey (Paul Winfield) in one of these scenes that would make any viewer cheer, as the way Rod Steiger, the most hawkish of all, gets shortened and stamped on like a miserable bug, some bits of humor that would have probably been regarded as unpatriotic during the Bush years.Tim Burton certainly had fun making this film and so did the actors, so I don't see how anyone can't enjoy it. I was surprised to learn that the film didn't meet with positive reactions. I didn't believe it wasn't nominated for Best Visual Effects, or maybe it had the misfortune to be released right after ""Independence Day"". I suspect the release of ""Men In Black"" hurt the film more since the film had a sharper humor and set higher standards in terms of special effects. Still, ""Mars Attacks!"" is great entertainment with an interesting ending, and a bad-ass duo featuring Jim Brown and Tom Jones.And whoever played that female Alien was so damn stunning!",Mars Attacks!
36,Pjtaylor-96-138044,A messy and unfocused attempt to lampoon '50s sci-fi without actually taking the time to properly satirise the genre.,4,24 October 2017,"The problems with 'Mars Attacks! (1996)' start with the star-studded yet cluttered cast portion of the opening credits, which clue you in to the biggest issue that ails this messy and unfocused piece: each character represents little more than a recurring cameo. Seriously, they all have almost no bearing on the plot, if you can even call it that, and pretty much every scene seems entirely pointless because of this. In many ways, the whole thing seems like a fruitless endeavour. It doesn't help that there are almost no laughs at all, since the flick purports to lampoon flying-saucer science-fiction tropes in a schlocky tongue-in-cheek way and yet somehow manages to miss the mark by coming across as simply poorly conceived and campy B-movie stuff sans satire or subversion. The experience can only be described as passively skittish, coming across more as a series of loosely connected one-gag sketches than an actual narrative. It's a wonder all of these top-class actors even glanced at the script for more than a couple of seconds, though no doubt a large pay-check was involved. 4/10.",Mars Attacks!
37,bowmanblue,The best movie ever to be spawned by bubblegum cards!,7,28 May 2014,"The trouble is... 'Mars Attacks' doesn't have a lot (if any!) competition for that title. In the mid nineties, when alien invasion fever was at its highest, someone proposed a film about cheesy 1950s-style Martians attacking Earth and 'Mars Attacks' was born.The first thing you need to know about it is that it's an 'ensemble' piece, i.e. it has simply tonnes of A-list stars attached to the project. And, despite sounding impressive, that's kind of a downside. For none of them are really given enough screen time to get to know. There's absolutely no character development for any of them and, what's more, most of them are pretty objectionable anyway, leaving you cold when they finally get melted in a – visually-pleasing – array of colourful laser fire from out green, big-brained invaders. There are a couple of 'nicer' characters, but they're hardly in it enough for you to even remember their names. Many of the characters could have been removed completely and the story wouldn't have lost anything.Jack Nicholson is undoubtedly the 'main' character, as he plays the President of America. However, despite his acting abilities, he doesn't really do much as the role. Perhaps that's why they gave him another role to play, but, as I said before, half the characters could have been easily gotten away with and Jack's second performance is one of these.As for the story... well, there isn't really one. Mars does indeed attack, but not until about forty-five minutes into the movie. What you have is basically a 'sketch show' with many famous faces, all vying to 'out-horrible' each other.However, despite the film's many flaws, it's kind of worth a watch... but only for the Martians. They're completely the stars of the film. They get all the best lines (not that any are actually spoken in English) and are a delight to watch. In fact, they're so good they only go and double how bad their human (and un-computer-generated) co-stars are in comparison.If you think you can sit through a sketch-type alien invasion film with a few comedic moments (but not enough to really class the film as an out and out 'comedy') you should enjoy this.

38,ThomasDrufke,Ridiculous Sci-Fi Romp,6,18 September 2016,"Tim Burton doesn't usually delve into the Sci-Fi realm of filmmaking, so Mars Attacks seemed like a good deviation for him while still maintaining his style. Burton certainly does that, with sometimes satisfying and always ridiculous results.One thing it undeniably has is an unbelievable cast. Jack Nicholson, Glenn Close, Michael J. Fox, Annette Bening, Pierce Brosnan, Sarah Jessica Parker, Martin Short, and Danny Devito star in this insane sci-fi romp. And that's just to name a few. In some ways, this is Tim Burton's Independence Day. The story is structured in a similar way with an ensemble cast sharing the load with interweaving stories. The aliens have similar intentions but with a slightly more comedic approach and horrific special effects.I was not on board with this film for the first 45 minutes. There were far too many characters to keep track of and I didn't really feel connected to them anyway. The film also seemed to be taking itself way too seriously. But once the aliens reach Washington D.C., it turns into a completely different film altogether. So in one hand, it's an uneven directing job from Burton. But on the other hand, the change of tone midway through kind of adds to the ridiculousness of the whole thing. Either way, I enjoyed my time with this sci-fi romp.Overall, it's a charming little sci-fi project from Burton, and we haven't really gotten one of those from him since. Although the budget skyrocketed to 70 million, which is a lot for the 90's, the story feels more personal and smaller scale than the similar Independence Day. The effects are brutal and would have been better off using stop motion like Burton had originally planned. But all of this pretty much leads to a harmlessly entertaining comedy that hits more often than not.+Tonal change helps+Cast+Ridiculous-Don't really care about all the characters6.8/10",Mars Attacks!
39,lesleyharris30,"Shockingly Bland for such a Bizarre Premise,",5,2 July 2016,"Mars Attacks is a mediocre movie with a poorly developed story, despite a top notch cast. For a film with a premise as bizarre as a group of aliens based on trading cards attacking Earth, parodying Science Fiction from the 1950's and featuring a gigantic slew of cameos, it is surprisingly bland. It does not deliver it's promise nearly as much as it could have, the cameos feel very much like they were done for the paycheck and its satire of cheesy disaster films was something we have already seen done, to a much more effective degree, by the Zucker brothers. The lead cast members do a good job, Jack Nicholson is great as the president and throws himself in to this universe effectively, Pierce Brosnan is also very funny in his professor role, proving comedic talent. It surprised me with a set up like this, directed by the versatile imagination of Tim Burton, that Mars Attacks bored me, it is not as bad as it could have been, but it was certainly was not as good either, might be worth the watch if you see it on television and want to form your own opinion, but I would not recommend it. The Government must act fast when the Earth is attacked by powerful aliens. Best Performance: Jack Nicholson/ Worst Performance: Tom Jones",Mars Attacks!
40,Irishchatter,Very funny and good!,8,27 July 2016,"I have heard of this movie before but I never got to sit down and properly watch it until last night. It was unbelievably funny, I honestly didn't think it was one at all, I thought it was just a normal sci-fi film with such laughs! Jack Nicolsan as usual, did a great job in doing a few times such as the president of the United States, a crook and the scientist who translates what the aliens are saying. Seriously I would rather nominate him as a president than Hilary Clinton or Donald Trump these days! It would make the world a better place like haha!Anyways even if the movie was full of laughs, it's even sad to when the Aliens killed off the best stars such as Michael J. Fox, Danny DeVito, Sarah Jessica Parker, Pierce Brosnan and Jack Nicolsan with his few roles. However I'm glad they kept the other stars like Nataile Portman and the others. Portman is just so gorgeous in this as a teen, she really stands out in any movie! I would give this movie 8/10 for its humour and honorary of B movies out there!",Mars Attacks!

Thus, they are the ones in charge when the Martians come for a visit. The press secretary (Martin Short) is there to advise. At first, the Green Ones are thought to be friendly, mainly because a haughty professor (Pierce Brosnan) says so to fashion show hostess Nathalie (Sarah Jessica Parker). Her reporter boyfriend, Jason (Michael J. Fox) does not like the glances Prof gives to his girl. But, some of the Martians are invited to Congress, where they promptly mow down half the Senate with their ray guns. The President's main general (Rod Steiger) can't stop saying kill, kill, kill. However, the Martians apologize and arrange another meeting in the desert. Meanwhile, in Vegas, Tom Jones is headlining and a developer (also Jack Nicholson) is planning a posh new hotel, although his alcoholic wife (Annette Bening) is less than enthused. Finally, a donut-shop worker and teen (Lukas Haas) lives in a trailer with his mother, dad, his marine brother (Jack Black) and sister-in-law (Christina Applegate). Half-crazy Grandma comes to visit but they always take her back to ""the home"", so she can listen to her beloved LP of Slim Whitman. Uh oh. The Martians lie! When they come again, they start a war and get the upper hand quickly, with their deadly ray guns that pulverize the victims. Soon, Jason is wiped out and Nathalie is taken captive, along with the Prof. The far-from-bright marine gets turned into dust and most of the trailer court is wiped out. Mr. Pressman is eliminated personally by a Martian disguised as a big-breasted woman. They even get to the Prez, killing him and placing a Martian flag on his chest. Horrors! The greenies also run to Vegas and start havoc. Can nothing stop them? What about a former heavyweight boxer (Jim Brown) and his estranged wife (Pam Grier)? Or how bout Grandma and her shrieking version of When I'm Calling You? This film is Tim Burton's best work, no argument. It is inventive, quirky, hilarious mayhem. The large cast is PERFECT, down to the last member. As for the special effects, they are likewise dazzling, with special words of praise for the creation of the little but deadly Martian beings. Everything else, from costumes to editing to script to direction is also fabulous. Want to send the doldrums packing? Nothing is better than this one!",Mars Attacks!

43,The-Sarkologist,A Twisted film from the mind of Tim Burton,9,12 October 2013,"Tim Burton is a man who knows how to make a movie. He did it with Edward Scissorhands and he has done it again with Mars Attack. Burton isn't a typical Hollywood director. He has his own personal style and his films go from being emotional, to adventurous, to outright satirical. Mars Attack falls into the satirical category.The American audience where said to have hated this movie, and this is not surprising considering how it poked fun at American society. It was a movie that has satires such movies a Independence Day and Airforce One (even though this movie came out before them). I say this because the American President (Jack Nicolson) is just absolutely incompetent and pathetic. He is very hesitant and by the end of the movie he is an absolute wreck.The movie is about martians who come to Earth. They first appear peaceful but then declare war. This is not because Earth insulted them, nor because Humans did anything to hurt them, but because they just wanted to. They are untrustworthy, and will come in peace to wage war against everybody. It is very interesting that one martian is running around saying ""I've come in peace"" while he is killing everybody. It is a very interesting reflection of us has human beings. We claim to uphold peace so much yet let wars rage around the world. The current Gulf Crisis is a fine example of going to war just for the sake of going to war. Last time Sadam Hussein was the aggressor, this time it is the Americans.The welcome party for the aliens is interesting. The Americans want to meet the aliens on peaceful terms, but the first impression the aliens receive is of hippies, snooty reporters, and the US military. It is as if the Americans are saying, ""we will meet with you on peaceful terms, but if you are hostile we'll kick your butt."" The very intimidating meeting with the military is as if they are wanting a relationship on their terms. If the aliens were insulted, it was because of this welcome. First impressions count, and in this movie the aliens' first impression of the Americans were a bunch of bullies.The psyche of the characters are interesting. We have a Las Vegas sleaze (Danny DiVeto), a snooty media producer (Michael J. Fox) and Tom Jones (Tom Jones). Where Tom Jones actually fits in is weird. You expect him to be a cameo role, and he ends up taking major one. It is as if there is a taboo on killing Tom Jones. I am not a huge fan of Tom Jones' music, but his appearance in this movie and in the Simpsons makes him a likable character.Burton really undermines the image of the all American hero in this movie. The typical hero, the soldier who is brave and foolhardy, is one of the first people killed, and he is killed because he presses the wrong button on the assault rifle and ejects the clip. The guy was an idiot and would have never made it. Even so, he is honoured by his home town, given a twenty one gun salute, and a shrine to him is erected in the family caravan. The real hero is some humble boy who works in a donut shop and saves the world by going to rescue his grandmother from the old folks home. His final speech really highlights the humble and unusual nature of his character. It is neither long or loud, nor is it full of patriotic phrases, but is more of a 'thankyou but it was not me but all of you' and finishes off by saying that we should all live in teepees because teepees are cool.",Mars Attacks!

46,Dr_Coulardeau,"And some say it is humor, sarcasm, irony?",5,7 October 2015,"This time he blew it completely, Tim Burton. OK he does not like middle class America but why the heck does he want to have it destroyed? All right he does not like Martians who are green and destructive in the most futile and insidious way but why the heck does he want them to destroy us all? He sure does not like crooners that are good enough for Las Vegas casinos and for grandmothers who live in the past, but why the heck does he want them to be a deadly weapon against Martians? In this film Tim Burton's phantasms and fears and frights and complexes and whatever make people disagreeable and uncomfortable are coming to the forefront in the limelight. No we do not have to accept that paranoia. No we do not have to like that neurotic schizophrenia. No we do not want to let ourselves drown in that kind of pile of clichés and stereotypes.""But you do not understand anything and you do not have a sense of humor!"" will all Tim Burton's lovers and addicts tell me, and they will be right. I do not have that kind of morbid sense of humor that is no longer humor but frankly a macabre grandiloquent overstatement of the most visceral and glandular hatred turned into a joke. If that is a joke then I am an undertaker of such jokers. True enough he used Jack Nicholson in the role of the master joker one more time and I must say as an incompetent and ineffective President of the United States he is outstanding, but even so there is no joke in such a subject.To just make you realize this film is by far too much and too extreme just change the Martians into Native Americans, African Americans or Asians and you will be able to see this film is out of joint and the dream that such a massacre can liberate the earth and humanity so they can start all over again is a myth that so many fundamentalists caress and cultivate. The Unabomber – let him rot in a federal prison – advocates in his books and articles that we have to go back to a pre- industrial state because all our ills and problems are the result of industrialization from the very start reaching today its global phase. Global industrialization means global perdition for these advocates of ""Lucifer washes whiter,"" as the Winchester brothers, Sam and Dean, know very well.As for crooners being a deadly weapon, I would agree with him but what they kill is vain marginal clandestine underground research that has no audience and will never have an audience, even with the Internet, certainly not a buying audience, which does not prove anything except that you will not live from it whereas crooners do live comfortably. And there will always be some, even many grandmothers.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU",Mars Attacks!

One of the two gets a whiff of something and realizes that they must be standing downwind of a barbecue. Before you can say ""pile it on a plate,"" a herd of burning cattle comes thundering over the horizon. If THAT doesn't make clear the filmmaker's intentions, nothing could. Tim Burton pokes loving fun at- of all things- a series of bubble gum cards from the 1960s- and he does it brilliantly. A former friend whose tastes run to just about everything every filmmaker has ever produced told me that he ""hates"" this movie. I've frankly never been able to figure out why: it has ALL of the elements he loves so much in so many lesser efforts. Only done far better.

48,johnnyboyz,"Burton Attacks! an array of different ideas; genres and spoofs as smiles, scares and generally scattered content play out under a familiar set-up.",6,27 December 2009,"Tim Burton's 1996 film Mars Attacks! might just be one of the most shameless films ever made. The picture is shameless in its pastiching of those old, 1950s B-Movie sci-fi films; it's shameless in its convoluted and relatively misguided content, which constantly jumps from that of a seemingly harmless and 'funny' nature to out and out shock tactics; and it is pretty shameless right the way down to its casting of Pierce Brosnan as the British, typically cleverer than everyone else, pipe-smoking scientist character amongst many other issues I have with the portrayal of those in supporting roles. The crazy thing is, that everything just about comes together and everything just about works thanks to some minor, more minute observations of the world in which we live and the attitudes we express.As has been noted on many an occasion by those in the past, director Burton jumped into Mars Attacks! ,a spoofing of old Hollywood B-Movies, following 1994's Ed Wood which was about a man made famous by those exact things. Half of Tim Burton's CV sees him do adaptations of some kind, that's what he does when he isn't dabbling in expressionistic inspired; Gothic infused dream-like projects such as Beetlejuice; Edward Scissorhands; Sleepy Hollow and, with hindsight, something like Corpse Bride. The adaptation-inspired side of his work sees him remake past films in Planet of the Apes and Charlie and the Chocolate Factory; adapt stage shows in Sweeny Todd and, perhaps most famously, bring to life the Batman comics. Mars Attacks! is a curious beast; it's a sort of satire-come-loose remake of most 'flying saucer' movies from decades ago, but doubles up as some sort of visualisation-come-adaptation of a series of somewhat frightening trading cards, additionally from decades ago. There are times it works, times it doesn't.The film is a mixture of filmic awareness combining with the showing off of special effects to deliver something that caters to most tastes: it is scary; funny, but only in the blackest of forms; carries a fair amount of suspenseful content and is relatively unpredictable given its complete disregard to famous acting names and faces in terms of whether character and actors are powerful enough, important enough or recognised enough in order to survive. Observing some of the more powerful acting heavy weights drop out of the film as those we've never heard of charge through, scathed but alive, is quite amusing.The film has a premise, I'm not sure about it having an actual narrative, but it has a premise none-the-less. And that is that extra-terrestrials from another planet are about to arrive on planet Earth with the apparent intent to destroy everything in sight: buildings; landmarks; people; cattle; everything. The invading force don't seem to give a reason for their actions, but the tag-line informs us of their thoughts: ""Nice planet. We'll take it!"" which would suggest they want to invade and set up their own settlements, indeed this was the aim in the trading card series. Indeed, the notion of what they want calls to mind that somewhat silly scene from 1996's Independence Day in which the president of the United States is told, telepathically, what it is the invading alien force are doing on Earth. You feel there must've been a point in which, amongst all the fun in making the film or writing the screenplay; someone must've just sat up suddenly and thought ""Hell, what beef do these creatures even have with Earth? Why are they even doing this?"" Answer? Because their actions spawn explosions and war, and that makes money at the box-office.Mars Attacks! covers a variety of different characters, too many if we're honest, and most of them are either clichés or stereotypes. You have the struggling African-American family, which features real-life ex-NFL player Jim Brown playing an ex-boxer named Byron Williams, with wife Louise (A pre Jackie Brown Pam Grier), whose kids are underwritten layabouts with a fascination for guns which eventually sees them acting as bodyguards for The President. Then you have the trailer-park dwelling Southerners; the prim, cell phone sporting, chihuahua owning socialite-turned-TV presenter in Sarah Jessica Parker's Nathalie Lake; while the Eastern European (mad?) scientist, whom creates a Martian translation device, is a sloppy representation too far.But there's a sly streak to the piece; something very dark which will see a well-off and pretty powerful character cruise the streets, in their chauffeur driven limousine, abuse the access they have to certain places as they look for women whom they can pay for sex. Later on, this character will suffer a cruel downfall when their sexual activeness goes a step too far and they perish. On another strand, a hotel businessman in Las Vegas seems to embody the very notion of greed as this additionally rich and rather well off character is naive as to what's around them in relation to the invading alien force, whom he thinks can be bargained with. This case-study of lust, greed and the abusing of one's position of power are slight but sly.While the film is nowhere near anything brilliant, there are enough little things to keep it going. The early banter between the American generals is quite funny and Michael J. Fox's character's fondness for a rival, female TV presenter is quite sweet. The film eventually settles for a vulnerable, but caring and therefore likable lead whose fearless dedication to aid those around him sees him win through. There are a few wavy moments; such as the scene in which a character is kept alive by God knows how when his disconnected head is kept suspended in the air as his heart, wired up a few feet from him, keeps beating as he talks to a human/dog hybrid; while there aren't nearly enough guerrilla scenes later on when a band of survivors make their way through the ruins of a city. But what works, works well and it's just about worth seeing.",Mars Attacks!
49,leplatypus,Liberalism attacks (dvd),7,18 February 2012,"This is a strange movie: In a way, it's as deadly serious as others extraterrestrial invasions (see ""ID4"") but in the same time, it's totally irreverent. In a way, it's a cousin of Spielberg's ""1941"". The humor comes from the Martian that are really sadistic and childish but also from the stupidity of humans. For me, it was cool to see that wasn't any respect for institutions and it's a welcomed breath of air from the always docile movies: here, POTUS isn't a courageous pilot, his Lady wears Prada, dogs are killed, monuments are destroyed, army is defeated and so on. On the other side, the movie has flaws as well: the entire Vegas situation is boring, all the more that a lot happens here. The miraculous song is really irritating (i understand why Martians react this way!). However, the cast is top notch and it's unusual to see such great names in one movie. In addition, the production is beautiful and very colorful and Danny's score is really entertaining!If you are stiff-necked or conservative, this is not a movie for you. If you aren't, you will have fun, I think. To conclude in the same spirit of the movie, I remember that the movie was scheduled on French TV on September 2001 but was then canceled!",Mars Attacks!

51,hellraiser7,Space Invaded,8,21 June 2015,"This is another under the radar gem I really like, yeah, I'm a fan of the 50's Topps serialized trading card line, which were beautiful oil painted illustration of simply aliens invading earth and us either getting killed or fighting back. That was it in a nutshell just turn your brain off mayhem. This film I feel captures that, despite not meeting every expectation this film came pretty close.The film is a parody of the 50's sci-fi from the good to even the ones you might have seen on ""Mystery Science Theater 3000"". As well as most of the Irwin Allen disaster films he was most famous for. It's not exactly one of the best parody films I've ever seen but it's solid.I really like the effects which are a combination of both CGI and practical which I feel actually hold up pretty well today. The aliens look just like the ones on the cards silly and butt ugly at the same time. Along with the technology like the giant robot which are always my favorites. And even like the laser effects and the way the people die, despite not gory it still looks brutal.I love the manic campy dark humored fun this film has, the whole film in a way plays out like a Mad Magazine cartoon, as each of the random things the Martians do are almost like comedy skits. From simply killing people in creative random ways like using one of the big robots to destroy a trailer with people we don't like which was a satisfying payoff. Commit petty vandalism, tour, you name it. I even like that the martians have comical personality which I feel fit them perfectly because like with the cards we're not meant to take them seriously. These guys are pretty much jerks, that you love to dislike both taking over the planet while fraking around and having fun in the process.Also I like the amount of clever humor it has, not just in visuals but verbal. The verbal humor is just fraking hilarious were the dialog is deliciously bad, some of the things certain random human characters say and even the Martian's sometimes can make you both laugh and groan at the same time. It's kinda funny because it's true in most disaster or badly made alien invasion flicks, sometimes they would have that dialog no matter how chessy or bad it was, some lines they said were fondly memorable.Even the human characters are fun, okay I wouldn't say their characters their more like charachures and that's the point. Just like in the cards their all one or two dimensional characters, and most of them are as moronic as most of the populace of ""South Park"", which of course make the Earth all the more ripe for take over. I like that they have a little personality and also the fact that it consists of a really huge A list cast which is both surprising but makes it all the more funny as each of them are just hamming and cheasing up the caricature's they play. It's also funny because most disaster films from Irwin Alien always consisted of a big A list cast for some weird reason.Really like the young main protagonist played by Lucas Haas along with his grandma. Both have a good back and forth, and I like the fact that in a way she's a better parent than his real parent whom are a couple of unlikable lowlifes. The grandma says one of my favorite lines, ""They killed Congress."" I couldn't help but crack up a bit from the way she said it but also something in the dark part of my mind I'd love for aliens to do since we have one too many corrupt politicians in the cabinet already.Jim Brown along with Pam Grier are really solid and it was great seeing both of them together once more since both are Blackpotation alumis, though I don't think and even they didn't think it would be this movie which make it all the more funny. Really like that their kids are bad asses as we see both get the aliens guns and are actually kicking more ass than the secret service, for a highly trained protection force they really suck. And liked it when Jim Brown was fist fighting against one of the aliens and breaking the glass, he could almost be like a Shonan anime protagonist because he's got some super human knuckles to be breaking though glass without getting cut.Rod Steiger as a over the top gung ho general along with Jack Nickelson as the president are just hilarious. From seeing the General so determined to kill the aliens. Down to the President trying to keep the peace despite failing miserably at it, my favorite line was ""there are still two branches of government still working and that's not bad."" um yeah it is.I'd love to see another Mars Attacks film with the R rating, it could be even darker more true to the card line but also still have that campy black humor. Or better yet a TV series on the Adult Swim block on ""Cartoon Network"" where each season could be a serialized plot and each episode a random nutty situation to deal with or even go the anthology and part of it could be the martians crossing over with other shows (if live action they be in animated form) like Gravity Falls, Steven Universe, Doctor Who, you name it it would be a laugh riot.

52,elshikh4,An Anti-Independence Day Movie !,7,16 December 2007,"Despite anything, (Independence Day - 1996) was a milestone in the ""end-of-the-world"" disaster movies. Yes, it's all about Viva America and marvelous CGI. Yes, it has some plot holes and tons of silliness. Yes, I didn't like a lot of things in it, or even didn't like it. However, it had smash success, and it did affect many movies to come.The thing is (Mars Attacks! - 1996) came out 5 months later. And with its publicity, it looked like another (Independence Day) yet with more stars and comedy. But that wronged it highly, because it is - in fact - the negative version of (Independence Day). And with regard to photography terms, the ""negative"" is always ugly however truer.(Mars Attacks!) is shocking. This round, there are nearly no heroes, the disaster smashes the world, and there is - to my surprise, and the genre's as well - a message.In an exceptional way, the movie utilized the ""disaster"" for satirizing the American society at the moment. Look how all the greedy, stupid, and coward characters are destroyed easily. And how the sole way to survive is by being less materialistic and more spiritual, as pellucid and high as the ancient music. Simply the movie dealt with America as an invaded place already by so many lethal values, to become a big joke in the movie's conscience.I loved many smart touches along the way. For instance: The Press Secretary, played by Martin Short, due to being a sex maniac, brings the Martians to the White House itself! The end's platonic love story between Professor Kessler, played by Pierce Brosnan, and TV host Nathalie, played by Sarah Jessica Parker, with no human bodies / destructive lusts involved. The old and tired boxer Byron Williams, played by Jim Brown, hated his job's dirty work, and became a Muslim; and having a real spiritual faith in this movie equals surviving; which Byron wins in the end.Jack Nicholson plays the American President James Dale, and the dull cowboy, showy hustler, Art Land who believes in money only. Since the first viewing, I believed that that was intended as the ultimate satire towards the American President in general, as if Art Land is his mirror reflection as dull cowboy, showy hustler, who believes in money only!The Martians were another wicked reflection in this movie's mirror. They are the humans, the real ugly picture of them as horny, lair, and avid people. Scrutinize a little, and you'll discover that their insane look, vain manners, and endless violence were ours. They're even short to embody our weakness, or assure how we're just dwarfs in that incredibly gigantic universe.All the cast did fine, and were so amusing. Though, I see that 2 actors stood alone: Rod Steiger as General Decker, who was a great caricature of the American military arrogance, being the movie's top laugh for me. And the impressive 85 year old Sylvia Sidney as Grandma Florence. That veteran actress, who began her career in the 1920s, and worked with director Tim Burton before in Beetlejuice (1988), delivered no acting at all; and this is the hardest acting of all!Burton, and his team of writers, were the actual Martians. They exposed the characters' frailty, and killed them for a laugh. Though, they were better than the Martians eventually, since they warned us: ""Don't you dare let this happen again!"".But nobody wanted to see the ugliness, laugh at the joke, or hear the warning. Because (Mars Attacks!) was too harsh to be the dreamy disaster movie, being about the defeat more than the victory. Add to that, the disappointing fact of it as a black comedy not an action (so how about having very little comedy as well!). That's why it wasn't a critics' favorite at the time, and grossed $101 million out of $100 million budget!Despite its dark tone, lack of comedy, and reputation as a flop, I enjoy such a movie. Enough to tell you that I've watched it many many times. It has bitter imagination, and pessimistic vision, but it managed to be optimistic at the end; at least the world there became more pure without its greedy, stupid, and coward characters!This is an anti-(Independence Day) movie.

I found this Sci-Fi/Comedy/Action film from 1996 to be a really uncharacteristic picture from Tim Burton.Presented as a tribute to 1950's UFO movies, Mars Attacks (with its awesome visual effects) delivers a kooky blend of twisted humor and ultra-violence that, when it works (which is about two-thirds of the time), is guaranteed to put a smile on the face of any fan of B-Movie schlock.P.S. - Yes, I do agree that, when it came to bad taste, Burton certainly did push the limits when he had the Martians perform their head-transplanting job, using Poppy, the cute, little, bug-eyed chihuahua, in their awful experiment.",Mars Attacks!
54,PWNYCNY,Interplanetary war reduced to a virtual joke.,8,23 March 2008,"This is a goofy movie, a spoof on the science fiction genre, and it works. The story has huge holes in it and could easily be trashed, but would not deserve it because this movie is fundamentally a science fiction black comedy. To take this movie seriously is a useless exercise in futility. Why trash a movie that's not supposed to be taken seriously? With that understanding, these comments are offered. Jack Nicholson plays two characters and provides an interesting and at times quite amusing performance. Jack Black and Sarah Jessica Parker also provide entertaining performances. But the best performance of all was that of Rod Steiger. Indeed, Mr. Steiger could have played Mr. Nicholson's roles too. The story is a take-off on other sci-fi movies but also includes some originality so that the movie is more than just a mere rehash of previous works. The movie may have some similarities to, let's say, The War of the Worlds, but is definitely NOT a remake of that movie. This movie also relies heavily on special effects which is a key component of the story. If you are searching for a movie that reduces interplanetary war to a virtual joke, then this movie is for you. But remember, it's only a movie.",Mars Attacks!
55,FilmCriticLalitRao,American director Tim Burton allows ghoulish martians to mess around with human brains.,4,19 March 2010,"""Mars Attacks"" is one of those ordinary films meant for one time viewing only which has been lucky enough to have achieved an almost cult film status as people have tried to decipher purposeful truths from it.All this has happened as its creator Tim Burton has created one of the most grotesquely strange films ever made in the history of cinema.One of the most challenging lessons that can be learned from this film involves the so called fictional failure of great American nation.This is something which helps viewers to deduce that modern man is nothing but a minuscule puppet who always exposes himself to annihilation at the hands of mysterious forces of nature who may arrive without any imminent warning from a distant,unknown planet.A fairly good idea of American unity is portrayed by using a good cast involving some of the biggest names of Hollywood cinema.However,this cast remains wasted as Tim Burton makes a fairly valiant attempt to make audiences pamper with his absent minded jokes.Most of this film's scenes are a veritable assault on human intelligence as aliens have been duly depicted as real stars who make a true mess of human life.It is hard to digest the fact that such events take place in one of the strongest nation on planet earth.",Mars Attacks!

Producers: Tim BurtonTim Burton made this sci-fi comedy called Mars Attacks!, and the cast he brought with him will make your eyes water. Seriously, the list is impressive. Jack Nicholson, Glenn Close, Annette Bening, Pierce Brosnan, Danny DeVito, Martin Short, Sarah Jessica Parker, Michael J. Fox, Natalie Portman, Christina Applegate, Pam Grier, Jack Black... and I've left some out ! It's like an Avengers movie if the superheroes were replaced with Hollywood celebrities.Mars Attacks! is essentially a throwback to 1950s drive-in sci-fi cheesiness, and it lives up to that legacy. Just don't go expecting that mid-'90s CGI to hold up all that well in today's climate. However, I imagine that also gives it a kind of throwback charm in itself.

57,CubsandCulture,A victim of its own success,7,11 May 2021,"The film is a faithful reconstruction of the a cheesy alien invasion flicks of the 1950's. It captures the tenor and humor of the trading cards it is based on. It is sardonic, bizarre and campy. It is entertaining on that level. But the script, effects are too good at re-creating the vibe of the material it is parodying...the film is too good-as in it is made by professionals-to be authentically psychotronic; it is not sublimely awful in the way say Robot Monster is. A bolder film would have used an unknown cast and presented a less slick film.The acting lacks the stiffness of the psychotronic films; moreover the script is too competent and coherent to create the deeper awfulness the films seems to be aiming for. Even the Deus Ex Machina has a partial set-up because the writing is competent. The resulting film is fun and funny in that it recreates this stuff...but its recreation is shallow and the studio didn't allow for a truly daring vision. I like this but the Lost Skeleton of Cadavra films are far more compelling at this sort of parody, homage.",Mars Attacks!
58,MaxBorg89,They came in peace...,8,31 January 2006,"Mars Attacks! is the kind of film you expect to watch only once and then abandon forever, since the plot sounds like a stupid update of some B-movie from the '50s (perhaps Ed Wood's Plan 9 from Outer Space, considering Tim Burton's previous film was about said director). But somehow, you end up liking it, for, apparently, no reason at all, at least there's no rational explanation, and you keep enjoying it, as the years (and viewings) go by...The story is very simple, and quite risible too: Martians invade the planet and people start running in panic, while the President of the United States (Jack Nicholson) tries to find a solution to the problem. Everything's about to turn into a very funny mess...As stupid as it might sound, the film actually rocks, perhaps because Tim Burton has understood he's not meant to treat the movie seriously, and therefore he gives us a wonderful parody of his key theme (the outcast's struggle against the people who don't understand him). There are only three typical burtonian things in Mars Attacks!: the superb main titles sequence, Danny Elfman's grandiose music and a couple of actors. That's actually what's also great about this movie: thespians who normally tackle serious, complex roles, have a hell of a time playing some grotesque, extremely hilarious individuals. These are not the roles we usually associate Nicholson, Danny DeVito, Glenn Close and Annette Bening with (oh, I almost forgot the priceless dorky scientist played by Pierce Brosnan). There are few ordinary people in the film, most notably Natalie Portman's First Daughter and Sylvia Sidney's half-senile Grandma, a truly great comedic creation.Not the usual Burton flick, but still worth your time.",Mars Attacks!
59,iquine,Burton Does Aliens,7,25 February 2019,"(Flash Review)This is an amusing and odd little movie with a massive cast of A-listers. As the title implies, aliens storm Earth with oodles of spaceships. The United States with Nicholson as president try to welcome them as friends but are quickly and brazenly attacked by the happy and colorful styled aliens. The rest of the movie is everyone trying to avoid being zapped by their deadly ray guns while trying to find a way to halt their invasion. There is light comedy interwoven as you wait to see which Hollywood star will be zapped next. The special effects, weapons and sound effects are reminiscent to the 50s Martian movies and are well-done. The funniest moment for me was when the military fires a nuke at them, some alien device sucks up the explosion and then an alien smokes the captured nuclear explosion matter with a pipe! Overall, this was fairly thin but strangely amusing.",Mars Attacks!

61,slokes,"""1941"" - The CGI Version",2,9 February 2005,"It's often said of a film that it's not as good as the book it is based upon. Here's a movie not as good as the bubble-gum cards it was based upon.Way back in the 1960s when director Tim Burton was a boy, Topps Chewing Gum put out these cards depicting a cartoonish Martian invasion of Earth, based loosely on ""War Of The Worlds."" Explosions, death, fire, monsters, and a glint of goonish humor, it was all a growing boy could want. Years later, his career as Hollywood's most visionary director underway, Burton decided to make a film celebrating those cards.""Mars Attacks!"" is a hodgepodge of loosely-knit moments with a cast that is way too large to support its slender thread of a story. It's supposed to be thrilling and funny, but it's neither. Instead, you have a succession of blind-alley bits with name actors embarrassing themselves, including Jack Nicholson twice as the president and as a gambler.Pointlessness rules. ""Do Martians have two sexes, like we do?"" asks an androgynous reporter at a press conference. Rod Steiger as a general is shrunk and stepped on. Boy scouts are squashed by the Washington Monument when the Martians knock it down. Tom Jones is singing ""It's Not Unusual"" on stage when he is suddenly joined by a trio of Martians.These are set up as punchlines, but there's nothing to punch here but piffle. There's some uniqueness to the Martians themselves, presented in early computer graphic imagery to resemble the day-glo plastic look of the bubble-gum-card Martians of Burton's youth. Jim Brown and Pam Grier offer some humor and sympathy as separated parents trying to save themselves and their two sons, and you wish they were around longer.Everything else, especially a pathetic subplot involving a grievously sick-looking Sylvia Sidney and a puberty-challenged Lukas Haas who discover the Martians' Achilles heel, seems to have been pulled from Stephen King's wastebasket. What was Danny DeVito's purpose in the film? He has fifth billing, and maybe five lines, all of which sound improvised and not in a good way. Annette Bening is a New Age alcoholic who talks like Marilyn Monroe and runs from the invaders, the best performance but one sadly undernourished by dramatic or comic purpose.Watching this film, I thought of ""1941,"" another comedy spectacle that puts glitz over humor. Except this time there's not even a funny speech like Dan Aykroyd's ""Was that Mickey Mouse I saw marching into Poland?"" bit to latch onto, just a series of sloppy non sequiturs by actors paying Burton back for having once put them in better films. The script is lame, and like ""1941"" it's hard to imagine so many professional film people letting this one go through their hands without demanding a major rewrite. As with ""1941,"" the idea is if you have a hot director with a unique visionary style, why not trust him to pull it all together?""Mars Attacks!"" is the answer. It's a sad little splat of a film, an early demonstration of CGI that also demonstrates how limited CGI as a tool can be. Burton is so much better when he lets the story dictate special effects, rather than the other way around.",Mars Attacks!

It's a spoof of those old cheesy sci-fi alien movies. It's surprisingly slow paced and quiet for a shoot em up alien movie.

Sometimes, funny, sometimes dull, and often times ridiculous, Mars Attacks! breaths life into a film which appears to have none. But then again, why argue over such trivialities? The casting was perfect, with Jack Nicholson doing a parody of himself, being over the top and too macho for the role. While the flow of the film seemed rigid and forced, the intent was simply meant to make fun of old-time sci-fi films. Good job on the parodying, but a rather average job on making all of these elements work succinctly.",Mars Attacks!

66,Steffi_P,"""We are your friends""",7,4 February 2012,"If Independence Day (also 1996) updated the classic alien invasion movie of the 50s and 60s, Mars Attacks! spoofed it to the hilt. Here producer-director Tim Burton once again stands up for his B-movie-loving corner of the 90s fad for tongue-in-cheek nostalgia.Burton has never been an exceptional visual director, but he has a certain knack at coming up with bizarre looking shots, such as one of Jack Nicholson's head a dot between the shoulders of the assembled press. He also clearly knows a few cinema-savvy tricks at handling the ensemble cast. Look at the first shot of Natalie Portman – she's just a background figure in this scene, but it opens with a shot of her, Glenn Close's scarf flying across the frame. This helps us remember her even though she's not really very active in this part of the movie.That aforementioned ensemble cast is perhaps the best thing about Mars Attacks! OK, no-one here does anything exactly exceptional, but every one has their place in the spirit of the thing. There are too many to mention them all, but special attention must go to the following: Leading lady of the 30s Sylvia Sidney as a lovable and non-stereotyped grandma; Rod Steiger, it seems the taking his role seriously as generally did, which works because it makes him look appropriately pompous amidst everything else; Danny De Vito, a bit over-the-top but showing great comic timing and exuberant use of his small frame; and Pam Grier, making a big impression in a small amount of screen time.Whereas most comedies would have some kind of action, romance or human story, Mars Attacks! is just pure and farcical spoof. It doesn't really have much point beyond that. It seems to make up for its lack of grand plan by simply being as constantly silly as possible. And on this basis it works well enough. Rather than the carefully-planned structure of a conventional screenplay, this one simply bounces from one madcap idea to the next like a series of Monty Python sketches, a dozen or so plot-holes swept under the carpet. It's a minor movie really by any consideration, but it's good fun for its 100 minutes.",Mars Attacks!
67,Reviews_of_the_Dead,Fun Parody with Bigger Social Commentary,8,26 July 2019,"This film was one that I watched a lot growing up. I remember it hitting the movie channels and it is just so quirky, that myself and I would watch it all the time. She ended up getting it on VHS, which got a lot of use as well. I really enjoyed it as a child, but it wasn't until I got older that I really started to understand how deep this film is. The synopsis is Earth is invaded by Martians with unbeatable weapons and a cruel sense of humor.It then begins showing us a farm house. A man on a tractor asks an Asian man if he is cooking up a feast. The Asian man tells him he is not, but then we see a herd of cows run by that are on fire. We then see a spaceship as it flies away. We then see that this spaceship is from Mars. More of them come and have a blockade around Earth.We then meet that the president of the United States James Dale (Jack Nicholson). His press secretary is played is Jerry Ross (Martin Short). He has two military officers in the oval office as well General Decker (Rod Steiger) and General Casey (Paul Winfield). Jerry wants to go to the press and just wants to know if they should when they should go on. General Decker on the other hand wants to keep this private and get ready for war. President Dale wants to gather more information first, but he wants to go with Jerry's plan to inform the nation.Some of the other people we follow are President Dale's wife Marsha (Glenn Close), who is of course the first lady. They have a daughter Taffy (Natalie Portman). Also in Washington D.C. is Louise Williams (Pam Grier). She's a bus driver that is divorced, trying to raise two boys who are handful. They're named Cedric (Ray J) and Neville (Brandon Hammond) and currently they're giving their mother a headache by playing hooky from school. The ex-husband is Bryon (Jim Brown), who is a former heavyweight boxing champion. He currently lives in Las Vegas and working as a greeter at a casino. He is trying to work things out with Louise with a plan of a visiting soon.Also in Las Vegas is Art Land (also Nicholson) whose a shady businessman trying to open up a new hotel. He is married to Barbara (Annette Bening).In between them is a family that lives in the middle of nowhere in the Midwest. There is Richie Norris (Lukas Haas). His older brother is Billy Glenn (Jack Black) who is in the military. Their father is Joe Don Baker and mother is O-Lan Jones. They also have a grandmother that lives in a nursing home named Florence (Sylvia Sidney). She is a little bit out of it though and calls everyone Billy. Sharona (Christina Applegate) is dating Billy Glenn as well.The final people to introduce are a couple of reporters who live together. Nathalie Lake (Sarah Jessica Parker) is one of them and does fashion pieces mostly for her station, but she works for a more popular channel. Jason Stone (Michael J. Fox) works for a rival company, GNN, and they seem to be constantly coming in second place.President Dale cuts in to let everyone know about the Martians coming to Earth. He tells them that they'll be contact and not to panic. Soon after, Professor Donald Kessler (Pierce Brosnan) goes on Nathalie's show and it is interrupted by the aliens. Their message is translated to want to meet up. General Casey is given command and everyone thinks it's going smoothly until the aliens attack. President Dale is clinging to the notion that it was just a misunderstanding or is Mars here to conquer Earth?Something that I alluded to earlier was that I never really picked up how deep this parody actually goes. The first thing that I realized was this is kind of a take on War of the Worlds while also being based off a trading card series back in the day. We really are getting these aliens coming to Earth, unprovoked and trying to wipe us out. There is a hilarious update to what can kill these aliens though for sure.It is after this viewing that I realized how much deeper this story of the film goes to and is extremely socially relevant now. President Dale seems like a good president, but he is really just worried about doing the right thing to get re-elected. Jerry just really wants to be transparent with the people as possible, which is ironic as he frequents hookers. General Decker is your typical Right wing, as he just wants to go to war and kill, then you have General Casey who is timid and completely the opposite. Professor Kessler really just doesn't want to be wrong as he is a man of science. General Decker of course doesn't want to listen to him either. The crazy thing is though, the film is showing that all of these people are wrong in what they want to do and it causes the deaths of a ton of people!I also couldn't miss the parallels here to coming to America or other places that were colonized. Something that confuses me is the first message that is sent, I almost feel like was a declaration of war and our machine misinterpreted it. It is an interesting assumption that we can defeat these aliens so easily if it was an invasion, which was much like what happened during colonization to the indigenous people.All of this is wrapped in an outrageous comedy. There were parts that I know were coming that still really make me laugh. I like the idea that these aliens have been coming to Earth and have been investigating things. It is fun seeing them experiment to learn more and some of things that happen are just great.With that said, the pacing of this film is really good. It doesn't waste any time from the beginning to get right into it. There is such a big cast to introduce, but I think it does a great job at making it seem natural and quite seamless. The invasion happens pretty soon after that and that gets just progressively worse. I like how it ends and what is used here to fight them off, it still cracks me up to this day. It is an interesting parallel for sure what was used in War of the Worlds.I've already touched on it, but the acting in this film is great. I can give credit to everyone, but I'll do my best. Nicholson is hilarious and playing two quite different roles. It is after a film like this you really see his range and what he can do. Close is solid as his vapid wife. Bening is interesting as she is a new age hippie. She is also one of the first to realize that these aliens aren't friendly and sticks to this. Brosnan is solid as is DeVito. Short, Steiger and Winfield all make for a interesting trio who don't always see eye to eye. Brown, Grier, Parker, Fox, Haas, Portman and the rest definitely round out the film for what is needed and I don't think there's a bad performance if I'm honest.Something I've been waiting to cover would be the effects of the film. Coming in, you really know this is a CGI fest. What I'm surprised by though, is that most of it is really good. I'm not saying all of it, as there are times that I thought that it doesn't look good or hold up, but for the most part though, it is on point. The Martians, their weapons and vehicles are all CGI as well as the attacks they do. It looks pretty solid though actually. The film is shot very well also.I couldn't end this without talking about the soundtrack of the film. I think that it does a really good job at sounding like a 1950's sci-fi for a good stretch, which is another thing that it is parodying. There is a song that is pretty hilarious that you will know exactly what I'm talking about if you've seen this or end up watching this. I also liked how the aliens sound when they talk as well. This all just fit the film for me.Now with that said, this film is one that I really enjoyed growing up. It wasn't until I got older that I really understood how deep this film really is. It does poke fun at not only War of the Worlds, 50's sci-fi films, but it also looks at political and social ideas from the past and present as well. It is paced in a way that it moves fast and never gets boring. The acting definitely helps there and the CGI surprisingly holds up. The soundtrack definitely fits for what is needed and the aliens talking are hilarious. Now being that this is part comedy, that prevents me from giving this a higher rating, but I don't know if you can present how this film is in a more serious way without being a remake. I definitely think this is good and should be given a viewing as it is fun.",Mars Attacks!
68,Spleen,Ack! Ack! Aaaack!,3,22 November 1999,"I'd LIKE to be kind, if only because of the stop-motion Martians.  Tim Burton may be the only director in the world, now that Stanley Kubrick is dead, who isn't hopelessly infatuated with computer-generated effects.  He deserves our respect.  And indeed, his Martians are gorgeous: their sneaky movements, their ludicrous ack-acking language, their big greebly eyes...That's as kind as I'm going to get, because by gawd, this movie stinks.  I never believed reports on how bad it was until now.  Interplanetary war! How can anyone take such a sure-fire theme and crash it into the ground?By shutting down the engines and letting gravity take its course, that's how.  Burton has a central premise he does nothing with.  The opening scenes on Earth aren't one bit funny.  The rhythm is all wrong for comedy.  Look at the way his poor actors have to deliver lines that might possibly, in vastly different circumstances, have been amusing, only to be swallowed up by deadly silence - not that the silence ever lasts long enough to be amusing in its own right.  And yet the characters don't grab us when we take them straight, either.  Was it meant to be parody?  If so I can't help thinking of another such parody: 1980's ""Airplane!"" (released as ""Flying High"" in Australia).  That film exalted in its ability to manipulate - it played EVERYTHING for cheap laughs, and yet somehow one felt keenly for the caricature of a hero at its heart.  Maybe it's because caricatures at least have sharp outlines.  The terrestrial characters in ""Mars Attacks"" are just lumps of dough.Elfman's musical score, sad to say, makes a bad thing worse.  I know he's done fine work in the past - ""Batman"" and ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"", for instance - but here he just doesn't seem to have a clue.  Never have I come across a score that covered so much of the action while doing so little for it.  Not that I really blame Elfman.

69,onepotato2,Please stop the pain...!,1,3 July 2005,"Mars Attacks is the kind of movie you watch repeatedly thinking, ""That's a funny idea...."" without ever actually laughing. It shows up frequently on late-night t.v. where I have now given it several 2nd chances; always with a pained expression on my face, while my mind devises elaborate ways to casue Tim Burton pain. The movie needs a lighter touch (which Burton has at this point proved himself incapable of) and it's airhead humor & plotpoints are undermined by the starpower delivery. That goes double for the budget. The ""realism"" of CGI doesn't help an idea as silly as this one. I don't need to believe the martians have the correct radiosity, shadow depth, animation speed etc. to have a laugh, and the production design is pretty much ruined by the digital insertions (...purposely OR obliviously crappy). It would take a cast of nobodies to put this thing over. Watching a cast of overqualified stars trying way too hard to be funny, with a script and a director who can't help them, is remarkably unsatisfying.I think I laughed twice, the ""friendly Martian"" translations while they incinerate people and the ability of ""Ack ack ack"" to mean just about anything.This movie is atrocious. For the record I started out loving Tim Burton movies and he alone wore out his welcome. His puerile mind hasn't moved an inch in twenty years. His Batman movies now look cheap, lurid and stupid. His movies reflect the emotional development of a five-year old. (Yes, including the execrable Big Fish) He wouldn't know a finished script if it bit him on the ass.

70,ArtVandelayImporterExporter,Mars Rules !,8,30 November 2020,"When I first saw this shortly after it was released I I wondered why critics and moviegoers were whining about it so much.It harkens back to the cheesy 50s space invaders/Cold War movies with their low-rent special effects and gung-ho military response. Except now we get to enjoy it in garish technicolor and 90s spooferama.I understand there was a Mars Attacks set of trading cards issued by Topps in 1962. That's before my time but if you look them up online you'll get the idea what inspired the look of this movie.There are so many recognizable faces having a blast it's pointless to list them all. My favorite is Sylvia Sidney, in her last big-screen credit.Like everyone else who loves this movie, I have my favorite scenes:1. Hippies releasing the dove, only to see the Martians vaporize it with a ray gun.2. President Nicholson giving his speech in the war room about 2 out of 3 branches of the federal government still being operational, so Americans don't have to worry about garbage collection. That scene might have played like satire at the time, but in a year when we have Gramma Killer Cuomo on TV every day announcing lockdowns and bloviating about his own leadership skills, it's practically a documentary.3. Lawn bowling at Easter Island.It is depressing to consider its competition in 1996 - the execrable, self-serious, flag-waving Independence Day - made about a billion dollar while this tanked at the box office. I mean, come on, Jim Brown or Will Smith as the bl@ck hero? A real man or a smug twerp?My theory is that low IQ American moviegoers want movies to reflect their paranoid fantasies about being the rulers of the world. Independence Day fed that. Mars Attacks subverts it in every scene.",Mars Attacks!

Otherwise it's just a good old jump in ""The Way Back Machine"" to see a litany of cameos or cheap parts by almost anyone who was famous in the mid-1990s. Though I do feel like most of the actors I liked were essentially wasted, but it is possible that was by design so the Martians could keep the focus for the majority of the movie.Rethinking on the movie almost makes me want a modernization, it has so many little quirks and nuances that really brings it to a special experience.

72,eric262003,A Cult Classic That's Fun To Watch,9,2 September 2021,"At first, I was a bit hesitant in watching Tim Burton's ""Mars! Attacks"" fearing that it'll be another box office failure like his other project, ""Ed Wood"". I didn't like the idea that he was letting money burn in front of him. When he made ""Ed Wood"", it had a multi-million budget and yet it sadly lost a lot on opening day. ""Mars Attacks!"" unfortunately met the same fate as well. It cost $80 million to make and failed its expectency to gross $120 million on its opening night. Well when you get a macabre twisted-minded director Tim Burton, you have to expect the unexpected. Even though it didn't fare well at the box office, in later years it developed into a cult classic with a nice blend of dark humour, nihilistic satire, and an exciting alein invasion story that pays homage to the old 1950's sci-fi films. Unlike the other alien invasion film ""Independence Day"", this one is strictly parody and where suspending your disbelief is mandatory.""Mars Attacks!"" commences when a herd of cattle in flames lands in a small American town and then a flying saucer is captured with the question if whether or not they're peaceful visitors, or are they here with evil intentions? After landing in a Nevada desert, the Martians are acquainted by President James Dale (Jack Nicholson) and other nearby civilians, but soon after we discover that the alien creature's real intentions are to cause chaos, destruction and to end humanity. At first the President thinks it's all a bit of miscommunication and that the Alien Ambassador goes out of his way in his language by saying ""We come in peace"". However like we expected all along that was all just a rouse and next thing you know, the creatures start zapping everything and everyone even the President himself gets burned to a crisp.The madness doesn't end there. The film take great liberties with a side dish of unapologies about poking fun at those science-fiction films that dominated the theatres in the 1940's and 1950's with his own sick twists to it. The idea for the movie was based off of the ""Mars Attacks!"" Topp's cards that were abolished in the 1950's the film depends on slapstick humour, witty dialogue, surreal insanity, special effects and total annihilation. Many cast members get destroyed in this movie, but the funny thing is the various ways they meet their fate which takes a more cartoonish approach as opposed to the more gritty fate we see in other films of this particular genre. You'll be gasping in awe over Jason Stone (Michael J. Fox) as he reaches for 's hand. Or the eye-soring moment when a dog's head is transferred over Nathalie Lake's (Sarah Jessica Parker) body. The whole atmosphere of the movie is like something taken out of a comic-book.The cast choices were excellent like I had anticipated. Aside from playing a level-headed President, Nicholson was also amazing in another role as an opportunistic Vegas businessman, Art Land. Glenn Close was wonderful as as neurotic First Lady Marsha Dale. Annette Bening is amazing as spiritual hippie Barbara Land who's fixated on meeting the Martians. Danny DeVito shows his screen charisma as the Rude Gambler who tries to strike a deal with the aliens. Jim Brown turns in a reamakable performance as boxer Byron Williams who wants to take on the aliens. Fox and Parker were excellent as determined reporters. Lisa Marie was memorable as a gaunt looking alien who goes incognito to woo Press Secretary Jerry Ross (Martin Short). The real scene stealer is from Sylvia Sidney as elderly woman Florence Norris who becomes the unsung hero of the day.The creature design of the aliens are quite impressive. They are green in complexion with skeletal bodies and inflated brains and have more advanced weaponry making humans the underdogs in their hostile takeover. They zap, destroy and kill, while having fun in the process. Their dialogue is incoherent and the only thing that comes out of their mouths are ""Ack! Ack! Ack!""If there is any weakness it would be that the early scenes with the aliens communicating starts to wear thin very quickly. In addition to that all that ""ack, ack"" stuff doesn't make them convince the audience that they are more superior to humans in terms of language. But once the carnage takes off, it goes by in a breeze. There are plenty of memorable quotes that will linger in my mind for a long time like when brainy child Richie Norris (Lukas Haas) tries to inerpret the alien's sign language, he claims he's giving the international sign of the donut. I also enjoyed President Dale's cheesy speech about ""why can't we all just get along""? Even singing legend Tom Jones confronting the aliens was funny just by the surrealism the whole movie contains.Sure it's not one of Tim Burton's best film, but the spoofs and homage it's based on exceeds anything we have seen from other outrageous films that are equally daring like ""Beetlejuice"" and ""Batman"". Burton knew he wasn't getting his money back on this movie, but he was having fun making this movie and in the end that's all that really matters.",Mars Attacks!
73,philip_vanderveken,Not for people who take Sci-Fi very serious (like for example Trekkie's),8,22 January 2005,"Mars Attacks probably has the same problem many other of Tim Burton's movies encounter. I guess many people don't really like it because they don't fully understand it. They take it all a bit too serious, while that's exactly something you shouldn't do with his movies. Personally I'm a fan of his work and I love the way he combines fantasy with comedy in this movie. Yes, it looks a bit like a spoof that has taken over the style of fifties movies and you definitely can't say this is a very subtle comedy, but it certainly works for me. It shows how the Martians come to Earth and first seem to be peaceful. But they aren't, in reality all they want is to conquer humanity and to claim the world as theirs.What you'll see is a president who can't even keep his family under control, but who still is convinced he's the most powerful man on earth, martians who can't stand the music of some crooner who's name I don't know (let's call him yodeling Zeke), a war loving general who thinks nuclear weapons are the answer to everything, a scientific adviser who is certain that the attack of the Martians is based on a misunderstanding (that must be the reason, because such a highly developed and intelligent culture can't be violent),... In fact, this movie was really entertaining, but shouldn't be taken too serious, even though this movie isn't even that far from the truth. Of course it magnifies everything at least 100 times, but there is some form of truth to be found in it. And I loved the way the Aliens looked like. Have you ever seen an Alien? No? Me neither, but does that mean we can't laugh with it? I don't see why not. I've seen many pictures of Aliens, but these certainly were the best and the funniest. However, if you think Sci-Fi is something that shouldn't be messed with, than I guess you better leave this movie alone, because you'll be very disappointed by it. On the other hand, if you are in for a good laugh, than I certainly recommend this movie. I give it a 7.5/10",Mars Attacks!
74,elliotjeory,Funny sci-fi film,7,10 August 2019,AAK AAK even though mars attacks! Is outdated its still funny. The aliens are freaky looking and there is some good actors in this although I didn't like Jack Nicholson as the drunk cowboy. A remake would be cool.,Mars Attacks!
75,Sergeant_Tibbs,Not the satire it wants to be.,4,10 July 2013,"Tim Burton's Mars Attacks! is a homage to 1950s sci-fi that fits in with the ensemble disaster films of the 1990s. I've always been a big fan of Tim Burton, his Big Fish was my first taste of what cinema could be, but even though this film was during the peak of his power, it's still a big let down. It has an insanely huge cast of talent with Jack Nicholson (in two roles), Glenn Close, Natalie Portman, Annette Bening, Michael J. Fox, Danny DeVito, Rod Steiger and many more, all given stock desires and conflicts with none particularly focused on and few resolved. The cast was why I watched it as well as the fact that it's on my watchlist from university in regards to music in film so it was worth watching in some regard but despite my low expectations it was still quite a disappointment.The first half is significantly better than the eye-rolling second, even though not much plot development is made. It's spent slowly setting up all the characters and humanity's reaction to martians. It's quite amusing at times, but never laugh out loud, feeling like it's completely comprised of the quirky side characters of Burton's other films and lacking the protagonist to root for. It's all pretty half decent for what it is, but unfortunately it has horrible and flat special effects which it relies on more than anything. Maybe it was the best of its kind at the time (though Independence Day in the same year was far superior), this is very primitive and most of the time it doesn't look like it belongs in the film's reality. Even some of the non-CGI effects are very poor. Perhaps this was more than Burton could handle or producers intervened, but it doesn't work and he should've tried for a stop motion or puppet effect.It does have some good elements. Danny Elfman's creative score is the biggest part of the homage to the 1950s sci-fi and that music plays a big theme in the story. While the score features the theremin prominently as the alien's signature sound, calling back to The Day The Earth Stood Still, it is the in film pseudo-country music that defeats the aliens. This suggests the idea, regarding pop culture, of what is now considered ordinary, the eeriness of the theremin over the country. However, contrivances in the script are very bothersome and ruin most of its execution. There's little sense of escalation from the first half to the second. It's the cringeworthy comedic and hokey moments in the second half that completely ruin the film and quickly wears out its welcome becoming one awful gag after the other that's doesn't feel like the satire it wants to be. A very weak effort for Burton.4/10",Mars Attacks!
76,MartianOctocretr5,Humorous intent marred by overdone brutality,6,15 August 2006,"Humorous parody of vintage '50's sci-fi movies, utilizing many of the plot devices so popular in that era. Many well known celebs joined in the fun for this clever satire, and most of them play devious, plotting, selfish, evil characters who you don't mind seeing getting vaporized on the business end of a ray gun blast. If the film had confined the violence to these degenerates, this ingenious parody would have been better off, but the wanton carnage is extended to innocents, the movie's one major weakness. Two cities, representing nests of human debris, Las Vegas and Washington DC, are the main targets for the Martian Creatures. The design of the invaders is delightfully absurd yet scary at the same time. Their motives are shown to be just as sinister as the Earthlings they are exterminating. They grin like idiots and chatter their only sentence in English, ""We are your friends"" as they annihilate victims with reckless abandon. Funny movie; could have been better if the violence had been limited to just the characters who had it coming.",Mars Attacks!

It waswell, as bad as the movies it was spoofing. Yet I watched the whole thing because I wondered what the gimmick would be that killed off the Martians. Earth viruses or bacteria a la ""The War of the Worlds""? Nuclear weapons? The milk of human kindness? Divine love? The cross of Christianity or the crescent of Islam? No DEVASTATING SPOILER TO COME!!!! BEWARE!!!!----->no, it was Country and Western music. I shuck you not.I am hereby revealing the ending and the funny, ha, ha gimmick as a public service so that you will not be seduced into watching this and thereby wasting what precious time you have left when you could be otherwise gainfully employed, say by playing along on the Game Network Channel or going to the ""Going Out of Business"" sales at Linens and Things or Circuit City or listening to Rush Limbaugh on the radio or Howard Stern, or even reading your spam emails.Yes, I did try to see the High Camp and appreciate the wonderful cast and realize that this a comedy and that I should chill out, have a little fun, laugh a little and don't be so High Brow. But I failed. Miserably. But one thing I did get out of this picture it is the answer to the trivia question: what was the worse movie that Jack Nicholson ever played in? That would be the same as the answer to the question What was the worse movie that Annette Bening ever played in?""Mars Bars Attack"" might have been better. Chocolate bars with guns a-blazing coming out of the flying saucers--now that might have been funny. Or not. And, by the way, everybody knows that in an alien movie with luscious alien babes, you never, but never, but never kiss her. But no, Martin Short has never seen an alien movie with luscious alien babes in it and so he tries a little tongue action with Lisa Marie and boy did he ever get burned!

78,Howlin Wolf,"Perhaps that's why I don't like it, I can't stand John Waters!",3,1 March 2001,"One reviewer compared this film to the style of John Waters. Aha! mystery solved! Now I know why I see so much I dislike in the movie.I had only seen two Waters films at the time of writing, ""Serial Mom"" (just about passable) and ""Cry-baby"" (awful) and fail to see why so many people love him. He seems like the Howard Stern (for those of you who don't know: American 'shock-jock') of modern American film, and resorting to cheap publicity shots like having someone eat dog feces, as he did in one film, fails to hide the fact that you're an incompetent film maker.Still, this is a comment on ""Mars Attacks!"", far and away Burton's weakest film. No, I didn't pop it in the VCR expecting a serious commentary on alien invasion, the publicity for the film should give you an idea of the kind of tone that the film adopts. What I did expect were some smart gags and an intelligent pastiche of '50's sci-fi. What I actually got was several big-name stars besmirching their previous work by reading lines from a script that didn't possess one solitary zinger...(SPOILER.)There was one great sight gag (where Michael J. Fox tries to grab the dog and the next shot shows just his hand) and that was it. Maybe I haven't seen enough cheesy sci-fi to appreciate it, but to my mind the best spoofs are the ones that are still funny even if you haven't seen what they are parodying (""Airplane!"" is a classic example, hilarious to me even though I haven't seen any of the ""Airport"" series which I believe was the inspiration)Burton's over-reliance on cross-reference to generate the laughs just points to serious script deficiencies, in my opinion. Lack of a faintly original take on the films he supposedly loves kills the movie. A shame, because I had high hopes for this before I watched it, and I like all of Tim Burton's other work. Chalk this one down to experience and go watch ""Beetlejuice""!",Mars Attacks!
79,oneguyrambling,Ack-Ack! Ack-Ack! Awful!,4,20 April 2012,"Mars Attacks sounds terrific on paper. A tongue in cheek alien attack film featuring a mega-cast of the past, present and futurely famous. Unfortunately most of them far better actors than this material deserves When the aliens – *AHEM* Martian-Americans – arrive, it is assumed that they must be intelligent beings who seek to share knowledge, and the President of the USA (Jack Nicholson) delightedly informs his nation of the breakthrough in inter-species relations.The fact that the Martians are 3 ½ foot tall and look like a skull with a massive exposed brain enclosed in a clear dome isn't at all offputting.The fact that they converse in a loud obnoxious ""ACK. ACK. ACK."" doesn't bother anyone.The fact that they kill the US Army General sent to formally welcome them, then lay waste to hundreds of onlookers desperate to be part of first contact is written off as a misunderstanding.Once the Martians take out an entire body of government, then set to eradicating the entire population, that fact becomes a little harder to swallow.But none of that should surprise the viewer of course, after all it is called 'Mars Attacks', not 'Mars drops in to say Hi'.The actual plot line is essentially irrelevant, which is why it matter not one iota that they gave it away in the title. What is supposed to matter is that Tim Burton has amassed a cadre of talent to act dumbfounded, outraged and perturbed at appropriate times in a film inspired by a set of bubblegum cards.Burton gleefully ignores standard cinema protocol and builds hero moments only to have the hero killed at the exact wrong point. He sets up scenes where love is about to find a way – then chuckles to himself when it doesn't.The film plays no favourites and obeys no conventions, the President of the US is no safer than singer Tom Jones, being Jack Nicholson doesn't make you any different from being Jack Black (in one of his first films – he's almost skinny here!).Meanwhile the Martians poke, prod and test their human captives, again with allegedly hilarious results, but might I say that Sarah Jessica Parker actually looks new and improved sporting a dog's head? My main gripe is this: I know that this is all delightfully silly and deliberately juvenile stuff, but that doesn't make it entertaining or somehow more worthy of merit. The fact that Burton set out to make a dumb film shouldn't be seen as a positive, if anything he should be flogged for wasting his considerable talents on this indulgent crap.I know that many viewers with 'mainstream' tastes see Mars Attacks as acceptable as they want to embrace and enjoy something silly, and feel they can only do so if said film is made by a man universally acknowledged as an 'eccentric genius'.I also know that many cinema aficionados and Burton acolytes see Mars Attacks as Tim Burton thumbing his nose to those same mainstream lemmings.But know this. Regardless of who made Mars Attacks, who starred in it and why it was made; it is a laugh free, amateurish snoozefest, with a severe docking in score for the persistent stream of trite and misguided jokes and alleged sightgags and less entertainment value than a Saturday morning cartoon.If Tim Burton wants to be all ironic and indulgent, let him do it on his own time. On behalf of Earth, I apologise to any extra-terrestrial beings who think we humans see this as 'entertainment'.Final Rating – 4.5 / 10. I dislike Mars Attacks more for what it is supposed to be than what it is. But with the cast, the budget and the talent behind the scenes, this should have been so much more than a childish and plain stupid vanity project.I'd rather watch Battle: Los Angeles 5 times in a row – with the sound way up – than sit through this again.",Mars Attacks!

""This looks like a good photo-op for me, should I be down there?""These two lines sets what makes Mars Attacks tolerable for me.With all the big names, and the marketing behind this to be a ""blockbuster"", I think this film was given more credit than what it deserved to be -- and that was a funny film based on 50's martian movies.I laugh at this film more NOW than I did then..because I was caught up in the hype that never should have happened..and the stars that never shoulda been in it..or the script that had way too much put into it.Hindsight is 20/20 and the reason I find this movie so funny now is because it reminds me so much of America's current Bush Administration. The lines coming out of Jack Nicholson's mouth, as he played the President, is funny as all heck.But Jack Nicholson playing the shark..well, that part could have been left on the editing room floor. As well as Annette Benning's Role, but Annette should have played Sarah Jessica Parker's role (and visa versa really...) with a more meatier and more developed script. Martin Short's role had promise and just went the wacky-stupid route which was unfortunate. Michael J. Fox's role was hilarious but very one dimentional which is sad. Pam Grier and Jim Brown were almost lost in this film. Little things like this is what makes the film unbearable at times.But in the here and now.. as I watch the late Rod Steiger role, I find it was a preminition of things to come. It was fabulous. That as well as Jack Black's small role. Paul Winfield and his role is in this mix as well, when looking at his roll  with what is going on today..you can't help but laugh at all of this and then wonder..oh my goodness!I had a problem with the Martians...I dunno. I kinda wish they were more like the Kanamits from the old Twilight Zone's favorite, ""To Serve Man"". Or maybe something more ""out there"". Ack, Ack....is just how I felt about them even though it was Topps cards these were based on.The ending..yikes!!! Tim Burton's work, which I've always enjoyed, went over the deep end here..and I don't know why. But that doesn't mean this film cannot be enjoyed. You just have to be in a different mindframe to do so.Problems? Well...too many big names, an uneven script, silly looking Martians, horrid ending, but a few nice shots about the workings of Washington, DC, the TV industry...is all you'll get from this.",Mars Attacks!
83,IonicBreezeMachine,"Not quite parody not quite homage, Tim Burton's adaptation of the cult classic Topps trading cards has a lot of energy and effort, but not much weight or substance.",5,30 September 2021,"When a Martian fleet of lying saucers approach the Earth their arrival is witnessed and reacted to by many across the United States. From the upper echelons the American government with President James Dale (Jack Nicholson), science advisor Professor Donald Kessler (Pierce Brosnan) to residents of the flyover states like Richie Norris (Lukas Haas) and his eclectic family of uneducated weirdos (save for his grandmother). The Martians' arrival quickly goes from point of curiosity to unstoppable rampage of destruction as the Martians use their bizarre otherworldly weaponry to destroy humanity.First introduced in 1962 by longstanding trading card company Topps, Mars Attacks! Was a set of 55 individual cards (54 image cards and one checklist) that told the story of an invasion by Mars detailing their attacks utilizing unearthly weapons and genetically enhanced giant bugs until remnants of Earth's armed forces launched a counter attack on Mars resulting in humanity's victory and destruction of Mars. The cards were immensely popular with children but parental, educator, and government outrage at the cards depictions of over the top violence as well as implied sexuality (particularly with card #17 ""Beauty and the Beast"") lead to the line being removed from the market. Despite launching and ending within in year, the cards are fondly remembered for their beautiful artwork that evoked the covers of pulp novels and took inspiration from the b-rate sci-fi schlock of the day involving flying saucers and giant insects. An initial attempt at a feature film adaptation had been attempted by cult filmmaker Alex Cox in 1985 but never got off the ground. Mars Attacks was brought to the attention of Tim Burton fresh off his critically acclaimed biopic of Ed Wood and saw Mars Attacks as an opportunity to make a big budget Ed Wood type movie with an A-list. The movie was released in December of 1996, 6 months after another alien invasion film, Independence Day, depicted a near identical story except played straight. Mars Attacks ended up underperforming with both critics and audiences and was Burton's first real misfire since his mainstream directing career began with Pee-Wee's Big Adventure (art house numbers of Ed Wood notwithstanding). While Mars Attacks has developed a cult following with people who appreciate its core joke of an A-List cast in service of B-rate material, I myself enjoy individual parts of Mars Attacks, but not enough to wholly recommend it.It'd be pretty pointless to critique Mars Attacks on the basis of plot, narrative, or internal logic because from the outset with its purposefully cheesy soundtrack by Danny Elfman (that is quite good at evoking memories of 1950s sci-fi), to its firmly antiquated designs are inspired by the likes of Earth vs The Flying Saucers or This Island Earth, Mars Attacks wears its goofiness with pride in its writing, production design, and its effects. Technically speaking Mars Attacks gives the perfect feeling of watching a 1950s B-Rate alien invasion film given an A level cast and budget and there's lots of little details sprinkled throughout you can trace back to other films of its ilk such as the Martian leader's video message that is staged almost identically in lighting and presentation to The Amazing Criswell's introduction of Plan 9 From Outer Space or the effect to bring Sarah Jessica Parker and Pierce Brosnan's severed heads to life in homage to something like The Brain that Wouldn't Die.Unfortunately where Mars Attacks stumbles is in its presentation where it lacks the irony to be funny enough to be parody, but it also doesn't have enough substance to serve as a homage with every character written as a puddle deep archetype broadly delivered in the most exaggerated manner possible. Mars Attacks is in the same category of chaotic darkly comic nonsense like Gremlins, Critters, Tremors, or Buckaroo Banzai but it doesn't have the grounding needed to make its premise come to life. While movies like Gremlins and Critters were silly, they also had focus developing central characters so we had a grounding element to bounce off against the oddness and havoc of the Gremlins or Crites. I think Burton didn't really understand the approach to material like this and the film probably would've benefitted from a director like Sam Raimi, Joe Dante, or Ron Underwood of the first Tremors film who were able to create grounded characters in strange scenarios. While Tim Burton is known for his odd eccentric style with stuff like Beetlejuice, Edward Scissorhands, or his Batman films, he's really not capable of creating grounded characters unless it's a situation like the Maitlands from Beetlejuice where their relatively blank slate status as characters was used to contrast against both the undead world and the obnoxious and tacky Deetz family. It's not helped that movie really doesn't get going until about 70 minutes in and actually starts resembling the events on the trading cards with giant robots and destruction of buildings. The opening 70 minutes are meandering and directionless with no one really taking the Martians all that seriously and we basically get variations on the same points over and over again such as Nicholson's calm to a fault President who tries to keep the public calm with FDR-esque fireside chats only to have his comforting words blow up in his face every time. Somewhat funny at first, but less funny upon repeated use.Mars Attacks is the kind of movie you'll either appreciate for its absurdity or scratch your head in confusion. It's high camp on a high budget, but it never goes into full on parody nor does it try to play itself with much weight either hovering somewhere between parody and homage without really satisfying either side of the spectrum. It's pretty pointless to pick apart Mars Attacks on any level be it storytelling, acting, or technical specs because it's pretty much critic proof where you can say it's weird and stupid, but the movie knows it's weird and stupid so any criticism you levy at it will be like you're just describing the movie. I can't tell you if you'll like this movie or not, it'll depend entirely on what your definition of ""enjoyable"" entails.",Mars Attacks!
84,hnt_dnl,"Not some cult classic, just plain awful",1,15 August 2021,"I saw MARS ATTACKS (1996) back when it first came out and thought it was awful then and it's still awful! This is probably the only stain on Tim Burton's 20th century filmography as everything else he did back then like Beetlejuice, the 2 Batman movies starring Miichael Keaton, , Sleepy Hollow, Edward Scissorhands, A Nightmare Before Chiristmas, and still to this day his best film Ed Wood (which should have won Best Picture) were all certified classics and hits and are a testament to his gothic, horror movie style. Mars Attacks is odd man out.This movie is so corny and cheesy with an all-star cast embarrassing themselves either mugging for the camera or being just plain dull. There's this weird dichotomy where it feels like 2 movies. On the one hand, you have Glenn Close, who plays the First Lady, makes goofy facial expressions versus the other where Lukas Haas is the awkward ""edgy 90s teens"" character. No character was interesting or memorable. In fact, the casting for this movie is weird. You have an iconic actor like Jack Nicholson, but then you have Pierce Brosnan at the start of his tenure as James Bond immediately after he'd just done the great Goldeneye, then there's a super young Natalie Portman right of the heels of the controversial film The Professional, but also Martin Short. Who is ironically one of the few comic actors in this, but I've never found him funny.The intentional over-the-top humor is humorless. The movie is just so silly and unfunny that it amazes me that the movie-going world is now re-assessing this mess as a cult classic. Is it simply because it's 90s Tim Burton and everything else he did in that decade was a hit? I mean, even though his 21st century body of work has been trash, that doesn't mean that he didn't have a stinker in the 20th century and he most definitely did with Mars Attacks!",Mars Attacks!
85,Beta_Gallinger,"A silly, over-the-top sci-fi comedy, one which has improved each time I've seen it",8,16 February 2011,"This is a Tim Burton film which was made as homage to the sci-fi B-movies of the 1950's. I first saw it in 2006, I guess just a little less than ten years after its release, and during my first viewing, I thought it was pretty bad, even though I hadn't thought that way about any Burton films I had seen before this one! However, I think it was only about 24 hours after that when I watched it for the second time, this time with a slightly better understanding of what the idea of the film was. With that second viewing, I still didn't think it was great, but certainly did find it to be better than I previously had. About four and a half years after those two viewings, I have now seen it for the third time, and this viewing turned out to be even better than the second.Many flying saucers come from Mars and surround planet Earth! The President of the United States, James Dale, is eager to announce this historical event to the country, and when he does, it obviously excites many people. The first of these spaceships lands in the Nevada desert, where a meeting has been set up. Many military personnel and civilians have gathered to witness this landing, and the Martians that come out of the ship are greeted by General Casey. According to a universal translator, these beings claim to have come in peace, and in response to this, a hippie in the crowd releases a dove. However, one of the Martians shoots this dove down while it's flying, and then the extraterrestrials kill many people who are present at this gathering, using laser guns that leave nothing but bones! It is possible that this incident was a ""cultural misunderstanding,"" but this possibility is ruled out when more Martian attacks take place, making it clear that all these creatures want to do is destroy! There are lots of characters in this film, and a very talented cast to play them. Jack Nicholson plays President James Dale, and also plays a more minor character named Art Land. Unsurprisingly, his talent and usual wry style help with the quality of ""Mars Attacks!"" Glenn Close, Pierce Brosnan, Martin Short, Danny DeVito, Sarah Jessica Parker, etc. also help make the cast as a whole a strong one. As a comedy, this movie isn't usually hilarious, but I still often laughed lightly, and found some occasional big laughs. Most of Press Secretary Jerry Ross' (Martin Short) encounter with a Martian disguised as an Earth woman may not be among the strongest points, but the outcome is perhaps one of the funniest parts of the film! The over-the-top Martians can provide a lot of the humour. To add to the entertainment value, this sci-fi comedy also has many scenes that are bound to have viewers in suspense, plus the special effects and the set design for the inside of the Martian spaceship are very nice to look at.This film came out the same year as ""Independence Day"", a more popular alien invasion movie, but I personally think that one is overrated and this one is underrated. I actually wasn't impressed with the Roland Emmerich blockbuster at all when I finally saw it all for the first time last year, and think this Tim Burton film is SO much better! If you ask me, this one has better cast performances (nobody here is anything like Randy Quaid as Russell Casse in the other film or those who play that character's offspring, thank goodness), more outstanding characters, and I guess a more entertaining plot. Another reason why ""Mars Attacks!"" is far superior is perhaps because ""Independence Day"" takes itself too seriously, which this other alien invasion film of 1996 certainly doesn't. I'm giving this sci-fi comedy an 8/10, even though I've given the same rating to more than one other film directed by Tim Burton which I've found to be better.

I don't get it, sometimes, when a movie doesn't take things seriously, people misjudge it as a bad flick. Some of the victims of this misjudging are B-movies. Lots of B-movies get misjudged because they are often times considered as campy, and thus leading to less-than-average ratings. I don't know about some critics, but ""Mars Attacks!"" is a great parody of 50's B-alien invasion movies. I loved MARS ATTACKS! the first time I saw it, and it gets better in every subsequent viewing. MARS ATTACKS! is an odd acquired taste that literally grows on you. This film was probably Tim's second tribute to inept B-filmmaker Edward ""Ed Wood"" D. Jr (The first was 1994's ""Ed Wood""). He really spent a big-budget, to make it look like a ""low-budget"" B-movie. The costumes and sets inside the Martians' flying saucers resemble that of Stanley Kubrick's ""A Clockwork Orange"" or Wood's ultra low-budgeted ""Plan 9 from Outer Space"". It seems Burton himself has become Wood himself. Then again, what better way to pay homage to someone than to be that someone yourself, right? In a way, Burton has a lot of fun with all of this.MARS ATTACKS! is a witty well-done B-movie. Just as the big-headed, slimy-brained Martians, Burton goes ""to-hell-with-it"" and goes wild with it. The first hour, which plays like an Irwin Allen disaster movie row-call, is the weaker half of the film, but it creates a sarcastic view of humanity and pop culture while faithfully pokes fun at the naivety and foolishness of B-movie characters that it still works. In the second act, Burton literally goes wild; blowing everything up and throwing witty homages to every B-movie cliché in the book. It's not for all tastes, but anyone who has a bizarre taste for camp cinema will surely treasure MARS ATTACKS! It can be said that, if Ed Wood had the budget, PLAN 9 would have looked just like this. Rating: ****1/2 out of 5.",Mars Attacks!
87,gftbiloxi,Just What The Hell Was That Anyway?,5,3 February 2008,"Suggested by a series of kiddie trading cards deemed so subversively violent that they were pulled from the market, MARS ATTACKS! is a film that tends to divide viewers into ""love it"" and ""hate it"" camps. Those who love it enjoy its mix of homage and originality and its remarkably black sense of humor. Those who hate it feel that the humor becomes so black that it descends into a sort of lowbrow meanspiritedness that undermines any amusement involved. Strange to say, they're both right.The story is the classic ""alien invasion"" tale given increasingly weird twists. The United States decides to construe the arrival of a Martian fleet of flying saucers as a friendly arrival--but alas, the Martians have a sense of humor so distasteful that a herd of drunken frat boys look like Noel Coward in comparison. Cattle catch fire and stampede! Heads are switched with pet dogs! Congress is wiped out by ray gun! Can a highly unnatural pairing of Slim Whitman and Tom Jones save the day? Well, you never know.The film is rife with sight-gags, and when they work they work go off with a bang--with the Las Vegas scenes the high point of the film. It is true that the Martians are a tacky bunch, but it's hard to be tackier than Vegas, and director Tim Burton successfully works the joke to the nth degree. Trouble is, the rest of the film isn't at quite same level. It's presented as a joke, but it's hard to laugh when the residents of a retirement home are reduced to wheelchair-bound skeletons. MARS ATTACKS reaches for laugh after laugh, but too often the reach is funny and the pay off isn't.The film has a host of actors, some famous, some infamous, and some just plain camp. Jack Nicholson does double duty as President of the United States and a Las Vegas promoter; Glenn Close scores as the First Lady; Lisa-Marie is weirdly snakey as the ""Martian Girl;"" and Sylvia Sidney is memorable as the semi-senile Granny armed with Slim Whitman records. There are a lot more: Rod Steiger, Pierce Brosman, Sarah Jessica Parker, Pam Greer, and so on, and most of them are as hit and miss as the film itself. I have to confess an unexpected liking for Tom Jones, who dives into the thing feet first and proves a lot fun. But it's the look and style that carry the thing, and it's all very ""What the hell was that?"" The DVD is truly no frills, although it does contain a few ""Martian"" jokes that are (somewhat like the film) more annoying than actually funny. Recommended as a curiosity and with the warning that you should rent it before you buy it: if you love it, you'll be more than ready to whip out the cash, but if you hate it, you'll grit your teeth for having spent a dime.GFT, Amazon Reviewer",Mars Attacks!
88,Stampsfightclub,Misinterpreted? Unlikely. Unusually bad Burton makes big let down,2,21 July 2009,"The US government receives intelligence from outer space that aliens from Mars are coming to earth, which soon spells disaster for the entire world.Tim Burton, director, producer and writer. An artist. Edward Scissorhands, Beetle Juice and Batman, are all loved and praised to this day. Jack Nicholson: Chinatown, Cuckoo's Nest, Easy Rider. Oscar winner. All these lists sadly mean little when you sit back in your comfy chair in the evening to watch a cool sci-fi film for the first time by two of the biggest names in the business, and you are left wishing you had taken an early night.Roland Emmerich's smash Independence Day a few months previously was an outstanding collaboration of up and coming stars that brought visual effects and stunning cinematography to a whole new appreciation. Mars Attacks could not compete, even if it was released before.Burton's picture is disappointing on numerous factors. For me, I have come to really love and appreciate his work. The darkness and simplicity of his stories and directional style make him unique in this competitive business and so I have a high expectancy for each of his works. So this 1996 release was disappointing as it copied a previous release almost word for word and the darkness and strangeness of his previous smashes were left out. Another factor for the film's bombing is the positing of the story against the situation. For example when the aliens first arrive there are TV reporter's standing on their caravans giving exceptionally bad speeches to the world. And none of this generates realism and is simply awful positing from a director who should really have known better.The story has been discussed numerous times over the years. Having looked on the IMDb discussion board it seems many find this a stab at other star driven Blockbusters. If that is the case, then the whole spoof concept is amazingly inaccurate as it tries to be real sci-fi and frightening. Encoding issues of alcoholism and business dealings, not to mention an embarrassing look at sex from Martin Short, makes the whole thing weighed down with impossible objectives that it would never have filled.Nicholson, Close, Brosnan, Bening and Fox may have had some astounding films in the past but none of their achievements are worthy of association with this consistently bad picture. Nicholson has actually never been so flat and uninteresting.In comparison to Independence Day, Mars Attacks revolves around aliens coming to earth and attempt a take over. But oddly this intentional comedy is less funny than the Will Smith star maker. Plus these effects are soft whereas the other is spellbinding.Remember 1977 when Star Wars broke minds? Remember the Phantom Menace? That was the biggest disappointment in Sci-Fi history. For me, seeing Burton and Nicholson subjected to an ordinary plot with unfunny intentions is the biggest disappointment",Mars Attacks!
89,KnightsofNi11,"Great spoof, no matter how silly it gets",7,31 August 2011,"I you're a sci-fi fan you might like this film, you might not. If you're a Tim Burton fan you might like this film, or you might not. I you're a fan of mixed genre films you might like this film, you might not. Personally, I really liked this wacky little flick. Mars Attacks! is a spoof of 1950's sci-fi movies, poking fun at all their cheese and cliché. It centers around a variety of characters spread out amongst the USA and how they all react and cope with a martian invasion. There's nothing in this film to take seriously and, for what it's worth, I found it to be hilarious and a ridiculous amount of fun, no matter how stupid it can be.Mars Attacks! is, in a way, genius. It is the kind of movie that is designed in such a way that you can't critique it. You can dislike it, or even hate it, but you can't necessarily critique it on any specific element. The reason being is that it spoofs a genre and a time period for that genre, so anything that is cheesy, silly, or stupid can be accredited to the film's spoofing. If a character does something irrational and idiotic, it is spoofing the way characters were in so many of those cheesy 50's flicks. If something totally bizarre and unbelievable happens in the plot, blame it on the genre the film is spoofing. This kind of manipulations practically falls under the category of film treachery, but I have to give the film credit for finding a loophole around any and all imperfections.And as far as imperfections go, Mars Attacks! has a lot of them. It is a ridiculous, absurd, unrealistic, and plot hole ridden film. Half of it makes no sense and the other half we just sort of have to go with. But the brilliant thing is, that's all part of the fun. This film isn't made to take seriously, and neither is it made to be criticized and scrutinized. It is meant to be enjoyed and only aims to be silly and entertaining. Some will see it as an uncreative way to force us to enjoy this movie, I see it as an opportunity to have a great time and numerous laughs.Another thing I have to give Mars Attacks! plenty of props for is production value. The film rounds up an all star cast of characters with everyone from Danny DeVito to Jack Black. It is also just a large scale flick with lots of great actions sequences with plenty of explosions and giant collapsing buildings. The martians themselves are completely CGI. They look cool to me but I'm unsure if the CGI would be considered good or bad for 1996. I would have to go back and compare it to other special effects of the 90's. The film may looks cheesy but, once again, that just goes back to the fact that everything about this film is cheesy because that is what it is spoofing. But when you think about it, a good amount of money and construction went into making this film as exciting and big budget cheesy as possible, and for that I have to commend it.Mars Attacks! isn't what you would call a high quality film, but that doesn't stop it from being pretty damn fun. I couldn't stop myself from laughing at the cheesiness, the irony, and the satire that is littered throughout this film. I see this is a great use of satire, and it is a spoof film that I can actually stand to watch, and that's saying a lot considering my alternatives would be Epic Movie or Vampires Suck. Mars Attacks! accomplishes what it sets out to do, and so I had a really great time with it.",Mars Attacks!

Get out of here, quick! Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh! Let's work our way through these top stars, shall we - Jack Nicholson is the coolest actor in Hollywood. Natalie Portman is the starlet of her generation. Glenn Close possesses such a prominent prestige. Annette Bening is peppy and very fine. The smart and sleek Pierce Brosnan who is oh so dashing. The greatly adored Michael J. Fox. America's Sweetheart, Sarah Jessica Parker. Danny DeVito, don't count him out. The strong and sexy Pam Grier. The endearingly hilarious Martin Short, who is so endearingly hilarious. The largely exuberant Jack Black. The rambunctiously sweet Christina Applegate. The greatest man in Vegas, Tom Jones. And the greatest football running-back, Jim Brown. Not too shabby, and you might even recognize a few more familiar faces.Let's work our way through their performances, shall we - Nicholson is purely Jack, 'nough said. Natalie Portman is too good. Close can overact with the best of 'em. Bening is endlessly appealing as a free spirit. Mr. Brosnan insists on pleasing. Michael J. Fox is really good at summoning his inner jerk. Sarah J. is too intelligent to act so witless. DeVito is noticeable even among the biggest stars. Pam Grier is openly big-hearted as she strengthens her legacy as an actress. Marty Short bares a comical confidence. Jack Black has a lot to give and seems preparing for fame. Christina Applegate is briefly buoyant. Tom Jones should stick to singing. And Jim Brown is actually pretty darn decent, he steals the spotlight.Mars Attacks! has good effects, considerable entertainment value, and it is pieced together nicely. Tim Burton loves to take every opportunity to delve into the dark arts, but his talents are best served on the lighter side, case in point, this and Edward Scissorhands.",Mars Attacks!
91,The_Movie_Cat,Stupid Stupid Stupid,4,22 April 2000,"Completely dumb comedy that is saved from being offensively unfunny only by virtue of it's good-naturedness.Not that the good-naturedness extends that far: violence, mutilation and graphic destruction permeate the movie. I cannot really slate Mars Attacks! as there are people that enjoy this kind of humour, and I must accept that ""screwball"" comedies are very amusing to some people. Personally if I see John Candy on a screen I tend to switch over, but I gave this one a go.Of course, it's all just a jokey satire on 50s B-Movies, but then satire implies wit. This is really lame, with stars like Jack Nicholson and Tom Jones sending themselves up rotten. Yet such stars already walk a tightrope between credibility and self-parody anyway, so there's really no need to send themselves up. It's like Arnold Schwarzennegger hamming it up in one of his ""comedies"" - Arnie, people laugh at you anyway, you don't need to try.I did laugh at Mars Attacks! - well, twice. Once when the fictitious boxer Byron Williams gets reminded by Art Land (Nicholson, unfunny) of his bout in ""The Quaker In Jamaica"". I also chuckled when the Martians first started to explode upon hearing Slim Whitman. The first time, anyway. Fifty times later and the ""joke"" had started to wear a bit thin.But it all seems such a waste. The budget was $70 million, yet the CGI effects already look cheap. But the excess of underused talent here is shocking. I don't know, maybe it's just me, but seeing Rod Steiger sacrifice his dignity by being shrunk to microscopic size, paraphrasing Winston Churchill and then being stamped on by a Martian seems a disrespectful moment. Pierce Brosnan gives a better performance here than he ever does as James Bond, though if seeing his disembodied head talking to Sarah Jessica Parker's on the body of a dog makes you laugh, then watch this. Personally I found it witless, charmless and pathetic.Also notable is the sheer disregard for the totty on display. Christina Applegate (the randy daughter from ""Married With Children"") is here, though is only in a single scene, while Natalie Portman only gets to deliver occasional one-liners. Many national monuments are destroyed - The Houses of Parliament in England; The Eiffel Tower in France; The Taj Mahal in India; yet patriotically The White House is left virtually unscathed. And the joke with Mount Rushmore was done much better in Superman II.Actors that are normally amusing, such as Danny DeVito, are encouraged to overact, as are all the cast, obliterating any essence of humour. Ultimately, it seems the sort of film that all the cast and crew had a real hoot making, yet fails to translate to the audience. Desperate and painfully unfunny.",Mars Attacks!

93,itamarscomix,A wild ride,7,9 October 2005,"Though it's certainly not among Tim Burton's greatest works, Mars Attacks! is, in many ways, the perfect follow-up to his masterpiece Ed Wood, because it's a direct homage to every trashy sci-fi B-movie from the 40's, 50's and 60's, and Mr. Wood's own works are high on that list. It's a common error that Mars Attacks! was intended as a spoof on Independence Day, which was a huge hit that very same year, and was in fact produced and filmed simultaneously; of course, Mars Attacks! spoofs the very same films that Independence Day paid homage to, even if, as many have already noted, it's actually officially based on trading cards from the late 60's, which inspired the way the Martians look. In Mars Attacks! Mr. Burton shows the kind of pop-culture sensitivity we're more accustomed to seeing in Quentin Tarantino's work, with relatively very little of his own vision and motives in it; he does a master job of copying the style of the horrible films he loved so much as a child, and so even though it's his least personal film  to that point, that is  there's also quite a bit of him in it, though not in the way that we're used to from Edward Scissorhands, Ed Wood and even Batman.Tim Burton lets himself loose on Mars Attacks! like no other movie since Pee Wee's Big Adventure. It's strictly visual comedy, and just like Pee Wee's Big Adventure and Beetlejuice, the success of the film is first and foremost due to his direction, and very little thanks to the script, which is minimal and quite simplistic. Burton gathered an all-star cast which includes Jack Nicholson, Glenn Close, Jack Black, Lisa Marie, Rod Steiger, Annette Bening, Michael J. Fox, Denny DeVito, Pierce Brosnan, Sarah Jessica Parker, Jim Brown, Martin Short, Pam Grier, Natalie Portman and Tom Jones in a fantastic performance as himself, and with the help of that cast he created what may just be his most outright hilarious comedy, which is also a clever and subtle parody. It's not essential viewing but it's one hell of a wild ride and probably Tim Burton's most easily accessible work.",Mars Attacks!

95,bellino-angelo2014,"Hysterical, wacky and irriverent... and underrated!",8,5 February 2021,"I have always loved this movie since the first time I saw it (June 2012). During these years I rewatched it a few times and I always liked it the same way I liked it when I saw it for the first time. I also think that this movie is very underrated because here on IMDB it has 6,3 and both many positive reviews and many negative reviews. When I look at the many negative reviews I do think that they don't get the sense of this movie as this is pretty much a satire on how politics treats their enemies and also a parody on 1950s' science movies. And the fact I re-watched it at least 5 times says a lot!The movie is about some Martians that comes on Earth for invading it. I already said the plot because what follows it's a series of hilarious vignettes involving many characters and the Martians. I'll tell some: when the Martians arrive in the Utah desert they start their killing spree and kill the news reporters and private Billy Glenn Norris (Jack Black); when the president James Dale (Jack Nicholson) is isolated in the bunker has a discussion with General Decker (Rod Steiger) and screams ''SHUT UUUUUP! SHUT UP SHUT UP SHUT UUP!'' It makes roll from laughter every time; When the night before the president receives a call from the President of France then we see the aliens that attack with laser guns all the French politics and outside we see the Eiffel Tower fall in crumbles; the nuclear attack to Mars fails and then we see scenes of the Martians that destroys all of Earth's major monuments (including the Rushmore Mountain, the Taj Mahal, some huge Las Vegas casinos and others).Now tell me, are those scenes funny? YES a LOT!The cast does a great job. Jack Nicholson is probably the best of all the big names in the cast in a dual role. As the President is so loud and irritable in his outbursts that it makes me laugh a lot every time! Annette Bening is my other favourite performer in the movie as she looks so gorgeous despite being a recovering alcoholic. Jack Black, Danny de Vito, Rod Steiger, Pierce Brosnan, Michael J Fox and few others give good supporting performances as well. The soundtrack is the second great thing of this movie since it fits like a glove what happens in the movie. And it's also very catchy in spots. The special effects are very cool for 1996 standards and they didn't aged a lot IMO since they look so realistic.I think that I have said all that I had inside my chest about this movie and won't say a lot anymore. I would suggest to anyone who hasn't seen it... Watch it!!! It's so funny and hilarious that you will even forget the time spent watching it and it's the perfect movie for a lazy afternoon.",Mars Attacks!

There's no doubt about it that audiences will be torn between those who enjoyed the film (the comedy) and those who hated it. This film is a parody of other Earth-invasion films, such as 'Independence Day' and 'War of the Worlds', which have been a common theme in story-telling for decades and particularly in the 1950s. In this film, the aliens are content on destroying Earth and humiliating the humans for the sake of it.

98,FloatingOpera7,Comedy Films Of The 90's: Mars Attacks!,10,1 June 2006,"Mars Attacks! (1996): Starring Jack Nicholson, Glenn Close, Annette Bening, Martin Short, Natalie Portman, Pierce Brosnan, Sarah Jessica Parker, Michael J. Fox, Danny Devito, Rod Steiger, Pam Grier, Tom Jones, Christina Applegate, Jack Black, Paul Winfield. Director Tim Burton, Screenplay Jonathan Gems.At first glance, Mars Attacks is a hilarious and colorful spoof of ""Independence Day"" (1995), but it also parodies science fiction/flying saucer films of the 1950's. While audiences generally disliked this comedy, no where else will you find a genuinely funny and fun film that boasts a cast of Hollywood icons like Danny Devito, Jack Nicholson, Glenn Close, Annette Bening, Martin Short, Pierce Brosnan, Pam Grier and Michael J. Fox, who are each straying from their usual repertoire and doing some good, zany, offbeat comedy. The premise: A race of funny-looking aliens who talk like ducks come to earth, betray a peace pact with humans and begin to rain destruction over dozens of cities, including Las Vegas. Alien specialist Barbara Land (Annette Bening) welcomes the aliens along with her hippie-like, New Age, alien enthusiast friends. Jack Nicholson portrays the President, in a role that he is clearly having fun with. Glenn Close, also, is having fun in the role of the First Lady. Natalie Portman, not yet a well-known actress, plays their daughter Taffy Dale. Martin Short plays Jerry Ross the Press Secretary who in a memorably humorous scene attempts to seduce an alien who has assumed the shape of a beautiful, tall striking woman with a beehive hairdo. Sarah Jessica Parker portrays Nathalie, a news reporter covering the invasion, who is in a relationship with political activist Jason Stone (Michael J. Fox). Nathalie falls for the brilliant and sexy Professor Donald Kessler (Pierce Brosnan) and both become victims of the alien's transformation power, so that for much of the film we see Sarah Jessica Parker's head on the body of a dog and the head of Pierce Brosnan inside a glass container. It's hilarious! Pam Grier, taking on the tough black girl/single mother persona she does so well, portrays Louise Williams whose husband is in the army and an obvious black G.I.Joe type of guy. Sure, much of this is outlandish, cartoonish and appears to cater to child-like audiences, but it's an entertaining movie nonetheless. And although no one saw it at the time, this movie paved the way for the more successful space alien comedies Men In Black. Mars Attacks is well-written, with characters who, although flat and straight out of comic books, are interesting. You have to be able to suspend disbelief in order to enjoy this movie and you have to be willing to lose yourself in the laughter, as this is the kind of film that depends on visual and spoken comedy. This is a document of comedy films of the 1990's, but the kind of comedy that is specifically targeting a demographic- younger, fans of alien invasion movies and fans of good comedy.",Mars Attacks!

Nicholson is pretty good in his dubble role and Tom Jones has a funny part... that's about it.Oh and I thought of one good joke, when Portman says something like 'it wasn't the doves', when the aliens strike for the second time... but for the rest, as I said, bleh...3/10.",Mars Attacks!

Though I might be wrong about that commercial part.But anyway, here's the deal: Mars Attacks! is hilarious parody from all those sci-fi flicks where aliens in their flying saucers come to take on the world just for the heck of it. And in this case it really, REALLY is for the heck of it: the martians have the most sickest sense of the humor in the whole universe. Hence forth the movie is mainly a black comedy, which actually is not anything new for Tim Burton. So thats the plot. Detrcution of the world, in hilarious manner.So the cast, ah, what a wonderful cast. Jack Nicholson in double role as the president of U.S.A and as a sleazy casino owner Art Land. Pierce Brosnan as Donald Kessler, a scientist, who is sure about peaceful (hah) purposes of the martians. Sarah Jessica Parker as bimbo reporter Natalie Lake, Michael J. Fox as her rival/boyfriend Jason Stone. and numerous of other small parts for Danny DeVito, Natalie Portman etc. It really is a fireworks of talented actors. Music is made by Danny Elfman, as it usually is in Burton film, and it fits like a glove in the quirky atmosphere of the movie. And Burtons direction is sturdy and good, or at least it is better than his direction was in Planet of The Apes.Special effects are decent. They don't blow your mind, but then again I have a feeling, that if all the computer animation was done today, the movie would still look exactly the same: cheaply made sci-fi flick. That is the style and it works well.But, the reason I cannot give this movie a better score is the overall plot, which does cut some curves and has some scenes that just don't work as good as the rest of the movie.

101,Dan1863Sickles,Let's Watch The Squares Burn!,3,11 March 2021,"It's fascinating to see Tim Burton fail on an epic scale. The problem with the movie is as simple as the title -- the earth is under attack and the director is rooting for the Martians!Why does Tim Burton love the Martians so much? Because they're mean, ugly, and weird-looking, and because they hate the people he hates. Small town jocks, the military, the squares, the working class, the poor . . . anybody who's not fabulous and weird and from someplace glittering with excess, insanity, and money. Like Bel Air and Beverly Hills.The irony is, the director's vision totally contradicts the story line itself. The structure of the screenplay really focuses on decent, ordinary earth people who become survivors. In that regard the movie is less like The Day The Earth Stood Still or The Thing From Another World, and more like Seventies disaster epics like Earthquake and The Towering Inferno.In those old Seventies epics, you had a huge cast drawn from different backgrounds, rich or poor, black or white. And then when disaster hits, unexpected heroes are revealed, and old relationships are strengthened while new ones are formed.But hey, Burton can't be bothered with that stuff.

The story has ugly aliens from Mars attacking Earth for no reason other than a lark.  The movie is full of visual jokes that are enjoyable.  The violence can be a little disturbing at times.  Jack Nicholson gives a fun dual performance as President Dale, and as Las Vegas casino mogul Art Land.  Glenn Close does a funny spoof of Nancy Reagan as the First Lady, while Paul Winfield plays the part of a pseudo-General Colin Powell.

On that level it succeeds beautifully. Everybody mouths their lines like they think that they are in the worst movie of all time. Especially Danny DeVito, who has swallowed his artistic side and gone back to the character he played in ""Romancing the Stone"" and ""Jewel of the Nile"". Those films were also pure B-movies and had some A-list actors in the cast.As for Jack Nicholson's dual role as the President and the Texan Casino owner, you can only hope that he had a lot of fun doing it. To think that this is the same man who has so many Oscar nominations and 3 wins to his name and appears with totally bizarre dentures in this film is mindboggling. Glenn Close looks embarrassed to be in this film and it looks like most of Anette Bening's scenes were cut.Tom Jones as himself is of course brilliant casting (Warning: spoiler): and that he is one of the survivors is also inspired (what would we do without him).So to make a long, boring review even longer (kidding) I had a reasonably good time watching this totally ridiculous time-filler and I hope that Burton's Charlie and the Chocolate Factory will have some of the same style as this piece of eye candy.",Mars Attacks!
104,saadanathan,Classic example of how aliens will invade earth one day 7\10,7,11 July 2021,"""Mars Attacks!"" is another big hit by Tim Burton, the setting takes place on Earth, which is being invaded by Martians (or in other words: aliens).The movie is another classic example of how humanity discovers a species of aliens and tries to communicate with them. Only to find out that the aliens have not come in peace. Unlike other movies which show the encounter with aliens, ""Mars Attacks!"" in particular laughs and makes fun of this sci - fi genre. It is made purposely so ridiculous, whacky and bizarre that it's main intension is just to laugh at humanity.The audience know for sure that a real encounter with aliens will go down way more different than shown here, yet so personally I believe what we just saw on ""Mars Attacks!"" is a possible outcome.The cast of actors is well wide and impressive: Jack Nicholson, Pierce Brosnan, Sarah Jessica Parker, Annette Bening, Glenn Close and many more.Great movie and great casting, a good and funny screenplay, a really joyful film to watch all together.",Mars Attacks!
105,TheMan3051,Burton's return to Comedy,8,29 June 2002,This movie is hilarious! It is a great spoof of those sci-fi B-movies of the `50s. The film doesn't have Burton's usual cast of players but the A-list cast does well. It's sad that this is Burton's first flop. Then again after eleven years he gets his first flop. How many directors have gotten their first flop after eleven years?,Mars Attacks!
106,FilmFanInTheHouse,A wonderful Burton Flick,7,28 August 2007,"Mars Attacks! (1996, Dir. Tim Burton) It is a normal day for everyone, until the President of the United States. They are able to get in contact with the Martians, and arrange for a meeting behind them and us humans. But not everything goes to plan, and the Martians have other plans for Earth. Are they just misunderstood beings? or do they really want to destroy all of humanity.When you see a film with Tim Burton's name on it, you know it's going to be something special. Mars Attacks! is nothing short of that. The story is there with enough action to keep you hooked. The action is top standard, even from Tom Jones. Jack Nicholson is just amazing in this playing two characters. The special effects are a mixed bag nowadays. Some of the effects still looked good such as the spaceships, but some CGI looked a bit dodgy, such as the green slime against the walls. This doesn't reduce the fun though, and you still have an enjoyable viewing experience, even after ten years.""I'm not having that thing in my house."" - First Lady (Glenn Close)",Mars Attacks!
107,PyroSikTh,Hack,7,12 August 2019,"Mars Attacks! is a piss-take through and through. It takes the controversial trading cards of the 60s and creates a movie around them, taking the opportunity to poke fun and as many old sci-fi films as possible. It's parody, it's satire, and in some ways it's even an homage. If this tone doesn't immediately strike you when you watch it, you're missing the point. On its surface level, Mars Attacks! is just silly. It's absurd nonsense. But make no mistake, this is kind of the point. It wants you to look at those old sci-fi/horror movies from the 50s and 60s and realise how ridiculous they were. The flying Saucers with satellite-dish ray guns coming out the bottom and destroying buildings, the stampede of flaming cows, the frankensteining of human captives to create disturbing chimeras with animals, the cowardly president delivering a defiant speech. It's meant to be ridiculousThat said I find Mars Attacks! was almost designed in such a way that it would be easy to miss the point. The satire is clever and witty, but not always obvious. I don't think I would ever describe Mars Attacks! as a laugh out loud comedy. It certainly has its moments, for sure, but its goal wasn't to make you laugh heartily every five minutes. It's a more thoughtful comedy, comedy that requires dissection to find the joke. It demands a smirk now and a hearty chuckle later when the implications really hit you. If nothing else it's humour is dark. Super dark. If you can't find the humour in people being vaporised, Mars Attacks! is not the movie for you.My most recent rewatch I actually found really rewarding in a number of ways. For starters, I never realised the insane amount of A-listers there are in this movie, and most of them are glorified cameos. Danny DeVito, for instance, has a couple of lines and then dies, he's barely on screen for a full minute, but this is Danny DeVito in the mid-90s! Glenn Close doesn't fair much better, nor does Michael J Fox (in his last ever live-action appearance no less). On the other hand Jack Nicholson gets to play two characters at opposite ends of the country. Then there's Natalie Portman, Jack Black, and Lukas Haas, all young and pre-fame. Annette Bening plays the most un-Bening character I've ever seen her play, while Pierce Brosnan and Sarah Jessica Parker share the most brutal fates. Tom Jones makes an appearance as himself, oh and Pam Grier stops a bus to retrieve her truanting sons.Another thing I never realised about this movie before, but makes so much sense in retrospect, is how much they actually got away with. The design of the aliens is horrifying. Skeletal, big bulging eyes, and brainheads. They even have little wiggling appendages under their cheeks. They're pure nightmare fuel. The complete brutality and cruelty exhibited by the Martians is even worse. They come down and appear friendly just to mess with humanity, and then vaporise everyone. And not just tame disintegration you usually get in movies, no, their rayguns strip the flesh from your bones leaving only charred remains. The most horrifying though is the fate of Sarah Jessica Parker and Pierce Brosnan who are subject to human experimentation. Their bodies are taken apart and dissected while they're still alive. Brosnan ends up as just a disembodied head suspended from the ceiling with BLOOD STILL DRIPPING FROM HIS NECK, while Parker suffers a head swap with her dog, which is equally as disturbing to actually see. How did this get passed the censors? And this was the toned down version as well! Originally the rayguns were going to have a wider variety of effects, but they had to tone them down to vaporising to avoid a hard R-rating. And this is all without mentioning the bizarrely creepy movements of 'Martian Girl' which is always oddly unnerving to watch.Mars Attacks! man. What a movie. It's been over twenty years and I still can't believe this actually got made. On paper it looks like a terrible idea: Let's assemble a huge cast of expensive A-listers and put them in a sci-fi parody that looks intentionally cheap. We'll make it visually terrifying yet colourful, kill off almost all the A-listers, and market it to a younger audience. While I'm not as bigger a lover of the movie as some (like my wife), it still holds a special place in my heart. I will always be nostalgic and have a fondness for it. I give it a solid 7/10. You definitely need to approach it at the right angle from the offset. This isn't Independence Day.P.S. It ends with Tom Jones singing 'It's Not Unusual' with a bald eagle on his arm. That's all that needs to be said really.",Mars Attacks!

109,nickenchuggets,We come in peace,8,2 October 2021,"Although I've known about the existence of this movie for over a decade, I never actually watched the whole thing from start to finish until last week. Maybe the reason I put it off for so long is because I didn't know what to expect, other than a fairly generic alien invasion movie. Beings from another world trying to conquer the earth is not anything new in science fiction, and even in the 1800s people like HG Wells were entertaining (and scaring) people with this topic. One thing that kind of annoys me about this genre is that the aliens are almost always portrayed as having intelligence humans can only dream of, but still can't figure out that violence resolves nothing. They even say how the aliens in this movie are a peaceful race by definition because they're smarter than humans. Before this all gets introduced to us, we are made aware of the fact that a massive armada of flying saucers from Mars is taking off and venturing earthward. As is usually the case, it's up to America to fix everything. The US president James Dale (Jack Nicholson) is trying to work with his advisors and military officers to determine how best to handle this once in a lifetime situation. They decide not to unleash america's nuclear arsenal and provoke a war humanity will probably lose. Instead, Dale gives the army permission to prepare a specified landing zone for the martian ships in the Nevada desert. When the ship lands, the (surprisingly short) aliens emerge, as soldiers and tank drivers look on in bewilderment. Using a machine that is somehow about to understand martian speech, an american general steps up to them and welcomes them to earth. The aliens say they come in peace. Immediately after, a man from the crowd releases a morning dove into the air to celebrate the new human-martian alliance. Unfortunately, the martians misinterpret the bird as a weapon and disintegrate it with their ray guns. An extremely one-sided gunfight breaks out, and the martians effortlessly destroy and kill many of the vehicles and men at the landing site. Shortly after, the president receives another message from the martians, saying how they are willing to apologize and now want to address the US Congress to set things right. The saucer lands again, this time in front of the capitol building. Once inside the Congress, the martian ambassador takes the lectern, with two bodyguards by his side. Right when everything seems nice and calm, they draw their guns and reduce most of the senators in the room to skeletons. By now, the entire world is being turned into a laughing stock. The martian forces are able to kill with impunity, and landmarks around the world begin to fall to their forces. Eventually, they attack the white house itself and Dale is forced by the secret service to flee. The martians try to coax the president into a truce after they break into his bunker, and then kill him. Right as all hope seems lost, a band of survivors discover by complete accident that while the martians are seemingly immune to atomic weapons, guns, and everything else, playing Slim Whitman music through a loudspeaker has debilitating effects on them. Soon, militaries all over earth put down their weapons in order to blast these songs from everywhere. Even the martians inside the spaceships have their heads explode and their invasion is foiled. After seeing this, I can certainly understand why it got the response it did upon being released. People generally felt the movie was impressive visually, but wasn't very original. For the most part, that's correct. Tim Burton wanted this movie to be a parody of already-existing alien invasion films, especially the huge amount of them that came out of the 1950s. This means Mars Attacks has somewhat of an excuse to justify its lack of creativity. It's simply mediocre on purpose. The types of weapons the martians use which are able to blast people into skeletons is also a trope you'd see in something like War of the Worlds. If you've seen The Day the Earth Stood Still, you'll probably notice the similarities between the scenes where the aliens first come to earth. In that film, the spaceman pulls out a device intended for the president, and the army shoots at him, thinking it's a weapon. The martians mistaking the dove for a weapon is basically a homage to that. I just thought it was entertaining to see the president's daughter (Natalie Portman) award the survivors for their heroism right after her father was martyred by the aliens. In my view, the movie was entertaining even though its amount of originality is pretty subpar, because Burton managed to parody 50s sci-fi a little too well.",Mars Attacks!
110,SKG-2,"Wicked, subversive fun",9,7 April 1999,"Except for his two BATMAN films, I really like the work of Tim Burton. Sure, his scripts may not hold together, but there's an appealing subversive streak of humor that appeals to me, and his visual talent is not slated towards beating us over the head with special effects, but with creating worlds that inspire us even if(especially if) we chuckle at them.MARS ATTACKS! was not well-liked by many, but I had a great time at it. The film may be intended as a tribute to(as well as a parody of) those cheesy 1950's sci-fi flicks, but it also serves as a wicked satire of the disaster flick, exemplified that year with INDEPENDENCE DAY.  Obviously, the main attraction is those Mars creatures, which, through a combination of stop-motion animation and computer graphics, are great to look at and provide several great moments in the film(especially when their heads explode).  But the humans do alright as well.  Sure, Jack Nicholson is one-note as the real estate developer(I'm reminded here that when Burton asked Nicholson which part he wanted to play, Nicholson replied, ""How about all of them?""), and Natalie Portman and Danny DeVito are wasted as, respectively, the First Daughter and a gambler.  But Nicholson does good work as the President, Glenn Close is hysterical as the First Lady, Annette Bening finally gets to play Catwoman(so to speak), and the cast is filled with people like Jim Brown and Pam Grier, who know enough not to take it seriously.  A lot of fun!",Mars Attacks!

113,chrisbrown6453,"Mars Attacks! must be viewed as a major disappointment, considering the talent and money involved.",6,17 June 2002,"Director Tim Burton possesses a brilliant touch and has turned out enduring delights such as Ed Wood, Pee Wee's Big Adventure, Beetlejuice and Edward Scissorhands. He is bound to have an off day, and one critic has already described the bloated Mars Attacks! as Burton's 1941. Jack Nicholson heads the big-name cast, playing the president of the United States who must lead the way when Earth is invaded by hordes of short, malicious aliens with big, bulging brains. He watches helplessly as the visitors turn members of Congress into toast with their ray guns. So much for diplomacy. The plot bears some similarities to that summer's biggest hit, Independence Day and to other camp classics from the 1950s, but is just never as funny as was surely intended. Maybe it's because the script is based on Topps Trading Cards. The special effects do look expensive, but grow numbingly repetitive. We could see the same explosions in any movie with Arnie or Sly. Annette Bening, Danny DeVito, Rod Steiger, Lukas Haas, Jim Brown, Paul Winfield, Sylvia Sidney and Christina Applegate pop in for cameos of varying effectiveness. Lisa Marie is totally awesome as a curvaceous alien pleasure doll who glides bewitchingly into the White House for a tryst. She has been invited into the Kennedy Room by horny press secretary Martin Short. Glenn Close, as the starchy first lady (who also plays V.P. in Air Force One) does a sort of Cruella de Reagan who refuses to serve the aliens on her Van Buren china. She is vastly underutilized. Ditto Pam Grier. Michael J. Fox is dispatched early on, while Sarah Jessica Parker and Pierce Brosnan do find romance though their heads and bodies have parted company. Acting honors go to singer Tom Jones playing himself. Is that not unusual?",Mars Attacks!
114,estreet-eva,You kind of know where Tim Burton was going with it.,4,19 February 2013,"Tim Burton used his star power to assemble one of the highest power casts you'll see in a mid 90's film. Unfortunately, he doesn't give them that much to do. ""Mars Attacks"" much like ""The Informant!"" plays like a joke that doesn't provoke laughter as much as it does a sense of knowing where Burton was going with the film. Basically, he tries to lampoon the 1950's creature feature film particularly ""The Day the Earth Stood Still"" but an underlying Burton-ian meanspiritness and tendency toward strong violence sucks much of the fun out of the film. The writers provide only a modest amount of fun from which to take leaving Burton to rely on CGI red-spangled speedos on the Martians and the stuntcasting - including Tom Jones wasted by simply playing himself - to push the movie along. Burton cross the spoof line in a few spots and instead simply lifts ideas from much better films particularly Rod Steiger's General Decker a copy of George C Scott General Turgidson from ""Dr. Stangelove."" The plagiarism serves not as homage but as a sign that you could be watching a much better film. In short, better parody of the same material exists elsewhere.",Mars Attacks!
115,DavidSim240183,The Martians have landed!,6,11 March 2007,"Although I am a huge fan of Tim Burton, even a talented and innovative director like him turns out a few clunkers. Big Fish (his worst film) had him trying to be something he wasn't and Planet of the Apes is not even worth mentioning. And as for Mars Attacks, well it doesn't rank very highly on my Burton list, but it is a moderately diverting big budget extravaganza. Its just less than the sum of its parts. Not what I've come to expect from Tim Burton.A lot of people were disappointed with Mars Attacks when it came out. Even though its not an altogether bad film. It does occasionally have some inspired scenes of chaos. And the Martian invaders are wonderfully malevolent. But its a little too chaotic for its own good. Too disjointed. Compare it to Gremlins. A similar story about malicious creatures gleefully destroying everything. But Joe Dante managed to keep the slim story going with great energy on his part, not to mention hilariously memorable sight gags and set-pieces. Burton is unable to do the same with Mars Attacks.One thing that must be said for this film is the extraordinary cast Burton has managed to assemble. Not only is it comprised of some of Hollywood's top stars, but even actors in supporting roles just before they hit the big time. As well as Burton faves. (Although Johnny Depp is nowhere to be found!). Even Tom Jones! Which shows you how many people in the world want to work with Tim Burton.I won't go into detail about who we have present. We'd be here all day. And besides, they're so underdeveloped anyway what would be the point? All the actors are just fodder for the Martian attack. Although it is a genuine shocker when you see top names like Michael J Fox and Danny DeVito getting killed after just a few minutes of screen time.Jack Nicholson gets the most scenes, for the simple fact that he's playing not one but two parts. The President James Dale, and Art Land, a developer in Las Vegas. Its an obvious homage to Peter Sellers magnificent showcase in Dr Strangelove. But Nicholson just doesn't have the same range. He's mildly amusing as the befuddled President out of his depth. But the other character is unnecessary and doesn't go anywhere.Pierce Brosnan makes an impression as the pipe smoking scientist certain the Martians are friendly. But he only really opens up in his scenes with Sarah Jessica Parker when they're on board the alien ship. As two severed heads. His a disembodied one. And hers grafted onto a Chihuahua's body.If truth be told the story sags whenever the Martians are not around. With their bulbous brains, bug eyes and maniacal cackle, they're an inspired creation. Clearly loving destroying the Earth, they get some great moments. Like defacing Mount Rushmore and putting their faces on it instead. Blowing up the Taj Mahal while posing in front of it for pictures. And frying Congress!There are lots of great little touches when examining the Martians lifestyle. I love the ray guns they use. They look like something you'd buy from your local toyshop. Their spaceships look like gigantic hubcaps. Their twisted sense of humour extends to blowing up national monuments just for the fun of it. And their infectious laugh reminds me of the aliens from the Cadburys Smash adverts. Without the Martians, Mars Attacks would be a pretty lifeless production.Its just a shame the human cast can't enliven their half. Except for one cast member. Lisa Marie, who delivers a grandstanding scene stealing performance as a Martian disguised as a human girl. Check out her beehive hairstyle designed to hide the giant brain. And her swirly patterned form fitting dress. She doesn't walk. She glides! On a mission to assassinate the President. And gets sidetracked by Martin Short's sex starved Press Secretary. Its a wonderfully witty scene, with a real appealing sense of deadpan humour. And Lisa Marie carries it all off without uttering a single syllable. If only the rest of Mars Attacks had some of the same inspiration.Its not all Tim Burton's fault. The film originated from a set of bubblegum cards. And those striking images of decimation and devastation doesn't provide much in the way of plot. The solution to stopping the Martians is a bit odd, but it fits in with classic B-movie clichés.But overall, Mars Attacks is a disappointment. Its a bloated, over-inflated production with too many cast members. You're actually grateful when the Martians start blowing people away, because it shortens the cast list and tightens the focus. But its still an overlong and painfully slow film at times. A minor entry in Tim Burton's otherwise excellent body of work.",Mars Attacks!
116,lordzedd-3,Goody Parady with HOLLYWOOD'S A-List,9,1 July 2006,"This is a dark comedy, science fiction. Plenty of humor and dark humor and Hollywood's A list was lining up to be shot down by these odd looking aliens. Why don't they have lips? Pierce Brosnan was the brilliant as the Scientist that thinks he can deduce what the aliens are like, but really is completely in the dark. In fact the whole cast is great in this knock out comedy that may be alittle too dark for some and many thought it was like ID4, but it's not like ID4, it's a comedy. It was suppose to be silly, and goofy. The effects were great. Cool, if strange looking aliens, the ships look great. It mainly mirrors ""EARTH VS. THE FLYING SAUCERS"" in many of the major plot points. So if you've seen EARTH VS. THE FLYING SAUCERS, then you know what basically will happen. But that doesn't spoil the experience.

I read a quote from Ebert regarding this film which I think is quite true, something to the effect that his previous film, Ed Wood, was a tribute to the man, while this film is a tribute to the terrible films he made. He also said it's not good enough or bad enough to be a true tribute, it's just sorta mediocre. And I agree. There are spots of dark comedic brilliance (pretty much anything to do with the Martians), but also some truly terrible moments (most of the human characters and their inane subplots). The whole aspect of the Martians is terrifically executed, from the classic flying saucers to the 'ack ack' to their means of defeat. But the human cast is so universally terrible that it really drags the film down. Really only Jack Nicholson and Pierce Brosnan seem to understand the type of film that is being made; everyone else takes the whole thing so seriously. The subplot with Lukas Haas and his grandmother is unwatchable, the black family is laughable, and the Vegas stuff is cringe-worthy. Though it's a homage to the classic '50s B-movies, it is at once both better than and worse than those films, making for a very uneven and disappointing product.",Mars Attacks!

Comics and video games have long become household treasure troves for Hollywood plot scouts, but trading cards? Only Burton could pull it off, aided by an all-star cast if there ever was one: Pierce Brosnan and Sarah Jessica Parker as doomed lovers, Annette Bening as a showgirl, Danny DeVito as a gambler, Glen Close as the first lady, Natalie Portman as the first daughter and, looming at superhuman size, Jack Nicholson in the iconic double role of casino mobster and US president. Many a beta male has posed as the president on the silver screen. Pansies, step aside and make way for James Dale. He fails, but admirably so, going down like a true predator, survived only by that biggest of cats. I never tire of the final scene, a tableau of tranquility in the wake of terrible turmoil and near-extinction.

121,kgprophet,Lots of Celebrities but Little Else,4,27 March 2021,"Tim Burton is great at making movies look like cartoons. I remember when this film was coming out it had a great looking trailer with a cavalcade of stars. How could you lose? For instance the brilliance of casting Rod Steiger as the mad general (patterned after George C Scott in ""Dr. Strangelove""). In the trailer he goes ""Annihilate! Annihilate!"" Very funny. But when you watch the movie, you realise that was all they had for his character. The script is a cut and paste of a bunch of ideas that maybe would have worked as a series of short skits, but for a feature length film, these flimsy characters run out of depth (and interest) long before the film is over.The film of course wants to be a comedy, but starts completely on the wrong foot by depicting a herd of cattle on fire. Frankly this is a horrible and unsympathetic way to open a film, by watching these innocent animals die a grisly death. The first act introduces the large array of characters across the country, as well as the White House. Jack Nicholson as the president is one of the best things in the film, but is diminished by Nicholson also playing a cliché business tycoon who shoots from the hip. The best thing by far is the appropriately superficial TV show personalities played by Michael J. Fox and Sarah Jessica Parker. Their dialogue and story arc is engaging, especially when Pierce Brosnan shows up as that archetypical 50s scientist who always had the answers in the old Sci-Fi movies that this film is based on.Otherwise there is little else to tolerate. The exposition of the dozens and dozens of characters is dull. The editing is lifeless. The decision to include certain scenes, especially the Vegas scenes, seem more obligatory because it features a movie star. My guess is that many of these recognizable faces agreed to do this film for less than their regular salary because it looked like a fun project. But I found almost all the scenes with these memorable faces quite dull. They say or do something somewhat offbeat, but not in any engaging way. For the most part the pay-off in exchange for the amount of time invested in them is not worth it.The two kids whose parents are a bus driver and a Vegas hotel employee. The trailer park family whose son is a gun nut. The grandma in the nursing home. The new age flake. And because, hey, it's Tom Jones and Danny Devito. Both of these people pop into the film in the third act out of nowhere. Devito is given nothing to do otherwise than basically mug for the camera and say ""How are ya!""Seemingly a spoof of ""Independence Day"", I'm sure the reason is that the script writers for both films went the obvious route and focused on how the government along with the first family would respond to an alien invasion. Many side stories with even more side characters are invented to throw in another interesting visual. As for the special effects they went for quantity over quality. On the other hand, because it's a very cartoonish movie, it's almost appropriate that the effects look shiny and plastic. It also incorporates the old fashioned stop motion animation. Again, making this more of a cartoon than a reality based film.But a bunch of goofy imagery with one-note jokes doesn't make a good comedy on the whole.The same goes with the big twist at the end, the accidental discovery that easily kills all the martians. It reminds me of the stupid twist at the end of ""Signs"". Goofy, but not a knee slapper. Worst for the wear is the cowboy talkin' entrepreneur played by Jack Nicholson. I'm sure he was having fun depicting this showboating businessman, but it all just falls flat and has very little to do with anything. This includes the big setup of a new hotel being built in Vegas, where it is more than obvious the footage is of an actual implosion of an old Vegas tower. Then there is a needless visit to a Vegas sign junkyard. It looks cool but means nothing. Also, for a comedy, there are very graphic and disturbing scenes of people being incinerated. When I saw this in theatre when it first came out, I thought about how much potential this movie could have had with a real story and more engaging dialogue.",Mars Attacks!

This movie was never intended to be SciFi drama, director wanted to make it SciFi- dark comedy- satire and he did it beautifully. Movie is great entertainment at it's best. Most of the people may not understand the purpose and the message of the film: it acted as a satire on all action and SciFi movies.I was amazed to see that this movie had big name in it's cast like Jack Nicholson, Danny DeVito, Pierce Brosnan, Michael J Fox, Natalie Portman, Jack Black etc. The special effects were also a funny part, because some of them are very well achieved and some of them are really cheesy; that's their purpose.Overall, Mars Attacks!

I expected this one to be kind of a rotten egg because of the rating on IMDb and just the whole premise of the film. I was wrong, this movie is a hilarious and action packed load of fun.Tim Burton does another great job directing and has a star filled cast. Everyone is awesome, especially Jack Nicholson, and Lukas Haas. I usually hate CGI a lot but the cheesy CGI in this film added to the cartoony feel and made it that much more fun. The story is ridiculous and bizarre but awesome nonetheless. I also thought the humor was spot on. This is a new favorite.See this movie if you Sci-Fi/Comedy. It's a must!",Mars Attacks!

Glenn Close, Danny DeVito, Sarah Jessica Parker, Pam Grier, Martin Short, Michael J.

There's movies that are bad in the sense that there was no thought or effort into them, and there are movies that are intentionally bad, meaning the style is supposed to be all in good fun. This is the latter. Even for a movie that's ""intentionally bad"", it's still pretty good. I was laughing the whole time. There were a few plot holes here and there, and things that seemed like they were setting up for a payoff, but never did. Despite these problems, I still enjoyed myself. The Martians' design and language were unique, the story was enjoyable, and the actors seemed like they enjoyed themselves. The score was also really good. I may go back and listen to the soundtrack with how epic the score was. Honestly, the score had more effort put into it than there needed to be. The ending was a bit silly and just felt like ""We need to end this, so let's end it as soon as possible"" and was honestly a bit of a cop out. There are some questions I still have about things left unexplained. Even with these factors, it's still worth a watch just for a fun time. See it and enjoy yourself.

Even his usual brilliant visual sense has deserted him here. Jack Nicholson is very disappointing in two unfunny roles, Glenn Close and Danny DeVito are completely wasted and there is no character whom one can focus on and thus empathise with. That said, there are some very funny moments and the Martians themselves are great; Jim Brown, the divine Pam Grier and Rod Steiger turn in excellent supporting performances (although there is not enough of any of them) and Lukas Haas and Sylvia Sydney provide welcome warmth and humanity: no wonder it is them that save the world.By the way - if you've ever wondered if Tom Jones can act, he can't!",Mars Attacks!
131,basrutten,"Achieves it's goal, but that doesn't make it good",6,11 February 2003,"""Mars Attacks"" clearly sets out to spoof old science-fiction B-movies (and maybe some recent SF B-movies too) and certainly succeeds: the plot is corny and full of holes, the acting is often quite horrible in spite of the all-star cast, the special effects look bad, and the way in which the aliens are defeated is laughable. It's just that Mars Attacks has all of these flaws on purpose, instead of many other movies, where the people that made them actually were serious about what they were doing but just to inept to do it right (e.g. ""Independence Day"", ""Battlefield Earth"")The big problem is that Mars Attacks is still a pretty lame movie. Yes, it's bad on purpose, but it's still bad. There are some indeniable funny scenes, but there aren't enough of them to make up for the load of utterly unnecessary and boring scenes that introduce people for the sole purpose of having them killed three scenes later and for the presence of Tom Jones, who should stay as far away from making movies as possible. 
All in all, Tim Burton certainly knew what he was doing when he made this movie: spoofing bad SF movies. Unfortunately, ""Mars Attacks"" is almost just as bad as the movies it's spoofing. ** out of **** stars",Mars Attacks!
132,Hallelujah289,"Savage, macabre joy ride",8,4 February 2019,"Mars Attacks! scared the bejeezus out of me as a kid but now I understand it. This isn't particularly a kid film even though it looks like it could be one.Special effects are intentionally cheesy with director Tim Burton specifying a claymation look to the CGI martians and a cheap, nostalgic Ed Wood look to their aluminum flying saucers. Cheesy would suggest campy but this film is far from wanting to be wholesome or politically correct. It stars Jack Nicholson as both U.S. President and alcoholic cowboy real estate tycoon and that should tell you something about the wild card and razor sharp mood of the film. This film is anarchic, demented, but with its own sense of gleeful and camp fun, much like Nicholson's Joker in the Tim Burton Batman films.Mars Attacks supports a perhaps bloated all-star cast, from Pierce Brosnan and Glen Close to a young Natalie Portman portraying the President's daughter in a slightly wry Leon the Professional sidekick way. Even a rising Jack Black stars. The star wattage is a bit at odds with the very non-mainstream appeal and message the film turned out to have. But most all meet a wicked end, and that adds to the anarchic bent of this over-budget financial flop and eventual cult favorite.I like this film and give it a high 9/10 because it is very good at being exactly what it wants to be, which isn't what most people thought it would be. Some say the film is mean spirited but I think it's about as destructive as a toddler building up a tower of blocks and then enjoying it as he blasts it down. The martians in this film are lethal but wicked funny and they tear down everything that you get the sense was ineffectual anyway. The film is pretty anti-establishment but most pointedly anti-mainstream and that message probably did come across in a brutal but not really vicious way.The film still celebrates the underdog and keeps alive the most caring nobodies to reign in the destructive martians. Tim Burton is present in both the martians and the underdog this time, and the film retains a spark of anti-hero charm while also asking you to sit back while many of your favorite actors and actresses get ironically decimated.If you are also the toddler who liked smashing your tower of blocks, then I think you will find something to like in this high budget wish-fulfillment fantasy. And it is satisfying for what it offers, even though sometimes the plot can be somewhat distracted. But just know this is Tim Burton on spite, and you should probably be in the mood for a satisfying kind of to-heck-with-everything destructive spite in order to enjoy this film. This is comedy-horror and high on the horror, but sometimes we need that.",Mars Attacks!

It is guaranteed to put off some viewers, but those who get the joke that is this film will get a big kick out of it. It is a truly hilarious film, but the laughs are not always straightforward. Some scenes are truly elaborate and require repeated viewings to be appreciated. The film has an enormous ensemble cast of Hollywood stars. It's a funny thing to note that everyone gets killed except Tom Jones and Annette Bening. This is really a gutsy film if I ever saw one. The president actually gets killed here! The dog dies too, as does the typical patriotic family trying to be heroic and defend their home. What a complete hoot this film is. How it ever got made, I will never know. It wasn't likely to be a success because it wasn't a typically patriotic blockbuster, it was expensive, and in the end it wasn't a success. It was a terrible flop, which illustrates that Americans really will never be able to laugh at themselves. It's hard to believe that Tim Burton is an american at all.

Jack Nicholson is definitely having a great time playing the President and alcoholic Art Land (he's the funniest character in this film!). He's intentionally being very serious and very funny at the same time. It's really funny that Tim Burton got all those famous actors to play in his movie.

The plot: Mars Attacks! Simple as. Well, there's a little more to it than that, obviously, but to say too much would be to give the game away for the eight sci-fi nerds out there yet to see this flick. (Don't get cross, nerds, I'm one of you, too.) The comedy angle is a hit and miss affair, some of it laugh out loud funny, some of it misfiring spectacularly, particularly the sequences involving Brosnan, not a man put on this Earth to bring the gift of laughter. Nor Tom Jones, for that matter. Indeed, two or three of the best lines go to the old Nan character, a wonderfully dry performance by Sylvia Sidney as the loopy old dear, giggling with senility as chaos reigns supreme around her. The best moment in the movie is her standout scene: As the Martians turn their ray guns on the members of the US Congress, we cut to her watching on TV, laughing riotously as she proclaims ""They blew up Congress!"" I did chuckle at that bit. Burton deftly handles the CGI heavy action sequences, but it is Danny Elfman's wonderfully evocative score that truly shines here, bringing to mind perfectly late night TV fodder such as The Thing From Another World and The Day the Earth Stood Still. Not Burton's best movie by a country mile, this is still an entertaining enough movie in its own right.",Mars Attacks!

Bug-eyed martians fly from Mars to Earth, and after that long journey, they use their phasers to evaporate members of the US Army who was at the welcoming ceremony. Thus begins the War of the worl.... err... let's go with War Between Man and Non-Men, and encompasses the entire movie. In between, big time stars show up, then are killed or at least have their heads put into a jar. Among the who's who of Hollywood in the film are: Michael J. Fox as a swarmy newscaster, Sarah Jessica Parker as a talk show host, Annette Benning as an alien crazed woman of some means, Jim Brown as a big black man, Jack Black as a dopey army man, Pierce Brosnan as a scientist, Martin Short as the President's press secretary, Glenn Close as the first lady, and Jack Nicholson as the President of the United States. So to sum it up, most of the stars play themselves in the film, including Tom Jones, who plays Tome Jones. Nicholson as the president is a funny choice and one part of originally creativity that I enjoyed in the film. The part I didn't like is how the aliens were defeated, by way of bad music, causing their brains to explode. It's kind of amusing at first, but the laughter falls off and we just hope the movie ends. The jokes, for the most part, are in the first half of the movie and tend to play off of what we know about the actors playing certain roles, and less off of the 50s movies that inspired the movie to begin with. I do not know why more related to the 50s was not used, I guess Burton didn't trust his material that much. Enjoyable to a point, Mars Attacks ends up being a disappointing homage to the science fiction films of the 50s.",Mars Attacks!
140,ltlacey,Planet Earth is attacked by crazed Martians.,9,28 October 2008,"Adsurdity done to perfection. Either you are a fan of Tim Burton or not, but even those who are not could very well find this movie entertaining as there is a lot going on than just Mars attacking Earth. And what makes it so are all the little details, especially in the scenes with only the Martians. (Sidebar here: Check out Nathan Archer's book, Mars Attacks: Martian Deathtrap, for a fun read and more examples of how life as a Martian is not much different than life as a human.) We get to see that even in the Martian ""world"" there are slackers who are asleep at the control panel. The story is simple and moves along quickly, and though there are a lot of actors (human), it is easy to keep track of who is who and their respective characters and personalities. We have, of course, your basic military personnel with the mindset of ""shoot first and ask questions later."" There is also the scientific community that firmly states that there is no need to think that 1000s of spaceships surrounding the planet could mean the Martians are getting ready to attack, and even keep to this mindset after a few attacks occur. And of course a president who has to ask his wife what to do, even though her goal in life is to replace all that chintz with watered silk. The first meeting with the Marians, of course, ends in disaster, as this is the overall plan of the Martians. We find out that the Marians have a sick, though funny, sense of humor and are able to lead the humans on with talks of misunderstandings numerous times. And of course who cannot love the final scenes where, by accident, our intrepid hero, played by Haas, finds the only way to kill the Martians.

142,Benjamin_Cox,A real blast but somehow missing the golden touch - 74%,7,26 October 2009,"At last! Another one of those movies I've waited years to see, I can finally cross this off my list. But for some reason, I'm not lighting fireworks and dancing around a bonfire. Maybe I was expecting too much - after all, it has all the big-name stars you could ever want and one of my favourite directors in the big chair, Tim Burton. By taking a well-worn genre and infusing it with his typically dark vision, Burton has fashioned a quirky and entertaining sci-fi blast that ticks every cliché you could imagine. But whether it's a dark fable on resisting the American Dream or simply an excuse to zap recognisable faces, this is one film that dares to be different from every other alien film and to be frank, that's as good a reason as any to celebrate.As the Hubble telescope spots hundreds of flying saucer-shaped things flying over from Mars, President James Dale (Jack Nicholson) is torn between welcoming the alien visitors and blowing them out of the sky. Convinced by Professor Kessler (Pierce Brosnan) that they mean us no harm, President Dale addresses the nation on this historic moment. But for some, there are more important things to deal with. Nathalie Lake (Sarah Jessica Parker) sees the aliens as an opportunity for a great talk show, tycoon Art Land (Nicholson again) isn't going to let the aliens ruin him opening his new casino and journalist Jason Stone (Michael J Fox) senses the scoop of the century. Sadly, these aliens have only two things on their massive minds - total annihilation of the Earth and having some fun while they're at it.In all the mayhem, it's easy to lose track of who is doing what and why with the exception of the aliens themselves. Truth be told, the aliens get the biggest laughs - not only do they look fabulous but they have the funniest scenes such as taking photos of themselves in front of the exploding Taj Mahal or the slightly creepy undercover Martian girl (Lisa Marie) with White House Press Secretary Jerry Ross (Martin Short). The look of the film is quite unique in a way I unexpected, like Burton's ""reimagining"" of ""Charlie And The Chocolate Factory"" but surprisingly, it doesn't detract too much from the movie as a whole. The cast, by contrast, do exactly that - each actor feels like they're actually playing themselves but the only one who is isn't an actor at all. Tom Jones' appearance in the second half is as ridiculous as it is sublime but sadly, all too brief. But as each star wrestles for screen time, I couldn't help thinking it was repeating the same mistake that ""Ocean's Twelve"" did. Simply throwing big name actors at the screen isn't enough to make a movie entertaining which is why the aliens are the true stars of ""Mars Attacks!"".It sounds like I've got a bit of a downer on this movie but I really haven't. I enjoyed the sheer sense of fun, despite scores of people being reduced to coloured skeletons and their component atoms. It's much more fun than the recent ""War Of The Worlds"" remake as well as being a delightful poke in the eye for overly patriotic disaster flicks like ""Independence Day"" or ""The Day After Tomorrow"". For that, I can only applaud Burton for crafting a wonderfully silly alien movie with just enough darkness to keep kids behind the sofa. It's like that classic British sci-fi series ""Dr Who"" - full of special effects and deadly alien weapons but with a cheeky glint in its eye to tell you not to worry too much. ""Mars Attacks!"" isn't Burton's best film and neither will it appeal to everyone - it's just too weird - but it's still worth seeking out if you haven't seen it yet. Just make sure you don't wait 13 years before watching it as you'll probably be let down.",Mars Attacks!

Mars Attacks! is great entertainment at it's best, and Tim Burton did an incredibly good job, as usual. One of the things that seems to bother me the most is that some people may not understand the purpose and the message of the film: it's mission is to spoof all those action and Sci-fi movies that abound on clichés and laughable scenes; in which Independence Day is one clear example. Independence Day is bad, relies too much on SFX, and abuse the audience's sanity, believing us to be fools. This is the idea that Jonathan Gemes (screenwriter) and Tim Burton(director) had in mind.Also one high point of the movie is it's main attraction to it's cast: Box Office names like Jack Nicholson; Glenn Close; Danny DeVito; Pierce Brosnan; Sarah Jessica Parker; Michael J Fox; (th great) Natalie Portman; Lukas Haas; Jack Black; Pam Grier and Annette Bening, all of them come together, representing a part of society and social status that they spoof themselves. The special effects are also a funny part, because some of them are very well achieved and some of them are really cheesy: that's their purpose.Anyway, much more shouldn't be said, since Mars Attacks! is one of those films that you have to see for yourself, and ultimately evaluate. 9 ou of 10",Mars Attacks!
148,cashbacher,Parody heaped on parody,9,14 November 2020,"One of the most widely used cliché's of science fiction is the Little Green Men or LGMs. That and several other phrases are used to describe some of the frequently used and rather bad plot devices in science fiction movies. In the case of this movie, even the exaggerations are exaggerated.
It starts with an all-star cast led by Jack Nicholson playing two roles. He plays the president of the United States and a glittery Las Vegas huckster. Among others, Glenn Close is the First Lady, Pierce Brosnan is a perpetual pipe smoking intellectual, Jim Brown is an ex-fighter now working as a Las Vegas gladhander, Martin Short is the White House Press Secretary and Danny DeVito is a loudmouth Vegas gambler. Every single role is deliberately overplayed, you get the impression that the actors really enjoyed hamming it up.
The villains are Martians carrying disintegrator guns and that have green Jell-O for brains. Like the classic tale by H. G. Wells, at first the Martians win all the battles, but eventually the humans discover their fundamental weakness and after that the humans quickly win the war. That weakness is hilarious.

There's nothing even remotely funny or interesting going on in this movie...and even what could have been a funny moment regarding one certain musical selection isn't funny either. This is a huge miscalculation on the script-writer and director's part.

153,jazzest,Successfully Bad,4,19 July 2004,"Strangely, this purposefully little engaged sci-fi spoof by Tim Burton is more unforgettable than seriously dedicated homage pieces, such as Eight Legged Freaks. Some bad ingredients may be thanks to intentional low-tech, while the others may be due to lack of crafts; the mixture of both keeps the audience guessing if Burton is serious or joking. For example, the ridiculously classic Martian appearance modeled with cheap 3-D technology seems to be well-thought, while the ludicrous political satire may be the result of Burton's poor skill in that area. Too many inconsistent and unresolved subplots (e.g., the romance between the heads of Sarah Jessica Parker and Pierce Brosnan in a Martian spaceship) are difficult to judge if they are by design or not.One thing for sure is that the film is successfully bad to satisfy movie fans' demands for bad flicks.",Mars Attacks!
154,pekinman,Strangely maligned,8,16 September 2009,"Maybe it was due to the huge success of 'Ed Wood' two years earlier that 'Mars Attacks!' was dissed by the critics and ignored by the public (which is very odd as it is much more commercially viable than the former title). It is also almost as good as 'Ed Wood' which is, for me, Burton's greatest achievement, so far. Tim Burton may have been channeling Ed Wood's spirit when he created this farcical, cheesy comedy about Martians attacking Earth, primarily Las Vegas and Washington, D.C. There is definitely social commentary going on here as we watch the destruction of the sleazy, besequined casinos and the equally sleazy United States Congress in session.This movie is one of Burton's most star-studded and all the actors are funny and clearly enjoying themselves. Jack Nicholson doubles as President of the United States and a high- rolling Texas scum ball out to make a killing in 'Vegas. He is alternately fatuous and stupid in a very convincing manner. Annette Beining shines in a rare comedic role for her as the Texas idiot's new-age-besotted girlfriend. She is extremely funny in this part and plays the dumb blonde to perfection. The jewel in this comedy crown is the late, great Rod Steiger as the sabre-rattling general who comes to one of the most hilarious ends ever in the movies.Martin Short is also a standout as the oily George Stephanopoulos-style White House press secretary who meets and is dispatched by the beautiful, camp Martian Girl played by the ever-delicious Lisa-Marie. Sarah Jessica Parker is perfectly cast as the empty-headed, vain news babe. Her dog, Poppy, a tiny Chihuahua, is a splendid canine actor. Burton excels at casting animal actors in all his movies. And then there is Danny DeVito, in prime condition, giving one of his funniest performances since 'Taxi'.The episodes in Kansas inside the trashy trailers are highlights, with the late Sylvia Sidney stealing every scene she appears in as Gramma, with her stuffed cat in her room at the nursing home and her addiction to Country Western music, music which eventually destroys the Martians by making their heads explode.I can't stop without mentioning the wonderful musical score by Danny Elfman. The f/x team should also be commended for the creation of the funniest space aliens ever, with their bikini underwear and bizarre vanity.This is a very funny movie and recommendable for families. It won't scare the youngsters and will entertain the grownups. Make lots of popcorn and be ready to laugh.",Mars Attacks!
155,SeriousJest,"If you like camp and science fiction, you'll love this film!",8,24 January 2012,"I am not a big science-fiction fan, nor am I partial to Tim Burton movies, but this one became one of my favorites from both categories within the first 30 minutes. First and foremost, this film is a great example of high camp. It is simultaneously dark-comedy and tongue-in- cheek sarcasmextremely witty, well-timed, and sometimes perfectly subtle.The cast was awesome–it felt like everybody's agent frantically told them, ""You need to be in this movie!"" And their agents were right! Good thing Kevin Bacon wasn't in this flick, or that famous game would be ruined because it'd be too easy. Not only were the big names present, but they were also performing their asses off. Whether they were nailing a tagline, cheesing a smug smile, conveying emotion through a subtle non-verbal cue, or purposefully over-acting, these actors brilliantly nailed their roles, and brought a great script to life. One scene involving Pam Grier, Ray J, Brandon Hammond, and a bus had me cracking up and cheering, in particular. By the way, I usually do not find Parker attractive, but I gotta admit she was pretty friggin' smokin' in this movienot hotter than Christina Applegate, though, whom I only recognized after staring at the screen and wondering, ""Who is that fine-ass chick?""And let's not forget the one area of this movie in which I expected Burton to deliver most: the aliens. Well, Burton came through even better than expected. The CGI was creative, scary, repulsive, ridiculous, and funny. At one point, I wondered whether it was treason to cheer for the aliens.Honestly, I think I didn't rate this flick higher only because I'm not a big fan of the science-fiction genre, so I probably wouldn't watch it more than once, but if you're a science-fiction lover, you might consider this movie a must-own. I definitely think everyone should make the time to watch it at least once, though.",Mars Attacks!

Here human beings think that aliens, because of their incredible intelligence, have necessarily to be intelligent, and so pacific. This spilbergianan point of view is rapidly brokenn: the optimist position of human beings (too static and without dialogues with empirical world), makes the aliens act easily and menage to kill a lot of people, with mad actions that make them similar to Gremlins.A negative role is play by graphics, that's a little bit poor and unrealistic. But this movie have to be watched as a funny entertainment that reveals interesting reflections on meeting aliens, through parody and irony, but without a real deepening of the problems. His nature not so burtonian (it's not gothic or halloweenian) and his a little weak plot makes the movie not a masterpiece; but it can be watched as something interesting for anarchical destruction that breaks all human expectations, that are built by other movies' conceptions.",Mars Attacks!

No wonder Mars Attacks! bombed at the box office but not surprisingly it instantly became a TV cult classic. Burton is extremely talented (the beginning of Mars Attacks with its great special effects, editing, music and camera work is masterful film making) but he chooses not to make mainstream commercial movies (except for Batman where he knuckled under to Warner Brothers) and yet his films are just popular enough to continue his career. Why do many people dislike Mars Attacks!? Along with Burton's love for old B horror and Sci-fi movies is his dislike for the lifestyle and taste of the mainstream public. Mars Attacks! on the surface is another Independence Day but underneath they are completely different movies. While Independence Day is wrapped in the flag and God Bless America, Mars Attacks! gives it the finger. Lots of characters are not shown in a favorable light in Mars Attacks! to put it mildly; the President, his First Lady and press secretary, military officers, scientists, TV reporters, businessmen, lawyers, red necks and patriots.

158,CherryBlossomBoy,One of the weakest Burton's creations,3,26 July 2011,"It looks like Tim Burton was contractually obligated to do this film. Everything in it says ""hired director"". Perhaps Warner Brothers felt he was the one to deliver apt competition to 20th Century Fox's ""Independence Day"" made the same year. The idea almost backfired: ""Mars Attacks!"" made the slight profit only thanks to international broadcasting. Maybe Europeans have more taste for Burton's visions than Americans do? Or is it that the joke in this film IS on the Americans? ""The greatest nation on Earth"" notoriously finds it difficult to laugh at themselves especially when patriotism is mocked. Burton as an author likes to mock about and this would seem to be the subject he'd be at home with.However it doesn't seem he had much control over this particular project. The script is unusually bad for a typical Burton movie. Weak dialog, forced and sparse lines, even the usually good actors have a lot of trouble delivering them convincingly and with good timing. Jokes and gags don't connect. There are way too many characters that don't serve much purpose other than to fill up time. None of them is particularly interesting or likable. There is a completely useless second Nicholson's character and the scenes with him just didn't make sense. Okay, I get it - the fact that Las Vegas' casino owner and the president of the US are played by the same actor should somehow convey that the two have the same mentality - oh, big deal. I don't even want to guess what were Danny DeVito and Tom Jones doing there. The storyline is disjointed and a lot of scenes are illogical or plain stupid.Art design is bad as well. The colors are all over the place, not something you'd expect of a typically monochromatically oriented Burton. He usually uses colors only to emphasize something nasty or sinister. Was this entire film nasty or sinister? Cinematography is also bad to the same end. It is uneven and some colors stand out too much.Special effects are made to look trashy. Okay. But they are also irritating. The perspective, the animation, the composition with footage show total disrespect for physics and put a lot of strain on a human eye and perception. Suspect of disbelief is in overdrive here.The very direction, that was the primary Burton's responsibility, is also uneven. It's fighting with the script, lousy actors' deliveries (not entirely their fault) and uncertainty whether this was supposed to be an action movie, a comedy or a satire. Ultimately it was none of these. It was a mess.Some people will appreciate ""Mars Attacks!"" as a parody. I know I have back then in 1996. Since then I forgot the films this one was parodying. Some will appreciate it as a satire on American society and I'm okay with that. But that satire was rather shallow and predictable and it didn't really hit where it hurts. Nobody will appreciate this as an action movie. It was not.The die-hard Burton's fans will argue that all of the things in it were deliberately put there, that it was an homage to 50's trash sci-fis, that there is a lot of subtle symbolism to be found in it and that Tim Burton knew what he was doing as he (usually) does.I'd say he just had a really, really bad day at work. He was gambling with a high budget production, and almost lost. The American audience was right this time and the Europeans saved the film for no good reason.",Mars Attacks!

Since I regularly watch these kinds of movies, for example the work of late and great Ed Wood, I know the settings and the plot quite well, and most of the things in Mars Attacks! are spot on.The cast is truly remarkable too. Never has so many actors fought for so little screen time without over-acting. Jack Nicholsson almost manages to steal the show with his two characters, but there are lots of other actors doing various roles, ranging from Pierce Brosnan as the sophisticated scientist(smoking a pipe!), Danny de Vito as a lawyer, Tom Jones as himself, Natalie Portman, Tim Burton's girlfriend Lisa Marie, Glenn Close, Michael J Fox(yay!) and quite a few others I've missed.The effects are cheesy but well-made. Multi-coloured skeletons from multicoloured alien ray-gun blasts, flying saucers which are truly that(flying saucers), and lot's of pyrotechnics.The aliens are really cool and come straight out of one of the cultiest of all 50's movies(I've sadly forgotten the title).

162,GuyCC,"A Blatantly Deliberate ""B Movie"".",7,1 May 2001,"Up front: I am a Tim Burton fan.  I like think his visual style is among modern American cinema's best, and I enjoy his quirky oddball hero stories. ""Mars Attacks"" is a mixed bag for me, but I get the jokes.Tim Burton must have been at a point in his career where he just sat back and said to himself: ""I want to make a fun movie for me.""  If this isn't how it came about, that's how it comes across.  I know enough about the old trading card series to know that he pulled some of the best jokes from them, and the alien's attack on Earth is pretty much just gleeful mischief.  It's the same kind of sadistic enjoyment that a kid would have kid burning ants with a magnifying glass.  I can't believe the number of celebrities that came together for this movie. A lot of cult movie actors, as well as Burton's regular film castings make an appearance in this movie, and the way they overact and overdramatize everything, they seem to be having as much fun as the director.As I said in my header, this is a deliberate ""B Movie"".  The special effects are cheesy.  The acting is over the top with silly lines.  Everyone in charge doesn't seem that particularly bright, and it's up to a teenage kid to save the world.  The main thing I had an issue with is how they finally stopped the aliens.  One one hand, it was really funny (Kind of reminded me of ""Killer Tomatoes"").  On the other hand, it seemed to be pulled out of nowhere, and what an odd weapon.  Still, I laughed at the absurdity.It's funny this came out the same year as ""ID4"".  Intentional or not, it served as an amusing side parody.  Not my favorite of the Burton films, but the impressive cast list and utter silliness makes it worth an occasional watch.",Mars Attacks!

166,Wilbur-10,"Like a centrefold - big, dumb and empty-headed.",5,9 January 2001,"I'm loathe to criticise Tim Burton's work as he seems to have so much enthusiasm and passion. He doesn't mind not conforming to audience expectations ( 'Batman' ), or tackling off-beat projects which other directors would avoid ( 'Ed Wood', 'Nightmare before Christmas' etc.). Praise aside, the fact remains that good directors still make some poor films - 'Mars Attacks' is poor at best.The film is a big-budget, effects laden, homage to the Sci-Fi films of the 50's, where Earth was under continual attack from a variety of fiendish aliens. Set in the present day, 'Mars Attacks' follows in comic-book style an invasion by Men-from-Mars, and the resulting chaos this has on a cross-section of stereotyped characters.The effects are excellent, the premise full of potential, and the cast top notch - but the film stumbles to such a degree that its conclusion is met with the same sighs of relief as the 'B' films it is sending up.The cast is impressive to say the least ( rivaling 'A Bridge too Far' which was a similarly empty effort ), but few characters are fleshed out to any degree and roles seem to have been written around whichever star name offered their services - a policy which deals death blows to the script and narrative. Jack Nicholson, Glenn Close, Michael J. Fox etc. all jump on for the ride but get in each others way and end up as dumb 1-dimensional characters - only Sylvia Sydney manages to put any real meat into her role.The film is reasonable lightweight entertainment, but it promises so much more. Tim Burton has worked hard to get himself into the privileged position where he can indulge his film ideas - if 'Mars Attacks' is the result then success has indeed been a double-edged sword.The resulting film is simply not funny, and the story drags tediously - 'Mars Attacks' fails as a spoof, a comedy, an action film - you name it.",Mars Attacks!

Well, after I watched it, I couldn't help asking myself: ""what kind of a comedy was that?"" Apparently a satire, Mars Attacks! fails due to a bunch of factors, that, taken together, don't help the movie at all.This Burton ""comedy"" automatically assumes that, because it's a parody, it'll be funny. But it isn't. It's very hard to laugh during the film. A parody won't be funny unless the material is funny. It's not funny to see Jack Nicholson as the President because the role isn't written comically.Jokes are overdone. We see the aliens' ray guns turn people into skeletons. This is funny the FIRST time it happens. But with each recurrence of the supposedly comic weapon, it becomes less and less funny, and just dull. The same applies when the humans learn of a weapon that causes the Martians' brains to explode. It's funny the first time, but soon is used so often that it loses its effect.The plot of the film is just random. I couldn't really find anything purely satirical about it. The way I've been able to decipher it, it asks the question ""what if a group of people refuse to be assimilated? What would happen?"" But its done unsuccessfully.When it comes to acting, Pierce Brosnan is the only real highlight. Danny DeVito occasionally scores, but not consistently. And Jack Nicholson finds himself in an ineffectual (and very unfunny) double role.But the film does occasionally score when it comes to comedy. Just not consistently and not often enough.

The movie would, in my eyes, have been much better as a straight cartoon.The story is old-style SF horror, somewhat like ""war of the worlds"". So far so good. I am sure the script was hilarious, but a realistic massacre (of which there are several) is a realistic massacre. And too much violence doesn't make a good story in any event.Another weakness of the movie is the over-using of stars. The movie is littered by well-known stars, giving us a cavalcade of Hollywood stars being evaporated. This is silly, but not amusing, only a sign of a low-quality movie.The story is very close to ""Independence day"". They arrived closely after each other, making ""Mars attacks"" feel like a parody of the former.For the technical quality, I don't give it bottom ratings, but there is little more that is good with it.

May be in 1996 or few years after, 'Mars Attacks!' is still fine and exceptional for viewers but it's boring and silly when viewers watch these days. In other words, this movie gets old for young generation.The storyline itself is more like B-movie. It has no heart and chemistry between their entire casts. I have no idea what was Tim Burton purpose by directing this poor movie. It's one of his worst movie I've ever seen, even worse than 'Dark Shadows'. The only thing that could save this movie is their casts. They didn't act remarkably though but it's fun to see star like Jack Nicholson, Glenn Close, Annette Benning, Pierce Brosnan, Danny De Vito and Michael J. Fox in a movie.

Overall, 'Mars Attacks!' is not a film that audience would enjoy nowadays, the more years you watch it, the more you dislike this movie.

It's nothing more than just the same old corny, over-the-top acting and deliberately awful special effects (if one can even call them that) as the sort that director Tim Burton is trying to mock. All it leaves you with is a thought that says 'it was meant to be like that' even if it is terrible.For another thing, it is disappointing to see such a stellar cast reduced to such pointless acting. It's such a waste of talent to put Nicholson, Close, Brosnan, Benning among others in a film where rookies picked randomly off the street could do the same job for a much lower wage.And the film itself is difficult to watch because the direction and the script are truly awful, but it just leads me back to the too-oft-uttered phrase, ""it's meant to be like that"". All it really does is alienate the viewer rather than truly draw you into the experience, either as a sci-fi flick or as a comic satire.I think it's fair to say that the cast and crew had a lot more fun making this than we have watching it. 2 stars out of 5.",Mars Attacks!
176,mercury4,Not funny,1,17 April 2001,"There is nothing good about this film. It tries so hard to be a black comedy. Like most of Tim Burton's films it is black dark. Mars Attacks! is one big spoof of 50's SCI FI flicks. It is also a spoof of Dr. Strangelove. Specificly, Rod Steiger's character.(Gen. Decker). This character acts alot like George C. Scott's character in Dr. Strangelove.People are always saying how bad some movies are, but the only people that I've ever heard say this are the critics. One Science Fiction movie I can compare this to is Plan 9 From Outer Space. Plan 9 is labled as the worst movie of all time, but it's so much better then Mars Attacks. Mars Attacks gets vaporized by any SCI FI movie in my book.Better luck next time Burton.",Mars Attacks!

This movie parodies the classic science fiction movies, Independence day, war of the worlds and Star Wars etc. Has a huge cast of popular actors with none of them getting the attention needed to really make them actual characters. Comedy wise it got a few laughs but I was a lot more weirded out at the strange visuals. One thing is for certain this movie is unique with it's aliens, the CGI really works with their design. The plot is bare bones and spends way too much time setting things up, leading to a rushed ending. Watch this if you are interested in the Alien design, if not skip it.",Mars Attacks!

I really hate to admit it, but this thing has really grown on me - so much so that I finally bought the DVD.When I first saw it, I wouldn't have given it more than a 4 out of 10, but after repeated viewings, I now give it a 9. I can't really say why, and I certainly can't justify it in any rational sense, but it all just works for me. The wry wit, the blatant social and political commentary, I find it all immensely satisfying.My confession's over, I'll do my penance.

The big stars die left and right, and earth is left to be repopulated with Mrs. Warren Beatty, a Las Vegas showgirl and Tom Jones! That's an interesting twist on Adam and Eve and Jane.

How about putrid? That's getting better, but not quite there yet.Vile. Yeah, that's it. Vile.

To those of you who think Tim Burton hit his low point on this movie, consider this. ""Mars Attacks!"" was an homage to all the cheesy Sci-Fi movies of the 50's and 60's. I think Burton knew exactly what he was doing. Obviously he has a soft spot in his heart for the director, Ed Wood. If you've ever seen an Ed Wood movie, or even the movie ""Ed Wood"" also directed by Burton, you'd know that cheesy sci-fi films are really a lot of fun. I think the problem with most people is that since the introduction to big budget special effects, people don't want to see effects that are less than spectacular. Honestly, I had not laughed at a movie in a long time before I saw ""Mars Attacks!"". ***SPOILER*** When I saw those cows on fire running down the street, I knew I was watching a classic movie. **END OF SPOILER** All I'm saying is don't go into this movie thinking of ""Star Wars"" or ""Star Trek"".

It was a joke and a funny one (my siblings and burst into laughter at the sound of ""Dakk, Dakk, Dakk"").  It drags in the beginning...but once we begin to get rid of the big stars, the movie begins to shine.  Love the casting of Joe Don Baker, Jim Brown, Pam Grier and Tom Jones. (The inclusion of footage from a Godzilla flick was great too).  Favorite moment from the film: when I realised that Tom Jones had a speaking part, not just a singing one, and was actually going to come to the rescue.  Jim Brown's tough ex-boxer was hilarious, made me feel like I was watching Slaughter or Three the Hard Way.",Mars Attacks!
186,CutUncut2021,Visionary pre-Covid romp,9,10 January 2021,"Remarkably apposite today in the aftermath of the ignoble storming of the Capitol: in one fell swoop with this Bush-era romp Burton encapsulates the entire fleet of American inanities and illusion of self-worth. The least offensive character is the deliciously ditzy Sylvia Sydney in her retirement home with the stuffed cat and her LP of Whitman's Indian Lovecall. A homage to Kubrick's Dr Strangelove and all those hammy 1950s sci-fi television series, even referencing Lumet's Failsafe, but also a riotous snub to all the movies in which the US saves the world (Independence Day, War of the Worlds, and the like). While the stateside stars clearly delight in the parody, the visionary overlapping ironies compound with the parallels between the Martian invasion and the current Covid-19 virus depopulating the planet with complete disregard for the protocols of democracy and the parade of self-appointed spokespeople. Burton takes the mickey also out of romance with the Brosnan/Parker equation and the sexist pap fed to the American public for decades. Martin Short and the gum-chewing inflatable moll with nothing to say goes even further into the American male psyche: ""They call this the 'Kennedy Room', pretty nifty, huh?"" The sacrilege continues unabated with the ensuing invasion of the White House, where it takes two shoot-up game-playing kids to show up the inadequacies of the President's protection detail and National Guard. The power of money in Vegas is likewise ridiculed. And what an elliptical stroke of genius to engage Tom Jones. The relatively low vote for this film suggests that most reviewers are white 'disenfranchised' American males offended when their sacrosanct yet vaguely understood ideals are lampooned. The finale on the devastated Capitol steps with a Mariachi band is the culmination of Burton's satirical look at his own country: the Proud Boys, QAnon, and the myriad Bundyites in every quarter of the ""home of the brave"". This pre-9/11 and pre-Trump romp has that evergreen pedigree of Groundhog Day. Let's not forget, ""We come in peace, we are your friends.""",Mars Attacks!

If you are after a plot-filled Sci-Fi adventure that will cause meaningful discussion on the Earth's relationships with distant beings....this is not for you. If you like a cheeky pup of a director using endless big-name stars to decorate a film devoted to excess then stay tuned. Tim Burton is a genius when good (Edward Scissorhands and The Nightmare Before Christmas) but he walks on very thin ice. For quite a lot of this film Tim has one foot, at least, getting very wet and very cold. Thankfully there are enough superbly memorable moments to justify the expense and our time.

189,guskeller,One of Burton's best,9,19 October 2021,"Although it isn't often discussed, Mars Attacks! Is one of Tim Burton's best films. This is because it has the budget for all his creativity, yet isn't so preoccupied with image that it loses relatability. The story of an alien invasion is classic and ambitious, but there is enough heart peppered throughout the script to keep everything grounded. Meanwhile, the movie is very funny and stylish in ways that suit Burton best. Mars Attacks! Has a distinct retro-futuristic production design that Burton brings to life and makes the film unique.The look of everything is fantastic but it is the star-studded cast that is the most eye-catching. Mars Attacks! Is filled with bona fide A-listers like Jack Nicholson and up-and-comers like Jack Black. Additionally, the score perfectly captures the nostalgic homage of the movie, and the special effects are an excellent blend of CGI and practical (which synergize well). This helps unify the outrageous supernatural with the emotional accessibility. Balancing camp is always a tough act but Mars Attacks! Nails it flawlessly. Appropriate doses of humor and vulnerability, thorough vision, and skilled craftsmanship make this a movie for all audiences.Writing: 7/10

190,Chris-332,Tim Burton Lite.,8,3 December 1999,"Okay, let me start out with this. There are two boxes you could fit in with Mars Attacks. You either loved it and thought it was hilarious, or you hated it and were disappointed in Tim Burton. I am in a box, the one where you like the movie. Sure, it got a little too over-the-top, even for a movie trying to be over-the-top, and it didn't have the usual Tim Burton feeling to it that we have come to love. Still, the movie was hilarious! It made fun of every bad sci-fi movie of the '50's, and it was funny how they got such well known actors to play extremely pointless characters, such as Danny DeVito and Michael J. Fox. The movie had hysterical music done by the great Danny Elfman, and the acting was amusing because of everyone purposefully overacting. I really thought that the movie couldn't have been done better. I can't believe that some people thought that the movie was supposed to be a serious movie. I read one review where they were comparing this movie to Independance Day. Come on! Please don't tell me that they were actually serious when they wrote that. This movie was funny, a little misconcepted at times yeah, but still another good Tim Burton film.",Mars Attacks!
191,ivony,Could have been so much more...,7,21 May 2003,"When I first saw Mars Attacks! I admit I absolutely HATED it and thought it was the dumbest movie I had ever seen.  Amazingly, I initially found Ed Wood's ""Plan Nine From Outer Space"" more entertaining.  I'm not entirely sure what prompted me to do so, but I gave it a second viewing.  Don't get me wrong, I still thought it was dumb, but I had a better appreciation for the movie in general.With an incredible star (and talent) packed group of actors and actresses, the movie was still missing something...an incredibly big something. Although I enjoyed the nod to sci-fi's of the '50s and the B-movie type stylings, it still was not able to deliver.  Maybe it was the push of the ""big named actors"" to make this seem like it was going to be some phenomenal hit, or the fact that those same actors never quite played up to THEIR potential.  But what I really think caused the problem was the incredibly bad timing.  No, not in its release, but in the movie itself.  So many jokes fell flat simply because they were delivered far too late, and the use of comedic repition was, well, *too* repititious.  I think many viewers who are die-hard fans of b-movie or 50's sci-fi will probably appreciate Mars Attacks much better than I.  And although it has some entertaining moments, it just didn't quite become what it could have. I give it a 5 out of 10 stars...it truly was just mediocre.",Mars Attacks!
192,kimcoxmonm,A blast with a blast from the past.,8,26 September 2021,"I just love this movie!! It's a cult classic and unless you are a Tim Burton or fan of the litany of Sci-Fi abominations from the 50's, it's hard to appreciate his vision. I think if he had the time to fine tune it (thanks to the studio wanting an earlier release), it likely would have done better.Easter eggs abound and one of the best casts anyone could ask for. Many have worked in other projects of his. If you watch it as many times as I have over the, yikes, 25 YEARS since it's release, you still pick up on things.It's one of those rare movies that the Goofs could be taken as a ""goof"" on the blatant errors the old movies made, especially Ed Wood movies. It would have been hilarious if they added wires to the saucers that was so obvious in Plan 9 From Outer Space, for example.You know a director has clout when they can get the great actors, many of them still quite relevant now, to appear in an homage SciFi picture. To me it's only a bit dated by the handful of people that aren't in the limelight anymore or those who passed a while back.The funniest scenes are the little guys lounging in their tiny red Speedos (on humans, they are ghastly and, well, gross), their Ack, Ack, Acking and Grandma with her Slim Whitman music.You can't take this movie seriously, it's not meant to be.

195,jeuneidiot,Where is the line between campiness and spoofing campiness,5,24 March 2007,"Tim Burton takes an A-list cast including Jack Nicholson, Glenn Close, Natalie Portman, Sarah Jessica Parker, Jack Black in an early role, Rod Steiger, Michael J. Fox and several others and attempts to send up the cheap, campy science fiction movies of the 50 and 60s. I think he watched too many Ed Wood movies and had this idea spring forth fully formed from his forehead.Martians attack the earth, pretend to be friendly and then start zapping earthlings and wreaking destruction far and wide. My favorite part: When the martians get the translator machine and carry it around with them shouting, do not run, we are your friends, while simultaneously zapping everyone they see. It's campy and clichéd as was intended. The question is though, what makes a spoof of something superior to what it is spoofing? This movie is like green jello with shaved carrots made in a mold to resemble a clover and served at an upscale party to mock the parochial bourgeois of the midwest and Utah. Everyone has a good laugh and samples a bit to understand what it means to have such poor taste. But all said and done, it is still green jello with carrots shaved into it, and it's not that good and it is midwest potluck food (I've lived near Des Moines and Salt Lake City and know plenty about jello) and although done in the spirit of mockery or spoof, doesn't taste any better than the real thing which wasn't that good to begin with. 5/10",Mars Attacks!

200,crystallogic,"Surprisingly, a real treat -- a genuine loving parody",7,1 August 2018,"I first saw this movie when I was sixteen or so, not long after it came out on video. I feel sure the people who rented it only did so because of the ""A-list"" actors. I don't think they really ""got it"" and, at the time, I'm not sure I did either.over the years since then an interesting thing happened: I ended up watching this about four more times, twice when it just happened to be on and twice (the most recent times) through personal choice. It's safe to say that the damn thing just grew on me like insidious Martian mould. In 1996, I was really into science fiction, but more the ""literary"" stuff than silly old movies. I was a bit pompous about it all, in fact, so while I did kind of get a kick out of the movie the first time, mostly I just thought, ""well, that's pretty silly, and surprisingly -- old-school!"" and never really gave it much more consideration. With each subsequent viewing though, my immersion in old SF televisual classics and so-called b-movies had grown greater and certain things about this movie started to make a kind of ghastly, irreverent sense. I choose to just forget about the film being based on some old trading card series; I don't know anything about them, and maybe I'm missing out on something, but I think mars Attacks! works very well regardless as a kind of send-up of very serious and grave 50s and 60s low-budget SF ""schlockfests"".The funny thing is, I like a lot of those old movies, and I like them unreservedly. I don't find the form to be automatically ""cheesy"", too talky, too earnest, or anything like that. And I'm not a huge fan of parody for its own sake. usually, in fact, it leaves me cold at best, and a bit angry at worst, as peoples' hard work and dedication is lamppooned for a new generation with little sense of taste or respect. It's easy to be really contemptuous about mars Attacks!, and I think that was part of my initial impulse. I just didn't see the point in putting an ""a-list"" cast and director to work on what was essentially a copy of a plot from a 1950s B movie. Jack Nicholson's salary from this film alone might have financed two of those pictures!But then I thought about it a bit more. 1996 was the year Independence Day came out, too, after all. And what was this movie, this ridiculous blockbuster with the at-the-time state-of-the-art special effects and jumped-up movie stars, but a retread of 1956's Earth VS. the Flying Saucers? In fact, what were a lot of these big blockbuster movies but more expensive takes on what guys like Roger Corman, Val Guest and, yes, Ed Wood, had already done? Were they better just because they had a whole lot of money spent on them? NO!So, mars Attacks! is different because it's bald-faced about it, and that's really the extent of the parody. The more things change, the more they stay the same. The actors here know they're in a silly movie, and they're allowed to have fun. Nobody's expected to pretend this movie is anything other than what it is: a total unrepentent blast from the past.Sure, the ending is completely retarded. But it's ok as it's totally in keeping with the form! I like the build-up a lot. I enjoy the ridiculous stereotype characters, especially Ron Stiger's screaming red-in-the-face, practically foaming-at-the-mouth warmonger general. Jack nicholson as US President is so grave and sincere, it's hilarious; bang-up job from him, too. And there are so many adorable little cameos, gags and tributes. The music is nothing but loud warbly electronics done on an old synthesiser and it's the kind of thing that's both a terrific call-back to films of yore and something to annoy bothersome houseguests with. Tim Burton and Danny Elfman seem to have this relationship of trust going consistently, and I'm glad they went with this score instead of the normal bombastic stuff from sci-fi blockbusters of the 90s and beyond. About the gags, there are just too many to list, and a lot of them are over so quick you could easily miss them. This makes the movie have a nice re-play value, though, and is probably why I was always tempted to re-watch it even when my initial judgment was ""kind of bad!"". I haven't even talked about the aliens. They're ridiculous and awesome. I love their perpetually pissed-off duck-quack talking. They seem to have a sense of humour even though they're hell-bent on killing everyone. And I'm sorry I can't remember the name of the IMDB reviewer who said this, but I just love the notion (which I just came across the other day here after watching again) that the martians set out to destroy everything ""uncool"" about humanity. I never thought of it like that before, and I think he might be on to something!I also have to respect that even though Tim Burton got together a whole bunch of top-bill actors, everyone was not only (presumably) on board with the project, but most of them agreed to get killed off in sudden and undignified ways. I don't think anyone's acting chops were exactly stretched making this movie, but I hope everyone had a good time and enjoyed their cameos and generic parts and laughed along when they were dispatched. This is a rare beast for sure: a self-aware and slightly smug 1990s movie that still managed to win me over and put several big grins on my face. Try it!",Mars Attacks!
201,Alex-Tsander,Comedy-Coated Subversive Sub-Text.,5,15 January 2009,"This movie certainly is not going to suit everybody. Its directors personal tastes are stamped all over it in such loud fashion that the result is a buzzing agglomeration of idiosyncrasies. However, if these characteristics are to ones liking, then it is a potpourri of fantastic fun.The colours are loud, the music is weird, the characters areas one would expectcaricatures. The Martians are wickedly sick. The office of The President is held up to ridicule. The secret service are amazingly shown as straight, efficient professionals and well-meaning vapid young men are billed as a joke. ""You must have seen a load of weird s**t in your life granny: people must have been scared when the train was invented"".One thing about the production which bothers me is that there are way too many stars! Why is this. Every insignificant schmuck in the story is played by a name actor. ""Rude Gambler"" ( unnamed ) who gets two appearances lasting about five minutes is portrayed by no less than Danny Devito. Perhaps this itself was a gag? Or there may have been some other thinking behind such a ""stellar"" cast, even that pun itself? I don't know.That said, it was a delight to see Rod Steiger reappear ( a surprise to me he is still alive ) as the belligerent general who urges the military option at every juncture in events.This leads me to the subversive backbone of the movie. It is a cliché in Hollywood movies that the military is gung-ho and wrong-headedly so. That peace is jeopardised by wild belligerent military men. A cliché that started to roll from at least as far back as ""Dr Strangelove"". In this story, however, it turns out that the belligerent general was right from the very outset. It is those who persist in believing their own fantasies of interplanetary brotherly love and peace who are disastrously wrong.The subversive message is actually more specific than that. It is that there is a dominant attitude in our culture which has it that if you treat folks from other places nicely they'll do the same to you in return. This movie loudly declares that to be self-delusion and just plain wrong. If you treat some folks from elsewhere nicely they'll turn around and burn you anyway.Time and again, the Humans insist on forgiving the Martians their murderous antics, until, ultimately, it's too late to do anything to avert catastrophe. This subversive message being underlined in bold type when we see a Martian running through the streets carrying the Human scientists' ungainly translation machine, shouting through it ""Don't run, we are your friends"" as his buddies blast everyone on sight! This movie boldly and courageously dares to declare that the dominant credo of today's media and political classes, ""peace through diplomacy"" is a fairy-tale itself.The movie is choc-full of gags, slapstick and visual invention. The ingenious plasticky aspect of everything Martian both harks back to the crude production values of old Sci Fi movies and potentially lends itself to spin-off toys. Although I don't think I have ever seen any. Specific movie references include of course ""This Island Earth"", ""Godzilla"" and various products of the Nineteen-Fifties. The final denouement is obviously a reference to the saving grace of microbiology in ""The War of The Worlds"", but in this case coming via a ""culture"" of a different kind.",Mars Attacks!

203,Serva,A wonderful and more realistic version of Independence Day,10,24 March 2005,"It's truly sad to see the people here that don't understand this movie and take it way too seriously. Mars Attacks is a parody of jingoistic movies like Independence Day and the likes of that film, and a brilliant such. I just love how in complete opposite to films like Armageddon and the mentioned Science Fiction blockbuster, it is the weak normal people with no real power (read: with no money) that come out the winners and get the awards in the end when the materialistic values around them lies in ruins - not the strong male macho heroes we're used to. The Martians themselves are so beautifully politically incorrect it almost hurts, yet in a good way. They have a passionate hatred for the most innocent beings they can find - such as animals and old people - and kill them every opportunity they get. And not once throughout the whole movie do we get an explanation to the Martians evil behavior, that's simply the way they are. Film-making-wise this is pure genius. Danny Elfman's music is awesome, and the special effects are really effective as well - just as fake-looking and cheesy as they should be. People complain about the story but there's really nothing to complain about, like mentioned it's a good story of underdogs and outcasts defeating evil through common sense, while the greedy, power-hungry and egoistic get what's coming to them.If you like Sci-Fi and have a sense of humor - preferably non-PC satirical and black humor like Monty Python, The Simpsons, American Beauty etc - then this is a film for you. Otherwise you should stay away from this one and go back to brain-dead films like Air Force One or Team America: World Police which don't need the viewer to think, where the current system is applauded and the reason that the day is saved in the end.",Mars Attacks!
204,beetle-259-554148,"Wow, this movie is bonkers...",9,16 October 2017,"Okay, so what do you get when you take War of the Worlds, Earth vs the Flying Saucers, Independence Day, and combine that with the mind of the director of Ed Wood, Beetlejuice, and Edward Scissorhands who grew up watching those types of movies? The result is Mars Attacks!, a sci- fi parody with an all-star cast; Jack Nicholson, Pierce Brosnan, Sarah Jessica Parker, Danny DeVito, Jack Black, Paul Winfield, Annette Bening, Rod Steiger, Natalie Portman, Lisa Marie, Glenn Close, Martin Short, Michael J. Fox, and Jack Nicholson!!Oh yes, this movie has stars a-plenty! This movie has more stars on Earth than you see in space!This movie is one that you either love or hate. I love it! Though there are reasons why I rated it 9 stars rather than 10. One reason is because a lot of the characters I wanted to see live don't survive. Hell, one of my favourite characters dies very early on.If this was another movie, the dated CG would've made me dock another star. But for the type of movie it is and for the genre it's spoofing, the now-poor CG works. In the '50s and '60s alien invader films that this makes fun of, the effects were dated in 1996 (strings visible that hold up the saucers, aliens obviously people in suits, etc). As a result, the effects in here being dated now unintentionally harks back to the dated effects of the '50s and '60s.One very interesting scene is when one of the buildings in Vegas is destroyed. In real life, that building was actually scheduled to be demolished! Tim Burton got permission to film the demolition of the Landmark Hotel and Casino from multiple angles and it's demolition was used in the film so when you it destroyed in the movie, it was actually destroyed (though no one was actually inside.).My mom told me that she saw this in the theatre and that it was the most terrifying movie she'd ever seen. Goes to show that Mars Attacks! isn't for everyone.So if you like Tim Burton, alien invader films, sci-fi comedies or even all three, definitely give this film a watch.Also, keep an eye out for the meat packing tycoon from Ed Wood, one of Burton's earlier films. He plays an investor in this film too.",Mars Attacks!

This is the movie that should have made the bucks, not the flag-waving patriotic idiocy of Independence Day.Jack Nicholson portrays the President as a man who is unable to come to any decision without asking everyone he knows what they think first. That sounds closer to reality than Bill Pullman's gung-ho hero to me.The ensemble cast is great, particularly the women: Annette Bening, Natalie Portman, Pam Grier, and of course Sylvia Sydney as Grandma.

However what if they just decide to invade earth simply because they are jerks and felt like it would be funny? that is where Tim Burton rolls in with mars attacks a movie where martians invade earth and kill us all only because it gives them a laugh or two.

210,keuhkokala,Shocking,7,13 August 2003,"When I first went to see this movie as a kid I thought this would be a silly comedy that anyone could enjoy. Then I was shocked to see loads of famous movie stars being killed by quacking martians. It scared the hell out of me, mainly because I had never thought some of those stars could die in any movie they were in. I thought it was quite scary.Now, when I´m older the movie looks a lot different. Director Tim Burton´s macabre sense of humor fits in this movie neatly. This movie is made to make fun of other Hollywood films and their usual cliches(for example an unarmed muscled man can´t be hurt, when a character ""dies"", his wife, who is hundreds of miles away knows something has happened to him and giant monsters can never catch a car driving away).This not a Tim Burton classic, but it´s still quite enjoyable, like all his films (yes, even Planet of the Apes). I recommend this to anyone who likes to see the American senate being blown away or else has a twisted sense of humor. And of course to those who like to see Hollywood films being mocked by a another Hollywood film with such stars as Jack Nicholson, Danny De Vito, Glenn Close, Michael J. Fox and even Tom Jones7/10",Mars Attacks!

212,constructionbob,It's not unusual...,8,11 September 2000,"If I could, I'd like to start with a rather interesting comparison I noticed.  IMDB (which I suppose simply recommends similar movies based on their broad themes) suggested 'Independence Day' if the viewer likes this movie.  Which I find rather ironic, considering the two movies could hardly be more different.  Oh sure, the plots are similar (aliens invade, good ol' USA has to find a way to defeat them) but the tones are worlds apart.  Where ID4 wallows in its annoying, cloying patriotism, Mars Attacks! sends it up brilliantly.Tim Burton's movies are almost uniformly strange in some regard, and MA does not disappoint here.  What other director would gather so many big hollywood stars, only to kill most all of them off in one way or another?  It's hilarious fun, depending on how warped your sense of humor is.  Here's a guideline: if you couldn't stop laughing at Lancelot's violent crusade into the Swamp Castle in 'Monty Python and the Holy Grail', then buy this movie. You will treasure it forever.  Otherwise, you will probably hate it.  The aliens playfully destroy things in the most deranged ways-or nonsensical, if it's not your thing.And hey, how can you not like a movie with Tom Jones in it!  Especially where he becomes a hero...along with the most banal characters the story has to offer.  Maybe this is some of Burton's social commentary...but maybe that's thinking too deeply.  This is either a movie you love or loathe, in summary.  Guess which side I'm on :-)",Mars Attacks!
213,Bilko-3,"Yes, we get the joke...",1,22 August 2001,"One of the problems that ""Second City TV"" had after its first couple of seasons was that it mistook observation for automatic humor.  They would nail an imitation of Joey Heatherton or Sammy Davis, Jr., but that was it. You were supposed to think, ""Yes, SCTV, these people are silly and you certainly have hit THAT nail on the head!""  But they never actually gave the characters anything funny to do.  The fact that the people parodied were exposed as being shallow and annoying didn't make the sketches any less shallow and annoying.""Mars Attacks"" is like that.  The idea was to make a really cheesy, third-rate sci-fi movie, just like in the Good Ol' Fifties, only to spend $20,000,000,000 making it.  Great.  It worked.  They made a cheesy, third-rate sci-fi movie.  But you get the idea that Burton wants to be praised for his Hip, Cutting Edge Cheesy Third-Rate Sci-Fi Movie.There's no actual plot line here.  But since it's a Tim Burton film, that is a redundant statement.  Burton is great at individual, quirky, interesting scenes, but he can't tell a story to save his life.Nicholson has a good moment when the President meets the aliens.  It's obviously written that the President is so dense, he thinks he can talk his way out of trouble and save the world.  Nicholson adds the feeling that inside the idiot is a decent man struggling to get out, and who knows that he is probably going to be killed but is willing to do his best.That's about it for this movie... well, that and seeing Sarah Jessica Parker in her underwear.Avoid at all costs.",Mars Attacks!

Well, I was really surprised when - after about five minutes - she started to laugh and from that she kept saying - I love this movie!!! She said she hadn't laughed so much since American Beauty. (Nor have I). Incredibly - disgustingly - colorful pictures, funnily overacted and over-directed scenes... really not the Farelly-type humor. It's laughing about America, laughing about bad American films. It doesn't mean you have to be non-American to be able to enjoy this movie, I think normal people can laugh at themselves.

It's mean-spirited and insulting and overall, very unpleasant to watch. This is a film that should not have been made, much less released theatrically. It is easily Tim Burton's worst effort. The only conceivable reason to view this movie is to see the all-star cast, although no one turns in a particularly good performance. If you find yourself in the mood to see an inventive, off-beat Tim Burton film, pick a different one. There are better things to do with your time than watching this movie.",Mars Attacks!
217,diogenes-858-449167,Classic Entertainment,9,2 November 2010,"One of my all-time favorite movies, and with a brilliant score by Danny Elfman (Simpsons). Mars Attacks! blends a brilliant script and clever storyline with outrageous 50's & 60's scifi chic and effects - and possibly the best cast assembled in the last 30 years of film. I believe Burton reaches a creative peak in making this 'evil vs mainly evil' black comedy. Cast performances are uniformly top-notch. Jack Nicholson, Glenn Close, Michael J.Fox, Rod Steiger, Sarah Jessica Parker, Pierce Brosnan, Pam Grier, Natalie Portman, Martin Short, Jack Black, Joe Don Baker, in fact the entire lead cast, all nail their roles with relish and class. I save the highest accolades of performance for two people in particular, though. Annette Bening and Jim Brown. Bening, as the flaky, gambling, buddhist hippy, dissipated reforming alcoholic wife of Art Land (Nicholson's 2nd character in the film) steals the show whenever she's on screen. Bening show's she's simply brilliant at bringing a character to life with a minimum of fuss and a maximum of entertainment. Her Alcoholics Anonymous meeting scene at the start of the Martian invasion is one of many pieces of her inspired comedy performance in Mars Attacks!Equally stellar, but in an entirely different way, is Jim Brown's ex-heavyweight champ, Byron Williams. Totalled by his separation from his wife (Pam Grier) and kids, for past crimes and misdemeanors, Williams is eeking out a living as a meet n greet doorman at a Vegas casino. His journey, of battling his personal demons and then the Martian horde, to be re-united with his family a changed man, gives the audience a classic moment of redemption. The Martian invasion sees him take a stand no other character in the story achieves - an act of total self sacrifice in the face of annihilation. And we're led to believe he's made the ultimate sacrifice, until the final few scenes. Outside the wrecked home of his family, the camera pans up from a pair of dusty sandaled feet to reveal a bruised and battered Brown, still wearing his dinky Egyptian breast plate and skirt, striding toward his home and the redemption he's finally earned. We're not told how he gets there, but the acts of courage, his beating the odds and being re-united with his family is what we're after, and what we're given . There were other heroes in this film, but Brown's character runs the gamut of human hardship (and the gauntlet of evil Martians), to get there, and he gives his performance without breaking a sweat. There are too many classic and iconic scenes in this movie to mention them all. Burton's vision, the efforts of his crew and the cast, have created a dramatic entertainment of satire, parody and fun. The amount of divided opinion on this film shows many people weren't ready to get it. It's a pity, because those who do get it know they're dining at a banquet.",Mars Attacks!

Its a poor film in many ways not for its special effects but for its horrible disjointed storytelling. The story kept changing from one scene to the next and I found this very irritating and hard to keep up. There were far too many subplots! Seeing Pierce Brosnan smoking a pipe was absolutely absurd, he was totally miscast as a scientist and as for Tom Jones, keep to the singing mate!

221,jack_thursby,A festival of dreck,1,26 June 2005,"I was really looking forward to this movie because it seemed like a cool sci-fi spoof with a great cast. Even better, I noticed that ""Mars Attacks!"" was being shown on cable in a late-nite time slot -- the best time for watching a flick like this.However, my pleasure quickly turned to pain as I actually began watching the movie -- it started out slow and unfunny and did not deviate from that course one iota. I'll say one thing in favor of ""Mars Attacks!"" -- it is consistent. Nothing works on any level at any time; it doesn't work as a spoof, parody, comedy, satire, etc.. etc... And it is boring, incredibly boring... and when something does happen, it is boring.I think the main problem with ""Mars Attacks!"" is that Tim Burton tried too hard and too seriously to make a funny little spoof movie when he is not a director of funny little spoof movies. Burton's successes are with stories that are a little weird, like Edward Scissorhands or Batman (to which he added a dark visionary element). He's not really a comedy director and ""Mars Attacks!"" really needed a lighter touch to make the material work.

223,doodah367,Burton pays his respects to the 1950's,8,3 October 2001,"Mars Attacks! Isn't so much a spoof of the famed science fiction B-movies of the 1950's rather than it is homage to them.  Director Tim Burton claimed to be a great fan of the genre, and with this 1996 comedy, he has successfully crafted a hugely enjoyable comedy while also paying his respects.The real stars of the show are the aliens themselves  their appearance alone should be enough to encourage laughter in the audience.  But their actions and private jokes simply excel expectations, and the way in which writer Jonathan Gems have managed to even go as far as creating a personality for the main aliens, mostly the ambassador, is particularly impressive.However, in addition to the aliens, there are also a Catch 22 type plethora of characters, each with their own quirks and reactions to the invasion, with an all star cast to back them up.  The way in which most of the characters are developed enough within the film to let the audience decide whom to sympathise with is note worthy as in many such disaster films with many different characters (yes Deep Impact, I'm looking at you) the audience finds it hard to be bothered who dies and who lives.  Jack Nicholson is impressive in his double role, particularly with his performance of Art Land, a sleazy Las Vegas hotel/casino owner.  Annette Bening is also convincing in her role as Barbara Land, a comically insane reformed alcoholic.The concentration on characters does lead Mars Attacks! to tread lightly around the notion to have an intricate plot.  It seems the coupling of Burton/Gems would rather comically destroy the worlds landmarks rather than develop any sort of plot intricacies, but to be honest, I don't think anyone cares.As well as tickling his audiences' funny bone, Tim Burton also manages to slip in a few hidden political statements of the contemporary government  the White House press officer's weakness for prostitutes may raise a few eyebrows.  Not only this, but the way in which the President calls all his senior staff down to some kind of war room and saying they `have to take charge of the situation', before only being prepared to discuss what they should tell the press, gives you the impression that Burton is working with some sort of political hidden agenda.But, after saying that, the film still remains to be very gung ho with the only other world leader, besides from the President, being shown in the President of France who is briefly portrayed as being hysterically foolish. Whether this is a deliberate poke at the nationalistic approach used in similar, more serious, disaster movies such as Armageddon' and Independence Day' would be up for debate, however.Mars Attacks! has been criticised by critics and moviegoers alike, but these people probably took it far too seriously.  This is a hugely enjoyable movie, and a must see for anyone who misses the days of drive-in movies.

227,vertigofan-3,Another sample of the mind of Tim Burton,7,17 November 2002,"MY RATING- 6.7Well, let's begin to say the attitudes and reviews towards this mov here in Portugal, were mediocre-good as it always happens with a Tim Burton mov.I wasn't that interested in this, I only enjoyed his Batman flicks, yet the other night they had it on tv, so I couldn't miss it. In general, it's a good mov, mildly entertaining, but not the best Burton has given to us.The starting point is, as someone has said, the parody of the old fears of 50's sfifi movs, the hysteria a la Orson Welles on alien invasion and dealing with the invaders. And Tim manages to do it well with his typical twisted view to show the hysteria that would cause an martian attack.We see a great deal of massacre by the aliens, runaways, different views on the attacks and some funny `experiences' like Sarah Jessica Parker with a dog's body or Bondian cientist Pierce Brosnan! In fact, the way of destroying the aliens come from an old tune from Sylvia Sidney radio! What a twist! Well, the mov has so many different stars, that only a couple of them create a whole new scene. Some of them appear in almost cameos- De Vito, in a minimum role, Anette Benning, as the neohippy wife of cowboy Jack Nicholson who also stars as the U.S President. In fact, only Nicholson and Glenn Close get the status of stars. Others include Rod Steiger (one of my fave actors), the now-adored Natalie Portman, a grown up Lukas Haas (from Witness), Joe Don Baker, the old lady Sylvia Sidney (loved her in the 30's movs!), Martin Short and attention to the silent appearance of Lisa Marie (Burton's girlfriend) as the female alien. Even Tom Jones appears to sing in the new world `It's Not Unsual' after escaping with Benning in a plane! Well, maybe his presence has somekind of meaning about not being unusual that some of these days we get invaded by aliens.Overall, it's a nice mov, it's not even the best of the director, yet a must to anyone who enjoys his mad sense of humor, like me.

229,giuliano-3,Tim Burton Attacks!,9,6 November 2000,"...everything that American society has become from the advent of the Cold War to present day. His portrayal of the media is perfect, everyone from Micheal J. Fox to Sarah Jessica Parker give great performances as television personalities. Any scene involving the combination of Jack Nicholson, Martin Short, and Rod Steiger is nothing less than brilliant. I could go on and on about this cast but will just simply say it is one of the best overall performances from a cast I have ever witnessed. Short of Jim Brown, but heck, even he was just supposed to be a struggling, over-the-hill ex-athlete with anger issues so I guess he fit the bill perfectley also. The mass amount of people (judging by the rating of 6.1 presently) that despised this film greatly baffles me. Then again, maybe it doesn't, seeing as how dumbed down versions of 70's T.V. shows bring in 40 million dollars on opening weekend while masterful works such as Ed Wood fade away within weeks or months not exactly racking up the ticket sales. People want to be entertained, and really don't want to think much during a film, and these days the only thing that matters is having a spectacular trailer anyway. If you build a trailer, they will come... And this is why I am willing to say Tim Burton is one of the two to three greatest directors of our (my) generation. Look at his filmography, there is not ONE film that you can pick apart and say its bad. He does not ""give away"" his entire films before you see them. Most people respond with ""Mars Attacks!"" which is why I'm writing this. I believe this to be on Tim Burton's TOP three list, right there with Ed Wood and Beetleguese. He has never conformed to the usual studio standards for a director, and it would seem to me that he has had to do a lot of wrangling with studios in the past to get what he wants on the final product. He belittles the government, executive office, army command, general American populous, etc etc in ""Mars Attacks!"" and I guess that's why the status quo didn't go for it. If you haven't seen this film and you enjoy good, dark humor, I'd suggest you forget what your friends have told you and go ahead and rent it. This is not supposed to be like Independence Day or Men In Black, it is a spoof on those films and other martian films from the 50's era.

I think this movie tried to do what 'Top Secret' and 'Hot Shots' mastered: being so saturated with jokes that even if 10% of them were good, you had almost non-stop laughs from them. But it failed in that respect. The jokes got quite lame after a while of watching, and you begin to get bored and maybe even not hit pause while you go fetch a glass of water.",Mars Attacks!
234,kheops,So good ! A great Tim Burton's movie,9,22 January 1999,"This movie shows that ""Plan 9 from outer space"" had a serious reason to be made : it lead us to this movie. It's a radical critic of the ""american way of life"". The government, the army, the pacifists, everybody! Maybe that's why it didn't work in USA. It's the anti-""independance day"". the strength american doesn't saves the world, it's its biggest weakness : the country music. Everything that sucks in USA saves the world. But this movie is overall a Tim Burton's movie, with the shiny colors, the characters are typically burtonian. we progress in his strange universe of freaks (martians experiments on their spatial ships) and strange characters (after Edward Scissorhands, Jack, PeeWee...). He doesn't like the total strength, the total ugly, the total bads, he prefers human beings, but in another and personal vision, his vision.",Mars Attacks!

I think that you have to have a good sense of humour, perhaps too much expectation came from the all star cast.

It really does seem like it because this must be one of the worst movies I've ever seen. It is not funny, entertaining or interesting in any way. I guess this movie had about three laughs and fifty sighs. It's kind of funny how bad this movie is, because if you have one or two stars in a movie, thanks to them, the movie automatically gets a little better. Here you had like 12 great celebrity actors and still it sucks. The script is lousy, the Martians are probably the high point of this movie, and they are not funny. I'd love every single person who liked this movie to try to tell me why it was good, because I just can't see how you would be able to like it. Don't waste your time watching this movie, if you haven't already seen it, because it is not worthy of your time.",Mars Attacks!
239,Celtic80,This movie is very demented....,6,15 August 1999,"I liked this movie, but you have to have the right mind to enjoy it. It is very demented, and some parts are funny, but it is slow and not to everybody's taste. Tim Burton always makes movies that I enjoy. They are just so different from other filmmaker's movies. Beetlejuice is still my favorite movie from him.Mars Attacks! is just a remake satire of all the low budget invasion movies of the 50s. You can see most things coming, but Burton adds a demented twist to it. Watching the Martian's heads explode like grapes are fun. Moreover, this is the 'only' movie where I have laughed at someone being killed by a chandelier. Many people die, and all of the deaths are humorous, so you have to have the right sense of humor.The acting in Mars Attacks! is just as it should be. Very bizarre. You do not really get to know the characters; but then again, the invasion movies of the 50s never really had any either. The all star cast should attract some people. Natalie Portman is in this movie, so that is a plus for any fans and a reason to see it as well.Be in the right mind when you see this movie and you will like Tim Burton's demented satire. If you do not have the right mind set, you probably will not. *** stars (out of *****).",Mars Attacks!

I do know, however, that if another director would have had his hands on this, it probably would have ended up a lot darker and a lot less funny. But I find a happy medium in everything so I take it for what it is. For what it is I give Mars Attacks a 10. For one thing the story is very well written and very witty. Second, this movie has the greatest aliens of all time. As a huge fan of the cards before this came out, seeing them look almost real is a treat. And third, the acting. Although I do think that some of the actors didn't need to be hear, Danny Devito had such a tiny part,  but for what it is the acting is great. My fav parts of te film are all of the parts when the martians are on, in the saucer especially. Although I would have perfered the martians to be stop-motion animation, the computer graphics of these guys are excellent. And the saucer scenes are a nice homage to Ray Harryhausen ( those are his saucers you know).",Mars Attacks!

At the end, our hero and his grandmother receive the Congressional Medal of Honor. (The CMH is only given to persons in the military, the Presidential Medal of Freedom is the nation's highest civilian award). Having said that, this film is a brilliant parody of all those b-movie sci-fi films of the 50's and early 60's. Pure entertainment. This flick did not take itself too seriously. I find it to be the perfect companion film to Independence Day (also made in 1996). You can't hate a plot where the Deus Ex Machina is Slim Whitman tunes. Overall, I give it 8 out of 10 for sheer entertainment value and laughs in virtually every scene in the movie, especially if you're a Boomer who watched all those old sci-fi movies back in the day.",Mars Attacks!
244,bfreilly,"For the love of God, RUN!",1,8 February 2006,"Let me cut right to the chase: this movie was awful. During the opening credits, I believed, like apparently many who have seen this film do, that ""Mars Attacks!"" was a spoof of the '50's horror genre and could actually be pretty funny. Unfortunately, as the movie progressed, I found myself feeling disgusted at how stupid this movie was. I laughed perhaps twice throughout the entire thing. Compared to movies such as ""Airplane!"", ""Naked Gun"", and heck, even ""Scary Movie"", ""Mars Attacks!"" seems forced and overly simplified.One of my bigger issues with the film was how bloated with star power it was. Jack Nicholson, Pierce Brosnan, Glenn Close, what were these people thinking when they were offered this script? ""Boy, this sounds like a great film and a great booster to my career!"" Thank god almost all of the high name actors in this film recovered from their bouts with temporary insanity and went on to better things; otherwise, they could be treading dangerously close to Halle Berry/""Catwoman"" territory.Normally, I enjoy the weird quirkiness of Tim Burton's films, but this attempt just makes me feel irritated and depressed. There is a certain something, a spark if you will, missing from this one that was so prevalent in his others. To sum up, this is definitely not the worst movie I have ever seen, but it is definitely up (or down) there. Avoid it like the plague.",Mars Attacks!

I kept waiting for the big laugh or the big effect or the big twist and it never came. The aliens were really fine animations but their actions made no sense.I guess I wanted it to be more of a spoof and less of a lame story.",Mars Attacks!

Martians have surrounded the planet with multiple alien warships and, after a failed peace treaty with them involving a dove released by a hippie, are soon invading every continent and country on the globe. The Movie focuses on many different characters as they deal with the invasion and the humorously cartoonish aliens. The cast in this movie is wonderful and features a slough of big name actors. Jack Nicholson Glenn Close Martin Short Pierce Brosnan Pam Grier Rod Steiger Micheal J. Fox and that's only naming a few. Tom Jones also joins our protagonists as a hilarious version of himself also on the run from the aliens.

Kudos to the man who drew that.So yeah, you got the typical cliché cast Jack Nicholson as the President. The obnoxious billionaire, The trailer park people, the dumb one, and of course the creepy CG Aliens who only know to destroy. And they attempt to reason with them....but they NEVER learn.

This film is for laughs and is spoofing the early 50's sci-fi films that some of us grew up watching. In the early film, War of the Worlds, the Martians were killed by micro organisms that were in our atmosphere. Here they were killed by Slim Whitman music. How about when the Martians were chasing people and zapping them while the ""translator"" machine keep saying ""Don't run,we are your friends"". The Martians like Tom Jones so much that they joined his back up singers. Every time I watch this film I see something else that's there for a ""joke"". Don't try to make this movie fit the sci-fi mold; just watch it for the spoofs and enjoy yourself.",Mars Attacks!
251,pcs3746,Best Modern SatireFilm,9,8 August 2010,"I am always surprised when I hear people panning this film. It is a complete hilarious satire on modern American life. The surprise of the liberals as the Martian ravage every thought they ever had of Utopian unreality is hilarious. And, the ignorance of the super elite government types of what is actually going on is so close to reality it becomes a sad joke that would not be funny if it were not so on the mark.Mars Attacks gives us a bitter/salty taste of who we probably really are and how screwed up we have become as a fractured, self centered, fantasy living society.When the Martians first appear, the President seeks advice from people who have no clue what to do. But, they do not hesitate to give powerful presentations of crack pot advice and in the end; the President is shown to be a charlatan of a politician who is so in over his head he can't see daylight. This is probably true of all people who get elected to that most high office.I also enjoy the way Burton shows the strength of the common, every day persons who care about each other and who seem to instinctively become heroes, willing to sacrifice themselves to save total strangers.Of course, the Martian steal the show. Their idiotic ""Brain with bug Eyes"" characters are completely without mercy and yet, they are shown to be cynically sympathetic, even to the point of almost shedding a tear before they lay waste to everyone in the room. It's hilarious.The scene where the Martian disguised as a woman in order to sneak into the White House is a classic. Martin short plays the philandering adviser so well, you can not help but laugh.Mars attacks is a work of high entertainment, excellent comedy, and biting satire. Originality reigns supreme as always in a Burton film. If you did not enjoy the film, you probably have a less than full understanding of American politics and society.",Mars Attacks!

Tim Burton assembled an all star cast who knew what they were doing (including Rod Steiger and Jack Nicholson, who both got started during that era...Steiger before) and sent up every Sci Fi movie made, including Dr. Strangelove. Tom Jones gets pretty thin after a while and his cameo was even good parodying himself (quite like Robert Goulet).

Instead of a hero-president who rides into battle with the troops, you get an incompetent politician who only cares about his approval ratings. Instead of cold, calculating aliens who conquer earth for its resources, you get goofy aliens who conquer earth for fun. And the secret weapon in this film is just as absurd as the one in ID, but this time there's no attempt to cover it up.What's more, you get two convincing performances from Jack Nicholson. This is highly unusual in fast-paced films, where I usually see Jack Nicholson playing a character, rather than the character himself.(criticism: The treatment of the Colin Powell character was rather tacky. How long is Hollywood going to continue doing this to black actors? I have to wonder if the epilogue was changed to avoid having it happen twice in the same film.)Watch ""Independence Day,"" and then while you're still on a patriotic high watch ""Mars Attacks!"" and be prepared to laugh your socks off.",Mars Attacks!

Only Nicholson as the president and Jim brown as an ex-prizefighter, make their marks on the film as characters.  (Nicholson's other character is unnecessary and doesn't work - Peter Sellers he's not.) It's a parody of the genre, sure: Independence Day mixed with all the '50s worst visual elements.  But even parody has to have some structure; this is a bit too manic and busy.  Nicholson gets some funny lines in (like after Congress is massacred: ""We still have two out of three branches, and that ain't bad""), and in fact the script works well as satire for the first half.  But after the attack begins, the humor gives way to... well, just a lighthearted version of Independence Day.  It's a replica, not a parody.  We see Mount Rushmore defaced, the Eiffel Tower melting, etc...  Where's the humor?

After the flying saucers lifted off from Mars, however, it all started to go down from there. Are those flying saucers? Is that a string holding them up?Later in the movie, the characters were portrayed as stupid people who don't want to believe that Mars is invading their planet.

However, instead of Earth's counter-landing on Mars (and subsequent destruction of the planet a la STAR WARS) and the giant insects created by the 'other world antagonists'--fitting for a film like this--we get doped-up, campy humans with equally funny deaths and lack of sincerity.

Martians are coming down to Earth and everybody on Earth is awaiting their arrival to make peace. When the Martians arrive, they do come in peace... but then a hippie releases a dove in glee and it scares the Martians so they start to run a muck and kill everybody. lol.

Also, I got a lot of laughs from this movie, it does have some really funny moments in it. That may be because it's so over-the-top but it doesn't matter. The CGI Martians are delightfully cheesy and so are the characters. Overall, it's not one of Burton's best films but that's not what it's for.

280,Jay-90,Mars Attacks! and Revives 50 B-Films!,9,12 October 2002,"The greatest aspect of _Mars Attacks!_ is that it is not supposed to be great.  The film was shot on a low budget, and many of the crew, namely actors Jack Nicholson and Danny DeVito, and director, Tim Burton, agreed to make the film as an homage to the TOPS Bubblegum wrapper comic series.The film works because it doesn't present itself as being more than what it is: a parody of '50's B-films.  Throughout the film, obvious references to those B-film classics, like _The Day the Earth Stood Still_ and _This Island Earth_, are present.  When the Martians land in Nevada (alleged home of Area 54), Burton reminds us of those famous scenes in which the U. S. army battles the aliens with crude artillery, matched against the sophisticated ray guns of their adversaries.  Because the sci-fi B-films of the '50's were infused with anxiety, precipitated by the McCarthy era, Burton plays upon this context when the Martians visit Congress and destroy every senator and representative in attendance (""We still have 2 out of 3 branches of government working for us,"" President Nicholson reminds his fellow Americans).  Aside from the riotous parodying which takes place, the film draws upon a cast of Oscar-nominated talent.  However, realizing their true motivation for such a film as _Mars Attacks!_, Oscar nominees Glenn Close, Annette Bening, and Jack Nicholson camp it up.  Immediately, an audience member acknowledges that these actors know the Academy will not reward them for their efforts in this film.  However, an informed audience member would see that their acting, meant to be campy and hammed up, is at the heart of their performances.  Given the fact that these are award-winning actors acting poorly, any viewer would have to applaud the performances as ""sheer talent-less.""I give this film 9 out of 10 points.  While not a great film, by any stretch of the imagination, it is a fun film which fulfills its purpose.  Nicholson, DeVito, and Burton can be pleased with the results of their desire to bring the famous TOPS story to the screen.  In an age in which Hollywood either promotes lavishly expensive, high-tech scripts or promotes artistic plot-driven storylines, _Mars Attacks!_ finds its own place and does not put on the facade of being something other than it is, an homage and revival of the classic '50's sci-fi B-film.",Mars Attacks!
281,dnroth,Ridiculous (but in a very funny and good way),8,20 August 1999,"This farce of old bad sci-fi (a la Ed Wood) is a welcome diversion to reality. It's flashy, it's mind-numbing (in a very good way), and it hauntingly keeps your eyes on the screen. It's also anti-climactic, but hey, doesn't that just help the farce to be more closely tied to its basis?I do think that the film can be taken somewhat seriously, but it shouldn't be in that thumb-your-nose-at-the-world kind of tone that so many critics unfortunately use. I love the large assembly of performers that Burton compiled that just go to vault the spectacle of the whole movie into the ridiculous. That's a good description of the movie--ridiculous (but in a GOOD way).The whole movie has an overblown feeling to it. Everything that happens is comprehended to be an impossibility, and I reacted by laughing. It is humorous, but it is not a movie to search for one-liners in. It's the idea behind the movie, and not the dialogue, that makes the movie humorous. The martians are evil, and humans simply can't or don't want to comprehend that. Tim Burton used that idea to present the film in his own bizarre way.Just ""SEE!"" it.",Mars Attacks!

With a stellar cast and Tim Burton directing, I'm not sure why I didn't like it better. It's a nice pastiche of 50s horror movies, but it wasn't particularly funny, at least in a laugh out loud sort of way. It's not a bad movie but feels sort of flat. I can't really put my finger on why it didn't work better for me. Unfortunately, it's lesser than the sum of its parts.",Mars Attacks!
284,resadote,Why does everyone find this so funny?,4,9 December 2005,"I can't help but cringe when people write reviews such as ""I loved this movie. It totally rocked!"" Well, it doesn't take a brain the size of a martian to realize that this movie is not the great satire it's cracked up to be. First of all, the characters were completely static, save a few. By the end, Burton effectively kills off any character I was remotely interested in. Also, I can't help but wonder if this movie is just a stupid scheme to boast 1996 special effects. Past the first half, there is NOTHING plot-wise that takes half a brain to synthesize. In the beginning, at least there was some discussion on the aliens' bodies and why they were hostile towards doves, but those questions never got answered or even fueled. Lastly, this movie cannot hope to illustrate any morals or hidden messages. If it's supposed to be funny when you see a human being vaporized as he clings to his dying wife's hand, then someone here has a problem. Is it Tim Burton? The bone-headed producer that approved it? Or is it with us audience members? If humans can laugh at other humans being murdered by child-like visitors from space, then maybe we really do deserve to be vaporized. After you, Burton.",Mars Attacks!
285,Summerland,Holding fast to comic-book traditions.,8,27 October 1999,"Mars Attacks does a great job balancing the new special-effects craze with old-fashioned, comic-book style science fiction.

Mars Attacks reminds us that the sci-fi genre was built upon fantastical, 'space invaders' type stories.",Mars Attacks!
286,pwoodring,Too many for too little,3,28 January 2011,"The opening credits made my jaw drop. What a cast!! Established greats alongside rising stars -- an amazing roster of talent. However, Burton simply started killing them off early in the flick in various unpleasant ways, mostly by incineration. Poor Michael J. Fox didn't even get in one good line before he was offed. I think my biggest objection to this movie is it's very poor organization and timing. There are two main devastation scenes, one of which occurs too early and takes away too much of the cast, and the other, longer scene, which is technically quite impressive but is devoid of either passion or humor. Satire or spoof, the plot is missing fundamental cinematic values such as pacing, tension and payoff (not the technical terms, I'm sure!). Jim Brown's unexplained and really rather unnecessary return at the end also seemed to be a major miscalculation. And I have to add that the aliens' exploding heads simply became dull after a dozen or so. In my opinion, Burton's low point.",Mars Attacks!

They tried this several times in hope that there is still hope of peace. On the other side, the martians understands this and laughing all the way to the human. They play along with human with innocent face and take all the advantage of the human misunderstanding or interpretation. Sometime you may think that a character will be the hero but then suddenly it will be killed by the martians without warning.

But, that's exactly why I like it. Mars Attacks! is reminiscent of the classics 50's science fiction films, when Hollywood was more concerned with being entertaining than making sense. And that was the spirit of Mars Attacks: entertain, but don't be afraid to be strange. I mean, the martians are killed by ""Indian Love Call"" for crying out loud! Again, not for everyone.

Even after a violent first contact we remained optimistic. If you think about us as humans, would this not be how we would respond? In ID4 their ships were stationed above every population center, meaning their intention was to attack. In Mars Attacks, they sent one ship to Earth, and played on man's gullibility. In a lot of ways, this film was rather realistic (outside the parody and the defeat of the Martians), and if you take that Martians, living up to their name, are all about war a devastation just for laughs. OK, maybe I'm getting carried away, but at least this film was funny, a good parody, good music, and still a lot more realistic in many ways than ID4 or the new War of the Worlds.",Mars Attacks!

Of course the story is ludicrious from beginning to end, what were you expecting, a documentary? I found it very amusing and NOT in a ""so bad it's funny"" kind of way.

300,chrisn-6,Tasteless and funny,9,1 August 2003,"I hadn't seen Mars Attacks for some time until I picked up a DVD from a supermarket bargain bin recently.On rewatching the film it still seemed as funny to me as I remembered it. It works at several levels.  As a homage to the clunky ""B"" movies from the 50s. As a parody of the more recent Sci-Fi extravaganzas with granite-jawed, wisecracking all-American but politically-correct heroes saving the Earth (yet again) and as a satire of modern American culture/politics/media.  It is also a black farce (rather than just a black comedy) with really nice bad taste.The actors all seem to be hamming it up to perfection.  The Martians are the antithesis of the wimpy Star Wars alien types.It seems that many Americans are uncomfortable with the film but that non-American audiences like it,  which may offer an interesting insight into national psyches.   The several comments that it is somehow a ""mean-spirited"" movie seem to indicate some shock at any assault on apple-pie morality - which is after all not a common occurrence in American comedies.9/10",Mars Attacks!
301,toyoshimad,"""Mars Attacks!"" spins aimlessly out of orbit.",4,15 October 2013,"Tim Burton's fascination with 1950s camp is without end. He was successful with ""Ed Wood,"" but in ""Mars Attacks!"" his homage to the cheesy sci-fi flicks of late night yesteryear prove less funny than the originals. Despite a cast of Hollywood's who's who (Jack Nicholson, Glenn Close, Annette Bening, Marty Short, Danny DeVito, Rod Steiger, and the campy addition of Jim Brown and Tom Jones) and updated special effects, the screenplay by Jonathan Gems is not a gem (pardon the bad pun.) Spoofing schlock isn't hard. The hard part is making something inherently funny (unintentionally funny...movies so horribly bad they were a comedic train wreck) funny. Gem's screenplay is a scattershot of gags. Some work, but for the most part fail. There are no lines in this film that are memorable. What proves to be the Martian's undoing is expected. At least in the context of hokey corn. Burton's cavalcade of stars never approaches the madcap zaniness of Stanley Kramer's ""It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World"" or Kubrick's social commentary in ""Doctor Strangelove."" Burton tries to incorporate some of ""Strangelove""'s elements. But Steiger is no Gen. Ripper and Nicholson no President Merkin Muffley. Nicholson also plays a sleazy Vegas character, Art Land. Tim Burton is a visual director. An art director really. He's never quite good as a man who understands writing, character dialogue, or nuanced acting. Actors are more or less props for his visual inventions, which are often highly creative. ""Mars Attacks!"" simply tries too hard. It's a spoof, but hardly a funny one.",Mars Attacks!
302,homerthefreak-786-658831,6/10,6,4 July 2016,"It makes sense that this movie was based on a trading card franchise, because that's pretty much what it felt like. It was as if they turned a bunch of the scenes from the cards into scenes in a movie and stitched it together into a coherent plot. Like a lot of stuff happens, but it doesn't really mean anything. Like for example, two people are captured by the aliens, and then eventually they die when the spaceship crashes, but they don't really do anything when they're on the ship. The cast was packed with stars I did not expect, but even they didn't really do anything. They were just there, in that situation. All this movie has is that at the end there's a basic conflict resolution, but until then everything going on just feels very random. It's never explained why the aliens acted peaceful for one second before attacking, or even why they're attacking. Again though, I can't fault it too much on all of this because this does make it feel more faithful to the source material. That's the problem with having the source material be a trading card game. It just feels... weird... that this movie exists.Besides that, a complaint I have is that I feel like they should have probably made this movie with an R-rating. As I look at some of the trading cards the movie was based on, they seem pretty violent, and I think this movie would have had a lot more to work with if it was rated R. The aliens aren't even supposed to have green blood. It's red, like ours. Also, imagine Jack Nicholson cussing out some aliens.",Mars Attacks!

Tim Burton has deliberately tried to make this film so bad that it's good, but unfortunately doesn't quite succeed.  If the aliens had been obvious me in suits, or if the music had been just the odd chord here and there or the flying saucers hung from visible wires this would have been a fantastic film.

Most lines were in character and style, most actors over-act just enough to make it a hilarious movie. All well over the top. Good film. Rated it an 8",Mars Attacks!

It really is pointless trying to classify it any other way. Very, very clever indeed. Lots of in jokes and swipes at the mainstays of Government.Slight Spoiler ---One example would be President Jack getting literally stabbed in the back by the Martians he tried so hard to ""get along with"". There's even some deliberate continuity mistakes thrown in. Just before Jack gets stabbed, keep a close watch on his tie - you'll see what I mean.For me, Mars Attacks is entertaining, the comic strip style of direction never lags and all the names live up to their billing, until of course, they're toasted by the Martians.Good fun 7/10",Mars Attacks!

What made me come and leave a review this time was noticing that Jack Black ( Billy Glen) was the brother of the doughnut shop kid and he was putting the rifle together blindfolded. I am not sure what made me notice it, because Jack Black looks so different than he does these days (he's actually pretty thin and well built, it's no wonder I never noticed him before)Anyway, the more I watch this movie, the more it grows on me like some other reviews have mentioned and I can see that now and confirm it's truth.If you've never seen this movie, you absolutely must.",Mars Attacks!

We remember them in the 1975 Oscar winning ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"", and we cannot understand the motives behind their consent to play a part in such an awful motion picture. The fact that its total US box office count of about $ 38 m. is only four-times larger than the first week ticket count of $ 9.39 m. indicates that people have been mislead by the trailers and ads, rushed to enjoy a science fiction movie, but quickly spread the news that ""Mars Attacks!"" is a fiasco! One wonders why some film reviewers make such an effort to analyze and find hidden ""values"" in this senseless production. There is nothing to find. Some say that it is a parody of a science fiction movie. It is not! It simply is a quick setup to sell a very cheap product to uninformed viewers and make a fast profit at the same time. It could be acceptable for 10 year old kids, but the fantasy violence and some bad taste imitation of sexual scenes have rightly rated the film PG-13.

This movie is one of the worst I've ever seen- and I have one heck of a sense of humor, especially when it comes to bad movies.

I know everybody considered this movie as a big joke, a satire of ""Independance Day"". Someone comments : ""IT IS NOT A SERIOUS LOOK AT WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF MARTIANS ATTACKED EARTH!!!"". From my point of view, I THINK IT IS (even if I laugh during all the movie).Just think about it : What else example of cultural clash have we ? In 1492, when Columbus met Indians, the ""MARTIANS"" were the western people. And what did they do ? They claimed they come in peace (in the name of Jesus Christ) and killed or slaved everybody !!! Isn't it the same non-sense purpose that in the Burton's movie ?It's not the first time a SF-movie talks about this subject, but it's the first time aliens are not evil, but just CRAZY ! In fact, we don't understand nothing in their behaviour (Why do they hate birds ? Why are they crying during the incredible speech of Nicholson, and kill him one second after ? It's very clear the first problem is a communication problem.). And the funny look of these aliens brings us another question : try to imagine seriously, extra-terrestrials contact us. How can we handle the situation if they're green with big heads and use flying saucers ? Can we keep serious ?The only silly thing in the movie is the end. Burton could not (with a such super-production) make a sad ending. Too bad ! I'm waiting for a USA-SF-movie, where Space Invaders win the game and kill everybody. So, maybe people will understand what Indians felt in 1492.",Mars Attacks!
325,a-man-412-238911,One of Tim Burton's best.,8,4 January 2013,"Tim Burton, has done many movies in his career but his funniest film to date is ""Mars Attacks"". The film is a love letter/spoof of the 50's era of sci-fi B movies,(which viewed today would be laughable). The plot is pretty paper thin but too be honest it's a Tim Burton movie. A group of cruel and tasteless aliens decide to destroy the earth for shits and giggles. While the army and a gong ho general want to nuke the aliens, the president and his peace loving professor want earth and mars to coincide but the aliens don't really care as they enjoy defacing famous landmarks and killing innocent people. The genius of Mars Attacks is that it's a comedy,while most alien invasion films are serious and depressing, Mars Attacks makes fun of the fact that it's a bad movie and does it perfectly. The cast is really second to none,Jack Nicholson is great as both the President and as sleezy alcholic casino owner Art Land. Other cast members include, Glenn Close as a bitchy first lady,Pierce Brosnan as a professor for the white house that wants to analyze and have peace with the martians,Danny Devito as a rude gambler, and even a young Jack Black as a redneck soldier. Mars Attacks is a very smart and funny movie because it doesn't takes itself seriously. I know Tim Burton never talks about this movie, but I think that he should be proud of one of the funniest spoofs ever made.",Mars Attacks!
326,feanorelf,"It's satire, not spoof!!!",10,10 October 2005,"I enjoy reading 'hated-it' reviews of movies I like. Here most of negative reviews complain about it being a no-fun spoof, some compare it with Airplane, mentioned as a good example of successful parody. and yes its restless gags, and countless cinephile quotes make it a very funny movie.Mars Attacks is not Airplane: regardless what Tim Burton said about, Mars Attacks irony is not as much about '50ies movies: it is about STUPIDS, and, definitively, about how ALL mankind, with no exceptions, is stupid (especially US mankind in Burton intentions, I suppose).Each character in the movie represent a cliché, and let them be intellectual, pacifist or their opposite, tycoons, Machiavellian, ambitious: all of them are greedy and blunt idiots beyond redemption, and without redemption they get killed by the martians who find it incredibly easy and funny (even though, the martian themselves are not much better than us, the movie suggests).Some comments say the characters are unrealistically dumb... well they are dumb, but I still haven's seen in a movie or in a book such a high level of dumbness as to be unrealistic.So, you will find this movie simply delicious if you accept being laughed at together with everyone and everything that surrounds you. On the contrary, if you think your supposed intelligence is too sacred to laugh at it, you've best watch another movie.",Mars Attacks!

The point of this film is exactly that, its for the kid is all of us. The one that remembers going to the theater and rushing down to get a seat in the front row. Also I think that those who disliked it missed the fact that it is Tim Burton's homage to Ed Wood. Say what you will about Wood's work but I know you all watch ""Plan 9 from Outer Space"" and get a great guilty pleasure from it. So figure it out people. Its Ed Wood does ""The War of the Worlds"".

Who else could take 3 ""horses"" of the '70's (Brown, Grier, and Jones) and place them in this quirk context? Not to mention have them save the world? True greatness!Secondly, the Martian language.

336,Popcorneater,Interestingly Different!,8,10 April 2003,"As a Tim Burton fan, I was quite impressed with this movie.  Perhaps mostly because of how remarkably unpredictable it is in comparison to most of the Sci-Fi movies that are coming out these days.  The movie doesn't try to appear serious like ""Independance Day"".  Instead, it provides us with a comical ""over the top"" take off of all the rediculous movies of the same genre. The best bit is that they actually star famous actors such as Michael J Fox, James Earl Jones and Jack Black that are killed off in the first fifteen minutes - unlike most SFI-FI movies in which we know that the stereo-typical ""Good Guy"" is going to survive all the way to the end. In my opinion, this is one of Tim Burton's finest works.  The highlight would have to be the scene with the Martian Girl.  Danny Elfman's music once again sends a chill down my spine.  The only downside to the movie is it's boring ending. This movie isn't mean to be serious realistic; it is just a large group of proffessionals creating a movie that is fun.",Mars Attacks!

Burton makes good use of special effects to create a retro look with the aliens though it is odd that the film takes place in the present and all the military gear and uniforms are from the 1950's.

This movie is a secret weapon, your ace in the hole, the Easy Button, if you will, in the prove your-movie-buffness game of ""6 Degrees to Kevin Bacon"". Starring, among others: Jack Nicholson, Sarah Jessica Parker, Glenn Close, Alex P. Keating (oops...I mean Michael J. Fox), Jack Black (a somewhat slimmer and much less hairy Jack at that), and Pierce Brosnan.Did I mention Danny Devito is in it too? Burton once again creates a world unto it's own. It's a colorful mix of modern day with a 60's style. Sure, scientists can build a machine that translates the Martian language into English, but everyone uses television sets with bunny ears and volume/channel dials.Did I mention Annette Benning is in it too? The effects are so-so. The Martians are small and skeletal with HUGE brains to compensate for any shortcomings. They talk in what sounds like ducks barking. It is a language my roommate and I have adapted to help curb our swearing (thanks a lot, New Years Resolution #4). It's been working out pretty good for me, although I do fear the landlord will raise the rent out of suspicions I have taken in a new feathered pet.Did I mention the kid from Witness is in it too? Mars Attacks! is absolute farce with everyone and their mom hamming it up. Jack Nicholson chews the scenery and spits it right back out. Glenn Close demonstrates that she really needs to do more comedy (""103 Dalmations""...we can take the extra puppy, Cruella could use a spotted fur drink coozie). Sporting the finest First Lady bouffant hairstyle, she disregards her daughter: ""If you're going to be a pest, I'm just going to have to ignore you."" This movie is very corny. Very cheesy.

Some witty writing too. Contains some truly laugh out loud moments .. and nowadays that is a rarity. Nice to see Pierce Brosnan being silly, something which he should do more (works well, as soon to be seen in the Matador). Sarah Jessica Parker had not yet found her stride in this movie, but works OK. Jack Nicholson is, well, Jack Nicholson. Definitely a nice retro 50s style self depreciating science fiction movie. It may work better with people in their 30s and above as they remember actually watching the reruns of 50s movies :) Is that why it hasn't got a higher score on here as younger viewers don't get the in-jokes?

To casual moviegoers, it was okay, no better or worse than any other film that summer, but to fans of the cards and/or purists, this was no less than a travesty. I can understand why these folks reacted the way they did. As far as MA purists were and are concerned, Burton spat on the source material and made a mockery of it . . . a watered down kiddified version of the card series.

I consider this movie two hours of my life wasted...AND I am a huge Burton fan. So far, this and Beetlejuice are the only Burton movies I just cannot stand. I'm even a big fan of slapstick and this movie just didn't do it for me.I was really excited when this movie came out, with all of the great names in it, so the disappointment was all the worse because of the hopes I had for this movie.

The effects are half-decent, making sure they're not too cartoon-ey. And in regards to this movie being based off of TRADING CARDS, I'd say Tim did pretty good with handling the source material.And now, the bad. As much as I love the cast in this movie, it just kinda seems wasted. I mean, picture Danny DeVito, a football player, and Tom Jones trying to escape an alien-ravaged Vegas. As funny as that sounds, the movie really doesn't do anything with it. The same thing goes for Jack Nicholson's character being the PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES! You'd think they make a joke about The Shining or One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest, but they don't. You wait for the punchline, but it just never comes! And with all the stars, the movie tends to be a bit all over the place.

For those who do like it, in the aftermath of the real-life tragedy in Littleton, Colorado, let us not forget that what can be hysterically funny as a Hollywood special-effect is no laughing matter when violence involves real people.That having been said, I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.  The story is built out of cliche after cliche, but it's done so well!  The characters are archetypes.  For some characters we can name some actual public figures who are being caricatured.  The Martians are the ultimate villains we love to hate.  Treachery, homicide, and destruction are not so much a means to an end for them but a sport to be enjoyed.  In a sense the movie is predictable in that conventions of science fiction are followed, and yet the details are so creative. True to form, the Martians invaders are destroyed, but not until the toll of destruction to earth and its inhabitants is very great. And yet it's very satisfying, as the apparent moral of ""the meek shall inherit the earth"" is not only taken to a comic extreme, but made to be the logical outcome.  Everyone, human or Martian, who at the beginning was confident he or she was in control of his situation would be destroyed. Whether their confidence is in the use of weapons, their intellect, or the ability to make a deal, it would end in failure.  The people who made a career of smugly seeking peace and harmony with the universe would be among the first to be incinerated by the Martians, but those who would actually find it would be refugees from the depths of Las Vegas.  People who seemed destined for lives of poverty would emerge no richer than before, but suddenly having more than most. The world would be saved by the most unlikely hero and heroine.  They would receive medals from a teenaged girl who is all that remains of the government, and the national anthem would be played by a set of musicians who never before would have been invited to perform at such a ceremony.

When the adults fail to act, the nation is saved by a couple of black kids with skills learned playing video games. Everything in this film is expertly done, including the script, direction, acting, special effects, and art work. An under-appreciated classic.",Mars Attacks!

Mars Attacks proves to be a waste of talent and material of a film. There simple are too many things wrong with it. It's supposed to be a comedy, in commemoration of the scifi movies from de 50's and the 60's. But then it turns into something dark, and we don't know if it becomes a serius movie, or if it still is a comedy.  Honestly i don't know what Tim Burton was trying to show. Perhaps he will explain it one day. For someone that likes scifi this film can only be considerated an ultrage.Definatly a must not see to anyone who appreciates scifi and a poor tribute to the classic movies of the genre.",Mars Attacks!

360,Rosear,Tim Burton having random cheesy fun! What's not to like?,10,15 April 2005,"Two things should be clear about Mars Attacks. First of all, the fact that it's a Tim Burton movie, and secondly, the fact that most Tim Burton fans have something against it.The reasons are fairly simple. First of all, it's a pretty average sci-fi comedy, with cheesy dialogue and little to no plot. Most of the characters exist solely to be in varying amounts of pain. The special effects look terrible, the casting is seemingly completely random, and to top it all off there's random deus ex machina moments involving Tom Jones, of all people.Secondly-- people expect Tim Burton to write dark, Gothic fairy tales about misunderstood outcasts and pale moon light and blah blah blah melancholy death of insert-subhuman-Mary-Sue-here. If you look at any of Tim's movies though, you'll quickly realize that there's always, always, a definite level of cheesy humor in there. Tim likes humor. ""Vincent"" had humor, ""Frankenweenie"" was full of it, and it wasn't until Edward Scissorhands that there's even the slightest hint of serious drama in any of Tim's worlds... and even poor Edward was a good fifty percent slapstick and sitcom-y laughs. So Mars Attacks isn't in any way shape or form an exception-- the only difference is this time it actually LOOKS bad.On purpose, of course, say the Burtonites. And you know, it kind of is. The random neon-green skeletons, the catatonically brilliant gum-chewing Lisa Marie, the whole Poppy fusion thing, every bit of it is just Tim and his crew going wild with bad sci-fi clichés. The effect of growing up on Ed Wood's movies, or the happy whee joy of being back together again with Danny Elfman, or whichever the reason... everyone is just having random fun, and it shows. It's dead funny. And remarkably more coherent than would seem.Mars Attacks isn't a bad movie, at all. It's a random fun Tim Burton movie that happens to look hideously stupid. never mind the fact that it's based on some freak combination of a trading card game and, well, Great Glass Elevator... never mind that fact that Danny Elfman, after seventeen+ years of Oingo Boingo and two sad sad years without his favorite director, finally gleefully gets to use a whole positive butt load of theremins. Everyone working on this thing is happy, and everyone I've seen this movie together with agrees it's incredible amounts of fun.All that said, I can recommend Mars Attacks to anyone looking for a slightly off-beat space comedy. The cast list should have at least half a dozen stars able to draw you in, and you can trust Tim and Danny to join forces for... well, something not quite as good as the 1994 Boingo album, but close, very very close. Oh, and your kids will love it too. Go see!",Mars Attacks!

362,aloystscarlet,Mars Attacks!: One of Tim Burton's Finest,7,6 November 2013,"In Tim Burton's Mars Attacks!, a colony of rogue aliens contacts the human race for the first time ever, only for the human race to discover that they are in mortal danger. Now however grim this premise may seem, it is anything but. With grand performances from Jack Nicholson, Sarah Jessica Parker, and Jack Black (for the first 30 minutes or-so that he was on screen). This film contains an onslaught of all-star cast members, and although some of them remain a bit too satirical through out the picture, performances from Pierce Bronson, Danny DeVito, Martin Short, and Jim Brown make up for such an unusual base of comedy(and what the hell, lets throw in Tom Jones just for good measure). The CGI (computer-generated images) was also quite impressive, from the onslaught of saucers coming to our beautiful blue planet, to the deliciously addictive need to want to see the martians' brains splattered across the pavement (or even in their own helmets, just for the sake of less clean up later on). Tim Burton has definitely made himself known for his darkly artistic style and refutable casting options, but the great deity of dark comedy himself has really taken a big leap from his usual vision, and took on a level of directing I have never seen from the great visual artist. So luckily, despite a barrage of cheesy dialogue made cheesier and a boast of generally bland characters, Mars Attacks! is comical, greatly conceived and in many ways is a step up from your usual martian invasion parody.",Mars Attacks!

No one else as Tim Burton can make a movie with almost no storyline ( storyline is the biggest cliché ever seen) into a spectacle where you keep smiling and really enjoys seeing it . His enthusiasm just jumps right of the screen. It looks like he really enjoys seeing big Hollywood stars being killed in funny situations!The way Jack Nicholson is killed by the way . Or how or dear 'Mr Bond' head is 'screwed' of. Even the president from France is killed! the only thing that isn't that good is the ending. He really could have made a special ending, maybe he used the cliché ending in purpose but,... what are ya going to do about it huh ?Go see it , cause even if you hate it , you will laugh with Tim Burton's sadistic and morbid sense of humor!",Mars Attacks!
364,The_Bobinator,"Scary to some, funny to others",5,2 May 2007,"This movie is probably the most borderline movie I have seen in my life. On one hand, the style of Tim Burton, who started out as a Disney animator, is to make real movies as if they were cartoons. This is OK for movies like Edward Scissorhands, but the way the in which the martians slew completely innocent, harmless people in the most vile way possible may look fine in a cartoon, but is going too far in a live action comedy. On the other hand, Tim Burton did expose many of the age-old flaws in the government of America and perform a feat desired by most, but attempted only by few, the off-screen, humorous demolition of France. His style is artistic, yet sometimes questionable. His results are terrific, yet sometimes horrific. You can't live with him, you can't live without him. He's Tim Burton, and this is definitely a film most true to his character.",Mars Attacks!

However, it must not be compared to ""serious"" science fiction (as Alien), nor should it be understood as a parody of these (like Spaceballs). Instead, watch some of the really bad science fiction movies from the 1960s - the days when colours still had a rather artificial look, toasters and other kitchen equipment was being used for spaceship cockpits, and aliens visiting the earth to wipe out mankind used to be called a plot.

What I mean is that every big stars die and also the president(a little bit different from the two movies I name earlier). The movie also makes us see the Martians on a very different look by making them sleeping at work or by lying in every possible ways, by being hypocritical, that's why it shocks a lots of people who say ""I don't like that, it's different"".

The spaceships seen in Mars Attack function a lot like those in the 1950's movie. I think that Tim Burton was giving a nod to legendary special affects expert, Ray Harryhausen. The one exception is that Ray Harryhausen created his saucer effects utilizing stop gap animation which was state of the art special effects for that time in the 1950's. Tim Burton did not use these effects, but still a nod to a classic genes. Some of the resemblances seen in the Martian spaceship's are the overall shape of Tim Burton's saucers, the ray gun that comes out from the bottom of the Martian spaceship, the upper and lower sides of the disc of the Martian spaceship are rotating just like the ones seen in the EARTH VS. THE FLYING SAUCER'S movie.",Mars Attacks!

378,capteagen,Relax . . . It's Not Supposed To Be High Art!,8,11 June 2013,"I used the summary I did because I get the feeling reading other reviews that people were expecting SFX like those of ""Independence Day"" or ""Alien(s),"" etc., and were disappointed in not finding them here. In truth, I believe producer/director Tim Burton and the older cast members in particular knew exactly what they were doing. They directed the film at a general audience to be sure, but also targeted a segment of older viewers like me; the Baby Boomers who came of age at the height of the Cold War and the threat of nuclear annihilation, and/or accidental contamination by nuclear fallout or waste wherein the consequences included things as harmless as ""Blinky"" the three-eyed fish of The Simpson's fame, to atomic mutations on steroids such as the giant ants in the 50s thriller, ""Them."" I am the quintessential member of that target audience; I'm 57 years old, male, and grew-up on a diet of Saturday afternoon and ""late, late show"" television that often included a healthy (or unhealthy depending upon one's views) dose of 1950s SciFi ""classics,"" such as ""Earth vs. The Flying Saucers"", ""War of the Worlds"", ""The Day The Earth Stood Still"", the aforementioned ""Them"", ""I Married A Monster From Outer Space"", ""The Thing From Another World"", and others. Those were the high quality films; those with good scripts, good acting (e.g. Michael Rennie, Patricia Neal, etc.), and enjoyable, if not exactly believable, story lines. Then there were those of much lower quality, e.g. ""Zontar, Thing From Venus"", ""Beast With A Million Eyes"", ""The Crawling Eye"" (known in the UK as ""The Trollenberg Terror""), and others. The thing is, at the time people of my generation loved them all, regardless of quality. They were escapist fun, period; and sometimes the cheesier they were, e.g. ""Plan Nine From Outer Space,"" the better. One suspects that Tim Burton, two years younger than me, wasted a lot of Saturday afternoon watching such fare. We know Steven Spielberg did because he said so! Regardless, what Burton and the cast have done is that they created a very tongue-in-cheek and very campy homage to the entire 1950s SciFi genre. I don't want to be a spoiler but suffice it to say that there are sly, and some not so sly, allusions to much of the finest in 1950s schlock. I don't think this next observation will spoil anything, but perhaps one of the most significant, and I believe heartfelt, references to yesteryear is the appearance of the Martian ""flying saucers."" They clearly are meant to honor the work of the late Ray Harryhausen, the master of stop-action photography. Ray died only last month (May 7, 2013) at the age of 92, but his work as director, cinematographer, and special effects coordinator in such films as ""Clash of the Titans"", ""Jason and the Argonauts"", ""It Came from Beneath the Sea"", and ""Earth vs. the Flying Saucers"" just to name few, was considered to be the high tech leading edge of SFX in its time. Before the advent of today's computer generated wonders, Ray was a true wizard and even though computer generated graphics are used here, Burton's crew made the saucers look like the work of stop-action photography, which had to be something of a labor of love. In any event, while it may not be the be all and end all of film making, the movie nonetheless accomplishes it's goal of sort of taking us back to a somewhat simpler time, and doing it with equal parts humor and loving attention to cheesy detail.",Mars Attacks!
379,guitar-gal13,Weirdly amusing.,9,16 March 2009,"When I sat down to watch this film, I wasn't sure what to expect. All I'd heard was that it was quite strange, and then knew of a lot of the actors featuring in it (along with the fact it's directed by Tim Burton). Well, it being strange certainly was right. But, in my opinion, that is what makes the film what it is. Just the sheer ridiculousness yet brilliance of some of the scenes captivated me. The aspects of parody and social commentary stop it from becoming totally ridiculous and a lot of the wit involved in the film kept me amused. People who want obvious sense and meaning should possibly think before watching this film, but otherwise I would highly recommend it. My friend and I found a lot of the scenes were so strange that they had a high entertainment value and we also thought that the film is visually very effective. However, this film is best to watch with someone else, as then you can share the weird and wacky parts and they are easier to accept. Don't write this film off if at first you find it too weird and seemingly pointless; make sure you give it a chance and try to look for the amazing wit which can be found.

And if there are famous actors, you know they won't die, and if they do, it will happen in an heroic way by the end. This movies breaks all the schemes.You can't take anything for granted. Every person I thought ""well, this is the one"" ended up being killed! Until the very end you have no clue about who will finally beat the aliens!

Tim Burton the director uses this movie to in a satirical way to make of the United States government, army, and culture.

386,peacelandbread,Darkness within its loud colour.... A fun and surreal experience!,9,31 March 2005,"It took me a few years after the release of ""Mars Attacks!"" to actually see the said film. As I am a pretty big Tim Burton fan, I was wary that this would be an ""over - Hollywoodized"" attempt to simply garnish money via a flimsy film with an all - star cast. When I finally did see the film, however, my prejudices disappeared! I believe that ""Mars Attacks!"" is a brilliant motion picture. The more I watch this movie, the more little items in the background and sly secondary comments grab my attention. The picture is witty and actually fairly intelligent, given that it is a self - reflexive jab at the tacky sci - fie flicks of Yesterday. Nicholson delivers a stellar double - role as typical middle of the road populist President and also as a sleazy Vegas developer, and Michael J. Fox is darkly sarcastic and fun in what shall probably be, unfortunately, one of his last great roles in film. As for the directing, it is pure Burton. Delightfully hallucinogenic backdrops are a hallmark of this movie, and the scenery is an over the top display of loud colour contrast coupled with almost campy sound effects. There is a subtle underlying ""American Dream"" theme to be found throughout the movie, and the individual caricatures of the actors / heroes of the film are darkly amusing. These at - times twisted and wacky characters serve to work with the layout and bright imagery of the overall film quite well; I hold this to be an excellent synthesis of colour and camp, and together it makes for a fun and thoroughly watchable movie experience. From a U.S. Army General's inference that citizens opposed to universal demolition were ""peace - mongers"" to aliens with a dry sense of homicidal humour, this film is a nifty ride from beginning to end. And what an end.... You might be surprised! When the sun sets, I believe that this film is worth purchasing in order to watch it repeatedly, as little sub - jokes and playful scenery expound throughout. A brazen and fun accomplishment by all involved in its creation, ""Mars Attacks!"" deserves to be viewed again and again. If aliens ever attack our little planet, I can only hope that they do so with as much class and charm as their cinematic counterparts....",Mars Attacks!

Honestly, what other movie has a horde of evil aliens bent on world conquest who are defeated by playing oldies? none. alien movies are awesome, tim burton is awesome, and when you put the two together, you get twice the awesomeness.go watch it now. and if you see the guy that wrote the last review on the street somewhere, throw an egg at him.",Mars Attacks!
390,iiscotty,Hilarious!,9,8 December 2018,This film is so irreverent that many people don't get it. To have a wonderful cast of top billing actors in a movie and then kill them all off is funny in its own right. I laugh every time I see it and just the mention of this film brings a smile to my face. Tim Burton you are a true master!,Mars Attacks!
391,KellySaxy,How is this movie funny?,1,31 May 2005,"I actually saw this movie when I was 15, and it scared the crap out of me. I'm not some sheltered person either. I loved horror movies and had seen every one up until that point with no nightmares and Mars Attacks scared the crap out of me. It was embarrassing--especially since Tim Burton was and is my favorite director, but he certainly is more demented than most directors--which I usually love--but this time I was very disturbed by the fact that he found mean-spirited cruel aliens on a senseless killing spree--funny. I rewatched the movie tonight for the second time ever, and I still found this disturbing. This time is didn't scare me, but I still didn't find it funny. I usually love Dark Comedy, but for it to be successful it actually needs to be funny. I don't find this funny at all, so I'm really asking, why is it funny? When these aliens incinerate people who are just trying to shake hands with them, they laugh, and apparently the audience laughs with them, but why? Am I really supposed to laugh when they incinerate Congress after pretending to come in peace? Am I supposed to laugh when they drop a chandelier on the first lady? Am I supposed to laugh when they incinerate a dog who's just trying to protect his masters? Am I supposed to laugh when the ambassador tricks the President into shaking hands with him so he can stab him through the chest? Am I supposed to find the aliens funny because they're dancing to Tom Jones when the lights come on, even though they turn their guns on the audience and start incinerating people again? With all the incineration that's going on this seems more like a holocaust movie. It's also especially morbid that all the skeletons are red and green (this movie came out around Christmas). After Nightmare before Christmas--which I do actually love and see the brilliance of--I've decided Tim Burton had something really bad happen to him on Christmas once,or maybe every year his family and he roasted people and painted their skeletons who knows? But my point is HOW IS THAT FUNNY? It's senseless violence and, sure it supposedly spoofs every thing American, Presidential, and Sci-Fi, but I still don't laugh during this movie ever. I really don't see a place that I possibly could, and yes I've seen all the old sci-fi movies. War of the World. The Day the Earth stood still etc. I get these aliens were based on bubble-gum cards, but the only successful spoof of Tim Burton's in this genre--I think is Ed Wood--which actually is funny.So seriously. I know it's like Opera (you either love it or you hate it) but I really don't see how anyone could love this. And yes, I'm pretty sure I get what about it is SUPPOSED to be funny--I'm not dense--but it's not funny to me (just because some people don't love it other assume they don't get it. It's possible to understand something and not like it). Especially since I don't find mean things that kill people for fun, funny, and apparently that's what it takes to like this movie. And YEAH, I get that it's supposed to be a joke and I shouldn't take it seriously--I don't, it's obviously an exaggeration,. But still, I don't find it funny at all, and I really don't get how anyone could. So, man, I really think Tim Burton dropped the ball on that one. This movie was no good for anyone's careers who were involved. They all seemed to disappear for a two year period...",Mars Attacks!
392,airborne80,One of the top three movies ever!!,10,26 June 2005,I am in no way a movie buff. I operate in a world of cold cruel situations and when I watch movies...I seldom get impressed. Marrs Attacks is so filled with hidden and not so hidden funny stuff that I have watched it at least five times and STILL find new things to laugh at! Spoof on old movies is an understatement. It is simply great! In fact...I just went on e bay and bought a bunch of Mars Attacks figures and I am 42 years old!!!!The movie is full of great actors and fantastic one liners. The people from Mars are both funny and scary at the same time so prepare for a great movie!! Watch it with some pop corn and a date and have fun!,Mars Attacks!
393,bigike24,Sarcasticly Brilliant!,10,3 July 2005,"Brilliantly sarcastic and witty. It parodies not only the 1950's flying saucer genre, but our own self absorption and media driven society as well. Many classic moments; the first attack, blowing up congress and Slim Whitman's music to name a few. The cast was another plus. Jack Nicholson as the president/developer was inspired. Glenn close as the hawkish first lady was great. And anything with Pam Grier is good. Mars Attacks! is a movie that I notice something new in every time I watch it. I had not realized until the last viewing that Jack Black played the over the top soldier. I also enjoyed the mean spirited glee the martians exhibited in response to our efforts to be peaceful",Mars Attacks!
394,pgberrypb,I agree 'misunderstood',10,30 November 2020,"Totally agree with the review stated 'misunderstood'. It's a Tim Burton homage to 50's B movies. Full of colour and fun. The effects still hold today especially if you consider we don't know how aliens look!
Great star studded cast as well. Great dark humour from the Martians as well.
Ignore the nay sayers sit down and have a great laugh and this misunderstood masterpiece.",Mars Attacks!
395,levipaigec,Awful,1,2 November 2018,It's just so bad. Everything about it is silly and pointless. Not surprised I've never seen it before today. two hours of my life I'm never getting back,Mars Attacks!
396,gerryharrah1961,Two hours of your life that you'll never get back.,1,11 November 2014,Comedy? If that's what they were trying to do it missed terribly. The cast walks through this with some very uninterested and uninspired performances. Even the direction is slow and dull. Not one of Tim Burton's finest to say the least. Jack Nicholson acts as if he was stuck in a contract he couldn't get out of. Michael J. Fox performs as if he were in a hurry to get to the golf course. A particularly embarrassing performance. Pierce Brosnan is probably the only the only entertaining performance. He seems to be doing a self parody and enjoying it. And Glen Close does seem to be having a good time as the first lady. Spoiler Alert: If you're a dog lover don't watch this.,Mars Attacks!
