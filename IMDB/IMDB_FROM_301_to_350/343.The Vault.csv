0,SnoopyStyle,fun little caper,6,17 March 2021,"In 2008, Walter Moreland (Liam Cunningham) leads a team salvaging a wreck when the Spanish police confiscates the treasure. Unbeknownst to the authorities, the treasure is more than what it appears to be. It's a road map to a greater treasure and Moreland needs to steal it back. The big problem is that the government has placed it in an unbreachable vault in the Bank of Spain. In order to solve the problem, Moreland hires genius engineering college student Thom Laybrick (Freddie Highmore) who is tired of being recruited by big oil. They have an opportunity during the 2010 World Cup.This is a fun little caper. It's not that complicated. Liam Cunningham is always great. The two problems are Freddie Highmore and the vault. Freddie is always going to look like a kid and I can't see him as a romantic lead. Astrid Bergès-Frisbey may as well pat him on the head. He is probably never going to heat it up. He's going to be an adorable puppy even on his death bed. The second is the vault construction. I don't really see how it's set up. It's essentially the gold idol in Indiana Jones. In Indy, the premise doesn't need explaining because it's such a small part of it and it is what it is. In this movie, the scale construct is central to the story and so it needs to work. Couldn't they place more counterweight which they do in the emergency situation anyways? Couldn't they just do that earlier? I'm not sure if the story is mechanically sound. Overall, this movie is a good escapist fare although two hours may be unnecessarily long.",The Vault
1,paul_haakonsen,A tedious and slow paced story with a lack of interesting characters...,4,10 August 2021,"Ugh, well at least they tried.I am sort of amazed that writers Rafa Martínez, Andrés M. Koppel, Borja Glez. Santaolalla, Michel Gaztambide and Rowan Athale could collectively managed to churn out such a subpar script. But I guess too many people working on a single thing can become a hindrance.""Way Down"" (aka ""The Vault"") was showing promise in the first part of the movie, but it quickly descended into mediocrity and then slipped beyond that. I started to care less and less about the storyline as the movie progressed. And it didn't really help much that the characters in the movie failed to reach out and provide me with much of any entertainment. I felt that the character gallery in the movie was just lacking individual personalities and traits, as everyone was essentially a drone.This movie had potential, but ended up being just another heist movie, and not an overly great one at that. So if you enjoy heist movies, there are far better options out there. Sure, there were some interesting ideas along the way, but the abundance of writers working on the script were just tripping one another along the way, and it made for a less than mediocre movie experience.It does amaze me that the movie was so boring, especially since it had a pretty interesting ensemble of casted actors and actresses, with the likes of even Liam Cunningham and Famke Janssen.The movie's story was progressing too slow for my liking, and it was was increasingly becoming more and more difficult to keep having an interest in the storyline as the story dragged on and on at a painfully slow pace.""Way Down"" was by no means an outstanding movie, and this is definitely not a movie that I will be returning to watch a second time, nor is it a movie that I would recommend anyone to rush out the get to watch.My rating of director Jaume Balagueró's 2021 action thriller lands on a less than mediocre four out of ten stars. There are far better heist movies readily available out there in an abundance. This one came and went without leaving as much as a dent.",The Vault

3,searchanddestroy-1,One more collateral damage of Casa Del Papel or Ocean's Eleven,4,31 March 2021,"I am used now of those Spanish yarns speaking of capers. Nothing to do with the heist movies of the sixties, with so much charm. I admit that I am an old timer, 57, but those heist films now are too much fun, smooth, cool to me, the ending is always more or less predictable, too smooth, not enough tragic. You even don't care about the characters; you only may wish they succeed. They are not facing their fate, their doom. It is agreeable though, but I begin to get tired of those films. I proceed in the watching, just to have the right to comment, because commenting without watching is totally senseless and idiot. And I always hope....",The Vault
4,CinemaSerf,Enjoyable crime hesitate caper,7,17 October 2021,"OK, so it's more a sort of ""Ocean's 11"" meets ""Topkapi"" type of plot, but I really quiet enjoyed this totally far-fetched tale. The target - a seemingly impregnable vault in the Bank of Spain in Madrid. The thing is, the would be robbers - led by ""Walter"" (Liam Cunningham) have all the tech at their fingertips, they have an agile and capable team, but they have no idea why this particular vault is so difficult to crack. This is where their boss hits upon the brilliant young mind that is ""Thom"" (Freddie Highmore). A man with a MENSA rating off the chart, but a man who is bored, who needs a challenge. Cunningham tempts him with an opportunity to acquire a legendary lost treasure - but only if he helps them solve the mystery. What now follows is a quickly paced, engagingly cast crime drama as the gang must find a way into and (more importantly) out of the place - and they only have the duration of a football match that is showing on the big screen on the plaza outside - before they are detected by the state of the art security system and the eagle-eyed security chief at the bank. It's unusual, this - it has humour and decent characterisations, but it is also quite cerebral. Young ""Thom"" uses his brain to solve a lot of the problems - a practical application of genius and science that makes this film just a little bit less of a visual effects fest than many similar efforts in this genre. Proper little twist at the ending too... Good fun!",The Vault
5,zardoz-13,"A ""Money Heist"" Inspired Robbery Caper",7,21 June 2021,"High-stakes heist thrillers are a lot of fun, if the thieves contend with a gauntlet of bewildering obstacles. The success of the ""Mission Impossible"" film franchise and Netflix's ""Money Heist"" (2017-2021) attests to this theory. Since German filmmaker Fritz Lang forged the first criminal mastermind in ""Dr. Mabuse, Gambler"" (1922) and Jules Dassin helmed the first two modern heist capers ""Rififi"" (1955) and ""Topkapi"" (1966), everybody has imitated them. The harrowing cliffhanger situations our protagonists encounter in Spanish director Jaume Balagueró's ""The Vault"" should make anybody squirm with anticipation. They endeavor to rob the Bank of Spain in this preposterous but melodramatic escapade.Best known for his eerie Spanish-language horror chillers ""REC"" (2007), ""REC 2"" (2009), and ""REC 4: Apocalypse"" (2014), Jaume Balagueró uses snappy editing to intensify the suspense and tension in this white-knuckled, adrenalin-laced exercise in larceny. Suffice to say, five writers concocted these death-defying shenanigans. Everything Balagueró and scenarists Rafa Martínez, Andrés M. Koppel, Borja Glez Santaolalla, Michel Gaztambide, and Rowan Athale do adheres slavishly to the ""Rififi""/""Topkapi"" formula. Ultimately, you may guess the film's anti-climactic surprise ending. Nevertheless, Balagueró neither lets the suspense nor tension slacken during its gripping 118-minute runtime. Primarily, ""The Vault"" got its' R-rating for its English & Spanish profanity. Meantime, violence and nudity are conspicuously missing. Happily, a virtually unknown cast, featuring Freddie Highmore, Astrid Bergès-Frisbey, Sam Riley, and Luis Tosar, gives this thriller a fresh attraction even though it's formulaic from fade-in to fadeout.""The Vault"" opens in the year 1645 when English privateer Sir Francis Drake conducted raids on the Spanish Armada. Literally, we find ourselves in the Atlantic Ocean looking up at the keel of a sailing ship under nonstop bombardment. Treasure chests plummet into the depths. Some 365 years afterward, a wealthy British salvage expert locates those chests and hauls them up from Davy Jones' locker. Before he can eyeball them, Spanish Customs authorities descend on him in speed boats and helicopters. Since the treasure lay in Spanish waters, the courts stash it in the Bank of Spain at Madrid. This contentious salvage tycoon (Liam Cunningham of ""Titanic""), who spent 30-years scouring the Atlantic for this lost treasure, must scrutinize the cargo before Spanish officials catalogue it. He enlists a game 22-year-old Cambridge engineering graduate, Thom Jackson (Freddie Highmore of ""Finding Neverland""), heralded a 'boy genius,' to mastermind this elaborate heist. Nobody has ever plundered the impregnable vault of the Bank of Spain. (Actually, ""Money Heist"" did during its' third season.) An ingenious example of 19-century engineering, the vault itself is situated below the bank. When intruders trip the alarms, the vault floods itself and drowns anybody trapped inside!The chess game tactics of ""The Vault"" should keep anybody wriggling on tenterhooks. Our heroes aren't professional thieves, and Thom embraces this chance of a lifetime for the sheer thrill of it. Of course, we shouldn't be surprised a sexy, light-fingered pickpocket, Lorraine (Astrid Bergès-Frisbey of ""Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides"") lured him into this intrigue. Inevitably, we get a computer expert who hacks the bank's security system, while our heroes deal with a fanatical security chief, Gustavo (Jose Coronado of ""Son of Cain""), who is on their heels at every turn. Complicating matters for the abrasive Gustavo is the World Cup Spanish soccer championship that clears the way for our heroes to enter the bank because its security cameras are aimed away from its roof. Mind you, ""The Vault"" is not without faults, but its charismatic cast and Balagueró's dynamic helming create a winning combination which makes this spine-tingling caper worth a spin.",The Vault
6,Calicodreamin,Clever heist movie,7,1 August 2021,The storyline was pretty basic but well executed. Cinematography and acting were better than I expected. The plot had a solid attempt at a twist although it was terribly predictable. Overall an enjoyably mindless watch.,The Vault
7,MOscarbradley,A really pleasurable guilty pleasure.,8,29 August 2021,"I love a really good heist movie because a really good heist movie has to be supersmart as well as exciting if it's to hold our attention and entertain us and the best heist movies are classics of their kind. ""The Vault"" may not be quite 'classic' material but it's still hugely entertaining, superbly plotted and very exciting. If, on close inspection, the plot has more holes in it than a large Swiss cheese, who cares; this is a guilty pleasure of the most pleasurable kind and one of the best heist movies in a very long time and like a lot of heist movies, especially since the name-checked Danny Ocean hit a few casinos in Vegas, this one has you routing for the thieves.The boss of the operation is Irish actor Liam Cunningham while gang members include Sam Riley, Astrid Berges-Frisbey, Luis Tosar and Alex Stein but the self-appointed mastermind is Freddie Highmore, a twenty-two year old engineering genius whose brain is needed to crack the vault. The setting is Madrid during the World Cup and the job is to retrieve some rare Spanish coins siezed by the Spanish government from Cunningham during a salvage operation.Of course, if you can actually follow what's happening step-by-step you're a smarter cookie than I am but then you don't go to a heist movie to see a step-by-step guide on how to rob a bank; you go for the sheer fun to be had watching others do it and Jaume Balaguero's ""The Vault"" is a fun movie of the first rank. The only suprise is why it went straight to Amazon, at least here in the UK, as it has box-office success written all over it.",The Vault
8,westsideschl,One of the Best of This Genre,10,20 May 2021,"Much better than I expected & I've seen most of the bank heist movies made. Kudos to this one for it's intelligence; the realism (of course ignoring the novel unrealistic complex avoidance scenarios); the Madrid location with World Cup football (soccer) tie-in; and best of all the several twists. Very edge of seat entertaining if you're willing to suspend disbelief to some fantasy degree. Well acted with some of the usual heist characters with a couple of new character types.

9,ops-52535,its a major heist...,7,14 March 2021,"On the heisters vault, where its gonna be heisted by the finders that lost their heist in the beginning...that was terribly written, but its more or less a treasure hunt where the treasure is first to be found, lost and then retained in a european way of criminal film style.its not a bad film, its just that it uses well cliched methods to the game of entering the vaults, even the trap mechanisms are unoriginal, so its a ''seen it all before'' movie. but its a pretty tense movie in periods, well made score and the acting just as you expect. though i didnt like the casting of ''the good doctor'' with his spectrumized behaviour and pinnochio diamond twinkling eyes as the young ''brain'' of the coup, the rest is within the limits.so its a film of suspence ,shortage of time, many money and very fast shifting pace, with little time to rest. so if you wanna gain some good outta this, then pay attention to the small details, its all in there ,its just hard to trace. its a recommended film thinks the grumpy old man",The Vault
10,paulclaassen,Entertaining!,6,8 August 2021,"'The Vault' is also known as 'Way Down' in some countries.I enjoy treasure hunting movies, and 'The Vault' felt like a treasure hunt movie, although it wasn't really. It was captivating in the vein of 'Now you see me'. It is a detailed film, with everything taken into consideration.Freddie Highmore stars as the film's hero, Thom, who is a computer genius - or simply, a genius altogether. Although not everything was entirely believable, it was presented in an entertaining manner that made it feel fresh and credible. I enjoyed the fact they had to overcome obstacle upon obstacle. The closer they got, the more challenging it became. I found it rather fascinating.I also enjoyed Liam Cunningham as Walter, the group's leader and the guy who found the treasure in the first place. There's a few twists along the way and a really exciting climax. I thoroughly enjoyed this film. Ha-ha, great cliffhanger ending...!Would I watch it again? Yes.",The Vault
11,cruise01,Decent heist thriller.,6,11 August 2021,3 out of 5 stars.The Vault tries to play as a treasure hunt heist thriller. As a crew is trying to steal valuable artifacts from a highly secured bank during a soccer tournament in Spain. Simple plot. The direction does lack in fun. The characters and script is a bit forgettable. The cast ensemble is okay. Could have been better.,The Vault

13,jtindahouse,Not quite as fun as other heist films but still a good time,7,1 October 2021,"I enjoy a good heist movie. They are always a lot of fun and often have a lot of clever aspects that I really appreciate. 'The Vault' is no different. It finds a good balance between being clever enough to be impressive, while also being simple enough to easily follow. The film also did a good job of making sure we were on the side of the heisters. It's not always easy for me to side with ""criminals"", however on this occasion they gave me good reason to.Where the film falls down a little is in the characters and the acting. Heist characters should be ultra-cool and a lot of fun. This lot are quite serious and certainly not the coolest collection of characters ever assembled. Also the acting lets them down a lot of the time. It often feels like lines have been learned five minutes before the scene and are just being read out, rather than acted.Still, this one is a good time for the most part and if you are a fan of heist films like me then you will likely find some enjoyment in it. 7/10.",The Vault

Liam Cunningham hires university graduate genius, Highmore, to help him and his crew of top thieves to break in during the World Cup final (not heard of that before!)This is a well enough mounted production and the break in section isn't bad, however it's all been done before and so for this film they've created a ridiculously over the top sci fi vault that just seems silly.

20,thekarmicnomad,Hard to stomach,2,10 April 2021,"This is basically a simple little heist film - which is exactly what I signed on for.The main character is such a massive bell-end though it is impossible to watch.He is the kind of insufferable prick that, if you knew him, and you saw him getting mugged in the street you would video it rather than actually help.He is the obnoxious butt hole you would normally find as the antagonist in a feminist movie - what hangups must this writer have to create such an awful lead character?I made it up to the point where he, so smugly, suggested to the tech specialist that he rang a staff member up to basically ask for their password.The guy was like ""thanks you really are a genius!""In my imaginary end to the movie the safe door slams shut on his hand and he bleeds out before the police get there.",The Vault

22,abisio,A heist movie worth your time,9,14 April 2021,"Robbing Banco de Espana has been already made on a NETFLIX series and while the challenges are similar, the development is quite faster here (less than to hours) some good suspense moments.Walther owns a wreck recovery company whose latest recovered load was sized by the Spanish government and stored in that bank. He knows within that load there is are pieces that point to a bigger treasure.In order to get that pieces back, he lures Thom (Freddie Highmore, a little static but still charismatic) a young nerd but very smart engineer still trying to save the world and more interested in adventures than money.There are some other English speaking characters involved; a love interest (Astrid Bergès-Frisbey as Lorraine, quite good), a former special units (Sam Riley) and an MI6 shady operative (played by Famke Janssen).On the Spanish side we the always excellent Jose Coronado (as the bank security chief ) and Luis Tosar as the get anything man. Considering how good they are and that is an Spanish production; they probable deserved more important roles (specially Tosar); but still they get a decent screen time and their brief moments.The script is adjusted to root for the thieves; so they have to be the ""GOOD GUYS"" of course.The first part of the movie where information is being collected requires some suspension of disbelief but still works. The third act when the heist start is very well executed and both sides match their intelligence and mistakes.The end is well and open joke but satisfying.In brief is well crafter heist movie; with some original elements and able to keep your interest for almost two hours.

24,witster18,Falls Short on Big Set-Ups,5,9 August 2021,"I thoroughly enjoyed the first hour of the vault.It was like National Treasure and The Bank Job had a baby, and it definitely kept me interested. The films' first half delivered loads of intrigue and excitement, but the film struggles to keep momentum down the stretch. Every snippet of excitement lurking around the corner, led to a dead end.The artifacts themselves we're supposedly segue to an even bigger find, or in this case a sequel that i no longer want to see.I agree with another reviewer that the lead was perhaps miscast, and I also feel his expertise under-utilized/under-written. The whole film felt like it was headed to something exciting, but it never seemed to get there.I thought the film really mishandled the ""escape"", and the events surrounding it, and left too many details on the drafting table.I can't recommend The Vault. I've seen far worse, but summarizing that I prefer ""Art of the Steal"", ""Bank Job"", and ""American Animals"", seeing how I those are Average films, should sum-up my opinion here.",The Vault

Even though I was sure of the outcome, I was still holding my breaths a couple of times. The movie was also well shot.However, there were many common tropes. There was almost no surprises in terms of characters and plot points. I did not feel the strong connections and dynamics between the characters, especially between our main genius college student and the thief girl.

31,President_George_Washington,FROM THE DESK OF GEORGE WASHINGTON,5,8 August 2021,"Good Morrow.I have found enjoyment in most of Jaume Balagueró films. He's a master at his craft. This caper flick, for all its polish, is bit of a miss. All the ingredients are here, but it falls flat in the third act.The head of security knows that something is up, he knows the date (a big kick ball match) and has ordered extra security. He's a pro with no sense of humor, constantly scowling and monitoring security screens...there's a lot of people watching security screens. What he fails to do is place any security in the vault or even by the vault. A man of his skill wouldn't make that mistake.I'd love to rate this higher, but there are just too many improbable occurrences to take it seriously (a scale, that if goes out of range, floods the room a'la Indiana Jones style).By the end, I just couldn't muster the slightest care.I suggest Jaume's Mientras duermes (Sleep Tight).

32,daisukereds,Very good! But..,6,15 March 2021,"Tense and entertaining. Very well filmed, cast, acted, edited, sound design, locations, visuals, etc. It's a very good package for a heist movie. It doesn't really do anything mind-blowing or memorable, but I have no complaints at all, which is rare. It feels VERY realistic, which sometimes is not fun (when you've seen Mission Impossible 4.. you get a taste for the fantastic and grounded). If you haven't seen it and want to pass the time with a well crafted product, I'd say ""go for it""....Now..
Normally, I qualify movies as a whole. But I tend to put emphasis on the beginning (Marriage Story being a fine example). If I'm immediately turned off is no good, but also how easily and smoothly I'm introduced to this new world. I tend to be easily dissuaded because of everything I've already watched in my lifetime. And then there is the ending (like the anime Code Geass s02), which is the most important part of it all. If the story ends and you feel hollow, disappointed or let down.. then the time you spent watching feels even heavier, a sense of wasted of time.This movie failed me in one of these regards, just a bit. That plus the averageness of the script in comparison to others, lowers what would be a high score for me. And this was a choice.. I can't agree to it, but it isn't my film.

38,itsbobr,Good Heist movie,7,25 May 2021,"Walter (Liam Cunningham) and his Salvage crew found a treasure chest from a Spanish Galleon long submerged, but the Spanish government denies Walter the treasure. Walter hires Thom (Freddie Highmore), a student engineer to figure out a way to get the treasure from the underground Vault of Bank of Spain, which is heavily guarded and impossible to break into. This can't be good.Once Walter and his crew draw up the plans a wrinkle occurs and that is Gustavo (Jose Coronado) the Chief of Security for the Bank of Spain and he knows the Bank is at risk during the World Cup Football Game between Spain and the Netherlands. He knows because his cleaning crew job was cancelled, but found out there was another cleaning crew on the premises. Oh, oh..........Yes, this is like a Mission Impossible story. Don't try to memorize everything, just go with it. The real problem to be solved is that once the Vault is breached it will lower itself into water and anyone captured in it will drown. Thom needs to find a way to prevent the Vault from going into the water.Here is what they are looking for. Back in the day, the Pirate Francis Drake sunk the Spanish ship took the treasure and hid it away marking on 3-coins the exact whereabouts of the treasure. So the 3-Coins are what are needed and they are in the treasure chest Walter took up from the sunken Spanish ship.Notables: Astrid Berges-Frisbey as Lorraine, part of Walter's crew and helps Thom figure things out; Axel Stein as Klaus, Walter's computer hacking guy; Luis Tosar as Simon, who is someone who can get anything needed; Sam Riley as James, Walter's hot-headed right-hand man who takes a dislike to Thom; Famke Jansen as Margaret a British Civil Servant who betrays Walter.Toward the end the Vault is breached and the water comes in. You knew that would happen, right?This is a good heist movie and gets exciting near the end. You keep asking about a twist. Yes, there is one.

Surprise, wonder, angst, curiosity and boredom all were proffered with the same look (the 'who me' look). So the sudden answers to difficult problems weren't sold to me as the audience.I actually liked most of the rest of the cast, they worked off each other well despite English being their second (or third) language. It did seem a bit disingenuous to have them utter profanities in English when things went wrong. It didn't sound as sudden and surprising as it should have.The plot only served to confuse you enough that you didn't question it or look too closely. There were many holes and connections made where there was no supporting information. And throwing in a few sleight of hand tricks to wow the unready was also as a way of distracting from a poor script.Having said all that, it's an ok movie if you don't look too hard.

Which has been a phenomenal hit that also focuses on a ragtag groups efforts of breaking into the Bank of Spain. Unlike the Netflix program which has so far spanned 5 series, this movie only has two hours. So it would be a bit unfair to make direct comparisons..... so in this film the group has to regain some treasure that they lost. Lead by Walter who is played by Liam Cunningham, (famous for his Game of thrones role) alongside several other. Do the personalities jump out of the screen?? Not really if I'm honest. They do appear a bit dry. Interpersonal relationships on the screen perhaps reach their pinnacle when you might believe two of the characters have a romantic connection. While its suggested that they do, through subtle and not so subtle hints in the movie. I don't feel it. The two characters just seem too different. Weirdly the part of the movie that I enjoyed most and maybe others are in agreement, I don't know but I really enjoyed the incorporation of the world cup 2010 where Spain beat the Neatherlands to win. That created a few moments that I will take away from the movie more so than anything to do with the treasure. Which is a little boring. So would I recommend it this movie? Not really.

The movie for the most part was quite well done - with good actors, cinematography, well-paced story and nice suspenseful atmosphere.But the writers sadly leave you shaking your head by trying to make the vault so mysterious and super-cool, but it came off as absurd and cringy. So, after over a hundred years of mystery, the vault's mechanism is quickly revealed after some back and forth and several cups of coffee. Ok, I can still live with that, because I understand the movie has to move along. But it just goes downhill from there.Apparently EVERYONE who uses the vault and get to its door, needs to span a LOTR's You-Shall-Not-Pass-like abyss in the middle of Madrid city.Then, after opening the vault using the proper method - using official finger print and required keys - they still CANNOT walk into the vault because of pressure sensors. So how does ANYONE then use this vault?? How did officials get those boxes in, and how would they get them out?And the heights of absurdity is that pressure sensors changes will cause the vault to lock and trap anyone inside, and FLOOD it completely to KILL anyone inside (tough judicial system Spain has, eh?).Also, are we to assume that this vault was originally designed to store ONLY water resistant items?? Wouldn't violently flooding it with torrents of dirty fountain water likely destroy priceless objects typically stored in vaults?I would also suggest to Freddie Highmore to consider his charcter study, because it looked like The Good Doctor took a vacation to become The Good Enginner to break into a vault - didn't see any difference!So sadly this would have been a very good movie, but the absurdity surrounding the vault really turned me off.",The Vault

It was about three quarters of the way through the movie, the day of the big heist, where in order to get to where they need to go, the characters must do the thing that is by now so cliché that I thought that it would have been banned from every script written since 1970.That's right, they crawled through the air ducts. By now, doesn't everyone know that they don't make air ducts big enough for a man to crawl through (especially in the world's most secure bank) and they're far too flimsy to support the weight of an adult anyway?I don't mind a few moments that stretch credulity.

But rob the Bank of Spain? Sure, why not? I'm all in. My idealism does not extend to living an honourable life. I want to be a crook!When the protagonists are about to get double crossed they somehow know it in advance and double cross the faithless co-conspirator while fighting for their lives. That co-conspirator, working for the British government, leaves them to die. Sure, why not?And when they need to escape, they do so against all odds and somehow go from a third floor window to the pulsating crowd below.It doesn't help that under Admiralty Law in every seafaring country the salvors get to hold onto the salvage until a decision has been made by the affected Admiralty Court as to the disposition of the salvage. But adhering to that fact would destroy the entire ridiculous premises of this film.I can't wait for the Vault2, and robbing the Bank of England. Then I can write another snarky review over another turkey. Perhaps it can be set in 2012 with the London Olympics providing the atmosphere.As for Freddie Highmore he should stick to TV.

So, the ""vault"" is protected by some elegant mechanism that trips a ton of water when someone enters it and the weight changes right ? Ok.... ?So, exactly, HOW do you put something IN the vault in the first place ????In order to do that, you need to have some system to turn the scales and water system OFF.If there is a system to turn it OFF to get stuff in and out, then they could of and should have overridden that system, just like they did all the other systems.Case closed.Also, when they get inside the vault, it seems that the ONLY thing in it is the treasure from the shipwreck at the beginning.So... nothing else that valuable in Spain worth storing in the most secure vault ??Yeah, so ... all in all... stuff that really spoiled my enjoyment of what could have been an OK movie.In addition, not really one single clever, new, security defeating technique is shown.The bit at the end with the other treasure located under the Bank of England is a bit of a joke also.Hoping for a sequel ??

For example, why set up Thom's moral outlook and then totally fail to show how he is persuaded to join in a bank job? How come the native English speakers spoke the script word for word rather than saying ""look, shall I just say the thing you were trying to say in the script?"" were they just paying their mortgage, or did they try to make it better and an inflexible director made them say it as written? Freddie Highmore was amazing in finding neverland... Does he make terrible movie choices? Does he have a bad agent? Is he only capable of playing Freddie highmore and that happened to fit finding neverland perfectly? Is the hero's name Thomas Johnson so close to John Thomas as a deliberate Easter egg?

That is fine, i didn't go into it wanting to see a genre subverting heavy hitter. I would have simply taken competent and failing that something fun. I watched this in April 2021 and my standards have hit bedrock and started digging. Still I was disappointed.The movie had one key issue. Casting... The main character Thom, played by Freddie Highmore is so awful. I didn't like him 'Good Doctor' and sadly I think he borrows a lot of traits from his character in that show. I hate him in this. He has zero, '0!' chemistry with the rest of the cast.He is the guy you get if you want a super awkward, stilted performance of a genius who can't hold a conversation. The problem is they had hm being the sudo hollywood star that saves the day and gets the girl. You can't have it both ways with this lack laster script, and a actor with such little charisma.The rest of the cast aren't anything to phone home about either. Not because I feel they acted badly, but because of chemistry. Again... They don't play off each other, they look uncomfortable to be in eachothers company. They could have subbed their co-stars for brick walls.Verdict:
Avoid, it's a good looking, competent movie with alright passing. Unfortunately it is beyond average in all other regards.I would highly recommend watching something like Flawless if you haven't. Otherwise just a rewatch any of the oceans films. Even 8... If you want something a little lighter and silly go with 'now you see me'",The Vault

Those two factors were quickly nullified by a flimsy plot, a weak script, and clumsy directing. This movie wants to be good- even if it is a rehash if so many other (and much better) heist films. The cinematography is gorgeous and often stunning but it doesn't help the plot, cast, or script be any more believable than it is. That was my big problem. (I've trained myself not to look at Famke's new face, and her part is very small, otherwise that would have been my biggest problem). There are many troublesome anachronisms; the worse of which I only caught at the end. How would Sir Francis Drake know anything about coordinates (ie longitude and latitude) in the 1600s? And why would he put them on three separate coins?
