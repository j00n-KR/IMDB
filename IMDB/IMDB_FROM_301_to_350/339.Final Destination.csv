0,TheLittleSongbird,Destination to death,7,1 December 2017,"'Final Destination' is most notable for two things mainly. The first being that it was the introduction of a fascinating and clever premise that is pretty unique for a supernatural horror. The other being that it was the feature film directing debut of James Wong, best known beforehand as a veteran of 'The X Files'.It spawned four sequels with the fifth film being released in 2011. While it is flawed and somewhat of an uneven film, the first 'Final Destination' is still, six years after the fifth film, one of the franchise's better outings. Perhaps even the best, and the one where the premise feels the freshest. The more stale the concept got, the more the novelty wore off and the less effective the film. Could 'Final Destination' have executed its premise better? Perhaps. Mostly, to me, it did it quite well.Visually, 'Final Destination' looks pretty good for low budget. It's slickly shot and very atmospheric, while the plane effects in the Flight 180 plane scene/explosion are quite impressive. The music score has a suitable eeriness.The film is never dull and is a vast majority of the time fun and suspenseful, with elaborately creative death scenes that are ingeniously unsettling. The film's highlight is the opening Flight 180 scene, anyone already with a fear of flying will have their fear exemplified and it is likely to turn people from boarding a plane for a while. Wong does competently with the directing and the portrayal of Death is an interesting and well done one.Acting varies, with personable Devon Sawa, affecting Ali Larter and Tony Todd's creepy cameo coming off best. Really liked the characters' surnames, that were nifty homages to horror/suspense icons.Not all the acting works however. The others are saddled with one-dimensional and flatly written roles and are a mix of bland (Kristen Cloke) and irritating (Kerr Smith), also found myself not being able to take Seann William Scott seriously.The biggest issue is the script, which is very high in the cheese and awkwardness factors and there is some clumsy exposition that often feels under-explored and not really going anywhere. Generally the story is nice, but things could have been explained better and explored more and it's a little too reliant on coincidence. Things also take a dumb turn towards the end before the film concludes on a logic-defying note.Overall, patchy but entertaining. 7/10 Bethany Cox",Final Destination
1,bkoganbing,You Don't Cheat The Grim Reaper,5,30 January 2012,"Final Destination which spawned a veritable cottage industry of sequels like Rocky had a certain popularity among the young who really seem to have a terribly negative view of life. When young Devon Sawa has a creepy premonition and gets himself thrown off a plane bound for Paris in a class trip, a few others of his classmates and one teacher get thrown off with him.They all see in real life exactly what Sawa saw in his vision and they count themselves horrified at seeing friends and classmates die in a spectacular way as the plane exploded. They count themselves lucky at first, but then some mysterious force best articulated by Tony Todd says that Death is a character like any other and it's got a mean disposition. There is a plan of leaving this mortal coil in a specific order and you dare not disrupt the order.After which the rest start dropping in a series of bizarre situations and this has been the secret of the success of Final Destination and its sequels. And the deaths are properly gory and spectacular as well.For this kind of film of which I'm not a particular fan, Final Destination is as good as it gets.",Final Destination
2,Leofwine_draca,Uniquely entertaining,7,14 July 2016,"Once in a while a film comes along that you have no hopes for, but which pleasantly surprises you anyway. And into the over-saturated market of the teen flick comes FINAL DESTINATION, a dizzying and suspenseful shocker which has to be the best teen horror film we've had since SCREAM - all right, I know that's not saying much, but watch this anyway. Tired viewers will be glad to hear that this teen-orientated film isn't full of moronic dialogue and boring situations set in a school - instead, the film is focused entirely on the central premise, there is no deviation.Created by the two guys who made THE X-FILES so interesting when it first started - James Wong and Glen Morgan - this is, at last, an original film. There is no bogeyman here, no masked slasher, instead the killer is fate itself. I'd give my right arm for a little bit of originality these days, which is why this film enthralled me so much. The film starts off excellently with a strong sense of impending doom and a horrific to watch plane explosion. It then slows down only to pick up the pace in the second half, becoming both exciting and thrilling. Of course, it's the deaths which are the highlights of the film, and these definitely do not disappoint.Inbetween them, we get some typical teen angst as the shunned Sawa tries to convince his friends that they're about to die. Sawa, who starred in horror comedy IDLE HANDS, is surprisingly good in the lead role, giving us a likable neurotic who manages to be heroic when the time comes. Okay, so the rest of the cast are merely passable - full of the beautiful but bland faces populating most American soap operas these days - but it's nice to see Tony Todd pop up in a cameo as a creepy morgue attendant who gets all the best lines.As I mentioned before, the death scenes are outstanding, yes, FANTASTIC; they consist of a series of commonplace accidents which culminate in the victim's demise. They're grisly and surprisingly gory in places, making a nice change these days from relatively bloodless stuff like I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER. Okay, so the fiery, frenetic climax is a bit predictable but there's a nice twist at the very end. FINAL DESTINATION is a clever film, and one to be watched. It has a uniqueness about it which sets it above the rest and it's thoroughly enjoyable too - what more can be said?",Final Destination
3,SnoopyStyle,Interesting original concept,6,21 October 2013,Alex (Devon Sawa) is going to France on a school trip. He falls asleep and has a vivid dream where everyone dies in a fiery crash. It's so vivid that he freaks out and gets thrown off the plane with many of his fellow students. The plane actually explodes and those people seem to escape death. Only something is hunting them down one at a time.It's a great original concept. However it doesn't lend itself to being filmed in a compelling way. Basically weird things happen and everybody dies. There isn't a crazy manic. The kids aren't trying to outrun somebody. Death is invisible. That's the whole point. It's just one weird death after another. There's something much more visceral about an axe murderer gutting his young nubile victims.,Final Destination
4,kosmasp,Great idea,8,29 October 2009,"The concept (not a high end concept of course) of the movie is really great. It works perfectly as a Horror movie and it is fairly good acted. Since it is/was the first of its kind, it has the seal/stamp of something new.Since there are 3 follow ups, the title isn't really accurate, but that shouldn't bother you. Apart from the idea, what really will grip you is the inventiveness of the script. There are so many settings and so many different ways of ... well you'll see if you watch the movie. I don't want to spoil anything, if you haven't read anything about the movie(s) yet. But as Horror movies go, this was one of the best that came out ""recently"".",Final Destination
5,jboothmillard,Final Destination,5,11 March 2005,"""In death there are no accidents, no coincidences, no mishaps, and no escapes!"" When I was younger, I found this scary movie, and the sequels that followed, thrilling and fun. I'm glad I watched again to get a better perspective, directed by James Wong (The X-Files, The One, Black Christmas). Basically, on May 13, 2000, high school student Alex Browning (Devon Sawa) and his class are boarding a plane, Flight 180, from New York John F. Kennedy Airport for a field trip to Paris, France. Before take-off, Alex has a premonition that the plane will explode in mid-air, killing everybody on board. When the events from his vision begin to occur in reality, he panics and causes a fight between him and student Carter Horton (Kerr Smith). Resulting in them, and others to be removed from the plane. They include Carter's girlfriend Terry Chaney (Amanda Detmer), teacher Valerie Lewton (Kristen Cloke), and student Billy Hitchcock (American Pie's Seann William Scott), while Alex's best friend Tod Waggner (Chad E. Donella) and student Clear Rivers (Ali Larter) choose to leave. Moments later, after the plane takes off, the plane explodes in mid-air, and the surviving passengers stare at Alex in shock. The survivors are each interrogated by FBI agents Weine (Daniel Roebuck) and Schreck (Roger Guenveur Smith), who show they are suspicious about Alex. Thirty-nine days later, the survivors attend a memorial service for the victims. Following this, a chain reaction of strange events begins to occur. An invisible force causes Tod to accidentally hang himself in his bathtub with the clothesline coiled around his neck. His death is ruled as a suicide, but Alex and Clear break into the mortuary to examine Tod's corpse. The mortician, William Bludworth (Candyman's Tony Todd), reveals that the survivors have disrupted Death's design, and the Grim Reaper is now taking the lives of those who were meant to die on the plane. Alex and Clear discuss their next move and realise that Alex's visions was Death's plan, he and the others have to figure out how to cheat death again. Carter confronts Alex outside a café, with the other survivors also arriving at the scene. Terry is angry with Carter continually arguing with Alex, and as she walks away, she is immediately hit by a speeding bus, splattering the others with her blood. After watching a news report about the cause of the explosion, Alex concludes that Death is reclaiming the survivors according to the order they were supposed to die on the plane. He works out that Ms. Lewton is next, and goes to warn her, but is taken away by the FBI agents. He is released without charge, but is too late to save Ms. Lewton, who is hit in the neck by an exploding computer screen, her house is set on fire, and she is impaled by a falling kitchen knife. The remaining survivors reunite while driving through town as Alex explains the situation. Carter, mourning the death of Terry, is both enraged and scared, and drives the car at high speed without controlling the wheel attempting to die. Eventually, he stops the car on a train crossing while the others get out. At the last minute, Carter is trapped in the car, as the car won't start, the door is locked, and the seatbelt is jammed. Alex manages to save Carter before the car is smashed an oncoming train. A piece of shrapnel is knocked onto the track, the train swipes up this shrapnel, which is sent flying in Billy's direction, the shrapnel decapitates Billy from the jaw up. Alex realises that because he intervened, it skipped Carter to the next person afterwards. Realising he is next, Alex hides in a cabin in the woods, and does stop an attempt on his life. But he recalls that he changed seats with two classmates in his premonition, meaning that Clear is actually next. Alex rushes to her house to save her while being pursued by Weine and Schreck. Death makes various attempts to kill Clear, including electric power breaks throughout the house, and a swimming pool spilled with a broken power cable thrown into the water on the ground. Alex finds Clear trapped inside her car surrounded by the loose electrical cables that ignites a gasoline leak around her. He grabs the cable, allowing her to escape from the car just before it explodes. Six months later, Alex survived, he, Clear and Carter have travelled to Paris, France to celebrate their survival. While discussing their ordeal, Alex reveals that Death never skipped him after he saved Clear. Fearing the nightmare is not over, Alex starts to walk away, when Clear warns him of a speeding bus, which he avoids. Then Carter saves him from a falling neon sign. It ends when Carter questions who is next, and the neon sign returns to crush them. Also starring Brendan Fehr as George Waggner, Forbes Angus as Larry Murnau, Lisa Marie Caruk as Christa Marsh, Christine Chatelain as Blake Dreyer, Barbara Tyson as Barbara Browning, Robert Wisden as Ken Browning, P. Lynn Johnson as Mrs. Waggner, and Larry Gilman as Mr. Waggner. All the performances are fine, it is a clever concept that the villain is Death itself stalking the victims, the editing and pace is okay, and it is eerie and creepy when it needs to be. I admit all the chat in between slows it down a little, but for the inventive, gory, and often over-the deaths, best being the train decapitation, it is a worthwhile enough horror thriller. It was number 46 on The 100 Greatest Scary Moments. Worth watching!",Final Destination

7,BA_Harrison,Nothing is certain but death and sequels.,8,11 December 2009,"Final Destination sees a group of students narrowly avoid being blown to smithereens in an airplane disaster after one of their number, Alex (Devon Sawa), witnesses the catastrophe in a vision minutes before it actually happens. Miffed at being cheated, Death decides to have another pop at each of the survivors, claiming them in the order they would have died in the midair explosion.This simple yet ingenious concept allows director James Wong to deliver a series of intricately designed and wonderfully imaginative death set-pieces that make this film one of the most genuinely entertaining and original horrors of the decade; not since The Omen films has violent death been so imaginatively planned and so much fun to watch unfold.As each victim reaches the top of Death's hit list, seemingly insignificant incidents cause a snowball effect that ultimately results in a horrific demise: a leaky toilet pipe winds up causing a guy to choke to death in his bathtub; a tiny crack in a mug kick-starts a chain of events that climaxes in a huge explosion; and a train hurtling past a piece of debris makes another poor schmuck lose his head (although not completely—just from the lower jaw upwards!).In an exciting finalé, Alex attempts to end the terror by trying to cheat death once again, only to realise that he has got the order all wrong, and it is pretty social outcast Clear (the lovely Ali Larter from Heroes) who is next up for the chop...With spectacularly gory deaths, a very likable and talented young cast, a dark sense of humour, a cool cameo from Tony 'Candyman' Todd, and a totally unique killer, Final Destination goes to prove that not all big budget, major-studio, teen-orientated horror is totally worthless garbage.",Final Destination
8,Quinoa1984,"""I'll See You Soon."" One of the best films of the new year",7,30 July 2000,"James Wong's Final Destination is a weird yet immensly entertaining horror film that has plenty of scares and a cool twist- the killer isn't some guy in a mask or a guy in a dress.  It's death, literally, coming for you.  The plot (spoilers I think) involves a kid who is going on a trip to Paris and on a TWA flight (I think this is a odd coincidence to TWA flight 800 plane that crashed in the summer of 1996).  But, the kid has a revelation before the flight begins that the plane is going to crash.  He gets off, and so do a few other kids in the comotion.  Two minutes later after the plane takes off, the plane crashes (talk about a messed up revelation).  But it gets better after that with the death.  Very clever, sometimes even funny, and always frightening, I think (unless nothing else comes along this year) this might be the best horror film of the year and definately one of the best teen slasher movies to come around in a while.  Best part- the mortician Tony Todd telling the kids that death is one mother****er you shouldn't mess with.  Reccomended.  A+",Final Destination
9,BandSAboutMovies,Better than expected,5,3 September 2020,"Originally written as an episode of The X-Files, Jeffrey Reddick ended up turning his script into a movie that became five films, two comic books, and nine novels. Not bad for a guy who sent in his first script to New Line at age fourteen, which led to a phone and mail friendship with studio head Robert Shaye.It was directed by James Wong, who also made The One and the 2006 version of Black Christmas. He would say, ""One thing we were all in agreement on from the start is that we didn't want to do a slasher movie. We didn't want a guy in a dark cloak or some kind of monster chasing after these kids. That's been done again and again.""On May 13, 2000, Alex Browning (Devon Sawa) and his classmates are supposed to take a senior trip to France. Before the plane takes off, he has a vision of the plane crashing and panics until Carter Horton (Kerr Smith) fights him. This gets both of them kicked off the place, as well as Tod Waggner (Chad E. Donella), Terry Chaney (Amanda Detmer), Billy Hitchcock (Seann Willam Scott), Clear Rivers (Ali Larter) and teacher Valerie Lewton (Kristen Cloke, named for famous horror producer Val Lewton). The plane crashes and everyone dies, but Death won't give up.It pays them back in exaggerated set pieces - stay tuned on those, they get even crazier - as Death must take them off the board. They learn exactly what they're in store for from William Bludworth (Tony Todd), who is pretty much the personification of life being snuffed out.In case you wonder, ""Hey, where have I seen this before?"" The answer is 1983's Sole Survivor and The Twilight Zone episode ""Twenty-Two.""Alternate titles in other countries included Destination in South Korea, The Death God Comes in China, Last Station in Turkey and it was almost called Flight 180.",Final Destination
10,Coventry,the worst possible villain...death himself !,6,26 June 2003,"Movies that scare you are rare these days. Some of the old classics like The Exorcist, Repulsion or Rosemary's Baby managed to make you shiver but when a nowadays horror film can frighten you, it's actually quite an achievement to itself. In fact, it's not the movie itself that is creepy but the whole idea behind it really gives you goosebumps. Alex and his class are going to France for a workweek. Many little signs make Alex afraid and a vision right before take-off makes him cause a scene. He and 5 others are thrown off the plane. While they're fighting in the lobby the plane explodes and all 287 passengers die. At that point you might think they're the luckiest people alive but...think again. They all start to die in the order they were supposed to die on the exploding plane. Why ?? Because Death had planned it that way. And there's no way you can escape your destiny. Alex starts to realize tries and tries to beat death again for himself and all the other survivors. Because he gets these little clues about what's gonna happen, he's always one step ahead... The first hour of this film is really good. The tension is built up efficiently and you just stare at it with your mouth wide open. You really awaits what will gonna happen next. The big advantage of this film is that it actually has no heroes. You have the feeling all the characters can die any minute. After this first astonishing hour, it all gets wasted a little. There are a little too many ""miraculous escapes"" to keep you alert. That's a damn shame cause you really get the feeling the makers could have provided this film with a better ending. Yet, no worries because by then the film proved itself already as highlight of the new generation of horror. For the rest: there's a good amount of violence, blood and gore so even the fans of that are satisfied. The cast does well actually. Most of them made some fame by now but when this film came out they were all rather new in the field. Except for Tony Todd of course. Mr Candyman is a great casting choice!!! His eerie appearance and his spooky voice make the hairs on the back of your neck rise",Final Destination

12,bevo-13678,Tricky,10,23 July 2021,"If you like the movie ""Tucker"" you might like this one. Then again you might not, as this movie is actually nothing like Tucker. I guess it would depend on your taste in movies.",Final Destination
13,hitchcockthelegend,I'll see you soon!,9,23 November 2008,"Before taking off for Paris, Alex Browning has a vision that the plane is going to explode. Pannicking he gets off the plane and in the mêlée a teacher and a group of his class mates are forced off the flight, the plane goes on to explode in mid air, killing everyone on board. But pretty soon after the disaster strange accidents start to befall those who got off the plane, it seems that death is out to get them.With the number of hugely disappointing teens in peril movies that were made post the success of Wes Craven's hugely successful Scream, it's refreshing to find one that was, well, refreshing. Not purporting to be anything other than a wickedly entertaining piece of horror based nonsense, Final Destination is inventive, funny and above all else, shock laden.From the opening, and terrifying air crash sequence to the clever and gross way that our protagonists shake hands with the grim reaper, this film is gloriously proud of its horror intent. One peak at the surnames of the characters will tell you just how into their horror roots the makers are here, whilst not a homage movie as such, James Wong and his team clearly know what makes a modern horror picture work.If you find yourself complaining about the writing then you clearly are missing the point of Final Destination's existence, either that or you are in fact dead yourself! Four fun but vastly inferior sequels would follow, but really this is the one to watch, as good a 100 minutes of horror fun as you could wish to have. I dare you not to jump out your seat at least once! 9/10",Final Destination
14,Theo Robertson,I Was Expecting THE X-FILES,6,11 November 2003,"Seeing as FINAL DESTINATION was written , directed and produced by people heavily associated with THE X-FILES I was expecting something very similar to the classic American show but in the early stages the movie reminded me of that episode of THE TWILIGHT ZONE where William Shatner is on a plane and Fozzie Bear from THE MUPPET SHOW is sitting on the wing . The film turns into a "" Teenagers dying one by one "" flick after this point which is a sub genre I`m not normally too keen on but this one is better than most mainly down to the way the director and screenwriter trick the audience into thinking a character is going to survive only to see them die seconds laterBy no means a classic movie FINAL DESTINATION is still a fairly entertaining one",Final Destination
15,Hey_Sweden,Death sure likes to keep busy...,7,7 March 2012,"'X-Files' veterans Glen Morgan and James Wong do well with this better than average, interesting horror movie. It's not wholly original - a little known movie titled ""Sole Survivor"" predates it by about 17 years, and its succession of elaborate murder set pieces calls to mind the ""Omen"" series - but it's slick and entertaining. Its premise hinges on the idea that Death has a ""design""; people can interfere with that design but are merely delaying the inevitable. Devon Sawa stars as Alex Browning, about to fly to Paris with his high school French class, only to experience a horrific vision of the airplane exploding. He and several others get off the airplane, which does indeed explode. However, the survivors won't have long to celebrate their good fortune as Death intends to claim them no matter what. Alex figures out the order in which they will perish and starts doing everything he can to intervene. The story becomes rather standard stuff as we watch our cast of characters get knocked off one at a time, and the brutality visited upon this unfortunate bunch is often extremely amusing, whether it involves stabbing, fire, decapitation, or being mowed down by a bus. Things get off to a moody, atmospheric, and ominous start with some well done opening credits and the viewer does get a sense of impending doom right away. One of the best touches is turning John Denver's song ""Rocky Mountain High"" (the late singer having perished in a plane crash himself) into a harbinger of death. The material is sincerely played by its cast, also including Ali Larter ('Heroes'), Kerr Smith ('Dawson's Creek'), Seann William ""Stifler"" Scott (""Goon""), Chad Donella (""Disturbing Behavior""), Daniel Roebuck (""Halloween II"" '09), Brendan Fehr (""The Forsaken""), etc. The sequence with charismatic genre veteran Tony Todd as enigmatic mortician Mr. Bludworth is far and away the best, with Todd making the most of his brief screen time. Pacing is good, the special effects mostly convincing, and all in all the movie makes for a good diversion, although it eventually gets bogged down in the whole idea of just what the order of death should be, and the ending is just not terribly satisfactory. Still, filmmakers have certainly gotten a lot of mileage out of the concept here, with three sequels and one prequel having followed this initial entry. This is fun enough material with a lot of shocks, a bit of self-referential flavour to the writing (characters are named after notable filmmakers and actors of the 1920's, 30's, and 40's), and a fair amount of style. Seven out of 10.",Final Destination
16,preppy-3,"Interesting idea, bad execution",3,20 March 2000,"The basic idea was good--teens going on a flight to Paris--one freaks out because he dreams of the plane crashing--he's escorted off the plane with a bunch of friends following--they're not allowed back on--the plane takes off and blows up. They cheated death, but he comes back and goes after them one by one. Can they cheat him again?Interesting but the dialogue is terrible (the scene in the funeral home with Tony (Candyman) Todd is particularly bad), the acting is lousy and basically I was bored silly. After a while you were just waiting for the next teen to get it. The death scenes were well done and gruesome, but it gets kind of depressing when you realize you're just waiting for the next teen to get it. Also, logic flies completely out the window at the end. A boring horror thriller. Too bad--that plot had real potential!",Final Destination

18,poolandrews,Great teen horror flick with a nice hint of originality.,8,15 September 2007,"Final Destination starts as 17 year old Alex Browning (Devon Sawa) & his classmates turn up at JFK airport in readiness to catch flight 180 to Paris, he boards the plane & it takes off & in midair it explodes killing everyone on-board. Alex them wakes up & realises it was a dream like vision, he becomes freaked out when the events which happened in his vision happen in real life & after causing a large commotion he along with several of his classmates are thrown off the plane before it takes off. They are left in the departure lounge as the plane takes off, then they all witness it as it blows up in mid air killing everyone aboard just like in Alex's vision. Those who walked off the plane try to get on with their lives but start to die under mysterious circumstances leading Alex to believe that death has come back to claim those he saved...Co-written & directed by James Wong I have to say I thought Final Destination when it originally came out was a breath of fresh air for the horror genre which was producing boring unimaginative teen crap for years like they were coming off on a production line, at the time I originally saw it at the cinema I genuinely thought Final Destination tried to be something that bit different yet still gave horror fans what they wanted. The script by Wong, producer Glen Morgan & Jeffrey Reddick was apparently based on a potential The X-Files (1993 - 2002) episode & I must admit I loved the idea behind it, I thought it was clever, fun & made a great central premise for killing off teens in spectacular ways. The character's are good considering their clichéd American teen origins, the dialogue is good with it's plot explained just about enough to make sense without going overboard & at less than 100 minutes it moves along like a rocket with some extremely satisfying & clever set-pieces. The film also has a healthy respect for the genre & there are lots of homages & references to other genre films including naming the cast after old horror stars & director's, Valerie Lewton anyone? Of course it's not perfect & I'm not trying to say it is, while they are OK the character's are just faceless teens when all said & done, the mortician character is just very out-of-place, one could say it's a touch silly & the set-pieces go from sinister & clever acts which conspire to dispense of a character to overblown full on ghostly events like possessed electric cables, exploding cars & entire house's blowing up & some of it's own rules are broken as if Alex wasn't the next victim because he never actually changed seats why did death try to kill him when he was at the cabin before Carter who was as it is revealed the next victim? Still, I'll leave the nit picking to the monkeys because I just thought it was a highly entertaining & pretty original teen horror flick with a good story & decent gore.Director Wong does a good job & the film is very stylish & great to look at although I'm coming off the back of a terrible run of zero budget shot on a digital camcorder crap that makes something that looks this good an absolute god send. There's a lot of visual gags here, I loved the prevailing sense of doom at the airport with the informations boards displaying words like 'departed' & 'terminal'! Plus there's a John Denver song playing in the airport toilets &, of course, he died in a plane crash! I was more than pleased to see the makers haven't skipped on the gore either, there's decapitations, hangings, embalming's, stabbings, broken glass in necks, someone gets splattered by a bus in a great scene & there's plenty of blood splashed around. The film has a nice eerie tension & has a few genuine jumpy scare moments.With a supposed budget of about $23,000,000 this is very well made, the CGI effects are decent although not perfect while the make-up effects are very good. The film is set in a south New York but was shot in British Columbia in Canada. The acting is pretty good from a recognisable & good looking teenage cast, horror regular Tony Todd makes a small & somewhat pointless cameo.Final Destination is, in my humble opinion, one of the finest teen horror popcorn flicks this millennium & it's as simple & straight forward as that. This proved enough of a success to spawn two sequels, the even better Final Destination 2 (2003) & Final Destination 3 (2006).",Final Destination
19,zardoz-13,Tongue In Shriek Fun!!!,8,31 May 2008,"Watching horror movies a lot is like landing a plane. Any landing that you survive is a good one. Any horror movie that can scare the grits out of you is good, too. Sure, you may feel embarrassed after you recover from either a false alarm or a dreadful fright, but the filmmakers managed to grip you by her fears and generate adrenalin. Now, the acid test for a genuinely good horror flick is whether the storyline is strong enough to maintain momentum during the expository lulls between the scary scenes. Director James Wong's creepy ""Final Destination"" qualifies as an improbable but entertaining dead teenager movie with enough twists and turns to keep you guessing until fade-out.Airline authorities remove a mixed bag of high school seniors bound for France from their ill-fated jetliner at the last minute when 17-year old Alex Browning (Devon Sawa of ""Idle Hands"") has a premonition about their 747 blowing up after take-off. Valerie Lewton (Kristen Cloke of ""Stay Tuned""), one of the teachers riding escort, agrees to behind with these reprobates while her Parisian cohort shepherds the remainder of the class across the Atlantic Ocean. While airport security guards detain them in the lounge, Flight 180 ascends into the night skies and explodes into a blazing fireball, with no survivors! Typically, any movie with a protagonist that rescues a collection of characters from certain death would win not only their undying gratitude but also their lifelong loyalty. ""Final Destination"" dispenses with such hackneyed histrionics. Instead, the people that Alex saved either hate his guts or have to stay away from him until their grief heals. Everybody but Clear Rivers (Ali Larter of ""American Outlaws""), a Gothic-looking gal whose dad died in a convenience store robbery and whose mom lost her marbles and abandoned her, takes a shine to the ostracized Alex. She knows that Alex has a gift for predicting the future, rather like Christopher Walken did in David Cronenberg's ""The Dead Zone"" (1983). No matter how hard these survivors try to cheat Death in this suspenseful, nail-biting, supernatural horror chiller, the Grim Reaper reclaims them like lost luggage in the end.Feverishly, Alex struggles to discern a pattern so that he can cheat Death and save the lives of his friends. Somewhere between its smart-aleck cynicism and its mischievous mayhem, this variation on ""The Dead Zone"" grapples with some high-flown philosophy. Can anybody cheat Death? Does the Grim Reaper work by some kind of design? ""Final Destination"" thrives on melodramatic shocks and surprises as well as several elaborately staged Rube Goldberg death traps to keep audiences on the edge of their seats. Picture ""The Omen"" movies cross-bred with a slasher saga, and you've got a fairly good idea what to expect from this outlandish but provocative thriller. Considering the credentials of freshman director James Wong, who co-wrote ""Final Destination"" with scenarist Glen Morgan, it should come as no surprise that ""Final Destination"" emerges as such an engrossing chiller. Wong and Morgan both worked on many of the most memorable ""X-Files"" episodes and it shows in ""Final Destination.""",Final Destination
20,Boba_Fett1138,A refreshingly original horror movie.,8,30 May 2006,"In the '90's the Scream trilogy meant the revival of the horror genre and teen-horror in particular. After that lots of horror movie were created that all were very much alike and of average (at best) quality. ""Final Destination"" however is one fine exception and it distinct itself from other genre movies through its originality. I consider ""Final Destination"" to be one of the most refreshing and original horror movies of this decade.It's not a horror movie with monsters or scary serial killers. It's a movie with an invisible villain; death itself, which is determined to kill everyone that escaped his clutches. It's a great and original concept that is executed even better as expected. The fact that the 'villain' is invisible provides the movie with some moments that makes this movie distinct itself from any other movie out of the same genre.Reason why this movie was even better than I anticipated were the deaths in this movie. Every death in the movie is highly complex and wonderfully constructed and executed. You know something bad is going to happen but you never know how and when. Therefor the deaths and way of death all still come as a surprise. It makes the movie very tense and also both scary and gory to watch at times.The movie starts of with a spectacular (but still obviously 'low' budget) plane crash. Fortunately after its beginning the movie doesn't loose any of its pace and the movie mostly remains spectacular to watch throughout its running time, which is only 98 minutes short.All of the actors are obvious B-movie material, which is fine and works out really well for a genre movie like this one. Don't get me wrong, the acting is not bad but none of the actors will win any big award, or star in a blockbuster any time soon. Fine exception, I must admit, perhaps was Seann William Scott who plays a fun role and perhaps shows his very best acting skills yet, in this movie.The movie has some awkward moments and some weak dialog and character treatment at times but thankfully it doesn't really make the movie any less entertaining or good to watch.An highly recommendable, refreshingly original horror flick that surpasses almost every other horror movie of this decade, so far.8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",Final Destination
21,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,"Different... the good kind, mind you",7,28 May 2008,"This is perhaps best described as a slasher flick with a twist. The concept is interesting and well-developed, and remains both throughout. As long as you can do away with your disbelief for the duration, and accept that Death is going through something of a flashy phase, you're likely to enjoy this. The plot is reasonable, and keeps things going. The ending... *wow*. Thank you, Wong. Awesome job on that. The pacing is good, this certainly never gets boring. The effects are exceptionally done all the way. The acting varies, but it's never distractingly poor. Dialog... about the same, with some real high points here and there. The humor is absolutely great. It's never forced nor does it ever try too hard, and genuine comedy is the result, and it doesn't reach a level where the seriousness of the whole is lost, either. The cinematography and editing, the technical side of this in general, in marvelous. While there is some violence herein, this operates more through building tension. Suspense. The shocks are rather effective(they sure still work on me, and I've watched this a bunch of times). The writing isn't entirely flawless. I recommend this to fans of atmospheric horror, as well as the people who worked on it. 7/10",Final Destination
22,view_and_review,Death is coming for you and it won't be pretty,3,30 January 2007,"A high school class is boarding a plane to go on a trip. One of the boys' has a vision of the plane exploding and decides to get off. A few other teens join him as well as the French teacher. Upon take off the plane does blow up and so the group effectively eluded death... at least for the moment.One scene wraps up this movie for me: The teacher is cooking something on the stove. She has a mug near the fire and it gets hot. She pours some liquor into the mug and the cold liquor cracks the hot mug unbeknownst to her. She proceeds to walk into her living room near her computer. Some of her drink leaks through the fine crack in the mug and gets into the computer monitor. The computer monitor short circuits AND BLOWS UP!! sending a shard of glass flying right into the lady's neck. She still isn't dead though. With blood spewing from her neck she stumbles into the kitchen to get a towel. The fire is still going on the gas stove and they bring a lot of attention to that. Somehow she falls down on her back, but she is still groping for a towel. While on her back, with one hand still trying to stop the bleeding, she grabs the towel she was groping for. OOPS!!! The towel was under a wooden block full of stored knives!! They all fall out of the storage block, face down no less, and puncture her in numerous places. Death is not finished yet. To make sure she is dead, and that her young student doesn't rescue her, the towel caught on fire and proceeded to burn up the entire kitchen, the rest of the house, and of course her as well.AB-SURD!! That describes the movie. It was wholly absurd. How many freakish ways can you be killed? I guess the makers of this movie wanted to explore all 6 million. It was bad enough that a girl got hit by a silent bus that was traveling 60 mph and didn't brake though it had splattered flesh all over it, and that a ""live"" wire took on a new meaning when it came to life and literally attacked people, but they had to go way over the top with the teacher. I don't mind reality being stretched a bit, but there are limits to where my intellect just says: ""This is too much.""",Final Destination
23,anaconda-40658,This Film's Final Destination Should Be in the Trash.,4,22 May 2015,"Final Destination (2000): Dir: James Wong / Cast: Devon Sawa, Ali Larter, Kerr Smith, Seann William Scott, Tony Todd: Teen horror film showcasing various methods of death. It addresses the very unavoidable point where a person dies. Plot regards a plane that explodes upon take off and the students that died on their way to Paris for a field trip. A group of students and a teacher are removed after a fight breaks loose. Devon Sawa claims that he saw the incident before it happened. Was he dreaming? At the funeral he is met with jeers by those who believe that he had something to do with the incident. Then the remaining students die graphically leaving Sawa to believe that they tricked death and are being reclaimed. Director James Wong gives an ominous appeal but despite a decent setup it is still a gratuitous gory mess. Ensemble cast include Sawa as well as Ali Larter, Kerr Smith, and Seann William Scott. To be fair, Sawa holds his own as he struggles to understand these visions and trying to outwit fate. The rest of the cast are mere types. Larter is that hot chick romantic interest. Smith is that rival bully. Scott is that student who wishes he was playing Stifler in American Pie as oppose to lending his time to this cardboard. Tony Todd is laughable in a sinister ominous moronic role. Special effects are fine but the best destination for this gore fest is the trash can. Score: 4 ½ / 10",Final Destination
24,bombersflyup,Live it up Alex. Ya got your whole life ahead of you.,8,5 October 2018,"Final Destination is a light horror film, with a great premise that's not fully capitalized.A terrific idea and cast, but doesn't focus enough on the dialogue and characterization. The characters too simplistic and one-dimensional, you have different character types that maintain the same thought process throughout the film. Alex has Ali Larter's character in love with him, a young guy who's seen looking at his penthouse magazine, yet never once wavers from thinking about death's design. There are also too many coincidences. They all happen to be at a certain place at the same time, or Billy riding his bike by when Alex's running out and why did he not warn the FBI that Valerie was next instead of just standing outside her house. The slow build up excellent, dealing with the deaths of those on the plane and the death scenes of those before they know it's coming. Though once it gets down to the last four and they know they're next, it's not as interesting. X-Files writers Wong and Morgan, use quite a few actors that appeared once or twice on the show.",Final Destination
25,kannibalcorpsegrinder,A near-perfect modern horror classic,10,28 October 2018,"When a vision saves him and his friends, a teenager intending to go to a class trip to Paris learns that the strange accidents befalling them are the result of Death coming to claim them for escaping the plane crash and sets out to prevent their deaths from continuing to kill them off.This one ended up being quite an impressive and enjoyable effort. Among the numerous qualities here is the fact that there's a ton of high-quality suspense here which runs throughout this one since there's a lot of focus here in making the scenes suspenseful. Due to the ploy of not knowing when Death is going to strike and where, there's a big part of the film that gets really chilling as this one really plays up the accidental nature of the setups to drive home how randomly it strikes as the bathtub sequence, the attack at the teachers' house where all sorts of fun accidents are unleashed in order to keep playing up what's going to be the final killing blow and their encounter in the car out on the highway as they try to pull a friend out of a trapped car-seat with a train approaching them in the intersection which is incredibly fun. These are suspenseful setups that take the concept of his visions and really bring a thrilling underlining to the scene. There's plenty of suspenseful times elsewhere here, as the opening buildup on the plane before the takeoff which reveals itself as a startlingly realistic dream which sets up the remaining storyline about the clues and the possible manners of stopping the events from continuing, the save at the garage and the encounter out in the woods all come off just as good as the actual kill scenes in here which manage plenty of thrilling scenes all throughout here. As well, there's plenty of action here with this one that are just as much fun as the suspenseful ones which keeps this one moving along so well as each of these scenes plays out as truly fun action scenes that take the suspenseful setups into quite enjoyable levels as there's a great bit about actually getting the death scene going which goes all the way to the finale where that comes off really well. The other big plus here comes from the film's ingenious plotline where it continually manages to feature some great twists featuring the way Death is presented here as a physical, thinking entity that plans out life in advance without anything being done, working through this concept here in knocking off the survivors in a special order which is a truly original and unique idea that gets played out in a rather enjoyable manner. Along with the fine gore-packed kills, these here make this more enjoyable enough to hold out over the film's one flaw. There's almost nothing to like here about the federal investigation into the incidents which gets tiring with all their interludes that goes nowhere and never really gets resolved with the attempts to pin everything on him without having any real info to finger him on. Otherwise, this is only what keeps this one down.Rated R: Graphic Violence, Graphic Language, and Brief Nudity.",Final Destination

His friends start to believe he had something to do with it also and slowly fade out of his life.

Alex starts to believe that fate is starting to taking it's toll...One of the last original ideas ever for teen horror movies, before the onslaught of all them decidedly dodgy remakes that Joel Silver started off. The film is virtually fool-proof and the synopsis has winner written all over it. It's not as effective when you see it a second time, due to a certain bus scene, but you cannot deny the originality of the deaths and the story.The cast appear to be having a ball, and the only person who seems miscast is Wiilam-Scott, who is and always will be Stifler.It's jump-tastic, sick, and most of all, a funny movie too.And the most cleverest thing about it?

His raving on said plain gets him and a few others kicked off. Having missed the flight we see that Alex's premonition was fulfilled.

Glen Morgon and James Wong are two gifted guys in my eyes, and barring the mis-step that was ""The One"", I've enjoyed their film and TV work immensely.

28,Wuchakk,"Innovative premise for a 'Dead Teenager Movie,' but the last act isn't compelling",6,30 October 2018,"This first ""Final Destination"" movie from 2000 was a rather innovative 'Dead Teenager Movie' in that the killer was Death itself, the Grim Reaper. A group of people escape a great tragedy due to a premonition of one of them and the rest of the movie involves the Grim Reaper systematically slaying those who cheated Death in various creative ways. The opening tragedy in this case is a plane crash; in the second film it's a horrible highway pile-up; in the third it's a roller-coaster mishap and so on.I've seen all five of the currently five-film franchise, but they each tell the same basic story with different characters and a different location and are all of the same high quality of filmmaking, technically speaking. Whether you prefer one or another depends on whether you like the cast and the death sequences (and the locations) because, other than these factors, they're all basically the same.This first one has a quality heroine or 'final girl' in Ali Larter. Amanda Detmer is also on hand as a fellow student while Kristen Cloke plays a freaked-out teacher. They coulda done better showcasing these women IMHO. On the opposite side of the gender spectrum there's Devon Sawa, Kerr Smith, Seann William Scott and Chad Donella. Their importance to the story is in that order. Meanwhile Tony Todd makes his first of four appearances in the series as a mortician who curiously knows more than he should.For me, what makes these movies kinda dull is the fact that it's impossible to cheat Death. Sure, you can escape it here or there, but Death's been in business for millennia and expertly knows what he's doing. As such, everyone's gonna die except maybe the 'final girl,' who will most certainly die in the sequel.The script began as an X-Files teleplay and, indeed, the movie was made by two veterans of that series. And you can tell due to the basic feel of the movie and the inclusion of two government agents. I'd give ""Final Destination"" a higher grade because I love the concept, but this one curiously gets dull in the final act (despite all the 'exciting' things going on) and they coulda done more with the women.The film runs 1 hour, 37 minutes and was shot in the Vancouver, British Columbia, area (although the events take place around New York City).GRADE: B- (6.5/10)",Final Destination
29,The_Void,A good premise is squandered by stupid teen cliché's,5,9 January 2005,"The idea of cheating death, and then having death itself 'chase' you until the only conclusion ensues is a frightening one, and a really great premise for a horror movie. Death is the ultimate unknown and the idea of it being a malicious presence should give way to a classic horror movie. However, anything that should have been good about this movie isn't, and unfortunately it ends up being another teen slasher, just with an invisible killer instead of some goon in a mask. After a relatively decent start, the movie descends into a routine, cliché ridden, teen horror movie with not an interesting character nor a frightening scenario in sight. The story follows a group of teenagers and their teacher (also a teenager) that survive a plane crash after one of them has a premonition and gets himself thrown off the plane. What then follows is a series of over the top death scenes intertwined with a boring 'investigation'.It's a shame that this film is rubbish as the death sequences aren't that bad. We've got one kid being strangled in the bath, another is decapitated by a piece of stray metal while another is mauled by glass from a computer monitor, and later a set of kitchen knives. However, it's all spoilt by the boring characters and silly dialogue (imagine 'death' is after you; would you really 'challenge' it with harsh language?). I'm all against remakes, but this is a premise I'd love to see tackled by a talented group of people. With a good cast, interesting writing and a talented director; this idea could be taken all the way to the realms of the horror classic. Unfortunately, the chances of anyone making a film like that these days is slim because all of these sorts of things have to be done with 'teens' (a.k.a. actors in their early twenties, playing teens) for teens to ensure that the film will sell.

31,DICK STEEL,A Nutshell Review: Final Destination,6,20 May 2007,"I watched Final Destination 3 without watching the first two, so thanks to DVDs, I'm going to make amends. The most I know about the first Final Destination was that explosion onboard an aircraft was one of the most realistic ever, and probably had this movie banned from inflight entertainment systems.Alex Chance Browning (Devon Sawa) has a fear of flights, and in his class outing to Paris, he had a premonition about the flight going boom, and created enough a ruckus to have him thrown out of the plane, together with a few of his friends and teacher. Naturally he becomes guilt ridden, and prime suspect when the plane explodes mid-air without a clue as to why (following the actual TWA flight 800). Together with Clear Rivers (what a name, played by Ali Larter), they discover that if they were destined to die in that flight, then Death will soon be on his way to complete his mission, in the order that they were supposed to go.It brings to mind that our deaths are probably pre-ordained the moment we are born, and death has designed the way we have to go too. The premise is that should you beat that design, then you get a second chance. But are we up to that? Nope, because we want to see how the cardboard characters get sent on their way. However, the deaths presented here aren't really horrific or designed with grandeur, probably because they don't age so well over time. They do seem rather gimmicky in today's context.Not expecting an adrenaline rush each time the characters die or beat death, the plot does get slowed down because of the romance bit between Alex and Clear (and most ended up on the cutting room floor), so they do come across pretty jarringly. And the group size for death is relatively small, so you don't go beyond that number, including survivors. It's a pretty decent thriller, but a reminder that the nature of these thrillers is that they age quite badly over time.",Final Destination
32,StevePulaski,"Might have you yelling ""oooh,"" ""oh!,"" and other things at the screen",9,10 August 2011,"What makes Final Destination rise above other films of its horror genre is there is no designated killer. It's all just a series of ""accidents"" triggered by an non-present force. It's crafty, campy, and of a different breed. It's smart, stylistic, without being too over-the-top. The only scene I can think of in this film that pushes the limit is the scene where one person is strangled to death. It's clear the screenwriter pondered on how force can strangle someone.This is another horror film where you don't know how to feel when watching it. Tense? Scared? Freaked? Sadistic? Excited? When I saw this film, around the age of seven, I was nothing but amazed. I kept trying to figure out what the hell was making these things fall and what was leading these people to die. When I watched movies, up until around ten, I truly didn't pay attention to any dialog (odd now how I brutally critique films that lack it), I just went along for the ride.Alex Browning (Sawa) is going on a class trip on a red-eye flight to Paris. Just before take-off, Alex has a brutal premonition where the plane explodes, and everyone dies. Upon awakening, Alex, like anyone, is freaked out and his panic causes classmates an orphan Clear (Larter), his bestfriend Tod (Donella), the teacher Ms. Valerie Lewton (Cloke), his rival Carter (Smith), Carter's girlfriend Terry (Detmer) and goof-off Billy (Scott).Sure enough, the plane explodes in a fiery burst killing everyone. Alex, now realizes, he has an unprecedented ability to vision an accident before it occurs. Now, the people who made the lucky attempt to get off, and dodge death, are now killed off one by one in the order they would've died on the plane. The order I won't spoil because they explain it thoroughly (and I mean thoroughly) in the film.Over the years, the dialog in this film has gotten more attention by me. First it was about the deaths, then I listened to information that was around the deaths (like a few minutes before it would happen), then I would go crazy researching the film to get every pinpoint detail on the film before going back to watching it with my undivided attention. I was a mess. I loved the film. I loved every frame of it. Loved its dare to be different style of film-making, and loved every character, even the antagonist bully.There are some movies you can't put a price on and Final Destination is the one for me. Despite its questionable premise, it tackles it in a fantastic, and enjoyable manor. It doesn't get too comical (you can save that for the fourth film), and even though you could see sequels in the film's headlights, you anticipate them to be just as good as the first if the film sticks to its formula, limits its comedy, and has believable, realistic deaths.Starring: Devon Sawa, Ali Larter, Kristen Cloke, Kerr Smith, Chad Donella, Seann William Scott, Amanda Detmer, and Tony Todd.

But today I decided that maybe I should give these movies a chance, I heard from a couple people that they were pretty good. I apologize to the writers and director of Final Destination, because this was one of the better horror movies I have seen in a while.Basically, Alex and his fellow students, including four teachers, are going on a field trip to Paris, but Alex has a horrifying nightmare of the plane crashing horribly and exploding killing everyone. Right before they take off, he screams and tells people to get off, but only 6 follow him, one of which is in a fight with him, one of which believes him, one of which who was late for the flight, one of which was a teacher comforting him, one of which was his best friend, and one of which is the girlfriend of the guy who is in a fight with Alex. The plane explodes, killing everyone, thinking they're safe, Alex realizes that they were meant for death and it has a pattern, but it's a matter of playing Death! Final Destination is original and a terrifying story that brings up the interesting subject of fate and destiny and if you make it or things should happen naturally. Not to mention the pretty cool death scenes that occur in this film is any horror fan's dream of watching.

35,thesar-2,Don't Count on the 'Final' Part,8,19 February 2011,"In an agethe late 1990s and early 2000sof the horror revamp (thanks, Scream) comes one of the most clever and original horror/slashers to date: Final Destination. In fact, it was so smart, it was a slasher without a slasher and the main enemy/culprit that you won't see.Nowadays, the character of ""Death"" has been mocked pretty heavily, thanks mostly to Family Guy, but here, it's not so nice. Sly, but fair. Invisible, but present.A high school class is headed for 10 days to Paris, only ""nobody"" Alex (Sawa) has a pretty descript vision of their plane not making it a few hundred yards, let alone across the world. Awaking, and he really does, his outburst causes some of his peers and one teacher to deplane only to watch his premonition come true before their eyes. And, the FBI gets involved, thinking Alex has something to do with the explosion.Picture it: the year was 2000. The date of release: 3/17/00. Just think if this movie would've been delayed another year and a half. Or even then, if it would be released at all.Anyhoo, each of the survivors are naturally freaked, and when they ""mysteriously"" die one by one, Alex relies on his newly found intuition to solve the reasons of the deaths while heavily relying on Clear Rivers (Larter) – love that name, by the way – and Bludworth (Tony Todd of Candyman fame– the perfect choice for the undertaker.)Apparently, there's a pattern, a new one, that is, since Alex stepped in Death's way. Is that a role you'd like to take? Or would you be able to double dip in saving the survivor's lives?The movie, though a little hokey at times, is nearly brilliant for what it is. I remember shouting out, when it first came out, ""FINALLY,"" an intelligent horror movie. A thinker. And with a great cast. I would soon grow to love (yeah, I mean LOVE) Ali Larter, although the rest of the cast did what they needed to accomplish. Even Seann ""Stifler"" William Scott down played his typical over-the-top performance – but not by too much.The movie was equally shot well, had well-thought out ""death-by-accident"" scenes and a good soundtrack/score. It's not too deep, but its fun and quick and tight – what all horror movies should be. Also, it was refreshing to see that the absence of sex, nudity and excessive amount of gore can still drive/sell a ""teen"" horror movie.Highly recommended, if you haven't already partaken in Death's plan.",Final Destination

With the exception of Terry (Amanda Detmer), one of these who left flight 180 before it took off, the rest of those survivors who were later killed died in a number of complicated Rube Goldburg-like scenarios that took as much as five minutes to finally snuff them out.Alex somehow figures out, by watching the news of the plane crash on TV, the path of the explosion on the plane that hit the very seats that he and the other survivors of the plane crash were assigned to! And with that Alex could now predict, by the sequence of who's seat on the plane the fireball first hit, who'll among those who survived will be the next persons to die. This of course has everyone, including the local police and FBI, feel that Alex was somehow responsible for the taking down of flight 180! But just how he could have known that the plane was going to crash is anyone's guess! Was it sabotage? Was it that Alex knew that there was a bomb planted on the plane by terrorists? Or the most obvious explanation, and at the same time least scientific, is it that Alex could really see into the future and thus saw what was going to happen to flight 180 far, like 10 minutes, in advance!***SPOILERS*** The film starts to get a bit off base even in its storyline in the sequences of those who are to be killed, according to the explosion pattern on the doomed plane, that you get lost watching it. Alex for all his proved paranormal powers is totally ineffective in convincing anyone of those targeted by death-until it's almost too ate-that the end for them is going to come and come real soon. Pretty good horror/thriller even though it's, seeing one's death in the future, been done dozens of times before but never with-the mind-boggling death scenes-the ingenuity that's in it!",Final Destination

38,wellthatswhatithinkanyway,The first part of the Final Destination,7,22 February 2006,"STAR RATING: ***** The Works **** Just Misses the Mark *** That Little Bit In Between ** Lagging Behind * The Pits As he boards a plane on a class trip to France, Alex (Devon Sawa) begins to have premonitions that the plane and everyone on it will meet a terrifying end. As a panic attack sees him and some other trip members hauled off, it is not long before this is exactly what happens. But it seems the hands of fate that saw the deaths of all those on the plane has not stopped at the survivors and Alex and the rest of them soon find themselves in a terrifying wrangle with the hands of death itself.Despite the very interesting and original concept, the FD movies were ones I'd failed to pay much attention to until weirdly enough the promotional poster for Part 3 made me want to go see that, but I thought it would be a good idea to get acquainted with Part 1 (and maybe Part 2) first and with this first movie making an appearance on Channel 4 at the weekend (obviously on the back of the new film) I took my chance.This is an interesting idea for a horror movie, because unlike the usual phantoms and boogeymen characters in these films must overcome, here the protagonist is the very phantom force all of us will tangle with at some point: death itself. It's a real, believable evil and the original concept is used very effectively, even if I found some of the plot developments a bit predictable.The movie also suffers from a naff character in the shape of Sean William Scott. But from title to idea, this is a clever movie indeed, with some typically inventive death scenes for this genre. ***",Final Destination

I really don't see how this film became a successful franchise, there is nothing here that makes it any bit worth the watch, it wants to be a horror very desperately, but the set up and the way the story plays out is impossible not to laugh at, it dosen't really do anything right. Putting this under horror and thriller is an embarrassment for those genres, it really isn't scary, it never had me looking away or feeling in fear, the effects in the film are awful, Wile E. Coyote's injuries in Looney Tunes cartoons are honestly more realistic than these deaths, it's not one bit thrilling, the dialogue is stupid and tries to be comical way too often. Any bit of potential this film may have had is completely blown away by its brutal cast, they are some of the worst performances I've ever seen in a major Hollywood production, it surprises me that they even managed to get past one audition, they're ridiculously fake, the love scenes aren't convincing, nor is the confrontation between characters or any indication of friendship, there is literally no chemistry and because of this the cast fail at this movie big time. Boring, poor story, questionably bad performances, there is nothing that could possibly allow me to recommend Final Destination. A group of teenagers find themselves at the mercy of a force that is intent on killing them off one by one. Best Performance: Seann William Scott Worst Performance: Devon Sawa",Final Destination
41,CuriosityKilledShawn,Seriously bad film,1,1 June 2000,I thought the spate of teen-based horror flicks was over. I thought that by the time we got to I Still Know What You've Forgotten Some Summers Ago (or whatever) that it was all finally milked for every penny it was worth (!). I was wrong.I can't think of a plot more grotesquely stupid that of Final Destination. Five minutes into it I predicted every single frame that was still to come.Kerr Smith's character irritated beyond comprehension. Every 2 seconds he started a fight for NO REASON and was bullheaded and annoying through-out the whole film.While some of you may think that Final Destination is different from the rest of teen-horror flicks out there it has one very-annoying similarity that no can deny. And that is...actors in the mid-to-late 20s playing teenagers. It gets me every time.,Final Destination

46,paulclaassen,A classic is born!,7,24 April 2020,"Ahhh, a classic horror film. The slasher films are back (then again, did they ever leave?). 'Final Destination' is an interesting concept where Death itself is the antagonist in a slasher film.After an impressive opening, the film gets more freaky. All the characters die in freak accidents, and - come to think of it - is actually so possible. For these youngsters, death is sure to knock on the door. Even though we expect it, some deaths are very unexpected - if you know what I mean - and quite shocking. The execution (pardon the pun!) of the plot is interesting and rather thrilling. The very idea of cheating death is alluring.Even more interesting, is when the characters realize they will die in the order of which they were supposed to die. Paying attention to signs all around you might save your life, but then death moves on to the next person in line, until it is your turn again, and again you have to try and outwit it. Very clever premise indeed!The film is atmospheric and foreboding, with disaster lurking around every corner. The cast is pretty good and convincing, and so are the visual effects. The action sequences are also very well done. A great amount of detail went into the making of this film.",Final Destination
47,sol-,Foresight,6,6 October 2017,"Having foreseen the impending explosion of a plane and saved his friends' lives, a teenager becomes convinced that they accidentally cheated death and that a grim fate still awaits them in this slick horror-thriller. While similar to Thom Eberhardt's 'Sole Survivor', this latter film is still blessed with a fairly original premise and there are several intense moments to be had as the teens try to avoid Death coming for them after two of the surviving friends die in mysterious circumstances. The premise does, however, offer far more questions than answers, such as why Devon Sawa's character is sometimes able to foresee what will happen, why Death takes so long to come after them again, and most strikingly, why almost all of the deaths are elaborate and over-the-top. Imaginative death scenes are great in a movie such as a 'Friday the 13th' sequel, but here it just seems pointless if we assume that Death really wants the characters dead. While it might not all make sense, 'Final Destination' is nevertheless incredibly well filmed. The early moments of Sawa's hyper-awareness pre-flight are very well done and the camera hardly ever sits still throughout, often gliding and sweeping over the characters in a creepy manner. The film additionally deserves some credit for ending on a darkly comic laugh for what it is otherwise a rather grim take on fate and predestination.",Final Destination

51,TheMovieDiorama,Final Destination uses its precognitive abilities to spawn a franchise devoid of suspense.,5,4 September 2019,"Yes, another influential horror series that is ferociously mediocre and stupid beyond belief. The franchise filled with inventive death sequences, narrow survivability and teeny weeny clichés all started here with Wong, a man clearly hellbent in forcing audiences to be mildly cautious of everything, everyone and everywhere. Except he forgot one crucial aspect. He had seemingly directed/written a horror, but where's the suspense? Where's the horror? And holy flailing live wire where's the characterisation? A teenager cheats death after experiencing a premonition of a plane (which clearly wasn't suitable for take off...) exploding. He and a multitude of students leave the plane before the catastrophic event takes place and now Death is curing his boredom by finding inventive ways to kill these fools.For instance, a teenager strangling themselves with a shower and unable to stand up. Or a girl being slammed by the most silent speeding bus. Maybe a monitor exploding like a bomb and dispersing shards of glass into a woman's neck. No wait, I got it! Decapitation by shrapnel! Anyway, despite how inventive and gloriously gory these death sequences were, whilst suspending your disbelief for the vast majority of the film's runtime, masquerading plot conveniences as determinism is incredibly lazy writing. Hang on! I know exactly what you're thinking. ""Uhhh the point of these films is that Death is controlling their outcomes"". And I get it. I'm fine with that. But you're going to try and convince me that all the survivors happened to be at the same café as one of them meets their early demise, to which was all part of Death's plan? Or Billy riding his bicycle at the exact moment a house explodes? No. Those are just conveniences that outline the amateurish writing capabilities of the screenplay writers.Speaking of screenplay, nearly every line of dialogue is used to theorise about Death's plan. These students aren't having natural conversations about their lives or what they had for breakfast. They discuss death in so much detail, that one could mistake them for being morticians. Cheer up guys, please! The lack of characterisation is woeful, and in turn makes us care less about who meets their demise or not. Honestly, didn't give a toss who got impaled by a washing line. Wong had his mind purely set on ""how"" they were going to die, as opposed to ""who"", and in turn deviated from the much required suspense that Final Destination craved.Fortunately the practical effects make up for the absent tension, particularly the introductory plane catastrophe, inducing plenty of gore being splattered on the screen. The acting was functional for a teen horror, although Sawa and Larter were standouts with their underdeveloped pairing, and the Goldberg effect on some of the deaths were fascinating to watch unravel. But then you see Death retreat the water that mysteriously followed Tod on the bathroom floor, and we're back to nonsensical stupidity.Final Destination is a film I appreciate, especially for its influence and staying power in the horror genre. Forever watchable and a great film to put on during a popcorn night. However it's irrefutably mediocre, with stupidity around every corner and morticians randomly delivering excessive exposition, so much so that Death has seemingly possessed everyone into thinking it's actually decent.",Final Destination

56,Anonymous_Maxine,"A relatively interesting premise, but Final Destination ultimately sinks nearly to the level of the mass of bonehead teen thrillers that have been so prevalent in the 90s.",5,23 August 2001,"(spoilers) Final Destination starts off really well, with our unlikely hero Alex in a great scene where he has a dream that the airplane that he is on with all of his high school friends (what high school goes to Europe for a senior trip?!) is going to explode upon take off. This is unquestionably the best scene in the film, both for its creativeness as well as its effectiveness. This kid falls asleep on the plane as everyone is boarding (another common occurrence among high school kids on planes filled with their friends, I'm sure), and has a dream about a defective seat back table and a subsequent, and pretty impressive, explosion on the plane that kills everyone.
As the plane is going up in flames and people are getting sucked out through the hole in the side of the plane and burning to death and whatnot, Alex wakes up in a cold sweat and a frantic panic. Suddenly back to reality, he climbs over people trying to get back to the seat where his dream takes place, and when he gets there, he finds the same defective seat back table that was in his dream and therefore concludes that it was a clairvoyant dream and starts yelling that the plane is going to explode. Not bad for a movie that doesn't appear to be anything more than the latest teen slasher movie. And to top it all off, the part where the plane actually does explode (as seen from inside the airport), and especially the brief pause before the windows of the airport explode inward as well, is also one of the more satisfying scenes in the film. Unfortunately, it's pretty much all downhill from there. It seems that by avoiding being blown to bits on the plane, the kids who got off (some whether they liked it or not) seem to have `cheated' Death, and Death doesn't seem to be too happy about it. They are apparently being stalked by Death, as he (or, more likely, she) begins killing them one by one in increasingly outlandish and sometimes laughable death scenes. Is this really as original and entertaining as the explosion scene at the beginning of the film? Probably not. In fact, not even close. A bunch of scared teenagers being killed off one by one. Can you name another movie where this has happened? Can you really name a horror movie made in the 90s where this HASN'T happened?On the one hand, you KNOW that nothing like these scenes would ever happen in real life. For the most part, computers that people have in their homes do not have anything in them that would explode if vodka were accidentally spilled into the monitor, and even if there was something like that inside it, it probably wouldn't explode through the screen, the strongest part of the entire thing. I also fail to feel any sympathy for someone who strangles in the bathroom because he thrashed his legs around while hanging by his neck from a cord, kicking his feet everywhere except directly underneath him. Take some knowledge, people (as this poor guy would have said), if you ever find yourself in a similar situation, stand up. It'll save your life. And don't even get me started on the power line at the end of the film that whipped around like a severed worm in fast forward. This is just garbage, couldn't they think of something better than that? Power lines do not behave like loose fire hoses on full blast when they are cut, they behave like cut cords. Probably the only death scene in the film that was really shocking and impressive (as well as relieving, given the character) was the one with the city bus.On the other hand, this stuff does have a sort of purpose. Sure, every death in the film was ludicrous (even the rather grisly one dealt to Seann William Scott), but this gives shape to the character of Death. It's one of the film's good points that the Grim Reaper wasn't personified as a huge shape in a black cloak, stalking the kids and killing them. That would have put Final Destination in the same stagnant pool with all of these other goofy teen slashers and also would have ruined the movie beyond all hope. Instead, we get these outlandish and often ridiculously exaggerated death scenes, so it almost gives the feeling that Death is taking time out of his busy schedule to hand these people their asses personally. As Mallory Knox would say, `There's no escapin' here!' There are very few interesting things about this movie, other than such things as that you can see Tony Todd, known as virtually nothing other than the Candyman, in a small role as the freakiest mortician on the planet. Also, it's interesting to ponder what would possibly have made Alex so hated and feared for saving those people's lives, especially when he is alienated the most by the very people that he saved. Carter, in particular, develops an unfathomable hatred for Alex that swells to the exploding point. You'd think those jerks would be grateful. At any rate, the film as a whole is entertaining enough, but doesn't make much progress in attempting to elevate itself above the recent abundance of terrible teen thrillers and slasher movies and horror films. It is far above the abysmal level of such messes as I Know What You Did Last Summer and Valentine, as well as hideous spoofs like the Scary Movies, but Final Destination is definitely not meant for a more mature audience. If you decide to watch it, try to enjoy it for what it is, but keep your expectations low.",Final Destination
57,videorama-759-859391,A 2000 destined hit,8,19 November 2013,"From the opening reel, as the haunting ominous music score plays, a evil and ugliness presents itself. As stopping at the dreaded number three of this series, (number two was a pretty good sequel) of course this one being the best, I liked the whole cool scenario, indeed something different. If I watched FD, again, (I haven't seen it was for years), it would pretty much have about the same impact of eerieness and foreboding, as first time around. On a class holiday to France, Devon Sawa (what happened to him) has a premonition the plane he boards, him and his mates board will burst into smithereens seconds after take off. Him and a score of students get off the plane. The others stay on it. The plane takes off again. Boom! It's just like Sawa envisioned. Then death starts hunting Sawa and his mates down, one by one, in a series of freak accidents. So becoming the hero here, Sawa must find a way to curb and beat this evil, before the handful become fewer. This is a cool 2000 movie, something completely different of that year. What's terrifying about Final Destination, is the story concept, as of the surviving kids, where death is inevitable, their fates decided. You're thinking, ""How could these survivors die, being so lucky?"". But, that was the killer element I loved. Some of them die in some pretty gruesome ways too, though this doesn't compare to No 2, I should warn you. It's frightening to imagine, living in a world where this story would be true. A comparison as to inevitability and fate, is like in the Hostel movies, where some lucky victims escape, but they're all not lucky for long, as the Elite hunts em' down. Their fates inevitable. Same frightening point here. Just check out it's last shock shot. FD boasts good performances from some up and coming stars, but as to lead, Sawa's diminishing future in thespian world, I can't help but feel sad if a little bugged. Chilling haunting psycho supernatural thriller/horror, all the way.",Final Destination

And I love the idea that the killer isn't a random man with a machete, or anything like that. The killer is Death itself. It makes for a much more interesting watch.In this movie, Alex Browning and his friends are all going to France on a school trip. But before take off, Alex has a vision that the plane will take off like normal, and then explode. We see his vision and it is very graphic, which I liked. He starts screaming, and tries to get off the plane. He gets in a fight with a fellow student, and is kicked off, and a few others follow him. Some because they are his friends or teachers, and some because they believe him. He and his friends are told they aren't allowed to re-board. So they watch the plane take off. Then, just like in Alex's vision, the plane explodes. Everyone thinks Alex had something to do with it. Could be a terrorist plot. But it's not. Over the next few weeks, all of the survivors, who got off the plan, start dying mysterious deaths. Alex and Clear, one of the passengers who believed him, find out that Death is killing them one by one, in the order they would have, if they hadn't gotten off the plane. They try to find a way to stay alive, but does it work? For now. They find out that if they interrupt someones death, then it skips that person and goes to the next on the list. And it works, until they realize that it's going to come back around.Overall, I give this movie a 10 out of 10.",Final Destination

His girlfriend Terry(Amanda Detmer) met her end to a bus, and everyone else die in a certain fashion that is unusually predictable to death that is. Avoiding death is unlikely impossible, but cheating death is more dangerous than that.

61,dfranzen70,Only visions I ever see are more slasher movies...,6,30 March 2000,"It looks like an interesting movie, doesn't it? High-school kid has horrible vision of an exploding plane while his plane's sitting on the runway, freaks out, and leaves the plane, taking a few classmates and a teacher with him. Boom! Plane explodes. Did the kid save them, or is he just off his rocker? Don't look for anyone you recognize in the cast. I've watched about a billion movies, and I recognized only the last guy I listed up there (Tony Todd, from Candyman). Basically, this is a movie in the young-people-scared-out-of-their-wits vein that was popularized with the Scream films. This one, fortunately, is well-written, albeit with some plot holes. Still, it's an intriguing premise. Does Death have a plan for each of us? If so, then this kid's act of getting people off the plane screwed it up royally, and now Death's really ticked off and - surprise! - one by one, the survivors are picked off. But this is a tiny cut about the standard people-being-killed-one-by-one movie. It's not just a matter of how people are killed in this movie; that would be the easy, tried-and-true method. In Final Destination, the fun is in figuring out who's next, and if the premise is to be believed (that Death does have a plan), then the mystery of who is supposed to die next will keep you guessing. There's some pleasure in figuring out who's next, since there are some characters you kind of hope get it sooner rather than later. That said, the acting is nothing to speak of - rather bland, really - and the direction itself is really bad. But the story's interesting and the effects, gory as they are, are frighteningly realistic. PRO: Story, effects. You want blood, you got it! CON: Acting, directing, effects. This is NOT for squeamish people. My score: 6",Final Destination
62,dee.reid,Scared Me Good,10,19 December 2000,"I have to admit that when I first saw the previews for Final Destination, I didn't think much.  But after reading several reviews that said how good it was, I thought about seeing it, but couldn't because of a busy year. 
The story is about a kid named Alex(Devon Sawa) who just so happens to have a fear of flying.  With a class of 49 students, they are going to France on a field trip.  When Alex has a horrific premonition about dying in plane crash, he freaks out and is kicked off the plane with five other students and teacher.  Minutes after getting kicked off, and Alex is calm, the unexpected happens, the plane actually does explode.  Over the next few weeks, however, teachers, the survivors, as well as the police become increasingly suspicious of Alex.  Some of his friends even think of him as a god.  Anyway, the survivors of the plane crash soon begin dying in gruesome and sometimes horrific fashions.  Alex soon discovers that by getting off the ill-fated flight, that he had intervened with Death's predetermined pattern.  Death, however, has made a new pattern and Alex must find out what it is to save his friends as well as himself. 
I have to say that this movie scared me and my parents good.  I also must say that this film deserves a lot praise.  Although the plot is not original, however the antagonist is, Death itself.  What I really liked about it was that Death never showed itself and that it turned simple everyday items into murder weapons.Of course no horror movie is perfect.  There is one beef I do have with Final Destination.  Some of the death scenes are pretty creative and terrifying, but some of them seemed to have been forced.  I mean who is going to place a beverage on top of a computer monitor?Other than this one minor flaw, Final Destination is still a great and scary horror film.8/10",Final Destination

Scream and its sequels might not be to everyone's taste, but they are cleverly made. Final Destination, by comparison, is unashamed nonsense. The ingeniousness of the actual deaths gives it a certain entertainment value but beyond that it's difficult to believe that even the actors are taking it seriously.

The film does a good job of setting up the suspense, who will get killed next but more importantly how, providing red herrings for a few surprises.

67,drownnnsoda,Surprisingly Original Concept.,9,27 August 2006,"""Final Destination"" is a horror movie that you can't help but love - while it might not be the scariest out there, it's originality and creative deaths make it great. The film starts off with a teenage senior named Alex (Devon Sawa) who is heading out on a field trip to Paris, France with his senior classmates. Afraid of flying to begin with, he is a little nervous. But after boarding the plane, he has a premonition of a horrible plane crash that kills himself and everyone onboard. Awaking from the dreamlike vision, he abruptly gets off of the plane, causing a scene, with a handful of other students and one of the teachers following. When the plane takes off, sure enough, it does explode, killing all onboard. But after the horrible accidents, those who survived (thanks to Alex's premonition) begin to die bizarre deaths. A loner named Clear (Ali Larter), who was among those who left the plane, teams together with Alex while they uncover that it just may be Death itself that has a 'plan'. And if the plan is intruded, those who cheated death are going to pay the consequences.This film deserves a 10 alone just for the complete originality of it's story. I've never seen another film of this subject matter, and it's quite interesting how the film plays out. I think it's a great idea for a horror movie, unique and original. The entire personification of 'death' scenario is an interesting thing to play with. The plane-crash premonition was intense, and since I'm terrified of flying anyway, it made me pretty uneasy. The deaths that follow throughout the film are quick, sometimes unexpected, and genuinely shocking. Some of the deaths are anticipated, you know it's going to happen, which is quite suspenseful. But some of the others caught me completely off-guard, they were so abrupt and unexpected that I was nearly speechless. The actors here were great, Devon Sawa fit the leading role as our hero who is trying to save all of his classmates as Death begins to pick them off. Ali Larter (from the ""House on Haunted Hill"" remake) plays his helpful sidekick, Clear, very well. The rest of the cast all did good jobs, and we even got a cameo from Tony Todd (of the ""Candyman"" series) as a mortician who Alex and Clear run into one night. The ending to film was clever and left it open-ended for the sequels that followed, which were both well-done but not quite as good as the original.Overall, ""Final Destination"" is an excellent horror movie. It's not really scary, but it has one of the most original stories among recent horror films, and the creative deaths and inventive sequences that take place make it all the more better. Surely worth a look for horror and thriller fans alike. 9/10.",Final Destination
68,hu675,Unusual horror premise is certainly well made but it's certainly takes itself too seriously towards the last act.,8,11 November 2007,"Alex Browning (Devon Sawa) is a young teenager nearly done with High School. He's going on a field trip in Paris, France with some teachers and a group of students. When he gets an bad premonition on the place, while taking a quick nap. Alex panics and frighten, he finds himself kicked out of the plane. A teacher (Kristen Cloke) and five students (Ali Larter, Kerr Smith, Seann William Scott, Amanda Detmer and Chad Donella) got off the plane as well. Once the plane takes off, a couple of minutes later. The plane got blown up in the air, while it was still close to the airport. Now some students and his teacher are frighten by Alex's premonitions. While two FBI Agents (Daniel Roebuck and Roger Guenveur Smith) thinks that Alex might have something to do the plane getting explode. Now weeks later... one by one, the students are dying from unexplained mysterious deaths and Now Alex finds out that something is after them. It is probably Death is after them for not dying in the plane crash like they were supposed to. Alex has to find other ways to stay alive to cheat death, while He is trying to convinced the survivors that Death is coming for death. He wants to help his fellow survivors but it's a tough thing to make them believe a crazy story like this.Directed by James Wong (Final Destination 3, The One) made an intriguing horror/fantasy/thriller that has an amusing dark sense of humour and a game cast. Wong certainly has plenty of moments of style and suspense. Wong and Co-Screenwriter of the film:Glen Morgan (Black Christmas ""2006"" and Willard ""2003"") certainly learned a lot from their days of writing television episodes like ""Space:Above and Beyond"", ""21 Jump Street"" and ""The X-Files"". Originally this film started as a TV script from Jeffery Reddick (Day of the Dead ""2008"", Final Destination 2 and Tarama). Which Reddick wrote it for a ""The X-Files"" episode at first. But the producers felt this could have been a terrific film.DVD has an sharp anamorphic Widescreen (1.85:1) transfer and an good Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. DVD includes three commentary tracks. Commentary one is by co-writer/director:Wong, co-writer/producer:Morgan, editor:James Coblentz and co-writer/story credit by Reddick. Commentary two is by actors:Sawa, Smith, Cloke and Donella. Commentary three is by the late talented music composer:Shirley Walker (Batman:Mask of the Phantasm, Escape from L.A., Memoirs of an Invisible Man). DVD also includes Deleted Scenes, Alternate Ending, Two great featurettes and more. Two/Thirds of the movie is certainly an very good movie. But then towards the last act of the movie turns extremely heavy-handed. I also felt towards the end, it starts making fun of their own rules as well. To be honest, i liked the ""Final Destination"" sequels better than the original. It also takes Reddick's clever premise much less seriously as it should and the sequels are slightly more entertaining. But what's i think. Still ""Final Destination"" is one of the better horror movies of the early 2000's. It's certainly worth seeing. (*** ½/*****).",Final Destination

It's a good premise, and it sets things up well, but then kind of gets less interesting as it goes. Some of the sequels actually outdo the original.

72,Enchorde,"Not as good the idea, but entertaining",7,10 September 2005,"** CONTAINS SPOILERS **Recap: Alex and his fellow students in the high school French club are going to Paris. But as they have boarded the plane, Alex has a vision of the plane exploding. He panics and angers fellow student Carter. A fight follows and the both along with some friends of theirs and a teacher are kicked off the plane. As they argue over the missed flight at the gate, they see the plane explode, just as Alex said it would. The terrible tragic is hard to deal with, especially if you ""saw"" it happen before it did. The school has a memorial hoping to heal all wounds, but soon thereafter odd accidents happen to those who survived the crash. They've cheated Death, and Death doesn't appreciate being cheated very much.Comment: As I heard of it I thought it was a stellar idea. You can't cheat Death, he will come for you. Though the end result is not bad, actually it is pretty good, it is not as good as I envisioned. Basically I thought you could spin it two ways. A) a horror comedy with a lot of freak accidents or B) a pure horror with a lot of deaths and scares. Now it's neither, or a little of both. First, there are too few people to kill of to begin with. Time as to be filled, so a subplot of Alex being suspected of foul play (and he has a incredible ability to incriminate himself) by the FBI. The subplot is good but does not fit any of my alternatives above, and I think it slows the pace of the movie a little too much. The cast is good even though this is (surprise) no Academy Award-winning performance. Best is Seann William Scott in a role very typical for him. Director James Wong and his crew of special effects workers should be mentioned. It is well worth to pay attention, and I also had as much fun reading through the trivia and checking up on them afterwards as I had watching the movie.7/10",Final Destination
73,Agent10,Intense film by former minions of the X-Files,7,31 January 2003,"Eerie, spine tingling and different, Final Destination proved to be one of those horror movies that didn't try to sell itself as a pure horror film. Throw in some intrigue and a ton of tension, and this film clearly brought a unique perspective on the horror genre. With a genre in decay, Final Destination really brought something different to the table. Unpredictable and breathtakingly sharp, the modes of death made you want to hide in your room for a long time. The acting was fair, but it was really the execution and style this film took upon itself to create imagery unlike any other seen. Sadly, few people try to take this film's lead, instead, they go for the classic monster/ghost story with some homely looking kid predicting all of the film's events with an aplomb a heart surgeon might have.",Final Destination
74,aidanratesmovies,Overrated- but fun,6,6 June 2021,"Enjoyable, but incredibly flawed- Final Destination takes its incredibly clever and interesting premise to B-movie levels of entertainment due to the talent involved and its inability to take itself seriously. First off, we need to talk about the acting in this film. Besides some actors performances seeming anything but convincing, the acting can also be incredibly over the top, overdramatic, and silly to the point of enjoyment (besides the brilliant Tony Todd who is as great as ever). This film is incredibly bizarre, because easly with some extra effort put into making it and a better cast of actors, it could have been a brilliant horror film- but instead its simply treading on smart ideas with unbelievably stupid characters. The look of the film is very bland, an incredibly dull and dark early 2000's point of view that ages about as well as you would expect. Despite the actors being unqualified, the film did prove to be quite thrilling along the way- some of the deaths throughout seem incredibly predictable- but others are more crafty and far better done in terms of suspense- which after all is what you want in these kind of movies. The film is incredibly entertaining throughout, and although the characters are thin and the actors are meh, you still care about what's happening as you want to see them prevail and survive this ridiculous nightmare that has been put in place for them. In the end, Final Destination is no brilliant horror film- nor do I think it is deserving of a 6.7/10 on IMDb- but it is rather enjoyable and I wouldn't mind watching it and laughing at it again sometime in the future.My Rating: 6.3/10.",Final Destination
75,rbverhoef,It works so why bother,7,28 June 2003,"'Final Destination' does not make any sense. The movie is not meant to be to make any sense so why would we bother that. It is supposed to be scary and it really is scary, sometimes. Although things are silly it is kind of original as well. A couple of people escape death because one of them had a vision. Because they messed up the plan death had for them death comes up with a new plan to kill the survivors. One by one they die but one of them, Alex (Devon Sawa), sees the design, the path that death follows. Together with the last survivors they are going to cheat death. One of them, Clear Rivers (Ali Larter), feels what Alex sees.You understand things don't have to make sense here. Right before the first time the group survives we see the vision Alex has. It is more than scary. After that things are a little the same but there are some nice ways to make a death scary. Like the sequel it is stupid but it works.",Final Destination

77,a_chinn,Okay horror flick from ex-X-Files talent,5,20 May 2017,"This film had a definitely inserting concept, that a group of teens who have ""cheated"" death after abruptly departing an airplane that ends up exploding upon takeoff, who then find themselves fighting for their lives as death stalks them in the form of a series of elaborate fatal and/or near fatal accidents and mishaps (ranging from seemingly simple bathroom slip and falls, to downed power lines, to elaborate car and train sequences). The film was written and directed by ""X-Files"" veterans Glen Morgan and James Wong, so from a technical standpoint, it's a well crafted film with excitement, suspense, and thrills. However, I'm not sure the film's premise was enough to sustain a feature length film. It also doesn't help that the characters are not all that interesting, though it is kind of fun to see a young Ali Larter. Overall, this film this lacked story and characters to sustain itself, but the elaborate death sequences were interesting and suspenseful enough to hold my interest and make the film worth watching.",Final Destination
78,Reviews_of_the_Dead,A Fun Popcorn Film!,8,19 June 2020,"This was a movie that I remember seeing when it first hit the movie channels growing up. I'm not sure if we got this off of pay per view or not, but regardless, it didn't take me long to see this one. It was also an interesting time as I seen Devon Sawa, Ali Larter and Seann William Scott in other things around this same time, but wasn't expecting them in a movie like this. It's been probably since college that I last saw this movie and it is thanks to Duncan and The Podcast Under the Stairs' Summer Challenge Series for the 2000s. The synopsis is after a teenager has a terrifying vision of him and his friends dying in a plane crash, he prevents the accident only to have Death hunt them down, one by one.We start this movie off with seeing the room of Alex Browning (Sawa). He is supposed to be going on a field trip to France with his classmates. We get to see some images hinting to things to come later in the movie as well as an interaction with his parents about not ripping off a previous flight tag on his luggage. Alex thinks it is bad luck. He then heads to the airport with his best friend, Tod Waggner (Chad Donella), his brother George (Brendan Fehr) and driven by their father, Larry Gilman.Alex gets an uneasy feeling about things in the airport. Things distract him and draw his attention, but he's not sure what they mean. We also get to meet the others that are coming on this trip with him. To name some of the important ones, we have an outcast of Clear Rivers (Larter), a jerk by the name of Carter Horton (Kerr Smith), his girlfriend is Terry Chaney (Amanda Detmer), a guy who is picked on of Billy Hitchcock (Scott) and their teacher Valerie Lewton (Kristen Cloke). Before they get on the flight, Tod convinces Alex they need to use the bathroom where Alex notices John Denver playing. He points out he died in a plane crash.They get on the plane and we get a scene where Tod won't switch seats to allow two girls to sit next to each other. Alex agrees though and they take off. Things don't go well as the plane ends up exploding. We see this is just a dream though. Alex wakes up in a panic and this agitates Carter. The two get in a tussle and are removed along with Billy who was in the way and Terry who went with her boyfriend. Clear exits as well, feeling uneasy and George tells Tod to check on Alex. Valerie gets off as well, having the other teacher get back on the flight.To their dismay, exactly what Alex said would happen does, the plane explodes. They're then interrogated by government agents, including Agent Weine (Daniel Roebuck) and Agent Schreck (Roger Guenveur Smith). They know something is up, but they can't put their finger on it. They become even more suspicious when Tod dies. It is thought to be a suicide, but we see it play out and there are forces at play. It appears Death is correcting its plan that was altered, but can it ever be fully cheated?Now with the recap out of the way, I've already said that this is a movie I haven't seen in some time, but watching it last night it really is pretty fresh still. I would catch this one whenever it was on movie challenges back in high school and after. I've also seen all of the sequels at least once and some of them a few times. For the most part, they're just fun, but I also think there is an interesting concept we are playing with here.What is interesting here is that I read this was originally going to be an episode of The X-Files that they decided to flesh out into a feature film. I will say, I do notice inconsistencies with the story that felt like caused by rewrites. The first is that Tod and George are brothers. I did realize this time this was for a French class, not for like a senior trip so that didn't bother me. There was supposed to be underlying sub-plot that I'm glad they removed where Clear and Alex were in love. The problem though is that there's a comment she makes that he hasn't spoken a word to her in school, but then the agents are coming to her to figure out where he is. They clearly weren't close, so it feels like just some minor issues where they removed things, but didn't completely clean it up.I will say though, I do love the idea that Death is an entity. It has a plan for us all. The movie never explains why Alex was given the premonitions. If this movie never gave us a sequel, I don't need this to be fleshed out and explained. I chalk it up to there are times I get a bad feeling about something and then something bad happens. There's no rational explanation. As humans we look for patterns and that is really what is happening. There are some that bit a bit cheesy to me where Alex can see a reflection for hints. I could do without that, but I like throwing the magazine and it cutting up a page to bear the name Tod. More of that works. They do really good though with symbolism of things like an owl or the spelling of Tod was used as it means death in German. John Denver also keeps being played and the way he did is an interesting parallel. These are all slight nods that just show care to me and almost giving that Death has a bit of flair for the dramatic.I also have to give credit to this film. It is not the first one to have elaborate death scenes that play like the game mouse trap. What I like though is that this made it popular and in the horror community we use the term 'Final Destination'-esque deaths when you get little things that all culminate to the end. With that said, I think for the most part they're good in this movie. For whatever reason, one of my favorites is Tod throughout the whole series. We do get some CGI, not a lot. I would say the effects are pretty solid overall. There are just a couple times it doesn't hold up, but it is surprisingly well done. I like the cinematography that makes it feel like we're right there with Death as it is playing things out.If I really have any gripes with the movie, it is with the acting. I don't have a problem with this cast in general. Sawa, Larter and Scott are all solid. There's a bit of overacting from Sawa and Scott. Larter has some issues with her dialogue, but I think that was probably from rewrites. I don't like Smiths' character if I'm honest. Cloke, Roebuck, Roger Smith, Donella and Detmer are all fine though. I do like the cameo from Tony Todd as he is quite creepy here. Plus any time you can give a legend like him screen time, you're doing it right. I do also love the care to name every character after silent and just after horror icons like Todd Browning, Val Lewton, Robert Weine, F.W. Murnau and Max Schreck to just name a few.So now with that said, this movie isn't great by any sense, but this is a popcorn movie that I could legit pop in at any time and just enjoy it. I think that we have a solid concept that doesn't need to be fleshed out too much and it is an interesting premise for sure. There are some pretty creative deaths here that legit could be accidents or someone could be doing it. The logical explanations do work where you could question things. All of the effects aren't great, but good enough for me. The acting is a bit average. It doesn't need to be great as it isn't the focal point. I would also say the soundtrack is fine, but it doesn't stand out. I would give this movie above average in my opinion.My Rating: 7.5/10",Final Destination

This must be one of the most enjoyable cinematic experiences I've ever had, and certainly one of the most memorable. Being 15 and seeing these cartoon death scenes in live action with gratuitous gore was awesome. I've decided to revisit the franchise and this film still holds up. There's great build up towards the opening disaster. It's filled with dread, even after having seen it so many times. The film is brilliant in that death is an unseen entity, you can't outrun it. As the death toll increases, the paranoia sets in. It also has some excellent moments of comedy without ever getting so stupid. Most importantly, we can actually care for some of these characters. They are not kept in this insular vacuum either. The FBI do take notice, but aren't trying to terrify these kids. It's weird, funny, and a little frightening.

I personally began being fascinated with death and its similarities after a car accident, where me and my three friends didn't even get hurt. Our car went upside down and we didn't get even a scratch, which made me reflect about life for months. I was looking forward to seeing this movie for long time expecting it to deal with death, destiny and human will for survival, and it did exactly as I wanted to. I don't believe in such things as design and so, but a good movie like this one makes you reflect that it could exist.

What if it still is our time?""I'm sure everyone on Earth knows how these movies work, by now. A group of people (attractive teenagers, for the most part) narrowly escape certain Death as participants in some disaster. Yes, Death, with a capital D. But Death is not to be denied, so he sets up increasingly elaborate scenarios to kill off the survivors, while they attempt to thwart his plans yet again and live another day. As you can tell from the description, these movies are basically just about the death scenes and trying to guess how each person is going to bite the bullet, before it happens. They're like Saw without the torture and convoluted back story.Compared to the movies that came later in the series, the original Final Destination isn't nearly as inventive or brutal with its death scenes. Some of them will seem downright tame to today's audiences (this movie was released way back in 2000, after all). But, if you're a genre fan who can still find entertainment in even a mild dose of this formula, Final Destination probably won't be a waste of your 98 minutes.",Final Destination

But crossing Death's plans doesn't mean that they will stay alive. One by one they get killed in the most incredible ways.And that is where, in my opinion, the biggest weakness of this movie lies. The ways they die are so incredible. If this had been a comedy, I wouldn't mind, but now they want to be taken serious and that is where they fail.

Then a month goes by with the police & people growing suspicious of Alex then afterwards Death starts pursuing those who cheated their fates by manipulating the environments in deadly ways in order to kill them in the order they should die in. Alex gets accused/blamed for each death & his friends grow increasingly suspicious of him & think he has something to do with them all (including the plane explosion) & start avoiding him! The first few deaths I liked Todd Wagner's strangulation in the bathtub was well done as well as Mrs. Lewtons Kitchen death. With the kitchen knifes impaling her in the chest.The only things I didn't like were how the deaths progressed throughout the film. Such as Clears death scene how there was just no build ups to the death scene & how ridiculously it was done with the pool & the blowing winds! I would have preferred them to be like Todd's Death or even Valerie's death. Where it's takes place in a single place or room etc with objects about.But overall despite the milked exaggeration here & there it was a pretty good concept for a Teen Horror Film!7/10,Final Destination
86,screenman,Death Never Takes A Holiday,7,1 November 2008,"Watched merely 'because it was there', I was unexpectedly surprised by the quality of this movie.With a youthful cast of - to me - largely unknowns, it didn't seem to offer more than the standard formulaic brat-slash twaddle. But I was wrong.From the beginning it was entirely believable. These youngsters seemed to know their stuff, and whilst I never really cared for them, they at least conveyed a genuine fidelity to their parts. The growing hysteria with the anticipated plane-crash and the special-effects with which it was realised were extremely harrowing. The CGI was good enough to convince at first show, which is more than can be said for many a movie of much greater budget and scale.How do you deal with someone who foresaw the crash in a world of air-terrorism? The authorities are phlegmatic and assume he must have had a hand in it somehow. Yet the inevitable and meticulous evaluation of the wreckage points to an accident. It's a dilemma. They just have to suspect him of something.Meanwhile death has come-up short on its body-count and means to make good the deficit. And it's here that I knock points off. It is never explained (because Death doesn't give interviews) why it goes about developing such complicated and involved scenarios in order to harvest its crop. Why not just give them all heart attacks? The contrived and sometimes sudden deaths are tense, entertaining and shocking by turns but - as I say - the underlying premise of death's deviousness is never explained and leaves - at least for me - a gaping hole in the satisfaction ship.Still; it's well-acted, well-directed, and well made. The effects are good and the surprises keep coming.And one other thing that keeps coming that's no surprise at all is that its unexpected success has spawned a franchise of sequel after sequel.Poor old Death, always playing catch-up to the accountants.",Final Destination
87,moviewizguy,The Plane's Going to Explode!,6,20 June 2006,"Alex and other students are going to a field trip to Paris. They get on the plane. Alex has a bad feeling the plane's going to crash. They take off and the plane starts to shake violently. The lights start to turn on and off and an explosion occurs in the left side of the plane and people fall out of the whole. Then another explosion occurs and burns everyone to death!Alex suddenly wakes up from a vivid dream and the the plane hasn't taken off, yet. He starts to hyperventilate and drags six people out of the plane. Some students get mad because they will have to miss a day in Paris but suddenly, the plane takes off and it explodes, just like Alex's dream. After this event, the seven survivors starts to get killed one by one with freak accidents. Alex and the help of his friend, Clear, has to find out when will Death starts to kill them, next.This is one of your smarter teenage slasher films. No, it's no where like a killer chasing and killing people. But yes, it has a lot of violence. It's Death, in which you can't stop what's happening in part of life. The acting by Devon Sawa and Ali Larter were decent at best.This movie has a very elaborate concept, in which many horror movies do not. The deaths in the movie are even foreshadowed through clues, which makes you want to look for them. You would even have to pay attention to easter eggs, like the fact that before each person dies, the same song is played.Some deaths in the film are good, but many are more of a let down, since you ""might"" want them more violent. Still, they are pretty creative. I like the weird score by the composer, which gives a brooding effect through the film.This is a smart but not a scary movie, for me at least. The deaths are good in this movie but they're not great. If you are tired of regular slasher movies where a killer kills people, then watch this movie and you'll like it.",Final Destination

The picture was very fine and the special effects were great. The movie lets you really alone with the question if you are the next now. My wife watched some scenes only with one eye. I find it hits a big mystery with full of puzzles. At the end of the film all is open again for the second part and I am very curious how it will continue.

89,denis888,Just excellent,10,4 September 2006,"This is not just a teen film with a thin story line, then some silly jokes and then some sex...no, this film is way better. The very beginning makes the film a blood chilling masterpiece - when a main hero sees a vision of the plane crash and is in panic, he and several other people are gotten off the plane and then the plane explodes right when taking off, and then the true horror begins. Death is seeking all those who survive, it hunts its preys and kills them with no mercy. The absolute masterpiece of the film is the scene of the teacher's death - when she is going to drink hot tea and then adds some icy vodka instead and thus the cup is cracked, she then puts the cup on her computer, vodka oozes in, the PC explodes, the glass wounds her face, she falls down and then more and more terrible details add to her terrible death. The only weak point is the idea that death chooses the order who and when to kill. We all will die, but in no specific order, I believe, and there is no design here...",Final Destination

It still has many hallmarks from the teen slasher genre, most notable of these is the slightly corny dialogue, but it doesn't distract from the enjoyment too much. The cast is strong, the deaths scenes are shocking and usually unexpected, even if they are a little over-elaborate at times, and the direction is pretty smart and very tight.Overall this film entertains, and it is great fun when all you want to do is relax and watch - no thinking required.8/10",Final Destination
91,rivertam26,New kinda slasher flick,8,18 July 2020,"This is a fun flick. After all these years I still feel like the first takes itself a little too seriously and is overly goofy in parts. Centered around a group of high school seniors on their way to Paris when suddenly one of them has a vision that the planes going to explode. He tries to warn everyone and in a commotion a few get off just in time to watch the plane blow up. Filled with questions the survivors go their separate ways but begin to die in mysterious ways. Devon Sawa's character along with Ali Larter discover a pattern and try and break it before there's no one left. The story is intriguing and feels like it's new although it's just basically a slasher film with an invisible villain. That being said the death scenes are a little tame in this one compared to the others. But that bus scene still gets me everytime. The only meh one is the teachers it's just severe, silly overkill. The film is overly entertaining and leads up to an exciting well thought out finale that leaves the door open for a slew of sequels.Budget: $23M

92,Screen_Blitz,An intriguing teen horror-thriller,8,11 July 2015,"James Wong, director of the hit television series ""X-Files"", steps inside the teen-horror genre with this intriguing disaster-thriller. Alex Browning (played by Devon Sawa), a high school senior is on his way on a week-long field trip with his French class to Paris. Shortly upon boarding the plane, Alex has a horrifying vision of the plane exploding. Plagued with paranoia, Alex panics and rushes off the plane, with seven others removed off board. Much to everyone's shock, Alex's nightmare comes true when the plane unexpectedly explodes upon takeoff, killing everyone on board. The survivors off board include Alex's best friend Todd (Chad E. Donella), his arch-rival Carter (Kerr Smith), Carter's girlfriend Terri (Amanda Detmer), orphaned girl Clear (Ali Larter), tag-along student Billy (Seann William Scott), and their teacher Mrs. Lewton (Kristen Cloke). While many become grief- stricken by their losses, Alex discovers that death is still after them when the survivors who originally escaped their demise begin dying in freak accidents.Final Destination was definitely one of the most original horror films Hollywood has it offer. This isn't a typical horror movie. Instead of a blade-wielding killer in a mask, girls possessed by evil spirits, or people being attacked by monstrous creatures; this film deals with the killer being death itself. The concept involves teenagers who escape a deadly plane explosion and begin dying in really unusual accidents. Basically, these characters get killed from doing average, everyday stuff like cooking or hanging clothes. Yes, this may sound somewhat laughable, but this film does a good job making this suspenseful and intense. The plane crash sequence was pretty intense for me, it almost had me scared of going another plane ride. The death scenes were also pretty intense, although I think they could have been done better. I really love the characters in this movie. Each one of the characters are very well developed and have their own personality. Alex, the main character was easily my favorite, along with Ali Larter's character Clear, the girl who stands by Alex's side after the plane disaster; unlike the other characters who blame Alex for the deaths of the people on the plane. The cast did an alright job as their characters, none of them really stand out from others.",Final Destination

94,areatw,"Unique, bizarre and strangely entertaining",7,25 June 2017,"Ordinarily, a cheap and trashy film with a silly plot and weak script would be enough keep most people, myself included, away. 'Final Destination', however, more than makes up for these flaws in sheer entertainment value. The first time I saw this film many years ago, I enjoyed it enough to buy the DVD, and it has remained something of a guilty pleasure all this time.Some films try way too hard to tick all the boxes and create the perfect picture, when sometimes all that's needed is an original, unique idea and enough imagination to put it into practice. That's exactly what 'Final Destination' is - someones imagination let loose, with the end result a highly flawed, but highly entertaining film.",Final Destination
95,NijazBaBs,"extremely good topic, but not the best acting",7,27 January 2020,"Perfect general, scientific, religious topic. Something I always was curious about. The topic of destiny, could it be changed, could it be avoided. I think this should also be classified as sci-fi movie. But except topic movie is not that well presented, because most things are boring, too dramatic and annoying. Meaning, nothing special to see except the main topic and scenes depicting it. Had this been explained as some higher quality movies or better actors, could be perfect, for example like Source Code and The Commuter movies by Vera Farmiga and other famous actors.",Final Destination
96,blott2319-1,"Nice try, but a horribly executed premise",3,8 July 2020,"Death itself being the serial killer that is stalking and killing a bunch of kids who dodged their appointed time to die, is an interesting concept. At least it was a new spin on a horror film of this type after the glut of Scream knock-offs that had been littering theaters throughout the late 90s. However, the idea is not realized in an effective fashion with Final Destination. Considering the number of ways we all could die any given day of the week, it becomes downright comical watching the Rube-Goldberg methods that death implements to take down these kids. The movie seems to think we're supposed to be tense and frightened when a splash of water is making its way across the floor in order to make someone slip and fall, but I could only chuckle. In fact, there's one death that is so elaborate that I felt like it was pulled from a Naked Gun movie.There were definitely other times when the film went so over-the-top that it felt like they were going for comedy. The most blatant is the ridiculous scene in the morgue where Tony Todd explains the premise of the film for us in case we didn't understand yet. Maybe the tone would have worked better if they hired at least one good actor. However, Final Destination is overflowing with young people straight out of Central Casting. Not one of them effectively conveys an emotion, with the possible exception of Ali Larter who might be trying a little bit. Devon Sawa, who plays the lead character, is arguably the worst of the bunch. There's nothing likable or endearing about his performance, to the point that I was kind of rooting for him to die earlier. I can applaud the attempt these film-makers made to think outside the box, but the end result of Final Destination is not good.",Final Destination
97,gedikreverdi,The design of death,6,9 June 2021,I watched it again after I saw it in the theatres more than two decades ago and it's still entertaining. Sean William Scott playing Billy is the embodiment of early 2000s and he got beheaded by a piece of metal on the railways which felt very gory back in 2000 when I was a teenager. The opening scene where the 6 students and one of their teacher had to leave the plane right before it exploded midair was very impressive. The scene where the windows of the lounge were shattered is still iconic. The death scene in the tub with the cloth rope and the teacher is killed with with vodka spilling into the desktop computer and the screen got stuck in her throat and the house burned down in a fire were really good. Carter the annoying guy's girlfriend got hit by a bus and it really made me jump again. However the ending where they traveled to France after a few months and the three thought they survived and Carter got hit by an unhinged billboard that was put up at the top of a building felt a bit rushed. Alex and the final girl just survived or will we get to see them in the second installment too? I'll binge watch the entire franchise.,Final Destination
98,vip_ebriega,A terrific scare show.,7,18 October 2007,"My Take: One of the spookier and more creative horror movies today. In watching a horror flick, there are two things that I would expect. Either it's a true scare ride that makes me want to run for cover or shows true moments of uniqueness for its genre that it is scary. Both pleasure are in the slasher flick FINAL DESTINATION, which is surprisingly more creative and stylishly spooky than other ""hack-and-slash"" horror/slasher yarns. Although the characters are the usual teenagers served up for slaughter, they do a very terrific job in setting us up for a scare, and doesn't disappoint when it comes to their delivery.Devon Sawa's character is named Alex, who has some strange premonitions of doom when boarding a plane to France. When on board, Alex had a realistic daydream of doom and began yelling out ""This plane will explode at take-off."" This part gets a little wild. Hold on! It gets real serious when the plane DOES explode. His fellow French class members and school teacher manages to get out before the plane exploded, but are now, death has a new ""design"" for them. Obviously, death doesn't take no for an answer.Perhaps the best things and most likely the biggest reason viewers (especially horror buffs and teenagers) to watch FINAL DESTINATION are the really good quality kills. I mean, if you want to get rid of that teenager, who knows that their doom is at hand, why not do it with some style? This film has some very creative death sequences which might be one of the best I've seen in a horror film since the ones in THE OMEN series. Sure the possibility of that happening to you can only happen in a move, but this is a movie, right? Cinematic, indeed, but very, very creative.Sure it features teenage characters that are not given any personality, but in this kind of film, which is just made to kill off the teenagers quick (and good), I don't think it needs time to develop its characters. The film isn't good on the cerebral basis (in other words, it's sometimes isn't smart), but the storyline has some very neat ideas (like the death sequences) and director James Wong does a great job making it to a wild ride. I was so surprised how I liked this film (both as a stylish or a ""run for cover"" horror flick). FINAL DESTINATION is a terrific scare show.Rating: ***1/2 out of 5.",Final Destination
99,CharltonBoy,Good but not Brilliant.,7,28 December 2000,"Final destination really is just another of your teen Horror movies, although quite entertaining there is nothing in it that is different. Some of the death scenes in it are quite shocking , shocking in the respect that they happen when you least expect them and that is what i liked about the movie. There are parts in this film that are stupid,especialy the inept F.B.I agents , they dont seem to fit into this film and they just fade away without any mention at the end .

100,carbuff,Takes home an Oscar for teenage horror.,10,28 July 2019,"Right off the bat, let me say, I'm on the far side of 50 and so not the target audience for ""Final Destination"", but I thought that this was a great addition to the teenage horror/suspense genre. I really enjoyed it, because it's well-acted, well-plotted, not excessively gory, unpredictable, and even more superlative adjectives that I just can't think of at this moment. For the first 10 or so minutes, I really wasn't into it and thought that it was going to be a big let-down; however, given that it started such a successful franchise and was such a short film, I decided to stick it out. I'm really glad I made that decision, since I was rewarded with a movie that just kept building and building right into becoming a solid home run. I trying to think of something negative to say about this film, but I really can't--other than, maybe, it's hard to accept Seann William Scott as anybody other than Stifler. It's the perfect run-time and has the perfect amount of emotional content for what it's meant to be. If there were an Oscar for this type of film, it would be a strong contender, but sadly that's not how the world works. Both thumbs up for this slick supplement to this particular canon.",Final Destination
101,stamper,I do not think this is the Final Destination for this GREAT idea,8,12 September 2000,"This movie is good people, you understand that. OK there are not big names in it nor in the cast, nor behind the chair, nor behind the pen, still it succeeds in doing something that I've have seen many films fail in over the years that featured big names. Of course I've seen failures with little names too, but that is not the point I'm trying to make here. The point I'm trying to make here is that how can a piece of sh.t movie like Mission to Mars be almost just as successful as this movie. I do not get it. I mean ,of course I thought, well, f.ck the reviews' and I went right on and saw Mission to Mars, but I wish I would not have. With this movie it was different, I was not too keen on going, actually I did NOT care if I saw it or not, because basically the Trailer was not too good and that is a pity. If the trailer would have been as good as the one for Mission to Mars (which had to be good, otherwise not so many people would have went to the cinema to watch that crappy movie), this film could have made 2 times the money it actually made at the box office.Another thing that I have to say here, is, that despite all the booing and wooing of the past about teenie / high school flicks I must say there certainly are a lot of them these days that are worth seeing. Of course these are not the 10 Things I hate about you flicks, but rather the films involving teens that are different'. Like Cruel Intentions, Scream, Scream 2 or last year's hit American Pie. There are really a bunch of great movies out there that centre teens and I feel that they are doing it great, for they are not only looking to make the eye enjoy (as in sexy females and maybe gorgeous guy's) but there are stories there too. I mean these stories are not only better than some of the other stories out there, but they are really, definitely far better carried out. I mean two years ago or so, that The Avengers movie Trailer, it rocked, but what was the conclusion after watching it ? The film was carried out poorly. This one is actually a bit different, because the Trailer does not stand out, but the movie itself does, because it was carried out very good.On to the film itself, what was good and what was bad? Well bad there is not much to say there, actually there is nothing to say there. What was good, well let's get onto that in a bit, but first of all, what about the actors? Well they all get their job done and that is what counts, they are all good. No outstanding folks here, nor on the Oscar nor on the Razzie side. While I'm on it, I must say that the film was not too thrilling, meaning you don't sit on the edge of your seat the whole time, but it was still entertaining enough.On to the good stuff, what did I like ? Man that is like a thousand things. I liked the direction very much, for it was very well, not only angles and stuff, particularly in the death scenes, but also in the way of filming. I mean this film had not the biggest budget and yet it's effects are believable and good which is due to a style of direction that admits just the right amount of good effects to be there. Also, of course, a good thing when connected with direction was the editing. It was done at the right times and in good ways. The music was good too, I mean I never heard of the woman doing the music in this film before, but she got her sh.t together man, it was good. Now on to the film in particular, talking favourite scenes. My favourite scenes are the inside view of the exploding plane and deaths 2, 4 and of course 5. These are my favourite scenes, not only because they are carried out well but because they are somehow surprising (which counts only for the death scenes 2, 4 and 5). The surprise element is somehow too, the thing I liked very much in this film. You never knew exactly how someone was gonna die until it actually happened and even when you guessed it somehow was different than the most scenes I've seen in my life (that death scene 4 really surprised me in the way of how (the place) he was killed). Enough about the film and it's makers, what about the story ? It was not only inventive and new, but it also was smart, for it reflects a thought all humans have. Death is destiny and you can't escape death. OK there have been many films involving death or Satan, but few, really few were able to be original and bring to us a new dimension. This one did though and we should be glad it did.The ending of the film is very good, for it leaves questions open plus it leaves the possibility of a second instalment open too, so it is good for both the viewer and the makers. Believe me, I do not like every sequel (although I'm pretty sure they are making a sequel to this one), but I sure like an ending like this one, for it is quick, abrupt and does not answer all the questions. Plus I found the sarcastic song at the credits rather funny too.

102,The_Movie_Cat,"""You've got your whole life ahead of you""",4,15 July 2000,"I have to confess that after The Sixth Sense debacle, every magazine giving away the twist, I avoided reading a single review of Final Destination until I'd actually seen the thing. The fact that there IS no clever twist doesn't make it a bad film, just one more factor making it a mediocre one.Glen Morgan and James Wong, Executive Producers for both ""Space: Above and Beyond"" and ""The X-Files"", dealt a lot of expectation for this movie. Their ten scripts for The X-Files (most notably ""Squeeze"", ""Beyond The Sea"" and ""E.B.E."") created high hopes. But then high hopes is what the ant had and it didn't do him much good either.Maybe, like me, you're the anally retentive sort that is distracted by detail. Like in similarly air-based ""Die Hard 2"", where Bruce asks an airport receptionist to send a fax. The fact that this plot development saw her send the fax upside down - meaning the other end would have received only a blank sheet of paper - kept distracting me. Likewise, the two girls who ask the leads to change seats so that they can sit together. Why? There were three seats in each row anyway!But I digress. The film, itself, then, is the sort of movie that has that peculiar type of Transatlantic irony - ie., not really very funny, but we'll pretend it is and send it up anyway. I hate snobbery, but suffice it to say if you think the ""humour"" within this film is ""wry"" or ""clever"" then you're probably dead from the neck up. A bit like the guy in this film who... no, that's a spoiler... The ""joke"" is sewn right from the start, with multiple ""ironic"" references to impending doom, the lead quote from this review being probably the most subtle. There's also an unjustifiably snotty jibe at the much more entertaining and likeable ""Stuart Little"".The actual idea behind the picture - a group cheat death only to find the laws of death's predeterminism creeping up on them - looks tremendous on paper, and could have made for a fantastic movie. But while the initial idea is strong, and relatively original, the conception is weak and flawed. For a start, there's the average direction and acting, coupled with the age of the group. If this had been a much older cast, rather than schoolkids, it would have possible to get more depth into the piece. But then again, maybe it would have been nice not to have a 100% all-white, sparkly-teethed photogenic cast either. A little character variation wouldn't have gone amiss.Proceedings carry on as the characters each in turn meet a grisly death. While I won't, to be spoiler-free, reveal who gets it first, it is pretty obvious that the guy that puts the pieces together WON'T get it too early on in the movie. It's also basic narrative convention that the more interesting ones will get a slightly longer lifespan. In Hollywood only the bland die young. So knowing what trio will live on to see out most of the duration takes the fun away a little.One nice possible in-joke was the lead denying having a ""narcisstic DD complex"" Anyone know what this is? Wouldn't be a reference to a certain Mr. Duchovny by any chance? Other than the everyday, run-of-the-mill execution, the other problem I had was with the scariness of the movie. A fantastic trailer was shown on television, showing people leaping out of their seats, hurling popcorn everywhere. As a bit of an idiot, I had planned to see the film with friends and do this whether I found it scary or not, just to act the fool. As it turned out, two other people in the cinema meant we couldn't justify making idiots of ourselves to such a small audience, and was there really any time when such a reaction would be appropriate? Honestly, I didn't even jump once. Wes Craven and his silly Scream has got a lot to answer for...",Final Destination

I bought a VHS copy of this movie for one dollar, you could tell the scene the previous owner really liked by how worn the tape spool is, its the scene where somebody gets creamed by a bus, that's what these Final Destination movies are really about, gruesome death scenes. ATTENTION ALL HUMANS: Horror is the master genre, it is capable of seamlessly combining all other genres ( comedy,tragedy,sci- fi,historical,etc.etc.)- When you make cheap, ill-conceived, franchise driven gore porn, you make the entire human race look foolish.

""Final Destination"" is a really good movie and gives an almost entirely original concept. An unseen killing force known as death killing off the teens with tragic and nasty accidents. Okay I wasn't sold on the idea at first, as I'm old fashioned and prefer a straight up standard slasher, but when I saw this movie, I really enjoyed it.Coming out at a time when the second slasher boom was starting to wane, ""Final Destination"" breathed new life into the genre. Okay it's a little slow to start off, but as it goes on it really kicks in and doesn't become predictable as the death scenes are accidents and could really happen making it suspenseful.Another aspect that works is the cast, all of which give really good performances, not a bad one in sight which again is really rare in these types of movies. Devon Sawa was excellent as the lead, he manages to be sympathetic and convincing at the same time, pity he never did quite become a star after this. Ali Larter gives a well rounded performance as the female lead and plus has great chemistry with Devon Sawa. Kerr Smith plays the asshole jock really well. Kristen Cloke plays the teacher really well and makes you feel for her when her time comes, she should have had more screen time and Tony Todd was genuinely creepy in his small cameo role, it's always fun to see him in anything.All in all A really good movie with an original idea that works for a change and an excellent cast really sums it up.",Final Destination
110,Movie-12,Thrilling with a creepy atmosphere. *** out of ****.,7,31 March 2000,"FINAL DESTINATION / (2000) ***
Starring: Devon Sawa, Ali Larter, Kerr Smith, Chad E. Donella, Amanda Detmer, and Kristen Cloke. Directed by James Wong. Written by Jeffrey Reddick, Glen Morgan and James Wong. Running time: 90 minutes. Rated R (for terror violence and language).
	I think it is safe to say every individual has different feelings about death. Some fear it. Others deny it. Most are weary in some way regarding decease. ""Final Destination"" is a perfect thriller for skeptics, detailing seven confused individuals who accidentally escape demise, discovering the impossibility of defrauding their destined time. The film's atmosphere provokes cringe through a presumably omnipresent force stalking the characters, producing audience participation whether the Grim Reaper is footsteps away from us all. 	Devon Sawa (""Idle Hands,"" ""Wild America"") is a high school senior named Alex Browning. He and his French class are at an airport flying to Paris for a field trip with their teacher, Ms. Lewton (Kristen Cloke). Once on the plane Alex begins to experience a dream-like vision of the jet exploding in midair killing all of its passengers. As the plane is about to descend, Alex notices his illusion gradually comes to life. This leaves him no choice but to cause a small riot leaving him and six other passengers thrown off the flight. Students Carter (Kerr Smith), the ignorant jerk and girlfriend Terry (Amanda Detmer), Alex's best friend, Tod (Chad E. Donella), other peers Billy (Seann William Scott), Clear (Ali Larter), Ms. Lewton and Alex watch from the airport as their late flight bursts into flames within minutes after takeoff-leaving these characters suspiciously confused about fate.The film wastes no time depicting its setup. The rushed opening leads to lack of character development. Whereas the character's personalities are clear, we feel little remorse for many of them. The dramatic premise is horrific and revealing, playing like an extended ""The X Files"" episode without paranormal detectives. ""Final Destination"" is creative and full of variety; we witness the plane crash from two different perspectives, as a passenger and an observer. Days after the crash, the survivors begin to die in unusual manners-almost as if a curse of death was placed on them for cheating demise. Alex digs deeper and discovers his companions are being killed by strange coincidences in the order they would have died from the explosion on the flight. In desperation, he attempts to contradict death for everyone remaining while under superstition of two disillusioned law enforcers.
There are a few overlooked characters in ""Final Destination,"" mostly adults who seem to have an IQ score in the mid-nineties. The teenager's parents are left out most of the story. There is also a briefly creepy appearance by a mortician but is short-circuited by the plot. He is one of the many characters who end up explaining a lot of the plot to us.	Most recent teen horror romps feature a madman chasing characters with sharp objects. ""Final Destination"" is too smart to fall in that cliché, however. It has a punctual reason for inhabiting teens: these are young people full of energy and life, all the more reason for them to fight death.
The film, written by Jeffrey Reddick, Glen Morgan and director James Wong, never explains why the Alex character has visions of upcoming disasters. The idea makes for an intriguing story, but there are no interesting subplots or side characters here. Therefore without being backed up by supporting stories the filmmakers must thoroughly justify the character's reason for being. Wong seems to overlook Alex's illusions, a concept holding the entire movie together. 	Although ""Final Destination"" provides many edge-of-your-seat surprises and tension, the film likes to poke fun at many of its scenes. Like the average teenage thriller, the movie takes itself seriously about three quarters of the time-leaving the last quarter as comic relief. Certainly having nothing against comedic sequences in horror flicks, I just prefer a movie true to its genre. Even though ""Final Destination"" is nowhere near perfect, it is the truest film to the teen slasher gender along time.
""Final Destination"" is brought to you by New Line Cinema.",Final Destination
111,the red duchess,Surrealist suspense(spoilers),7,28 August 2000,"'Final Destination' pulls off a great trick.  While managing to retain a commendably non-'Scream' seriousness of purpose, a solemn accretion of suspense, a faithfulness to genuine fears and emotions, the multiple deaths in the film are as blackly funny as they are elaborately gruesome; but this note of the comic in an otherwise grimly portentous movie, never betrays its ambitions.  These ARE some deaths, though; some intolerably protracted, implausibly set up, yet deliciously executed; others sharp, horrifying, hilarious shocks, one of which suggest the scriptwriters must have seen Lynne-Maree Danzay's brilliant short 'Fetch', where autobuses are used to similar effect.With films like 'The Sixth Sense' and 'X-Men', it looks like Surrealism, once mocked as a dotty, marginal movement, has finally pervaded the Hollywood mainstream.  Not only does most of the action take place at night, but there is also an early suggestion that the whole thing is dreamt by Alex, not just the first plane crash - as he falls asleep on the eve of the trip, the clock showing 1:00 fades into the 180 that is the number of the plane; the dissolve is drawn attention to, signalling a move into the dream or imagined that the film never comes out of.  The narrative, therefore, becomes an expanded Unconscious, a drama of a whole set of fears.It is appropriate that Alex is 17, on the brink of adulthood - his dad dolefully suggests that his whole life is ahead of him, as if freedom, youth, fun are all at an end.  And they are.  As all fears are often sexual in basis, it is appropriate that Alex doesn't reach the final destination of the title at first - the plane crash is a coitus interruptus, like the bomb that stops the kiss in 'Touch of Evil'; it is a stunting of growth, a refusal to move into adulthood, to progress sexually (Paris, of course, being the stereotypical city of love).  As his friends are either trying to get off with girls, or are lucky enough to have one, Alex remains a solitary figure, locked into his own mind, whose only sexual relief is an old copy of Penthouse.Whereas the teen movie, for all its modish trappings, is generally conservative, concerned with finding a mate, fitting in, asserting order, like a Shakespearean comedy, setting the continuity of the species in motion, Alex is a destructive force, linked to death (the scrappaper with Tod written on it, as well as alluding to his friend, also refers to the German word for death), sterility; we are never quite convinced that the events are out of his control.  In one brilliant sequence of cross-cutting, Alex's opening of his Penthouse is linked with the leak of Tod's toilet, setting in motion his friend's death, Alex's onanistic seed a murderous power.As the film proceeds, he becomes increasingly detached from community, from reality, setting himself up as a godlike power, imposing patterns on the randomness of life, right down to the obscurely arrogant climactic gesture of self-sacrifice.  Even when order seems to be asserted at the end, he has finally reached Paris, and he has a relationship with a woman, has joined the status quo, he is unable to deal with it, he has to destroy it.  Like Melville's 'Le Samourai', 'Destination' is a dream of masculine selfhood, of wholeness, of the fears that it will be diluted, fragmented, by compromise, society, difference.  As a study in heightened megalomania,  'Destination' reaches heights from modest ambitions unavailable to the risible pretentions of the 'Beach'.The Surrealist aesthetic also informs the film's treatment of suspense, a steady accretion of 'normal', familiar, domestic details, imbued with the terror of a diseased mind - the opening airport sequences are a masterpiece of anticipatory dread, the everyday made malevolent.  The unsensational revelation of the plane explosion, a mere firework, in the background as boys fight, is staggeringly, resonantly beautiful, sequences such as the tasteless memorial to the air-crash victims - a statue of an eagle! - suggest that Surrealism, as Breton said of the English, is less a view of the world than a way of life.  For some reason films like this and 'The Faculty' are treated with hostility and indifference by critics.  Don't you realise you are living in a golden age of horror movies?",Final Destination
112,FlickJunkie-2,A fresh and entertaining approach to horror,8,10 October 2000,"It is refreshing to see a film that innovates.  The last film to do that in the horror genre was `Scream'.  `Final Destination' has introduced an inventive approach to the genre, giving it a supernatural killer rather than a lunatic slasher dress up in some kind of costume.  Using `Death' as the killer opens up myriad possibilities for the method of death and choice of victims.  This film was excellent at presenting the supernatural stalker's manipulation of the physical world to find murder weapons in everyday objects.  While the concept of Death taking people from earth is hardly new in films, the idea of Death as a malevolent attacker that has a plan that can be outwitted is a novelty.This film is the germination of an interesting direction, but does not bring the concept to maturation.  It is unsophisticated in its storytelling and the characters lack subtlety and realism in their reactions to their situation.  They are undifferentiated from their hollow horror counterparts in that regard, just fodder for the beast.  Director James Wong, who has mostly TV credits on his resume, breaks into feature films with a vengeance.  From the standpoint of the photography and visual effects, the film was excellent.  His camera perspectives were creative and lent greater force to the suspense.  His crafting of the scenes was less effective.  The prescient clues to the next murder lacked nuance. There were no surprises except perhaps the last murder.  The formula was always the same, Alex predicts a murder and then rushes frantically to prevent it with mixed results.As is often the case in this genre, the acting had a broad range from terrible to very good.  Devon Sawa was excellent.  He gave his character much more range and depth than we are used to seeing from horror heroes.  He was the closest to having genuine human responses to the tragedies, at least in the beginning of the film.  Ali Larter was good as Clear, but her character didn't have much range and she did little to expand the envelope. The same is true of Kerr Smith whose character had even less dimensionality. On the awful side, there were Daniel Robuck and Roger Guenveur Smith as the hapless FBI agents and Tony Todd as the completely implausible undertaker.This was an entertaining film and a terrific story concept.  I rated it an 8/10.  It is a must-see for horror fans, but still enjoyable for a broader audience.  Few films of this genre have the potential to improve in the sequel.  This may be one of them.",Final Destination
113,redkiwi,Not exactly a horror film,8,22 May 2000,"If it wasn't for a few gory death scenes, this would be firmly a thriller, but I suppose it is a horror of some sorts - more a teen slasher film where some nauseating adolescents get what they undoubtedly deserve.The main character, Alex Browning (scarily similar name to my own!) sees a hallucenation of a plane crash, and upon getting off a plane this actually happens.  The main premise is that there is a force of evil knocking off those who survived, which although not a novel idea was well brought across.This film was occasionally frightening, and kept going right till the end - which is more than you can say for a lot of the Hollywood pap of recent times.",Final Destination

They should REALLY hurry up and make a sequel already. 10/10",Final Destination
115,movieguy1021,Final Destination: 8/10,8,18 December 2003,"When you go to watch a movie like Final Destination, which is obviously a teen horror movie, you take your chances. You could get something genuinely creepy yet tongue-in-cheek, like Scream, or you could wind up seeing something like Darkness Falls or They. You just never know. When Final Destination came up on my Netflix list, I didn't know what to expect. Would it be something original and scary, or just some lame dud? Thankfully, it turned out to be the former.Alex (Devon Sawa), along with about 40 others, are all set to take off on a plane destined for their senior trip in France. Right before it is set to take off, however, he has a premonition that shows him that soon after takeoff the plane will crash and everyone on board will be dead. He and others are forced off of the plane, and, sure enough, the plane crashes with everyone else on board. While everyone thinks that Alex caused the accident, he knows that they were supposed to die on board. Soon, everyone who was supposed to be on the plane start dying one by one.Knowing that this was written and directed by the same team who did Willard, I knew that a lot of the movie wouldn't be just needless blood, but that there would be some sort of a creepy atmosphere to it all. And, by gum, there was. Although it wasn't as atmospheric as the aforementioned movie, and it relied a lot on sudden violence, it was still creepy. It seems like horror movies today rely on quick jumps to scare the audience. Final Destination sure had some, but also the music and the general movie itself was thrilling. When you could see that something was going to happen, you wanted to yell at the character to not do so-and-so. Then you sit back and enjoy the ride.Something else that surprised me was how many special effects were needed. That was one major drawback. At times, the special effects didn't look real AT ALL (re: the bathroom scene), or there were too many when less is more (re: the final, climactic storm). One other thing that upset me was the constant need to do odd lighting. Because of the off-again, on-again lighting, it's sometimes impossible to tell what's happening. In Final Destination's pursuit to become something ultra-modern, nifty camera movements are tried, but for the unnecessary reasons. For example, a long, overhead tracking shot is used when two people are going to the bathroom. Very unnecessary, if you ask me. I just realized how much Glen Morgan and James Wong are fascinated with people going to the bathroom. There must be a few scenes of that in Final Destination, and one quite humorous one in WillardI also thought that the movie took too long to get started. We understand that Alex will see the plane crashing, but for about the first half hour that's all that's `implied'. It's very annoying. Thankfully, the characters aren't as stupid as they usually are in teen horror movies, and I did like all of the talk about `death's pattern', etc. Overall, get on board to Final Destination and it won't crash.My rating: 8/10Rated R for violence and terror, and for language.",Final Destination

117,meydiana-65242,Creepy and Real,9,7 November 2020,"This movie was frightening for one simple reason, it isn't afraid to go the route of talking about death, fate and if the inevitable is really unavoidable or if deaths plan can be fathomed and subsequently outwitted. The opening scene is downright scary, come on who hasn't got on a plane and wondered if it would crash, and let me tell you I am not in a hurry to get on one now. Thought the story is a little contrived and a bit predictable(though that is part of the story) the effect is still the same. The movie is not, despite what you may hear, a teen flick, if you're a horror fan from any generation trust me you'll like it as long as you go in wanting to see it and willing to actually think about the film and follow the story line.

""Final Destination"" definitely had it's share of plot holes.  How does this ""cheat death"" premise ever end?  I wasn't all too fond of the ending either.  Over all, I give it a 7 of 10.

119,Rickting,My guilty pleasure,8,19 February 2014,"Final Destination is one of the only badly reviewed films I like, and among with its sequels it is my guilty pleasure. It concerns a student who foresees a plane crash and gets himself and 6 others off the plane, before a month later death starts coming after them in freak accidents and they have to work out how to stop death. That might be the best horror movie premise ever, and while the final product is a mixed bag it's never boring. Final Destination doesn't care about those who aren't horror fans and therefore some of the most important film elements such as acting and writing are neglected. In terms of acting, Devon Sawa gives one of the best performances of the series; Tony Todd steals the show as the creepy mortician and Sean William Scott adds some comic relief to the film but many of the other performances certainly aren't stellar. The script is the most developed and character driven of the franchise, but it's still not a great screenplay. Despite it's amazing premise, FD doesn't take the premise as far as it should and if it had done this it might have reduced the need for the now somewhat excessive stream of sequels.What people forget about FD is that despite not being scary (Then again, neither is Carrie or The Wicker Man but they're still fantastic) it is menacing, suspenseful, eerie and well directed. There is a sustained sense of intrigue throughout, and it holds up very well on multiple viewings. FD is not so much a film as a spooky, deliriously enjoyable and gleefully silly fun fair ghost train attraction, and it speeds through its eerie visuals, tense disaster sequences and Gothic thrills with admirable enthusiasm. Despite some less than great CGI, the plane crash is awesome, and the bus death scene is truly shocking and unexpected. The finale with Clear Rivers (Portrayed in an overly understated manner by Ali Larter) is also very tense, although the ending feels more routine. FD is a very fun horror film and I still hugely enjoy it although more as an enjoyable thrill ride rather than a work of actual quality. Check out the sequels (Except the dreadful fourth) for more gripping, ghoulish giggles.6/10",Final Destination

123,FilmFanInTheHouse,Will make you think twice about Death!,8,10 July 2007,"Final Destination (2000, Dir. James Wong) Story Alex is boarding his place to France on a school trip, when he suddenly gets a premonition that the plane will explode. When Alex and a group of students are thrown off the plane, to their horror, the plane does in fact explode. Alex must not work out Death's plan, as each of the surviving students fall victim. Whilst preventing the worst from happening, Alex must also dodge the FBI, who believe Alex caused the explosion.Actors The movie is defiantly a thriller, and is important for them to cast the right stars for the job. They really need to portray characters which are easily recognisable and can make you become emotional towards them. The stars chosen for this film are a good choice for the characters. The look of the characters fit well with how they are supposed to be acting. Kerr Smith as Carter Horton is a perfect example of this. He is portrayed as the meaner character of the bunch, and his looks and cocky attitude adds to this character.Music Like most recent horror flicks, the soundtrack is very dark and brooding. With this film it works very well, with the suspense. The music isn't used in the wrong way, which can often take away the scare factor. The film is more fun and scary when actions happen in a split second, rather than the music building up to something. Shirley Walker does a wonderful soundtrack which really fits in with the paranormal atmosphere of the story.Special Effects The special effects in the film are actually amazing. A horror movie seems to accomplish its task of scaring the audience a lot better, when it is used with very little CGI. There are so many techniques used, to prevent the use of CGI, that it's hard to understand what a practical effect it. Like the death of Ms Lewton. It was impossible to tell that there was actually a wooden board above her body to prevent the knife from hitting here. All these different styles and techniques used is what make the film good.Conclusion Out of all the recent horror films which have been released, 'Final Destination' is probably one of the top flicks. The more horror films which are released, the harder it takes to create something original and scary, but 'Final Destination' triumphs this. This is one horror film, which would work perfectly watched in the dark, and would defiantly make you think twice about what death has planned. Enjoy.""Don't talk to me.

It's literally just Death, an entity we never see personified, which is something the film takes great advantage of.The film is fun to watch. Devon Sawa gives a fantastic performance. The humour, while not readily present, still lands well when it's used. The kills were well planned and executed, as was Alex's reaction/involvement in each.It's far from a perfect film, but it's also a film that doesn't deserve the unexplainably low review it got over on Rotten Tomatoes (35% at the time of this writing). If you go into it expecting a slasher and are prepared to receive nothing more or less, you'll have a good time.The only negative thing that I can personally say about this film is to criticize the pointless and tasteless joke on Michael Jackson. It had no place in the film and only served to add more negativity to a situation that was still ongoing and very hostile at that point in time. Any filmmaker who needs to drag Michael down for a laugh deserves a little bit of negative reaction thrown at their movie.",Final Destination

The plane really does crash and the group who didn't go begin dying",9,2 July 2001,"This was an excellent movie. It starts off a little slow with small hints that something bad is going to happen and it just gets better from there. I loved the way they made it where you wonder who's going die next and how they're going die. The deaths in the film were very unique and each one could really happen. There's no crazed killer on the loose killing off people one by one in this film, no these deaths could happen to anybody.Even though this film was supposed to be about Death coming back at the teens who cheated him, you never actually get to see Death. In the origional script, it featured an actual Grim Reaper figure slicing and dicing his way through a teen cast, but they chose not to do it, thinking that way it wouldn't be compared to teen slashers like 'Scream.' I'm glad they did that because it was a lot better then when you got to see Death in 'The Frighteners.' Don't get me wrong, he looked pretty cool in 'Frighteners' it's just a movie's much scarier if you can't see what's there. It was nice to finally see a teen movie that had no sex involved in it at all. That's a rarity. It was also nice to see Tony Todd in a movie not as Candyman. He did a pretty good job playing the creepy mortician. There was a little gore in some parts of the film and nicely done special effects in some parts. I'm glad they didn't overdue it with the special effects like other horror films that I would like to remain nameless (The Haunting). The acting was good and the film itself was pretty suspenseful. There were some parts that were meant to give the audience a quick jump in their seats and was proven successful. Not in my case though. This movie makes you think that maybe Death does have a plan for all of us and we can't escape it. Makes me wonder how I'm going die. Well anyway, the ending was a lot better than I expected. There are actually two endings for the film. The first ending was screened to an audience before the release, but the filmmakers decided that the ending wasn't good enough. So, they went back and shot a different ending.

131,DavidSim240183,Never saw this coming,5,23 November 2007,"Final Destination had quite an impact on teen audiences. Far more than I thought it would. Its one of these horror films that suddenly emerges out of nowhere, and before you know it, its the one thing on everybody's lips. Such is the case that everybody already knows the plot before they sit down to actually watch the film.FD is a film that feels particularly unnerving in these post 9/11 days. There's no actual terrorism present, but the sight of a plane exploding is sure to bring back memories of that dark day in New York.And one of the film's central characters, Alex Browning (Devon Sawa) foresees the whole thing. He and a class of schoolmates are on they're way to Paris for a field trip, but Alex's vision throws a spanner in the works. He and six others get kicked off the plane, and not long after, it explodes.The survivors barely have enough time to digest this when they start getting killed off one by one in a series of bizarre accidents. Death is not about to let people slip through its fingers, and Alex & Co must figure out a way to break the pattern of their supposed deaths before there won't be anyone left alive to do something about it.For all its success, being expanded out into a trilogy and producing novelisations and such, Final Destination has a curiously thin premise to work from. Its basically a series of novelty death set-pieces strung together by a thin semblance of plot. That might not occur to you the first time around, but FD feels less satisfying the more times you view it.I think for any teen film to be truly successful, it has to have a strong cast to pull it off. Films like Scream, The Faculty and Election were all excellent because of astute young actors playing their roles.Unfortunately, Final Destination doesn't have an exceptionally bright cast. And other than Ali Larter's tough, resourceful turn, I found the rest of the teens in this film rather forgettable.Any teen film that has Seann William Scott is bound to turn me off. Fortunately he's not in the film often enough to ruin it. But whenever he is around I tend to tune FD out.Devon Sawa is quite boring as our teen hero. Maybe that's not all his fault. The writers after all keep having him spout dialogue about how they should have died on that plane. Their lives follow a pattern, something Alex's premonition has shattered. The different theories he kept spinning regarding all this really drove me crazy after a while.Ali Larter is really the only one here that actually makes an impression. She was the only one I felt sympathetic to throughout all this. She seems capable and industrious. All she really needs is a worthwhile script to work from and she could go on to become one of Hollywood's greatest leading ladies.Even the usually reliable Tony Todd seems a little off his game. He only gets a cameo appearance as a mortician, but even he fails to impress. Odd considering what a fine actor Todd is. He seems a little over the top, even borderline hammy as the creepy mortician musing over life's plan for us all. And that's all the more strange after seeing how perfectly sinister he can be in films like Candyman.The film's selling point turned out to be its death sequences. I can tell the filmmakers have researched films like The Omen, where people died in bizarre occurrences through decapitations and impalings. Here they've taken those single scenes and made an entire film out of it.One thing that does give Final Destination some novelty is that unlike most stalker/slasher films, the killer isn't someone running around in a mask brandishing a butcher knife, but ordinary, everyday household objects.It provides quite a bit of fascination how each one of these little lambs is going to cop it next. One of them ends up strangled to death through a simple slip on a puddle. Another gets creamed by a bus. A scene that's become almost as imitated as Psycho's shower scene.The problem with FD is that this is what propels the film. Take all of them away, and you haven't got much of a film left. And even these death scenes get tiresome after a while, because they get increasingly outlandish and over the top.In spite of the effect it had on teen audiences, I do feel Final Destination is somewhat overrated. It provides jolts and shocks aplenty first time around. But the more times you watch it, the less inspired it seems.",Final Destination
132,nitzanhavoc,"Excellent story, could have easily been a masterpiece with better direction.",7,17 June 2016,"While being a devout Horror fan for over a decade, I must sadly confess that I've missed out on many of the classics, by which I mean that even if I did end up eventually watching them, I was far too old to really appreciate them (and have thus lost most of the scare-effect in classics such as Children of the Corn, The Omen, Village of the Damned, and don't even get me started on Chucky). Thankfully, Final Destination is simply an excellent film, and therefore immortal.The story altogether is original and compelling, showing a teenager which an obvious fear of flights getting a premonition of his plain bursting into flames. Thus he discovers his power to comprehend and anticipate death's ""pattern"", thereby avoiding it. What he doesn't realize before it's too late is that nobody cheats death. At first the story feels a little mixed up and not too well presented, even considering director James Wong's former known project (The X Files). With no build up whatsoever, the unfolding of the story feels like a long episode of the cult series, for better or for worse. Also, certain parts of the story are simply left out, and the audience is left with the sole option of figuring things out relying on later scenes. While not a dire shortcoming - this still feels amateurish and bluntly unnecessary, especially considering the few seconds it would have taken to set things right.Then there's the acting, or more appropriately the cast. As a huge fan of both SLC Punk and Idle Hands, I simply couldn't take Devon Sawa as a serious (even tragic) character. I kept half expecting the joke or wise crack to magically appear around him, and that's the last thing one would want while watching a Horror film. Luckily I'd never realized he played the role of Stan in Eminem's music video, or it would have been ruined for me too. I assume this is a personal problem, as Sawa is a great actor and performs beautifully, and yet. Then of course there's the slightly weird choice of casting Steven Stifler as Billy (which brings us to the question - why have a Billy in the first place? Such films have absolutely zero need for a comic relief, this is not a slasher parody). After his immortal performance in American Pie (and later Road Trip), even seeing his face in a Horror film severely damages the sensation of fear and suspense. Lastly, Kristen Cloke as Miss Lewton. Having a young high- school teacher is a risky move, and takes some talented maneuvering to pull off (for instance Drew Barrymore in Donnie Darco). Cloke, while obviously a talented actress following bad directing instructions, is far too timid and overdoes the whole damsel in distress routine. Having such a character as a teacher, after presented as strong and secure at first, felt unrealistic (yes, I realize she's been traumatized, yet as I've said - overdoing it).Then, of course, the ending, following a very weak plot twist (if it can even qualify as one) and being as predictable as one could imagine, and far too comical. If Sawa and Scott were too comic for my personal liking, the ending is simply too comical for the average Horror viewer. With such an ending as the wrapping paper, the entire project stinks of ""I want to be mainstream"". This is Horror... why try and be mainstream instead of trying to make a better film?Please understand, the reason I have so much concrete criticism isn't by far that Final Destination is a bad film. On the contrary, the original and innovative story (even today, 16 years later! Hats off to screenwriter Jeffrey Reddick) could and would have been enough to make this film a masterpiece. Sadly, all these bad choices by Wong turned what could have been an excellent film, to just a good film. Such potential gone to waste...All in all, I had a great time watching this. While obviously more Suspense than Horror, it's definitely one of the classics, and if at 30 and 16 years after its debut it still managed to leave such an impressive mark on me - I can't recommend it enough.",Final Destination
133,romanorum1,Death Has a Design That Can Be Changed,5,10 May 2017,"The movie has an interesting premise: A high school student, aboard an airplane and waiting to depart on his French classes' flight to Paris, has a premonition: a ghastly vision of an explosion. He then raises a commotion and bolts from the craft. A few minutes later the plane explodes in midair just after takeoff, killing everyone aboard. The view from the terminal is terrific, with glass shattering everywhere. The young man and six others – who have disembarked during the turmoil – have cheated death, but death, though unfeeling, hates to be cheated. And so for the rest of the movie death stalks the survivors, and picks them off one by one. Meanwhile the main character tries to figure out the death patterns to stay ahead of fate. As a mortician later tells Alex Browning (Devon Sawa) and sympathizing friend Clear Rivers (Ali Larter), ""The risk of cheating the plan, of disrespecting the design, could incite a fury that could terrorize even the Grim Reaper.""The whole feeling is one of doom, that something is out to get you, as writer Mark Twain thought of his family tragedies. Inanimate objects turn against people, like water, wind, electrical wires, vodka, gas cans, knives, lanterns, fish hooks, candles, a garage- door opener, etc. And folks die in various ways, like an elaborate strangulation, decapitation, traffic accident, fire, etc. When John Denver's tune, ""Rocky Mountain High"" is played, watch out for a falling sign! So we have a bizarre chain of connected events, like a Rube Goldberg machine. In the early 20th century Goldberg created cartoons for newspapers that depicted complicated gadgets that performed tasks in complex ways. FBI agents and others think that Alex is some kind of freak, especially because of his theories about death's design. The last half of the film focuses on Alex's increasing paranoia and precautions, like his opening of tin cans while wearing heavy gloves lest he should severely cut himself and get blood-poison. His lit candles are placed in water bowls as protection against an ill wind that may knock them over.Despite an interesting story-line, the film has its negatives. For one, the acting is just so-so, especially with co-lead Ali Larter. In addition, this morphs into just another horror film. Also, there are the plot flaws. One may say, ""Why save someone's life as he will be doomed anyway?"" You may come to the same conclusion by adding, ""Why do we have doctors?"" Nevertheless Director James Wong's concept was popular enough with teen viewers so that four sequels were produced. But the characters were mostly created just to be knocked off, although not quite as badly as those in the ""Friday the Thirteenth"" series. You may be entertained by it.",Final Destination
134,domino1003,Don't Watch This Before Your Flight!,8,25 December 2003,"******POSSIBLE SPOILERS!!!!******""Final Destination"" is surprisingly good and rather graphic. The first few minutes grab you and won't let go. Alex and his classmates are on a trip to Paris. Suddenly, he gets a vision of the plane crashing. After he gets kicked off the plane, along with several other students and a teacher, they witnessed the plane exploding. Soon after the crash, the remaining survivors are soon killed off one by one. The reason? Seems that Death is a spoiled sport. First of all, if you plan on taking a flight to anywhere, you might not want to see this if you haven't already. Second, there is a LOT of graphic deaths in this film (A particular death involving a bus is a shocker). Some of the plot is a bit thin, but there is a lot of recurring themes (The use of music by John Denver, who died in a plane crash is very creepy). Some of the deaths are creative and the plane crash sequence is incredible. They've made a sequel (And there are plans for a third), but stick to this version instead.This is a pretty good film and worth a watch on a Saturday night.",Final Destination

I'm mean really, the Grim Reaper or Death has one job, collect or reap souls of people who have already died. I mean what the hell is the freaking' point of having a freaking' vision of impending death if you can't do something about it? Well? Somebody please answer me that? What was Alex suppose to do, sit in his seat with his hands folded saying ""Oh well, we're going to die. Can't stop it, IT'S DEATH'S PLAN!"" Who gave him the vision, I'm thinking God, and how dare Death think his plan is better then God's plan, if God wanted these people to live, then why did he stop him. Another thing, since Death is a solid creature that can arrange fatal accidents, then why can't at least the audience see it. I mean really, this is a movie, not freaking radio. I would like to see the monster. Finally the ending, which basically saying you can never escape death. If you are going to die, then just die. Even if you see it coming ahead of time, just sit down and except it. If not, you'll have an invisible monster out to kill you for messing up his ""plan"".

137,malkane316,Quick Reviews!!,9,22 March 2005,"Of the teen horror movies which appeared in the nineties most were dumb gore fests with cheap shocks and a sexy, young cast. However, there were 2 stand outs: Scream, of course, and Final Destination. Both are intelligent, with involving story lines, good characters, genuine shocks, and grisly deaths. While Scream was full of parodies and self-referential stuff, Final Destination played on our fear of death- the one thing which we all cannot avoid. While it does make jokes about itself and its genre, they are fewer than Scream, and do not go as over the top as some other films. The director fills every scene with real tension and fear, and successfully combines this with excellent set pieces and stunts, as well as sustaining a brilliant story. There are few films that can do this so we should admire Final Destination.128 students are planning to travel to France with their teachers for one last big school trip. However, the plane crashes, killing everyone on board. We then flash back and realise that it was the premonition of one of the students, Alex. He has been having a strange day, and when he sees that his premonition is coming true he tries to get everyone off the plane. Like a certain Twilight Zone episode he succeeds in only causing a minor panic and some embarrassment, and is thrown off the plane together with a few others who got involved. As they wait in the airport Alex relates what he saw and of course no one believes him. Suddenly the plane explodes, his premonition came true. In the aftermath, some of the survivors mourn, others see it as a second chance, the cops become interested in how Alex knew what was going to happen, and Alex has further visions. Soon the survivors are killed in bizarre ways, and the cops believe it is Alex. Alex thinks that death is stalking them because they cheated it, and he works out the order that they will die in, believing that if they can catch the visions and prevent themselves from dying again, they will be safe. This will not be easy though, as death can, and does strike from everywhere.The idea behind the story is excellent, and it is stylishly and effectively executed. It will appeal to the teen audience it is aimed at, but also older viewers as it is a very thought-provoking, existential film. This may sound a bit extreme, but apart from going back to watch Bergman movies, this is the perfect film. One character, Carter believes he is in control of his own life, not some invisible force, and at one point tries to prove this by parking on train tracks in front of an approaching train. Alex becomes increasingly paranoid, hiding in a hut from death, safe-proofing it in every way he can. Clear tries to be strong, has learnt to be this way through a tough childhood and cannot believe that all life is is a series of days avoiding death. The other survivors all have their individuality, and are not pastiches of other characters from teen movies. As well as this, the performances are each outstanding, even from Sean William Scott who proves he is more than capable of being Stiffler forever. The side plot of the cops believing Alex is behind the deaths adds a depth which most teen horror films do not have.Wong's direction is very stylish, and the deaths and set pieces are some of the most innovative ever, recalling the style of Argento, that everything is a potential killer. He also creates a massive amount of tension throughout, peaking with each death- the train and car scene will get the most flabby heart racing, the teacher in the kitchen is brilliantly staged within every fork and implement seeming deadly. The opening 15 minutes have to be among the most tense and exciting 15 minutes in movie history, confirming all those with a fear of flying to stay firmly on the ground. Though as you will see, the ground is far from safe. The film shows how we are not immortal, and without the humorous moments it might become too much. There are many famous shock moments, the bus scene being the best. Many have complained about this being stupid and unrealistic, but if death was stalking you, of course it would try to put the approaching bus under a veil of silence. It is beyond understanding that anyone could rate this a 1, but we can see why people may not like it. The premise may seem too far-fetched for people, but they seem to have forgotten that it is a fictitious horror film. Death here as a character does have a sense of humour, each death being ironic, gruesome or made to look like an accident, but this is all the more terrifying, that this force is coming after us for entertainment. Death wants immediate pay back for those who cheated it, but in the style of a Bond villain, likes to play with its victims first. Of course the deaths may seem impossible in the real world, but if it is Death stalking us, I think it has the power to bend a few rules. Most criticism of this film is petty and unexplained, meaning that the scoring of zero cannot be justified. For clever, shocking, exciting teen horror movies, there are very few better than this.9 out of 10",Final Destination

139,EthanBJones_03,More comedic than frightening,3,4 July 2017,"'FINAL DESTINATION' was directed by James Wong and stars Devon Sawa, Ali Larter and Kerr Smith. ​After a student(Devon Sawa) visions the plane he's about to board explode, he throws a fit and gets him and a group of his friends kicked of the flight. Second into the air, the plane explodes. All seems fine but when the survivors begin getting knocked off one by one, they must band together to discover the truth.Don't watch this movie if you're looking for a genuinely frightening and scary experience - you WILL be disappointed. This movie is more comedic than anything. I laughed so much more than I felt frightened. Now I think about it, I wasn't frightened at all. I wasn't even disturbed by the deaths. It was all just kind of dull. Watch this movie if you're drinking with friends because you will have a laugh, just don't watch it if you're looking for a horror movie.I really like the gimmick of this movie. It's pretty interesting and I would love to see it be explored more, with a different cast and director. The actual story itself was very poorly written. Character's are stupid and this makes it very hard to care about them. A lot of the things that happen in this movie make no sense and the deaths itself contain no logic behind them. I understand they tried to excuse it but there should still be logic and setup to each kill to justify it. Maybe even include red herrings; keep the viewer guessing. Another flaw with the deaths is how generic and boring they are. Needless gore and violence is the one thing I would remove from movies today if I could; it's sick and never works. That said, I would have actually liked to see more creativity and thought put into the deaths. Keep it comic violence and make the movie a full blown comedy; that'd be fun.The only performance in this movie that wasn't completely robotic and forgettable was Kristen Cloke as Valerie Lewton. Even that performance was just barely passable. The rest of the acting was pathetic. Devon Sawa was shocking, Ali Larter was abysmal, Kerr Smith tried but failed - no one impressed me and only one person barely escaped my scold. Every movie like this were the cast are getting picked off one by one needs to include likable characters to make me want them to live or an interesting antagonist to make the deaths interesting. This movie succeeds at neither. The characters are dull, bland and forgettable, and the antagonist(I won't spoil it) doesn't appear for the entirety of the movie. This lack of good characters makes me actively dislike the characters and means I don't care if they die which means I have lesser interest in the movie. This movie hit the trifecta of trashy cinematography. It was badly lit, shot and edited. Nothing in this movie is technically proficient. The effects are also atrocious. I don't care if it was made in the year 2000, realistic dinosaurs were made in 1993.This movie was not at all frightening(if anything, it was comedic). I laughed a lot in this movie due to the clichés and lack of genuinely frightening moments. There is a scene towards the end were I should have been on the edge of my seat but I was on the verge of crying with laughter. For what this movie is attempting to do, it fails. But for sheer entertainment value, I'll recommend this movie. Watch it with some friends. I'll rate it 3 Expert Getaway Strategies out of 10.",Final Destination
140,kdnor2011,I thought this movie would suck...I was wrong,7,11 July 2010,"I'm actually a pretty big fan of the Final Destination series, I got into it after watching the third film. I actually watched this series in a weird order. I got caught up before the fifth movie came out, but I saw the others in order of 3,4,2,1. So when I finally did get around to watching the first movie, I actually thought it might suck. Because the fourth and second didn't really impress me very much. Well thankfully it just turns out that 2 and 4 weren't very good, because Final Destiantion turned out to be a pretty good movie.My biggest problem with the film would probably be the tone it goes for. Give the sequels credit, they were horror-comedy's. This film is straight up horror, sure we have Billy as the comedy relief, but for the most part this film is just a dreary dark horror film. This wouldn't be a bad thing, except that the death scenes don't match well with the tone, and it becomes a little uneven. Sure getting hit by a bus is kind of simple. But the rest are pretty over the top that it becomes kind of funny. Also I don't care much for the subplot with the FBI, I can't understand how they would think this kid would kill his friends, or how he would even do it.But the death scenes are actually pretty cool, they may not be overly complex, but they are just over the top enough to be entertaining. Most of the characters are likable, and portrayed very well by the young actors. Sure there are the characters you love to hate, but that just makes it more satisfying when they die. I laughed a descent number of times, and actually felt sad and sorry for these people. The effects are great and I love the final shot.Final Destination is a pretty good movie, it's entertaining enough, and the characters are likable. The only big problem is that the tone and death scenes don't match that well.",Final Destination
141,Rammstein-2,Good idea gone wrong,4,22 January 2001,"The basic plot is a very good and scary one, but the film is so-so. Which is sad, because I can imagine great dialogues, great scenes and a better ending with, for example, M. Night Shyamalan or someone else better suited for this type of film at the wheel. As it is, what is a very novel and good idea is turned into a shake 'n' bake teen horror popcorn flick, good for a 14"" screen on a slow Saturday night. It wears itself out pretty quickly and the point of the film, which could have been very imaginative, is focused on killing off the kids as quickly and as haphazardly as possible. The funniest thing is that the story has perfect logic and sense, but the makers have overlooked it and done a slipshod job. I'm sorry they did. It could have been great.",Final Destination
142,bh_tafe3,Effective and engaging thriller,8,22 July 2015,"Given the self aware nature slasher movies took in the late 90s following Scream, it was a logical progression for a movie to come along where death itself is the slasher. This is the idea driving this effective, well made and well acted, entry to the slasher genre that was a big hit in 2000 and spawned a successful franchise.The once promising Devon Sawa stars as Alex Browning, a high school student who is about to fly to France on a school excursion, but has a premonition in which he sees the plane explode, killing everyone on board. Once on the plane, incidents from the vision start to occur. Alex panics, resulting in him, some classmates and a teacher getting thrown off the plane. The plane ends up exploding just as Alex saw in his vision.Cue a creepy cameo from Tony Todd (better known to horror movie fans as the Candy Man) to explain to Alex that he has cheated death and now death is coming for the survivors. And that's the plot of this one.The film contains a big variety of kills, from elaborately set up accidents to sudden decapitations. One of the more enjoyable things in this movie is working out exactly how the various scenarios are going to converge to achieve death's design. Death is one driven and creative entity.Devon Sawa is great in this film, gradually going further and further off the deep end as he tries to stay a step ahead of death. His performance and the ability of Director James Wong to draw the most out of the premise are the main strengths of the film, while Kerr Smith, Ali Larter and Sean William Scott all do exactly what is asked of them as death's other targets.The idea of Death stalking a group of people who have cheated him of his wages is an interesting one and this film doesn't waste its promise.

They don't believe Alex, thinking he's hysterical, yet when the plane explodes, they don't know what to believe.Final Destination has a great premise. As they left the plane, the seven 'survivors', cheated death in doing so. Though death is not done with them, picking them off one by one; there's no cheating death. Yet Final Destination isn't that great of a film over all. The directing is clumsy at times, the acting is nothing great, the dialog is nothing special either, yet these aren't the elements that make Final Destination a great watch. It's the elaborate deaths scenes that make this so interesting. Each one is either out of no where or meticulously drawn out for some exciting suspense.Devon Sawa, Kerr Smith, Seann William Scott and Kristen Cloke don't bring that memorable of performances.

Shots and effects are simple and underwhelming, like you'd find on TV; they do what the script calls for and little more.  But the script itself is a remarkable piece of work.As such, the film is smarter than you'd think it to be.  What most people would pass off as ""just a Horror film,"" is actually an incredibly taught Suspense film, that just happens to have some rather disturbing gory death scenes.Sawa is a remarkable actor, he shows a lot more depth and talent here than he showed in the Intelligence-Isn't-Necessary (but still entertaining) ""Idle Hands.""  My only complaint is his under-reacting to watching friends get killed right in front of him, but I'd peg that on under-directing.  See above.What is the Final Destination for all of us?  Who decides our fate?  What can we see in the world around us to answer these questions?This film made me think, but it can be enjoyed on the level of Popcorn Flick, as well.  The concept, and its execution, were remarkably clever.  I hope James Wong is allowed to direct more films, so he can learn as he goes. This was a GREAT script, but only a GOOD director.  The finished product is still a lot of fun to watch (if you can stomach the death scenes, which are all more gory than they really need to be).If I were grading this film I'd give it an 85 out of 100, but since we're dealing on a different scale, I'll round up.  9 out of 10.",Final Destination

1. Despite the overall ridiculousness of the plot, the subject of death is deftly and intimately handled.
2. The practical effects are really impressive and they really help to bring the spectre of death to life, ironically.
3. Devon Sawa (Alex Browning) gives a really good performance.
4. Tony Todd (Bludworth) delivers an incredibly sinister and mesmerising side performance.
5. The gore and violence is brutal, unforgiving and uncomfortable which serves up some gnarly and unforgettable deaths.
6. The tension and suspense is built magnificently via the well-timed close-ups and the slow zoom-ins.
7. The film serves as good commentary on the unpredictability and relentlessness of death, as well as the fact that living just to survive is no way to live, especially as death will get you anyway.Cons:
1. At times, the sound-mixing is distractingly delayed.
2. Somehow none of the characters heard or saw the bus that ended up hitting Terry Chaney (Amanda Detmer) before impact.

But the worst is yet to come...They weren't meant to get off the plane, and Death begins to reclaim its dues.But Alex seems to have the gift (or curse) to be able to notice clues about who is going to die and how, and finds out that Death is following a plan, an order, in killing them off...An instant classic of the horror genre, 'Final Destination', based on the 1999 crash of TWA Flight 800, has been a huge (and deserved) success, for the audience if not critically, getting two sequels (and a third, which is rumored to come out in 2009) and lots of fans.And with good reason; this story manages to create suspense and terror without the usual knife-wielding maniac, melds together the supernatural and the '10 Little Indians' kind of movie with great results, putting successfully even a touch of humor in it, and raise thought-provoking questions about Life and Death without being bogged down into Bergmanisms.Plus, it has, rare occasion in the horror genre, a leading man. So, more power to it! Final Destination: 10/10.",Final Destination

Devon Sawa who reminded me of a young Simon Le Bon (Duran Duran) never really made it to great success. None of the cast did really. Out of the all movies, I preferred Final Destination 2.

Sawa portrays a teenager who cheats death after having a premonition of a catastrophic plane explosion. He and several of his classmates leave the plane before the explosion occurs, but Death later takes the lives of those who were meant to die on the plane.I've always loved this movie, the plot is original and I can see why it spawned such a long-running and successful franchise.

156,johnsmithjanuary-20081,master of my own fate,9,22 October 2021,A classic horror film. Not really quite as much a horror movie as it is a thriller though in all honesty. A creative and inventive concept literalizing the escaping of death's grip.,Final Destination
157,happyendingrocks,A movie about the simple things in life... and death,8,16 June 2009,"The best horror films exploit simple fears, and since no sane person isn't at least a little bit afraid of flying, Final Destination chooses a brilliant catalyst for its mirth. But a set-up isn't enough to carry a film on its own, and the reason Final Destination works so well is that the film-makers don't rely on their fantastic concept to push the movie. In less-capable hands, this story would have been a rote 10 Little Indians kill cycle, but by integrating genuine suspense and boundless creativity into the proceedings, Final Destination falls somewhere much closer to the category of modern classic.Without recounting the plot, the core premise here is that no one can cheat death, and that by challenging fate, we oppose powers far beyond our control or understanding. The ""survivors"" who get off of doomed Flight 180 are perfect essays for the range of human reactions to the inevitability of death. Some leave the plane in a panic, like those among us who fear death to the extent that we let this fear lead us through our lives and out of situations that may contribute to whatever nasty end we imagine is in store for us. Much more interesting, the others who disembark the jet before its inevitable destruction are led away from their fate by simple twists of chance, each with a series of minor actions that test the fabric of fate just enough to forge their unnatural survival of an event they were destined to perish in.This complex but identifiable crux is why Final Destination is such a masterfully-rendered work of horror. We've all had those moments in our life where a seemingly random series of events culminates in a significant occurrence. It's quite natural to question what forces are at work in these instances, and how many variables were required to lead us to the conclusion we face.According to Final Destination, the force at work here is Death, itself. And this Death is a relentless shadow that uses pure elements like water and fire (again, simple fears) to create extravagant macabre Rube Goldberg devices to carry out its task. The way each individual piece of these machinations relates to something most of us would consider mundane (a leaky water line, a crack in a glass) heightens the powerful horror that permeates the film. After all, these victims aren't doing things we would never do and creating their demises by irresponsible actions; they are in situations that could actually happen to us, and the brilliantly slow and suspenseful set-ups that accompany each death force us to question: would WE notice the dripping water that eventually leads to our death? The scenes in the airport at the beginning of the film are particularly gripping. The dread is built though a series of subtle images that don't look at all out of place in the airport (the departure board, the words ""final destination"" on the ticket), yet something about them is askew (note that the number on the luggage cart that drives beneath the plane as the characters board is ""666"", for instance). This series of little coincidences are all things that many of us would never pay attention to, or even notice to begin with, but if we saw them all as our main character does, could we draw any other conclusion than the one he realizes?Of course, there is also a lot to be said for the gleefully orchestrated carnage that keeps the pulse of the film steadily pumping. The plane crash is a truly shocking set-piece; chances are, no one reading this has been in one, but seeing it unfold on this screen, we get the sense that not only could the film-makers' scenario happen, it would probably happen EXACTLY like we see it here.Even knowing what's coming doesn't prepare the viewer for some of the more carefully-plotted ""gotcha"" moments. (If you aren't caught off guard by the bus hit, I'm guessing you have the same semi-psychic sense that drives our main character to get off the plane to begin with). By mixing in the right amount of carnage, and making it as over the top as the story allows, the film strikes a great balance between tension and release, a tenuous and not-often-realized phenomenon that classifies most of the best horror films of all time.This is not a perfect film, by any means. FD has flaws both minor (Clear Rivers is one of the worst film character names of all time) and major (the entire FBI subplot, and the wholly unrealistic actions of the two agents, which are in direct opposition to the ""this could happen to you"" element that makes the film so frightening). The film also takes a credibility leap when the characters start calmly discussing ""finding the patterns"" and ""getting skipped"" (would anyone in this situation really be able to understand and articulate the phenomenon they are experiencing?). But there's also lot to be said for making a good old-fashioned thriller, and since we know that's what we're in store for here, it's relatively easy to allow our analytical minds take a siesta and simply enjoy how well this entire concept is brought to, ahem, life.""Simple"". There's that word again. We keep coming back to it because the notion of simplicity is key to the film's successful delivery. If the main point of the story is that Death is coming, that's pretty simple, and still effective. However, the interlace of actions and reactions that construct each kill, and indeed the entire notion of Death searching for those who escaped it, is anything but simple. So, this entity seems simple on the surface, but is in fact a more intricately constructed web than we could possibly imagine. Such is life, and such is Final Destination.",Final Destination

159,basrutten,Disappointing,4,27 July 2003,"CONTAINS SPOILERSI had heard some rather good things about this movie, and was kind of looking forward to finally seeing it, but unfortunately it turned out to be a rather big disappointment. I was looking for a clever thriller, but instead I got a slightly above average slasher movie (group of teens gets killed by maniac, you know the drill). OK, the ""maniac"" in this case is intangible (it's none other than ""Death"" in person) but it's still a movie about a group of kids getting slaughtered in strange ways.In fact, the entire movie amounts to little more than a series of freak accidents that are so unlikely and exaggerated that I couldn't help but laugh during a large number of them. The line ""don't move"" the main character says to his teacher while she's bleeding to death, pinned to the ground by a very large stake knife was absolutely hilarious! It's not like she CAN actually go anywhere, is it? I also found the plot behind the accidents (some people have cheated Death and now Death wants his revenge) to be more absurd than interesting or mystical. If Death really wanted them dead so eagerly, I'm sure he could come up with something a little less absurd than this.
Also, the lead actor is pretty unconvincing. He reminds be of the runner-up in the Dutch version of ""American Idol"" and is equally untalented. The rest of the acting is passable but that's about it. All in all, I found this to be a rather hollow movie. It's reasonably original, but it's definitely more a slasher movie than a really good thriller like ""Sixth Sense"". *1/2 out of **** stars",Final Destination
160,darkdementress,Cool concept wrecked,4,15 October 2020,"I thought the idea of this movie was quite original and kind of interesting but it's completely ruined by the terrible characters the poor acting the freaking most trapped style death and the lack of supernatural factor, realistic deaths, or explanations. It's also overly brutal and gory for no reason other than shock factor.. No thank you. Apparently no one ever works either? Days if not weeks go by and no one ever leaves for work lol. What they should have done to make this cool story was made the main character who has psychic visions with somewhat of a backstory of having things like that happened to him or her and make supernatural things more obvious. And make shadows like death was after them. the deaths should of been in actual possible ways that people have died ""in freak ways"" or ways people commonly die. But instead they made it like the freakin mouse trap game where it's wacky contraptions and ridiculous nonsense that just makes it really goofy instead of cool.",Final Destination
161,Shiva-11,This trip is a rough ride,6,19 March 2000,"Final Destination: When a horrible vision leaves him in hysterics, Alex Browning and several classmates are removed from their Paris-bound plane. Sitting in the waiting area, they watch in horror as the plane bursts into flames and crashes into the sea.   Though scared and confused, they are thankful for being spared.  But fate isn't ready to give up so easily.Although Destination is another body-count movie it is a nice change of pace from such tiresome slasher flicks as ""I Know What You Did Last Summer"" or ""Urban Legend"".  Rather than an unhinged serial killer driven by a minor slight, the pursuer here is Death itself.  I was glad to see that the producers didn't rely on CGI effects for a grim hooded specter.  Instead, Death is a quiet and subtle foe announced only by a wisp of wind, a brief shadow, or an unnerving hum- which makes for an unsettling effect. 
The dialogue is definitely lacking (but I didn't go in expecting Hamlet) and several of the characters do nothing but whine - their deaths couldn't come soon enough for me. There is however a palpable tension which will keep you engaged, and deliver a few jumps.  Make it a matinee.",Final Destination

163,mattiasflgrtll6,A modern horror classic!,10,13 July 2015,"I love this movie. The concept sounded very intriguing, so I decided to give it a watch.It starts off calm enough. However, it only takes mere minutes before you start to feel something is wrong. The signs changing by themselves to ""Final Destination"", GOD was that creepy! And it only gets worse. Alex Browning (the main character) knows something is wrong, he just can't put his finger on it yet. Soon, something horrible happens...! The plane falls apart and is about to explode! But this hasn't happened yet. It turns out it was Alex having a vision, so he then warns everyone what is going to happen. Only a few seem to understand that he's serious, but a few lives saved is better than no lives saved at all. Don't worry folks, this is NOT a spoiler. I thought so at first and went ""Jesus, give away the whole movie, why won't you?!"". But thankfully, I was wrong. Traumatized, but relieved, he comes out of the plane alive with a couple of people, seven or so. So everything is fine, right? Hell no! Shortly afterwards, one of the survivors die in the most bizarre way possible! (when you see it, you will be terrified at how cruel the death is, but also laugh at how inanely stupid it looks) And the killer is no one less than Death itself! Now this I found interesting. That it's not some slasher-type maniac but an entity you can't escape instead, is MUCH, MUCH scarier and chilling. Alex believes the death is not a coincidence and so, with the help of Clear Rivers, tries to figure out the mystery... Was the plane crash MEANT to happen? Is it possible to cheat Death?This is one of the scariest movies I've ever seen. Afterwards, I found myself looking around, wondering if any object near me could kill me!Everything is excellent. The cinematography, the acting (Devon Sawa and Ali Larter were marvelous in their respective roles), the music and the overall direction (James Wong was a brilliant writer at The X Files, and seems to be doing just as well directing) couldn't have been better. It's also a movie where you have to pay attention, or you won't understand all the revelations in the plot. It's difficult not to spoil this movie, but let me just say that not only is it really spooky, it actually has its bit of dark comedy as well. And rarely have there been as many moments in a horror movie for me where I've been frightened and in hysterics at the same time. And it even has a great ending. A satisfying ending for a horror movie is always a pickle, since it in some cases can be too ludicrous or cheesy. But here it was simply perfect. The characters also all have their interesting personalities. I'm pleasantly surprised over how I actually cared about almost everybody, even that dumb jerk Carter. Well okay, Valerie Newton was an unbearable selfish bastard. That's one exception right there. By the way, there's also... Bludworth. I have no idea who on earth he is supposed to be or what the hell is wrong with him... but he unsettles me. His voice got under your skin and he almost sounded like something evil was lurking under the surface. It's disappointing that he appeared so little, but at least he's in the sequel too. Maybe he has a larger role there. Tony Todd was like a natural in that part.Now, there is one strange detail... It's never explained or even hinted at, why Alex has these visions. How can he foresee deaths? Where did this gift come from? But this is a really small complaint. There was so much about the movie to adore and be inspired by that I could look past that and just find myself entertained.Listen up, you talentless modern day horror directors: THIS is how you make a scary piece of work!One last thing to you who read this: In death there are no accidents, no coincidences, no mishaps and no escapes.",Final Destination

The main lead, character actor Devon Sawa - but why do I keep confusing him with Johnny Lee Miller and Joshua Jackson? Anyway, he leads a cast of High School students (yeah, right) who are about to go on vacation to Paris. All before the flight, he has strange premonitions of death, and when he finally boards, he sees flashes of what horrible things could happen to the plane. As he is dragged off in a panic, six of his fellow students and a teacher follow him or are thrown off for being disorderly. Guess what, something bad happens to the plane they were supposed to die on, but death hasn't finished with them yet. Pretty good, innovative, attractive cast and even a guest appearance from Tony Todd (Candyman). Yes, they're all way too old to be in High School, yes, you could argue that it's just another teens in trouble movie, but the concept is fresh, and so are the solutions they have to come up with, which is all I can ask for after watching over 20 years of horror movies.Not flight movie material, but well recommended.",Final Destination

Did Alex save them? Maybe for now however the moral of these films and the story here is when your time is up your time is up.

Afterall, it is nothing more than some dumb teeny-bopper horror flick. And the talent that it brought into to perform for these films is never all that great to begin with. Also, the parts of the film that were supposed to be scary or shocking, came off as stupidly funny. I couldn't wait for this film to end, and I do NOT recommend seeing it.

The potential for a decent movie is there in the first 15 minutes, but the movie falls off so badly that you will be checking the clock several times, hoping for a final destination. That is so common in today's movies, find a decent hook, but never follow it up with strong characters or story development. Instead, resort to retread scenes that you have seen in countless other teen movies. This movie was stupid and geared for a 7th grade mentality.

173,blacklist-1,The best of the four no doubt!,9,11 April 2010,"With three sequels under it's belt and two main directors James Wong who did FD 1 and 3 and David Ellis who did 2 and 4. The Final Destination franchise has been an enjoyable one. The first is of the best no doubt. As a general occurrence in Hollywood movies whatever the genre the first if there are sequels will always be the best though some in recent years has reversed that assumption like Spiderman 2 and Lethal Weapon 2.Here though the first one is the best. James Wong directs this with skill and ease. He clearly knows his target demographics for this film horror fans and a teenage audience of fifteen years to early twenties. This being the case as all the main characters apart from one are teenagers. Looking at some of the reviews here FD has been highly criticised for a lot of aspects, which is fair enough as everyone has there own opinion. But let me tell you why this movie I give deserves a nine.First off the deaths are extremely inventive, there is plenty of gore so those with a weak stomach wouldn't like this. With the sequels the deaths though still gruesome aren't very scary and you more tended to laugh, but with the first one there are some genuinely scary moments that did throw me off balance like when the bus kills Terry Chaney (played by Amanda Detmer), that just scared the crap out of me. Also the start with the plane crashing in Alex's premonition had me on edge and arguably the scariest scene of the movie was when Alex and Clear go to see Todd's dead body and they run into the mortician played excellently by Tony Todd. Throughout there is plenty of suspense and tension helped by great music in whether the characters will survive. Also what is rare with your average horror flicks is any emotional connection to the characters. I cared about Alex and Clear and as they become a couple I hoped they would survive and Carter I hated him! Though the script and dialogue was a bit rubbish, it's easily forgiven. The acting is to a good standard particularly Devon Sawa as Alex and Ali Larter as Clear Rivers. The story is also original and different, which makes it refreshing and the ending is great. In referring to the ending I also loved the soundtrack when the credits rolled up. It was great. The special effects though obviously they would look bad now was good for it's time.That's why I think FD is a brilliant movie and deserves such a high rating and even though with each sequel they have been getting worse. FD will never lose it's touch and will remain for me the best of the franchise.",Final Destination

175,saarvardi,Not your average horror fair,10,7 December 2007,"Reflecting the whole ""terror without a face"" reality Americans woke up to on September 11th, 2001; the first Final Destination (released during early 2000) stands as a shocking premonition of things to come - with the main focus on (You guessed it) an Airplane Crash. After a student on a field trip actually has a premonition of this happening during the first minutes of the film, he storms out of the plane, dragging a group of fellow classmates with him. Moments later, the plane lifts off without them  and explodes right after its lift off. However, this was not supposed to happen. You see, Final Destination believes death has a plan for all of us, and if you ""missed the train"" the first time around, fate will come after you with a vengeance  combined with a horrible and gruesome death. The rest of the film sees the group of frightened teenagers who survived the crash avoiding the unavoidable  only to face the grim reaper later on in the film. This may sound dumb at first, but the concept of the movie, along with the idea one can actually ""cheat death"" is fascinating, IMO.

It is fun to see the characters struggle to figure out what is happening and the trope of the characters running from the cops being blamed for murder works well. The deaths are creative as expected but not as gory as one would think. The movie has that B-horror feeling but is definitely not a horror movie. The mysterious man who helps our cast does not get enough screen time.,Final Destination
178,Barky44,Quite good for a teen slasher flick,8,5 June 2005,"I really liked this movie. It's probably one of the better teen slasher flicks to ever hit the screen.Let's face it: teen slasher flicks are not outstanding cinema. The writing is always lame, the plots are even lamer, they're usually vehicles for the latest trends in fashion and music and showcases of the heartthrob and/or bombshell-of-the-month. They're really just vehicles for post-pubescent hormonal stimulation.But ""Final Destination"" is different. First, it has real imagination going for it. The plot is unlike your typical ""madman in the corn chases teenage bombshell through puddles,"" it actually took some thought to put this together. It's not just shock-factor movie-making, they actually sat down and outlines how all the deaths would work in a way that keeps the plot alive. A tale of kids trying to cheat death's design is much harder to write than a dude with a chainsaw.Then there's the death scenes themselves. Outstanding! I love a clever death scene in movies like this ... it's why you pay the $8! And these are some doozies. You can tell the filmmakers sat around for hours simply trying to find the coolest way to kill people. And if you have a sick mind (like yours truly), you'll find these death scenes simply hysterical! A really good movie. 8 out of 10. I'm giving it a high score because it's outstanding within it's genre.Barky",Final Destination
179,ShortCuteBlonde,very frightening,9,22 September 2002,"(may contain spoilers) i admit that after i watched this movie, i was very very afraid of flying and death, i liked it though, so much that i bought it, mainly for my brothers but it was still a good movie with a very original plot, i cant wait to see the next one!!!",Final Destination
180,tex-42,"Interesting Concept, but bizzare and poorly done movie",2,28 March 2000,"This movie starts out very well with a high schooler having a vision of the plane he is about to take off on exploding, and his panic eventually leads to him and six others leaving the plane only to have it explode moments after take off.  Now the movie takes off into the bizzare as we find that you cannot cheat death, and apparently death will kill you only in bizzare ways.  The movie now becomes unitentionally laughable as death slowly stalks each victim before offing them.  You don't ever see death, you only get a hint right before you die.  Death even goes as far as to cover his tracks after each person dies, which makes you wonder why?  In general this could have been an interesting movie, but it bogs itself down with teen-slasher movie cliches and an uneven script that leaves gaping holes in the plot and makes everyone in the film seem utterly stupid.",Final Destination
181,zfiany,I am a fan of all 4 FDs despite the bad reviews of the last two,8,13 October 2009,"FD is the kind of movies that you dare call a decent one. It's the sole movie that dealt with death as a character of its own. It's the only movie that made me see death as a person who chases people in a smart tactical way and more importantly in a way that is set ahead that if you can escape it once, you will definitely fail the next time for Death has plan B for you! The idea was new, I know what you will say that death premonitions have already been used in Movies. That's true but not in the frame where death is pictured as a character of intelligence of its own. In the movie, you can't but sense the presence of death as a human being but of Godly power.And, if you like horror movies for the creativity of deaths scenes used, then Final Destination is surely your thing. Everybody almost loved the first one and criticized the rest but I have to disagree. The first one has presented the basis for the idea but the rest worked on the originality of deaths methods and here I have to say that I liked them all and the most violent one for me is the second.",Final Destination
182,RickHarvey,treasure every step,7,15 January 2010,"The night before i viewed this film, i watched the latest final destination, the 2009 version. While that one was your typical , god damn awful teen horror flick, the original has more going for it and is packed with entertainment value.First of all, the characters aren't wooden. None of them come out with any ridiculous one liners like they did in the 2009 film. All the actors played there part well. The only problem with the characters was that not one of them was likable. Even though the plot is similar to the latest version, this one doesn't seem to be to much over the top. When i say this i mean that the deaths aren't far fetch and aren't only use to portray the gore element of the film like in the latest version. In the original, the deaths are believable while at the same time there filled with gore.The opening of this movie is great. the airport scene is filmed great and the special effects are brilliant. i don't know anyone who would turn the film off after the first 20 Min's. For once in the genre, the film gives an great script, good acting, original plot. This film rises above the rest within the teen horror genre. The only negative is that the ending is totally predictable, it quite easy to spot the characters making the mistake in there judgement. Overall this is a good film that deserves to be watched at least once. It a film that by far beats the rest, that is mostly junk, out there.",Final Destination
183,davidslicer,One of the best horror movies of 2000.,7,26 November 2000,"""Final Destination"" is the kind of horror film that works because it doesn't rely on maniacs running around with chainsaws(Although I did like ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"").It doesn't rely on our fears by surrounding us with flesh eating zombies(""Dawn of the Dead"" I have to point out was a classic).And it doesn't play with our fears by throwing out scenes of sexuality in which the characters are usually killed.Instead,the movie plays with our emotions because it deals with how we can never cheat death.A group of teenagers are thrown off of a plane before it takes off because one of the teenagers has a vision that the plane explodes and begins freaking out.The survivors begin to act suspicious of the visionary young man because he seems to know when the next one will die.What's worse is that the survivors of the plane seem to be getting killed under weird mysterious circumstances.Throughout the movie,the characters are not killed by getting shot or by the hands of another person but they are killed in situations that are to weird to explain.""Final Destination"" works as a horror movie because it throws The Grim Reaper right at us.The entire film is about death and how some people try to cheat it.""Final Destination"" also works because it teases us making us think we know how one character will die but keeps us guessing and watching.""Final Destination"" was the kind of film that I had the pleasure to watch.Very good film that will keep some people glued to their seats.",Final Destination
184,cLoNe,Excellent horror thriller,10,13 January 2001,"A really spooky movie. After we had some horror comedies like Scream and slashers like IKWYDLS and Urban Legends, this is a real horror movie. I like the other movies I mentioned, but not as much as Final Destination. Really thrilling and unexpected. The only thing that tainted my pleasure was the ending. Without spoiling it, I'm referring to the very final scene. You'll know what I mean when you'll see it. Turns out that scene was added to the original script and that shows.... After I saw the movie I told myself ""damn, this movie would've been much better without those extra 5 minutes"". Still, a great movie.",Final Destination

186,yongkang-27205,"Campy, quirky and all around weird",7,14 October 2021,"Suffice to say, this film really was pretty unique. It's odd (in a good way) to see the characters basically being thrown straight into the action. But it was done successfully, keeping the suspense and the thrill without excessiveness. Still, for all its uniqueness, the overall quality and feel was not spectacular, and is not a must watch, though still a definite good watch.",Final Destination
187,bgaiv,Very very good,9,16 September 2020,"This is just a classic. It's crazy and weird and... authentic.The leads are great, and far beyond what's expected from a horror picture. It's absolutely absurd to say this ranks up there with The Exorcist... but maybe not.Nobody is going to claim this picture has the immense power of that film. And they aren't remotely trying for that-- this film has its tongue firmly planted in cheek.This movie means to be real: Devon Sawa knocks it out of the park!By I always was a bit more intrigued by Kerr Smith's Carter. Sawa gets in the car, and Carter calls him a worlock. Soon after, one of Sawa/Alex's prophecies prevents a death and be says ""you're the devil!"" Then Alex starts talking about intervening, and Carter says ""are you God now??""",Final Destination
188,sakram,Good,7,20 October 2017,"6.5 out of 10 and here's why : The concept is good, an idea like this deserves quite a depiction, but there it is, Final Destination is a movie where people are facing a timed bomb-y Death, and they know it. It is a struggle against death. The only thing I hated is how deaths aren't completely incidental and they depicted it as some sort of 'transparent-yet-dark soul' which causes circumstances to change and voilà, death ! If only it were fully incidental then the scope of reality would've been preserved, without having to lean on supernatural stuff. Acting was good, though, so is the plot.",Final Destination
189,K-Slicer,This movie is overrated,2,7 May 2001,"This movie was not worth it's praise.  I thought it would be good but I was a little too hopeful.  I thought the death scenes were way overdone. If the teacher was going to be killed, could it have been quicker?  The performances of Devon Sawa and Ali Larter were great as well as the rest of the cast.  I thought it was better than some of the horror movies I have seen including Idle Hands etc but it was not as good as the Scream trilogy.5 out of 10.  It could have been better.",Final Destination
190,K-Slicer,I recant what I said earlier (SPOILERS!),2,12 December 2001,"Final Destination sucks pure and simple.  It is one of the worst horror movies of all time.  It's not a guilty pleasure and it isn't a horror film. It's insulting to sit there and watch a bunch of teens who are trying to outrun the angel of death even though they will die eventually.  The fact that Alex saw 'Death's plan' meant he wasn't supposed to die on that plane and those students who listened to him weren't supposed to die there either. Those who lived were meant to die at those points in the movie.  The teacher was supposed to die in her house.  The ditzy, fraidy blonde was supposed to get KO'ed by the bus.  I think making a movie were someone is trying to outrun death when it is going to catch up with him or her eventually is truly sardonic.  Maybe, that's the point of the film.  Either way, it sucks!2 out of 10.  Hey, at least it isn't as bad as Valentine, Tomcats, or Freddy Got Fingered.",Final Destination
191,drpakmanrains,Terrific Start Devolves Into Sub-Mediocre Slasher Pic.,2,5 October 2012,"First let me say I am 71, thus not the intended demographic for this film. But I had seen Devon Sawa in ""The Boys Club"" from 1995 and really liked that film, so I decided to watch this 12 years after its original release. I remember almost going to see it when it opened, but never got around to it.That said, after the first 15 minutes of this movie, I thought I was going to thoroughly enjoy this seemingly original idea along the lines of ""Sixth Sense"". But soon it just devolved into a teen slasher film, with the killer being ""death cheated"", overly explained by the coroner about 30 minutes in. Then Devon has to come to discover death's plan and try to fool it, supposedly ending the plan through interrupting it. This allows for a lot of grisly close calls and murders which seemed to me totally ludicrous, with objects self propelling and fires or explosions trying to kill the intended victim.I confess that I don't believe that any events in one's life are preplanned by fate other than genetic tendencies, so the premise itself was one I could not accept. But if the story had instead emphasized the guilt of having survived and how that affected them psychologically, perhaps a better film could have emerged, where the viewer could question whether there was intent or just coincidence. But that would have required some subtlety and an intelligent script, which were not in evidence in this pedestrian film. The clever surprise at the end was not enough to add more than one point to the rating. So a 2 from me instead of a 1. By the way, Devon Sawa did a good job, considering the poor material he was given. Hard for me to believe this sub-mediocre effort spawned numerous sequels or remakes. I wonder if I would have liked this more were I in my teens or twenties. Probably, since when I re-watch some of the films I thought were good back in the 50's, I often wonder how I could have possibly enjoyed them.",Final Destination

193,IrisNo11,Something Different That Defines A Teen Thriller Flick,10,1 October 2000,"Alex Browning (Devon Sawa) has a special (yet bonechilling) gift.  While aboard a plane with a handful of his fellow students, Alex suddenly predicts that the airplane explodes.  Only Alex, his friend, Tod (Chad Donella), Carter Horton (Kerr Smith), Terry Chaney (Amanda Detmer), Clear Rivers (Ali Larter), Billy Hitchcock (Seann William Scott) and teacher, Ms. Valarie Lewton (Kristen Cloke) are the only survivors from the school feild trip. One by one, since the plane crash, each survivor has died tragically.  The only way to save their lives is to cheat death itself.Freaky....isn't it? :)
FINALLY!  A teenage horror flick that doesn't involve some goofy dude dressed up in a stupid costume, going around killing people like they had in ""Scream"", ""Urban Legend"", etc.  Something that involves the mysterious supernatural, and involves even more heart pounding adventure! :)Also, the foreshadowing is very clear in the flick with the John Denver tunes and the dark shadows that lurk from behind them.  Interesting graphics and effects make this film an excellent flick! :)If you happen to watch the DVD version of the movie, you will also get to watch some deleted scenes to the movie, which I found interesting.  Also, an alternate ending to the whole film.  Personally, I liked the alternate ending much better than the one they had on the film itself.  But oh well!Overall, ""Final Destination"" is a great film!  You would not want to miss this one! :)",Final Destination
194,dirtychild,Inventive  but goes off the rails a bit!,7,14 February 2003,PLOT SPOILERS ALERT!!! Final Destination was a mostly enjoyable journey  it tells the tale of a group of students who are thrown off a plane  because one of them has physic premonitions about the plane blowing up.  Of course the plane blows up  but mysteriously  one by one  the survivors begin to die in horrible circumstances.  They work out that they have averted `Death's plan' and Death is reworking their fates (to be even more horrible than the plane crash).The plot sounds a little unbelievable  but it's an inventive and fresh take on the slasher-teen movies.Even though the movie goes against the typical horror heroine  the hero  Alex has feminine qualities that make him feel quite vulnerable to the audience.  Kerr Smith does a great job to go against type to play the macho jock who mostly wants to beat the fudge out of Alex (Devon Sawa)  miles away from Dawson's Creek.The first couple of `death scenes' are truly horrific and violent  some of these are pretty much guaranteed to scare the bejesus out of most people.But the movie tends to go off the rails a bit (after the train scene  funnily enough!).  I think the writers had a `hard time' trying to come up with a way how to beat `Death' in the end.  However the penultimate scene where Devon Sawa and Ali Later battle `Death' at Ali's house is quite `electrifying' (no pun intended!).After watching the DVD extras (deleted scenes / interviews with `executives')  it documents the trouble the film makers had in making an audience satisfying ending.  POSSIBLE PLOT SPOILERS  the original ending had Alex dying to save his pregnant girlfriend  thus cheating Death.  But the test audience had a bad reaction to this  feeling a bit distant from it after the first half of the movie was so different.  They reworked the ending  so Alex survived and Kerr Smith ultimately dies.  This made it into a typical horror movie ending (you know  a final shock right before the end credits).  I had just felt that both possible endings to the film were a bit of a let down  after the terrifying early death scenes  it doesn't seem like it goes out with a big enough bang.Don't let my review put you off the movie though  go see it for an original take on the teen-horror genre.7 out of 10,Final Destination
195,metalrox_2000,utterly worthless,1,21 June 2005,"the whole final destination series has one message. If you can save someone's life, don't bother, cause it will just throw off death's design. Then you will be targeted by death. The moral of the story is don't get involved. The entire Final Destination series is as low as the horror film genre can go. Once again, we have several talented actors wasting away in this in cohesive implausible, and totally worthless pieces of fluff. As with the second one, the directors decided they wanted to come up with some of the most impossible, and in some cases, unnessaryily goreish, ways to kill people off. The whole premise of the series is weak, and rather offensive. The lowest of any horror film series, only watch if you want to see how over the top a horror film can be. Other then that, just treat the series as if it didn't exist. If you are a real fan of the horror genre, you won't miss it.",Final Destination
196,lostintwinpeaks,Silly - but with Style!,4,1 March 2003,"The strength of FINAL DESTINATION lies in its ability to keep audiences on (to use a cliche) the edge of their seats. Or rather, to convince audiences that something is about to happen, then do a complete turn-around and have something else inexplicably happen.WHAT AM I TALKING ABOUT?Well, for example the death scenes. A large build-up ensues, where the movie convinces the audience that a character is going to die in all sorts of horrible ways. Then an anticlimatical drop occurs. The audience sighs, the character will be ok they think. But then - WHAM! - the character is killed in a most unexpected way. This is the power of this movie. Otherwise, the acting isn't very good; the script unsurprising; and the direction often slack, surprisingly so for John Woo.As for the core of the movie, the characters are hastily sketched with no depth and the storyline is rather old-hat fare. There is no denying it, this is a very silly film - but it will have you hooked till the end.Also of note: FINAL DESTINATION is a slasher movie, and the first without an actual killer - death itself stalks the protaganists instead. Interesting too is the way the movie turns everyday objects and occurrences into lethal weapons, and sometimes in rather original ways. There are also some neat in-jokes throughout.Bottom-line: Silly but with style and an ability to grip even the most reluctant viewer.",Final Destination

The opening scene is downright scary, come on who hasn't got on a plane and wondered if it would crash, and let me tell you I am not in a hurry to get on one now. Thought the story is a little contrived and a bit predictable(though that is part of the story) the effect is still the same. The movie is not, despite what you may hear, a teen flick, if you're a horror fan from any generation trust me you'll like it as long as you go in wanting to see it and willing to actually think about the film and follow the story line.

But, it made smartly by James Wong and make this movie as an innovative slasher ever. Imagine, you are been stalking by the unseen Grim Reaper (!). How can you cheat it ?

204,jangu,"Tries hard, but doesn't quite make it",7,23 April 2001,"'Final destination' starts out very fine indeed! From the ominous title-sequence, accompanied by Shirley Walkers effective score, until the inventive first murder, the atmosphere is thick with foreboding and threatening omens. And the airplane accident must surely be the most terrifying ever to be put onto celluloid! Scary stuff, to be sure!!! However, the movie goes downhill from there. The murders become more and more unconvincingly contrived (the bus-accident is a very well handled shock, though) and characters, grown-ups as well as adolescents, behave increasingly silly. Anyway, it's well above average for this kind of horror-thriller even if the final isn't as surprising as the filmmakers probably intended.

What an awesome concept. This movie is super inventive, genuinely creepy at points and a ton of fun.The Bad: there are some half baked ideas (like the lame shadow monster) and subplots in here that never fully develop. (Please explain how the main dude is never arrested. Please.) The movie also isn't as nearly as inventive as the later films, but I can't really fault it for that.The Ugly: speaking of said shadow monster...yeah, I'm very happy they abandoned the ""sentient"" villain for an unexplainable, uncaring force of the universe.

The coroner explains that lacerations on his hands are from yanking at the wire that strangled him. Alex brings up a great point that he if he was yanking at the wire, he wasn't trying to kill himself--it was an accident. All that develops into is the coroner coming back with a weird remark that in death, there ARE no accidents or coincidences. Realistically, someone wouldn't have that reaction to a great point and I thought, ""Ok, could we quit being weird and acknowledge the point he just made? He was tugging at the wire, which means he didn't exactly set this situation up for himself. So how did this happen? It's bizarre. How can his death be explained?""

208,SPaS,Worth your while,7,12 November 2001,"Alongside ""House on Haunted Hill"", this is one of the better follow-ups in the line of 'new' teen slasher horror flicks (starting from, of course, ""Scream""). What could I say? The acting is, in slasher terms, fine; especially the hero (Alex, played by Devon Sawa) gives a touching performance. Directing is good, but towards the end a bit too hectic - with a little less rushing the director might of had juiced up a bit more ""horror"". Then on the other side, at least it's never boring.BTW, as the original ending has more balls (see it on DVD), the re-shot, ""2nd"", ending is propably the best 'recovery' I've ever seen!

210,Phantasm01,Fly the friendly skies..,9,1 July 2006,"If you really want to scare someone, don't tell them another ""guy with a hook"" campfire story. Skip the urban legends and cheesy ghost story fare. Because what really scares people is real life.Go through the list of every possible way to die in any given situation. Mention how easy it is for a plane engine to fail, or a car to break an essential part. Comment on the plethora of common household items that, if they were to be involved in just the right coincidences, might result in your death.If you really want to scare someone, take them to Final Destination.The lead character, a high schooler named Alex Browning, is waiting on-board an international flight to Paris along with almost 40 of his classmates. During the wait, Alex has a premonition that the plane is going to blow up. He ditches the flight, taking several classmates and a teacher with him in the broil his panic incites. These precious few have their lives changed when, sure enough, the airplane explodes just after claiming the skies.The premise: those people were supposed to die, and now Death is simply getting caught up on his list. This means there is no killer, there is no hockey-masked looney with a rubber knife. There is a slight breeze, a brief, anamolous shadow, and then, you're dead.The craftsmanship here is excellent. The deaths are all very disturbing, all very real, and all very brutal, and the effect is nauseatingly refreshing. We don't see hysterical people running up the stairs to escape a never-tired creep, or jabbing meat thermometers into supernatural critters. We see a pattern of easily explained, perfectly normal, lethally designed events that not only cause death, but also adapt to the victim's movements. No matter where they go, death is at their heels, following them in the endless coincidences. And it's all the more terrifying because it's supposed to happen, and there's no one to fight. The most any of the characters can hope for is that Alex will predict it and, perhaps, intervene in time. Needless to say, Alex's track record for saving his friends drops drastically post-plane crash.The acting, though excellent, is a bit forced at points, and there are parts of the movie created solely to pad the film. A cringe-worthy expository interlude with a cheesy mortician and some repetitive dialogue are the only weak links in the show, however. The very concept of the flick is so interesting that it laminates all the duller moments.The premise is, of course, self-destructive. Death can't die so no matter how many times the characters manage to cheat the traps that seem to be laid for them, sooner or later, the chain of events will be set in motion all over again. It doesn't end until they die. This type of problem might have crippled most horror movies, but Final Destination cleverly eludes the chance of a weak and long-overdue ending by cashing in on the repetitive ""tag-you're-dead"" quality of the plot. It ends with the understanding that it hasn't ended.Not for the squeamish of heart, this movie is a landmark in the horror movie genre. Although it's not going to win any Oscars anytime soon, this well-timed and moodily constructed film does exactly what movies are intended to do: it entertains. It reveals the possibility that villains are all well and good, but the true horror lies in real death, in a murderer that exists in every inanimate object you come across.",Final Destination
211,JohnnyPHreak,Can You Miss This? IF I Were You I Wouldn't (Minor Spoilers),9,17 March 2000,"Freakish. On the edge of your seat terror. That's about all that came out of my mouth after this film ended. It stars Devon Sawa(Idle Hands, Now and Then) as a student who is going on a class trip to Paris. On entering the plane he has this surreal vision of the plane exploding. In a mad scramble to get off the plane he gets himself, and five other of his classmates kicked off the plane. The plane eventually takes off and explodes killing everyone on board. Months later each surviving member dies for unexplained reasons. This is a new twist on a very over done genre. There are the normal death scenes and scare moments but there done in such a way that your on the edge of your seat most of the film. This is also a bloody film. The death scenes are taken to a new level of nasty. It also has an ending that will leave you breathless. Even more so then the first I Know What You Did Last Summer. The actors pull off their scenes well and there's a very cool cameo but a cult horror legend. I give it an 8.5. This was a great supernatural horror film. Don't wait, go out and see this. And I warn anyone who has a fear of flying, the opening sequence is shocking.",Final Destination
212,Mr_PCM,A new twist on the slasher flick!,7,2 February 2006,"Final Destination is your average run-of-the-mill teen horror movie, but with one key difference from most; a rather unique premise.Having had a premonition that the flight he is boarding will blow up, Alex (Devon Sawa) causes panic by telling the plane, forcing the airline to disembark him and several other people. When the plane really does blow up soon after take-off, the FBI become convinced he caused the explosion. But they aren't the only ones on the survivors' tail. Death is also after them, and is determined to claim the souls that cheated it on the plane, and one by one they begin to die in bizarre and increasingly bloody accidents.The film is simply far too ridiculous for words. But that is part of the fun  trying to figure out exactly what series of morbid co-incidences will lead to a gruesome death., and who will be next. But to compensate for this originality, the characters are all straight out of school clichés 101; the jock, the kook, the nerd, the princess  they might as well have cast the kids from The Breakfast Club! But what is interesting about the casting is some playing against type  most notably Seann William Scott as a nerd and Ali Larter considerably dressed down as the kook, while Kerr Smith enjoys a change of pace from his role as gay Jack as the jerk jock. The acting is all steady but never spectacular, except for a brief cameo by Tony Todd of Candyman fame who manages to steal the film from just a couple of minutes screen-time as a creepy morgue worker.Certainly more original than any of the other major teen horror flick franchises doing the rounds such as Jeepers Creepers, and definitely worth a watch. But perhaps two sequels (including the forthcoming Final Destination 3) was perhaps stretching a good idea so far.",Final Destination
213,qball_82,...a nice change from the usual slice-em-dice-em teen-slasher formula..,7,10 June 2001,"A pretty decent horror flick, Final Destination presented an interesting story and was a nice change from the usual slice-em-dice-em teen-slasher formula.  I thought the use of ""Death"" as the unseen killer was particularly effective, and the movie manages to keep it's presence subtle rather than going all out with special effects and a physical portrayal.The last time I saw Devon Sawa was in Casper and he sure has grown up.  I thought the acting in general was pretty average but hey it's a horror flick, we're not after Oscar-worthy performances here. 
The story as I said, was quite interesting and definitely gets you thinking. Some of the deaths were pretty disturbing and I was surprised to find myself squirming in my seat!  The visuals were standard fare, nothing to rave about.All in all, if you're a fan of the teen-slasher flick genre, you're bound to like Final Destination.  I was pleasantly surprised.",Final Destination

I just saw it in the theater and it turned out to be a great surprise.  I loved every minute of it.  It actually made ME nervous as I watched it. I NEVER get scared at the movies, but this one actually made me squirm in my seat. Kerr Smith (from Dawson's Creek fame) was a great addition to the cast; he played a dramatically different role from his character on the show! Do yourself a favor and check this one out!!!",Final Destination
216,starlit-sky,"Terrible, terrible movie",4,7 August 2000,"At the beginning, the plot seemed promising but then it turned out to be terribly stupid. What bothered me most about the movie was the way they used cheap techniques to make it scary. And by that I mean all the stupid, non-sense accident scenes which are supposed to scare you. Now we are led to believe that ""death has a pattern and chooses its victims according to that pattern"". Suppose that it is true, why do all the people have to die in bizarre accidents? Are there not other ways of dying, say a heart-attack or sudden internal-bleeding or any sort of sickness? And why has it never occurred to the main character that the next victim could die just by a natural cause and not by accident? But no, people had to die in those bizarre accidents so the audience could be scared! Well, I was neither scared nor amused by these cheap tricks; I wonder who were. Throughout the movie I kept I wondering what the main message was, that death has a pattern, that we can change it? And why death always had to come as accident? Could the main character stop deaths from happening if it came as, say cancer? And one more thing: why did the main character have to presume that death was going to come immediately right after it took a victim. I mean just because he figured out who the next victim was going to be and could make a list of that, it did not mean that death was gonna hit the next victim right away!!! It could have taken 10 years for death to strike its next victim. It seemed as if not only did the main character know in advance the cause of death but the time of the death too. So, I think these otherwise-could-be false presumptions were expected to be taken for granted and the events were deliberately set-up which made the whole thing seem so obvious. Not a good scary movie.",Final Destination
217,Mario64,Interesting idea that falls short,5,28 June 2002,"It's an interesting idea to create a movie about a bunch of people who escape death and destiny keeps coming after them, trying to kill them. A hell of a lot more original than most thrillers/horror movies now days right. Final Destination takes that idea and falls short because of it's stupidity. There many plot holes and the script is poor at best. What's just as bad is most of the characters are just bone heads. On the positive side there are some dramatic scenes that are exciting and original that leave you somewhat satisfied after the fact. However, those can't quite make up for it's faults. Hard core horror movie fans, which I'm not, will probably apreciate this film more than I did, given the fact it's well above the average of today's horror flicks. I give it a 5 out of 10.",Final Destination

219,flickjunkie-3,"Creative, Intelligent Fun.",7,15 December 2000,"I had heard Final Destination was the best teen horror film since Scream. Although that may not be exactly correct, I still enjoyed myself during this intelligent and fierce thriller.Death has a plan and Alex (Devon Sawa) has ruined it. After having a premonition the flight he and his school group are about to take will explode in mid air, he tries to warn everyone. Of course no one believes him and with a handful of classmates, he is thrown off the plane before it takes off. When the plane bursts apart just after take off, Alex realises he has cheated death  and now it's time for payback. One by one, the survivors begin to die in horrific, mysterious circumstances. Now that Alex has figured Death's plan, can he do anything to alter the destiny that awaits him?Final Destination isn't a bad film. In fact, its pretty darn good. The performances are impressive, Devon Sawa possibly gave his best performance, while Dawsons Creek actor Kerr Smith gives a smartly evil role as Carter. Also Ali Larter, Chad Donella and Sean William Scott are very good performers for this horror flick. The script is very original, writer Glen Morgan deserves praise for his abilities on the keyboard. I love the deaths, they are very creative, and the direction is full of effort.Although slightly sometimes Final Destination can be slightly overrated, I highly recommend it for an audience who want to have a scarily funny good time.I rate Final Destination 7 out of 10.",Final Destination
220,Juan_from_Bogota,The story of a young Nostradamus,6,2 March 2007,"How can anyone predict the future?, well Nostradamus wrote about facts that would happen hundreds of years in the future, but this is an opposite story, Alex (the young Nostradamus), predicted something that was about to happen in the next couple of hours or maybe less, what an talent!, this movie really is entertaining!, and i had a good time watching this movie. The following events when the death is chasing after the survivals of the flight is the second good topic, you can avoid death?, you can actually change your destiny? everyone's destiny is already defined?, and if you manage to change your destiny, you violate a rule of our existence and that have to be fixed by the destiny itself?, well some philosophy can also be made about this movie. What genre is this movie? fantasy or horror? i think that is more fantasy, but with ""horror type"" deaths. Is a nice story and good visual effects.ABOUT THE FILM: Dewon Sawa plays Alex Chance Brwoning, a boy of high school that predicts that the plane in which they would fly to Paris in a school trip will burst into flames, he step out of the flight with some classmates, as they avoided death, the death start to follow everyone that dropped the flight, they are Clear Rivers (Ali Larter) an smart girl somewhat introverted, Carter Horton (Kerr Smith) one of the popular guy of school, the teacher Ms. Valerie Lewton (Kristen Cloke), Billy Hitchcock (Sean William Scott), Tod Wagner (Chad Donella) and Terry (Amanda Detmer), they realize that escaping from death is more difficult that they tough, but they try for all means to stay alive!.6/10",Final Destination
221,echozdog,"Horror formula. The characters die one by one, but it's all in how they die.",7,21 February 2006,"Yes this is another horror flick where the characters die one by one. At least it's not this person that can't die chase them with the cattle prod. They die because death is chasing them. The only thing that really ""creeped me out"" about the movie was the plane crash. Having a fear of flying the crash scene at the beginning hit home and made me squirm.The only real flaw in the movie (aside from the horror formula used over and over again) is the fact that if death wanted to get you it could find ways other than elaborate ways it does in this movie. Death would just give them all heart attacks and be done with it. It's like the when death wants to go get an ice cream cone it buys a cow and milks it and makes cream then mines the minerals to build a refrigerator to turn it into ice cream. It's all to hokey. If they could have figured out a way to not have that plot hole I might have given it a 8. But that dropped it down to a 7.",Final Destination
222,grybop,Just OK,6,7 July 2001,"The problem with Final destination is the HUGE plot holes - eg whatever happened to Alex's parents in the second part? Secondly, I think the idea behind it might have been better exploited if some supernatural events had been omitted - eg water creeping back into the toilet. And please , someone teach Ali Larter how to act! Yet the action sequences are excellently filmed and the ending is just... awesome, although it actually made me laugh! Finally I hope Devon Sawa will choose his next roles carefully - he deserves more than to be another stereotype thriller character.

It's fascinating that we are all 'born to die'. Ironic eh?I loved this film, and even though it slips into the teen-slasher genre, this film displays some kind of intelligence in the handling of it's subject matter.The story is very straight-forward, and it's conception is very good.Death has a plan for us all, and when some students 'cheat' Death, he/it comes looking for them, and disposing of them in quite unique ways.I will NEVER EVER get on an airplane after watching this movie. Never cross the road without looking. And I'll be more careful when drinking a coffee by my computer. It just goes to show, we can go at anytime.I could dissect this concept for hours, but I think I should do that somewhere else.The hip, young and very sexy cast - Ali Larter!!!!! Go girl!!! - all live and die respectively. Tony Todd (does he personify Death in this film?) gives a lovely turn as erm...a guy in the mortuary!Good script, breathtaking SFX especially the Plane crash!!! make this a great film for those who are afraid to live and to die.

224,Ysman,Just when you thought it was safe to listen to John Denver . . .,5,24 March 2000,"Chalk this up to another really good premise ruined with an atrocious script and an unoriginal follow through.  What would have been interesting to find out is why Devon Sawa's character was let in on Death's design but this is not the flaw of this film.  With some hilarious death scenes and general overall creepy tone, Final Destination could have been the next Scream (which every horror film released since 1996 has been so desperately trying to be).  However, Final Destination does not have the same tongue-in-cheek sense of humor that Scream had.  The film takes itself way too seriously when it just should have had more fun with its good ideas.  Instead the audience is forced to listen to a ludicrous dialogue.  With that said, the film is actually a blast if expectations are held low.  The death scenes are extremely graphic and were usually unexpected.  If it weren't for the bus killing and the beheading, Final Destination would just be another House on Haunted Hill, The Haunting, Disturbing Behavior, Urban Legend, etc., etc., etc.",Final Destination

228,mercury-26,Not for the squeamish,7,17 April 2000,"We've all heard the phrase, `kids do the craziest things-they think they're invincible.""  Given the recent surge of teen slasher movies like ""Scream"" and ""Urban Legend,"" Hollywood producers are well aware of this truth. Seems like they're serving up a little reminder to the youth of America: Your number could come up at any moment, just like anybody else.Even if Hollywood has no such intentions, it has discovered that their younger audiences are getting more sophisticated and are looking for new and clever ways to see themselves get killed. The latest killing spree film, Final Destination, doesn't mess around with guns and psycho killers, but gets right to the point: The killer here literally IS Death, which proves It can get pretty creative when it comes time to claim somebody. The idea is that Death has a design for everyone, that each moment of our lives is just a cycle of events that lead up to the End.  We're free to live our lives as long as Death lets us. Pretty depressing stuff but there is a point, which I'll explore in a minute. First, the nuts and bolts of the story...Seems Alex Browning (Devon Sawa), a high school senior, is given a special, unexplained ability to foresee his demise.  He sees it exactly as it's going to happen, in one of the most terrifying sequences ever filmed.  Apparently Death hadn't taken this into account; Alex goes berzerk and warns others of what's about to happen. A few people are saved, but most of the people involved proceed right into Death's arms, just as Alex foresaw (I'm not going to give away the details of this opening sequence, simply because too many other people, plus the film's trailer, have already ruined it). So here we have seven people who Death was all ready to claim, alive and safe. Apparently, this makes Death mad and It starts to pick them off one by one. Seeing as these people, five of Alex's fellow students and one teacher, defied Death's original plan, Death has to get creative. The most mundane of household objects, most of which we would never think of as lethal, are used together in bizarre, sometimes silly, chain reactions of events that lead to the kill.  All of these scenes are shocking, gruesome, or both, so be warned: this film is not for everybody.Along with having visions of his own death, Alex is able to foresee others' deaths and tries again to cheat the Reaper. He beat It once, and believes he can do so again (ah, the ego of the teenage male). There's a scene in which Alex knows it's his turn to go, so he locks himself inside a remote cabin and duct tapes down anything and everything that could possibly turn into a lethal object. He eats pudding from a tin can, having used leather work gloves to open it, sloshing the food around in his mouth to make sure there's nothing hard inside that he could choke on. This was a funny moment, and humor is something this movie uses well to give the audience a break. The scene reminded me of the way a parent of a curious toddler would start to think about household objects in a way she never thought of them before. This parent starts thinking of scenarios in which, a ball of yarn for instance, could become lethal.  Whether you think this is wisdom or paranoia, that parent understands one thing: Death does not discriminate. It happens to the helpless, the innocent, those who least `deserve' it. As cold and unfeeling as this film seems most of the time, it takes care to illustrate this point.This ain't no masterpiece, but this was an innovative piece of work; a worthy first crack at feature directing by TV veteran James Wong.  In the simplest terms, Final Destination is one hell of a good thrill ride. Suspend your disbelief at the ticket office and buckle up.Grade: B-",Final Destination

I thought the plane crash was a good idea, as it plays on most people's fears about flying and there were some good actors. I thought that the deaths were OK but not as inventive as some of the others. I'll be honest, before seeing this I thought that it would be way more gory than it actually was. I wont deny it did make my toes curl when billy got half his head cut off but that was the only one I thought was particularly bad.

Oh, and of course it's not scary. It create funny scenes (yes, because it's completely unbelievable, not just unlikely to happen), or chain reactions. That's it. I love the scene where one char makes a lot of precautions to avoid death in his apartment though. Is that even a great concept ? I mean, Death doesn't really care about us. It's not personal, you know. Death just makes sure some people die frequently, it's not like it's gonna make a complex, tedious chain reaction to kill you, and specifically you.

232,Verbal-17,One of the most effective horror movies I've ever seen,10,19 March 2000,"We've all seen a million deaths in movies, and for the most part we are desensitized to it, and we are able to predict the deaths we see on the screen. But occasionally, a movie comes along that surprises us with its scenes of death and violence. Part of the joy of Pulp Fiction was its unpredictability. Anyone who's seen Deep Blue Sea remembers the effect of the scene where a character dies completely unexpectedly. Final Destination succeeds where other horror movies have failed because it takes time to make characters interesting, makes their discussions about death and control over one's destiny intriguing, and their deaths are more than just predictable cliches. Of course, this is still a horror flick, but it's scary because monsters and serial killers can be beaten with sheer physical force, but what do you do when your enemy is death itself, that unseen, unstoppable force that has all of us on his list? This is at the core of what makes the horror genre so entertaining- it allows us to examine the subject of our own death, something we're all curious about, without having to stare it right in the face. If we see it in exaggerated style, on a movie screen, we're just voyeurs. ""Destination"" shows us death the way it really is- unpredictable, inevitable, sudden, meaningless.

235,MissCzarChasm,Finally a horror film worth a lot of Praise!,10,26 March 2000,"Final Destination has made my list as one of the best horror films in the wake of the teen/slasher revival. in fact it's the most original horror film since the original Scream and it may be better than Scream. There have been many cheap imitations(Urban Legend, i still know what you did last summer, etc) but this one is a keeper.The film begins with the most exhillerating 15 minutes in recent memory(and if you're afraid of flying be prepared to be shocked). Alex browning(Devon Sawa) is getting ready to leave on a class trip to France. while on the plane he has a vision that the plan is going to explode. Later he awakes from this vison and immediately he goes crazy telling everyone the plane is going to explode. eventually 6 students and alex leave the plane and sure enough moments after the plane takes off it explodes. This is where the story gets interesting by getting off the plane Alex soon realizes that him and his friends have cheated Death and they have to figure out when death is coming back at them.The one thing i thought was trully good about this film was whenever ""Death"" came after the remaining students that got off the plane it wasn't some grim reaper type guy you could see. whenever death was around it was very subtle. shadows, wind, etc. death never showed his ugly head. he used everyday thingst o kill his victims. in fact it was stuff that you could accidentally do in your home and that is what makes this film scary.The acting is great. Devon Sawa proves that he can carry a film. he has great talent. Ali Larter is a terrific actress who is well on her way to becoming the best actress ofher generation, but Kerr smith of dawson's Creek shines here. he was really good and i hope to see him in more films.Great film worth every dollar i spent to see it. 10",Final Destination

Ali Larter(House on Hunted Hill)is beautiful and kept Alex on his toes. Kerr Smith(Dawson's Creek)was your average bad boy type,but not that much.Which keot me laughing.Seann William Scott(American Pie 1,2,3)had a small role,but you'll notice him.Showing his talent still.Tony Todd(Candyman)was beside death,had the ceepiest role.   JamesWong would later do The One(GOOD)and Willard(GREAT!!!)showed he had what it takes to be a good horror director at the making.This film had the best death scences including that will go up with Samuel L.

238,Dkish,"The young people out there will love this, I am sure.",6,16 March 2000,"Another teen horror flick in the wake of ""Scream 3"" written by the guys who put the creepy in the X-Files. Sounds like a wild ride or is it? The story centers around a group of teens who survive an airliner explosion through a bizarre incident. After the crash, one teen (Devon Sawa) becomes completely convinced that the Grim Reaper is after him and he is hunting the group in the way they should have died in the explosion. Producer, co-screenwriter, and director James Wong re-teams with his partner Glen Morgan for a stab at the silver screen. Morgan and Wong's greatest exploit has to have been the couple seasons of the X-Files where it became the staple for TV suspense and to this day the series is still trying to recapture. They have continue to dabble in TV with such series as the little seen but at times brilliant ""Space: Above and Beyond"" and NBC's recent hit ""The Others"". But with the debut of ""Final Destination it's the team's first real venture onto the silver screen. Destination starts off with a great opening 20 minutes where we are shocked and dumbfounded by the opening plot. I haven't seen that thrilling of a plane disaster scene since 1993's ""Alive"". Wow, what a scene. And as the film moves along a lot of the scenes are shocking and keep you on your toes. But it's the latter half of the film that bugged me. The time I am talking about is just when ex-Hollywood sex symbol Ali Larter's hair starts to get blonder. Ever notice that in Hollywood films they always dumb down the leading lady until she is supposed to catch the hero's eye? It's at that point that Sawa's avoidance of the Grim Reaper get really hokey. That cabin scene is a perfect example. Every movie like this needs a supernatural ending and the finale here is gimmickry and unrealistic. If you love the humor-horror trilogy of ""Scream"" like so many million people then Destination has all that to offer but watch out for a couple goofy things along the way.  I guess other ""Scream"" clone ""I Know What You Did this Summer"" and especially its sequel got this back lash too. The young people out there will love this, I am sure.

Why the ___ in this day and age would people pay money to watch dozens of violent deaths for the thrill of it? Watch a movie which shows tragic death without the depersonalization.

241,paulgeaf,High Speed Deaths..,6,8 January 2005,"This is definitely NOT one of the best Horror movies I have seen. I find that review of it quite amusing. This movie could so easily fall into the category of American movies that are too much like trashy American Supernatural series that are being shown in their thousands from one side of the world to the other.. But! But, the way in which the director controls the atmosphere, especially when a frightening scene is coming up, also the suddenness of some of the deaths; which really does grab you from the back of the head and get you sitting up straight in your seat; for all of the above reasons this is truly a good movie.It is not a 'great' movie.The all too worn out and common 'American Teenagers Horror Movie' is enough for me to give it a lower rating -Unless it is strikingly different...which this film isn't. 6 stars",Final Destination
242,guskeller,Satisfying Schlock,6,13 October 2021,"Final Destination is satisfying schlock. The premise is silly but fun, and the craftsmanship is actually pretty solid, especially for a movie like this. There is some weak acting (namely, Kristen Cloke) and the music is occasionally distracting, but that is mostly forgivable because other techniques are implemented. Specifically, the camerawork is surprisingly engaged: plenty of movement and a variety of shots keep the visuals active. There are moments of abstract sound design that help set an eerie mood. There is even a match cut transition early on that is quite pleasant. Plus, a variety of special effects are used, which is always refreshing (the CGI hasn't aged well but everything else generally works).Some movies aren't trying to be much more than shallow entertainment and that is okay. Final Destination might not be enlightening or even make much sense, but it does accomplish its goals of excitement and gratuitous kills. For that alone, it is a fair experience. Yet, because Final Destination is competently executed on a technical level, it is more than a one-trick pony. Therefore, even though Final Destination clearly isn't high art, it does land as an amusing piece of pop culture.Writing: 6/10

243,Chris-332,An Original and Entertaining Film.,8,27 March 2000,"What really had me going about Final Destination was not the terrifying and gory deaths, or the the non-stop entertainment plot, or even the most original and frightening beginning since Scream. What really got me to enjoy this movie was the completely new idea of the ""slasher movie without the slasher"" idea, the magnificently shot scenes which kept you so freaked out about what was going to happen, the freaky and eerie score, and the amazingly fresh plot. After three years of lame and predictable slasher movies (with the exception of the well done Scream movies), Final Destination gives us a totally new look on death. Has there ever been any way of death in movies that aren't murders, accidents, or suicides? Final Destination gives us something new: the form of death itself gets cheated by five teenagers who get removed from a plane which explodes in mid-air. They were supposed to die with the rest of the passangers. Now Death is mad, and it decides to kill off the teenagers one-by-one to balance things out, using accidents and framed suicides to hide the fact that death is on a rampage of revenge. As each character dies throughout the story, the main character Alex, who can somehow see the deaths before they happen, looks desperately and tries to find Death's pattern of killing, because if he finds that, they can cheat death again.This movie has some problems, like the scene with the mortician, but because of the fresh story, the superb death scenes, the fine acting, and the very eerie feeling you get while watching the movie, you hardly even notice them. The movie also has great comedy in it, something only the Scream movies have perfected.So all in all, Final Destination is a thrill machine that definitely kept me going the whole time. I very much hope that movies like these are made more often now that slashers are finally being forgotten.",Final Destination

Eventually Alex, Carter, Alex's two friends, Carter's girlfriend, A teacher and Clear a girl who believes Alex are removed from the plane.  The Plane crashes and Death  has skipped these seven people. But, Death comes back for them, trying to kill them one by one.

245,jackcwelch23,Effectively scary and unnerving,7,19 October 2017,"I remember seeing this film for the first time when I was 6 years old. I saw it at our holiday house in Byron Bay and only 3 movies have ever terrified me as much as this one did (Jeepers Creepers and A Nightmare On Elm Street) but the idea of this movie is still so great whenever I think about it. Instead of a blade wielding psycho we have death itself as our villain. And hey, it can take any of us out whenever it wants. It cannot be stopped. Unlike the Terminator, some plastic explosive will not do the trick. If you're chosen, your time is up mate. I couldn't sleep for about 3 weeks after watching it. I still don't know how i can get on a plane without having a nervous breakdown. I also look on this movie fondly as it gave me a serious adrenaline rush of fear. It is more thought provoking than people give it credit too. We are only here on borrowed time after all. The big man in the sky will send the reaper to come calling for us someday. Maybe we should just be grateful we didn't end up on this particular death list, as I would like to die with my body parts intact at the very least. Another great thing about it is Devon Sawa's performance, believable and sympathetic. He brings credibility to a role that could have been cardboard. It is a great shame that his career never took off after this, but he can at least smile knowing he gave a memorable performance in at least one movie. It's still no masterpiece and it has an unsatisfying ending, and of course all the sequels sucked, but it will always send that shiver down my spine in the most satisfying way whenever I watch it.

246,werewolffromplanetx,Rube Goldberg presents: I Know What You Did Last Summer,4,19 January 2020,"(I felt that my earlier review was overly harsh, so I decided to revise it). A rather mediocre film, with a premise that is rather hard to take seriously, feeling rather like a mediocre Scream knock-off a la Urban Legend or I Know What You Did Last Summer, but with the killer replaced with a series of unlikely and usually fatal mishaps. Unfortunately, the film takes this silly premise too seriously, and squanders the potential for some delicious moments of black comedy. This, combined with the ugly early 2000s cgi and drab sets and lighting, leads to a dull and uninvolving viewing experience. The fact that something resembling a workplace safety video with characters and a higher budget could become so popular truly boggles the mind. I wouldn't say that I hate the film (unlike Hostel or The Purge, for example), but I don't really see the appeal.",Final Destination
247,derekauthor,A Terrific 'Destination',9,27 August 2005,"What made ""Final Destination"" so great was that it had a different approach to horror films. It wasn't your typically teenage-slasher flick type of movie with some madman hacking people to death with an ax. Instead, it dealt with the subject of 'death.'Alex Browning (Devon Sawa) gets some of his classmates and a teacher off a plane which, he claims after having a dream, will explode. After the plane DOES explode, those Alex pulled off the plane begin to die, one by one. This just proves that, according to the film's tag-line, 'you can't cheat death.'The ways the characters die are violent, but oddly realistic. The characters themselves make sense, and the direction by James Wong (of TV's 'The X Files') is great.As you watch the film, you can't help but think that one day, your day will come. It's a very morbid thought, but true -- and the film says so.",Final Destination
248,jpasols,Supernatural Horror at it's Best!!,10,26 August 2020,"If there's any way to open a horror movie and really grasp the attention of your audience within the first twenty minutes of the film, it's Final Destination!! This movie had one of THE most intense intros I've seen in any movie and it had my heart slowly racing from the very first frame to my heart pounding out of my chest when the plane explodes! Throughout the entire film you have a chilling feeling and vibe. The atmosphere and tone of this film is very creepy and definitely feels a lot like an X-Files episode (as it was originally intended to be before James Wong was convinced to turn this story into a full length film titling it 'Flight 180' but then re-titling the film 'Final Destination' the last second). Not to mention the eerie soundtrack score and brilliant cast performances from actors and actresses such as Devon Sawa (Idle Hands), Ali Larter (Obsessed), Sean William Scott (American Pie), and Amanda Detmer (Big Fat Liar), who all add some humorous tones to the film at certain aspects but when this movie needs to be scary it's SCARY! With creative death scenes and a phenomenal plot premise which follows Devon Sawa's character, Alex, has a vision of the plane he and his classmates board will explode. He saves himself and a few others who decide to get off the plane after Alex and Carter (Kerr Smith) get into a fight. After the small group of people exit the plane it really DOES explode after take off. Now death itself (personified as a presence/force with an awareness to make sure the survivors die in the order they would have died on the plane). I think this is all an amazing and clever idea for a horror/thriller film! In the age of teen slashers such as SCREAM, I Know What You Did Last Summer, Urban Legend, etc all being super popular and redone in the late 90s and early 2000s I believe that FINAL DESTINATION was a fresh and legitimately scary horror film that was presented to audiences and changed how horror would go on after the films release. Having the figure ""Death"" playing the part of a slasher was genius and I highly believe that every sequel that came after this movie proved how great of a franchise this really is! The film's score, cast, crew, plot, death's, atmosphere, was all amazing things this movie had! If you haven't seen this one I highly recommend you do so! Entertaining horror tale with a twist ! I enjoy it every time I watch it!!My rating for FINAL DESTINATION (2000) is a strong 10/10",Final Destination
249,Atomic_Peace,"Warning: if you had a near-death experience in the past few days, it's best mind of you, not to watch this!",8,28 February 2013,"In this John Hughes movie gone to hell, a French Class en route for Paris for an end of the year trip is ill-fated by the unpreventable plane crash, which will kill all aboard. But few are sparred from the flight, after teenager Alex Browning has a premonition of the deadly flight. They rejoice in their luck, but soon, Death soon sets out to collect the souls who evaded their ending, now they must figure out how to evade his gruesome agenda. Inspired by an actual case, in which a Mother called her daughter, the day before her flight, saying that she had suffered a dream depicting the crash. Concerned for her mother, the daughter rescheduled her flight,and as fate would have it, the plane crashed shortly after takeoff. I like to think of this movie like The Twilight Zone movie, just a hell of a lot more bloody! The Hitchcockian feel to it adds more pleasure to the film's experience. I will admit, I rarely watch horror films, mainly because over time, they've become an overdone, generic work after another, when I do watch something that meets the term horror, it's usually psychological or a murder mystery, take for instance ""And Then There Were None"". But, sometimes I will build up the bravery to sit through them, and most of the time, I am pleased with what I see. Luckily, this was one of the films that I enjoyed! The best part of the film's franchise is the Rube Goldberg-esque death scenes, as the series progresses, these become more creatively done, in this feature, the most creative death was the one that took place at a restaurant. But this being the first film, I give it a pass! But, like most franchises,the greatness dies off. I've heard through recent reviews that the 5th installment was actually the best, all ignorance to the 4th chapter, which was said to be the dullest out of the series, agreeably amongst all fans and critics. But, I have yet to see 4 and 5, as I have only seen 1 -3, as I am not too much of a horror fan! Out of all the films, I have to say that this has the best acting, directing, and writing. I give the film an 8.5/10 ticket stub. The perfect Halloween film, just make sure for the love of God that there are no children in the room, and fare warning, if you had some near death experience in the past few days, this may not be of fare mind to you!",Final Destination
250,yasenkiranov,Has it's ups and downs,6,5 November 2012,"I can't really say that ""Final Destination"" is a bad movie,but it's not anything special either.What I liked the most about this film was the idea-everyone's destiny being predetermined and what would happen if you ""cheat"" death.I thought it was very creative.The only characters you will probably care about are Alex,the protagonist,Clear,the love interest(sort of) and Carter,the a**hole.These three characters are the only ones that get any kind of development.Everyone else is pretty much cannon fodder.I didn't quite like the death scenes,though.The special effects were decent,but the scenes themselves seemed kind of implausible.The scene that irritates me the most is the death of the teacher,Ms.Lewton.I mean,she sees smoke coming from her computer and what does she do,walk towards it very slowly,how stupid do you have to be to do that.As much as I criticize the death scenes,they are somewhat suspenseful.The whole movie is,especially in the final 10 minutes.""Final Destination"" is an alright movie and it's a lot better than most teenage horror flicks out there.",Final Destination

252,kidwltm,"Butler, PA",7,19 July 2003,"Around the time of Final Destinations production, teen slasher films were very popular.  The film was made to capitalize on that fleeting market, but I've have to give recognition to the writers and director for trying something a little bit different, at least for the time period in which it was made.  James Wong did a good job directing.  His style is far from innovative, but it provides the film with a nice tone.  The screenplay could have went better.  Though better than an average example, FD still suffers from lack of character developement and some mediocre dialogue.  There are far worse examples in the genre, though.  The acting was also good.  Ali Larter was the only one I really didn't care for.  She just seemed rather uninterested in what she was doing.  There really wasn't that many parts I found to be particularly suspenseful or scary, though they will keep you from slipping off into boredom.  The final 15 minutes or so was also rather dull. A good example of later teen horror films.  There are evident negative elements, but there are some good ones too.

254,jaesboxer,A good idea sucked dry by a predictable plot.,3,17 February 2002,"When I first heard about Final Destination, I found the premise intriguing. Death stalking it's victims, unseen terror.  I actually saw it hoping that it would be an elevation above the teen horror flick genre.  Hope as I might, the burst into flames as quickly as the plane that sets up this cliche ridden, badly written, and horribly acted film.  Alex Browning is journeying with his classmates on a year end trip to Paris.  The movie opens admirably, despite several predictable moments (Alex's father saying ""Live it up, you've got the rest of your life ahead of you"", when thunder suddenly booms in the background and ominous notes take over.  We are introduced to all the key characters at the airport, several creepy, morbid kids who would benefit from psychological counselling.  Anyway, as Alex boards the plane, he falls asleep and is struck by a extremely vivid (and frightening) vision of the plan exploding.  When he causes a ruckus, Alex and several other members of his class are forced off.  Upon takeoff, guess what happens. The plane explodes, leaving the seven survivors to mourn for the two-hundred and eighty killed.  Now the idiocy begins.  Toilet water chases people through their houses, knives fly, kitchens explode, small sheet metal becomes deadly, decapitating flying blades.  James Wong, who did several X-Files episodes, obviously hoped to capitalize on this original idea of seven people who have cheated death, and have angered the cosmic existance.  But he is a rookie, and, though their is no boogeyman, the deaths of several expendable students are completely cliched.  The acting is forced, Devon Sawa and Ali Larter prove incapable of evoking sympathy, and Tony Todd as the death-obsessed mortician, is almost painful to watch.  However, challenging the acting for the statuette of 'pointless endeavour' is the writing.  Idiotic sick jokes fall flat, mindless murders grow tedious, and embarassingly bad lines pervade this film.  The stupid psychobabble makes the story seem incredibly corny, while an abyssmal ending, attempting black comedy, mares any chance of redemption.  A good outline for movie, but nothing more.  Maybe in a few years a more qualified director will produce the premise more seriously.",Final Destination
255,howellgirl2011,The grim reaper is coming to town to finish what could have been a tragedy for everyone.,7,15 January 2011,"This is one of my favorite horror films since A nightmare on elm street film series. It is simple and basic, mainly about these teenagers trying to escape a horrible encounter with death himself or itself. Because death can come in so many mysterious ways that can't be explained by science or common sense. I loved all the deaths it reminded me of a show now on TV called 1000 ways to die. It displays and explains how a person died in such a mysterious way or a bizarre way that some people can't describe it or won't believe it at first thought. The deaths were phenomenal and so unbelievable that I can't describe it or anyone else cannot do it. I really thought that the first scene on the plane was pretty good because you would never suspect a plane exploding or splitting it 2 ways it is so phenomenal and so unusual to learn and to process throughout the brain and the mind. I really thought that the last scene when the 3 teens are in Paris when the sign on a store or hotel comes swooping down and hits the teen who questions who is next to die on death's list and who will be saved. That scared me and I am like there had better be a sequel to this film and it better be as good as this one! But I have learned that there are more of these films to come and go and I will sit back and watch them roll and see people die.",Final Destination
256,fidelio74,'And When I Die',8,26 October 2012,"The word 'original' gets thrown around a lot in film criticism but 'Final Destination' is a truly original and devilishly inventive horror film. It is clever and unusual and the young cast is likable and play their roles well.Seated upon a plane which is about to take off for Paris, France, young Alex Browning (Devon Sawa) has a terrifying premonition in which he and his group of fellow students and teachers are killed when the plane explodes shortly after takeoff. Understandably, he flips out, and his resulting panic causes him and a small group of his friends and one of their teachers to be thrown off the flight. Mere minutes later, they watch in horror, shock, and disbelief, as Alex's premonition comes true and the plane does, indeed, explode.But, it turns out that they are not quite so lucky as they think. They soon learn that Death will not be cheated of their lives so easily and before long that terrible spectre is hunting them down, one by one, and killing them in a series of what appear to be bizarre accidents. Can Alex figure out Death's design before it is too late?The deaths in this film are cleverly put together and staged, and quite violent at times. There is a macabre kind of fun to be had in trying to figure out who will be next to fall beneath Death's merciless scythe. Another really neat thing about this film is that most of the main characters have surnames which reference great classic horror actors, directors, and producers. This is a really nice touch.'Final Destination' is intelligently written and surely has one of the coolest final shots in film history. It is no surprise that the film has turned into a profitable franchise for its studio, New Line. What is a surprise is that the sequels are actually pretty good and they always kick off with an exceptionally well-staged catastrophe which sets the scene for what is to follow.If you are a fan of horror, then 'Final Destination' should definitely be a part of your flight plan!",Final Destination

The thing that really makes this saga unique is the antagonist; death itself. The movies show us that anything can happen to you, anytime, anywhere, or caused by anything. Alex in particular is the most interesting character to me because after his premonition, he was the one who seemed the most frightened out of the five visionary's. Devon's acting was absolutely spot on.",Final Destination

259,HawkHerald,How did this thing spawn an entire movie franchise?,2,27 March 2012,"This is a really bad pseudo-horror film that would almost fit better into the disaster movie genre. A high school senior, Alex Browning (Devon Sawa), has a violent premonition while sitting on a plane waiting for departure for his senior class trip to Paris. He causes a commotion that gets him, several students and a teacher to be kicked off the plane. After leaving and while watching the departure, there's a disastrous mechanical failure and the plane explodes killing all aboard. The passengers who were kicked off are interviewed by the FBI, who're particularly interested in Alex because of his foreknowledge of the event and is treated as a suspect. And after all that the film goes into overdrive with this vague specter going around causing accidents that kill the survivors in grotesque (and unintentionally funny) ways. Alex learns from a creepy mortician named William Bludsworth (Tony Todd in his best Candyman face and voice) that he somehow cheated Death's design and its correcting this by doing away with the people who walked away from the plane disaster. Alex becomes determined to stop it.Give the writer some credit for a semi-original idea in having Death itself kill a bunch of stupid teens rather than a masked psycho with butcher's tools but the execution is pure B-movie slasher and the acting is as bad as a high school play especially from Devon Sawa. The movie is gratuitous crap but somehow made enough money and is cult classic enough to have FIVE SEQUELS!",Final Destination
260,mkm-hermanjnr,Delightfully cheesy horror that plays cliches for effect and fun rather than disappointment,8,24 November 2020,"I'm usually the first to cringe at awful teen-slasher horror cliches, or cheesy plot elements in horror movies. Films like Netflix's The Open House are everything wrong with the horror genre. In general, I can't stand dumb horror movies.Why, then, am I for some insane reason giving Final Destination an 8/10 score? I mean, it's your average dumb teen horror film right?Well, right *and* wrong.Somehow Final Destination is able to take some cheesy overacting, all the tired old teen horror cliches, all the same bland teen horror archetypes and blend them all into a surprisingly interesting and entertaining movie that feels like it's greater than the sum of it's parts. It does this in a way that feels similar to ""The Cabin in the Woods"".A good part of why the movie manages to elevate it's material above the norm is the tone.The film doesn't shy away from more adult content - swearing, gore, genuinely disturbing scenes...yet at the same time the acting is kind of melodramatic and the script plays everything over-the-top. Foreboding is layered on so thick that it actually becomes weirdly comical and makes the film better than it would be if everything was played straight and serious.""Have fun, Alex. You have your *WHOLE LIFE AHEAD OF YOU*."" Says the father character to our protagonist in his opening scene, voice inexplicably dripping with sinister, menacing dread. It's cheesy and makes no sense, but having such a lack of subtlety in the foreshadowing is weirdly refreshing. It feels like the film is good-naturedly laughing at it's own premise and it's a joke the audience can laugh along with.Another stand-out that highlights the strength the movie has dabbling in the absurd is the creepy mortician character, played really well by Tony Todd. Todd's performance is so outrageously, ridiculously hammy that somehow he owns it and becomes very entertaining. He comes out of nowhere and is not so much weird as ""bizarrely diabolical. The script offers absolutely no explanation as to why he speaks and acts in such an ominous manner and that makes it all the better.Another pleasant surprise is that the characters are written well enough to be likeable. Yes, they are cheesy stock characters, but they have some heart and intrigue to them. Even the obnoxious stock ""jock"" character becomes humbled over the course of the film and begins to become sympathetic, something which most horror films wouldn't bother with. The loss of the protagonist's best friend is actually pretty affecting, since the scene featuring his speech on death is surprisingly eloquent and heartfelt.Finally the film shows unusual inventiveness with it's premise - that Death is stalking the survivors of a terrible accident and actively conspiring to kill them. Not only is it a creepy concept, but scenes where our protagonist goes out of his way to obsessively ""Death-proof"" his entire life are very entertaining and novel. Again, the film also subverts the usual ""budget horror"" dross by offering some surprisingly sincere commentary about the inevitability of death and how unfair life can be.Perhaps the only element I didn't like was the ""FBI investigators suspect the main character"" cliche. It's the one stock scenario the film doesn't manage to turn into black comedy or play off of, instead it feels like an unnecessary distraction from the over-the-top horror. Our protagonist also doesn't really do anything to justify the extreme suspicion they show towards him, so it comes across as a bit irritating.In summary; you're sitting around on a slow Saturday night with a pizza and some friends. You want something cheesy enough to laugh at but good enough to actually be genuinely entertaining. Final Destination is *that* movie. And who knows, it might just surprise you!",Final Destination

Everyone who survived is about to pay the price because the grim reaper is an intractable enemy. Think of death here like The Terminator, or the unstoppable Borg from Star Trek, but with a malicious sense of humor.Seeing Final Destination was one of the greatest movie-going experiences of my life. If they had been charging $100 a ticket, the price of admission would have been worth it. Movies like this should remind us all that waiting until a movie comes out on video is a poor decision. Almost invariably, the impact of seeing a movie is severely diminished on the TV screen (I don't care if you have a 70-inch plasma; nothing substitutes for seeing a movie in the theatre. When I saw Dawn of the Dead in the theatre, my heart was racing all night, and for the first time ever, I locked my bedroom door. When I watched it again on video.....zilch, nada.)The script has plenty of clever twists and turns. The writing, editing, and cinematography are absolutely brilliant.

No person to blame, nobody to see and NO IDEA HOW THAT PERSON WILL DIE.  That's about the simple horror of Final Destination, and it was done in almost artistic ways.While many movie-makers have been unwilling or unable to get into the meat & potatoes behind a good R-rated movie, the creators of Final Destination have no such restraint.  In fact, the death scenes were so freakishly violent and intricate that they were interesting in and of themselves.  Imagine the force of death (not the Grim Reaper, but the ""phenomenon of accidents"", if you will) being MAJORLY p***ed for having missed a few.  Hence the plot.To make matters worse, the director displayed ""the little things"" hyper-accurately.  That alone made watching it really hard at times without wincing, flinching or screaming out loud.

They don't make them like this too often.Don't get me wrong, I'm sure if you were looking for flaws you could find them (no movie is perfect), but I wasn't and enjoyed my ride thoroughly as a result.

No character's development, no exploration in the nature of death, ridiculous 'sinister' episodes like that in the morgue or the 'paranatural' elements in death's 'revenge' - the film doesn't top the level of its boring teen protagonists.

I was on the edge of my seat the whole time. This movie is everything what ""Scream 3"" wanted to be. Not as smart as ""Scream"", but just as scary. Sometimes even scarier. The way they die is fun and refreshing. Of course, there is nothing to laugh about. But director James Wong (in a surprisingly relaxed debut) makes each frightening scene long-lasting and breathtaking. He makes an enourmously entertaining movie out of a tiny budget. The killing scenes are shocking. One of the characters is disposed off so quickly that your heart just stops. Another one upsets a computer. Another one teases us with the way he would die: slit his throat, electrocute himself. He dies in a horrifying way, completely different than what expected.The scene is gut-wrenching, just by looking into his blood-shot eyes. Finally, the last one is beheaded. The sequence is almost as good as ""Sleepy Hollow""'s decapitations, which means it is fantastic. I just love the way the guy stood there without a head on his shoulders. There are also some drawbacks but they are so insignificant that they do not ruin the movie in any way. The use of the same idea with small variations. Alcohol burns, and so does turpentine. I wish that the initial plane explosion would have been grander. Lastly, the end is a bit of a let-down. After a very dynamic middle, the end feels weak. I heard that this was not the original ending. I hope that the other one was more upbeat.
But being a horror movie fan, I am very satisfied with the ""Final Destination"". 8/10.",Final Destination
265,c-conley90,The Beginning of a Franchise,8,21 October 2014,"Final Destination began out as rather thrilling Scream clone in the late 90s. It just seems like a Scream clone, all the actors are pretty boys and girls from the WB like Urban Legend, Cursed, Dracula 2000, all those Scream sequels. But there is a level of intelligence involve in this, instead of another masked killer, we have a force of nature. A thing that can't be seen that comes calling to take teens to the grave. Death. A force more powerful that a psychotic killer or even Dracula. That marks a difference from many other of it's Scream-like brethren. It's more original, and it spends more time talking philosophy with teens about Death and fate then the other entries in this franchise did. The series honestly became more of a slasher as it went along, which is OK, but certainly lost some of the great aspects of the first one. It's also ironic that this is the least gory one of the series, though still squirm worthy and horrific in it's deaths.",Final Destination
266,RueMorgue,Don't watch if you are getting on an airplane any time soon!,5,11 May 2001,"This ""horror film"" tries a bit too hard, but is fairly entertaining at the same time.  It's certainly no Exorcist, but then again, I don't think that movie will ever be topped as far as the fear/intensity level is concerned.Sitting in a plane waiting for takeoff for a school vacation, Alex (Devon Sawa) has a vision that the plane will explode shortly after takeoff.  He goes nuts, he and some of his friends (and one teacher/chaperone) get kicked off the plane, and lo and behold, it explodes shortly after takeoff.  Amidst suspicion, Alex watches as his friends are picked off one by one by the force that had intended to kill them all on the plane, if not for their untimely escape.This one gets some points for special effects (the plane crash ""vision"" at the beginning is superb!) and gore, but loses points for storyline.  This is just too contrived, and predictable.  It's the old ""we were supposed to die but we didn't and now it's coming back to finish us off"" theme.  I found that waiting to see who was going to die next, and in what fashion, was the most entertaining thing about this film.  Some of the methods, while nothing new, are portrayed quite well with the use of special effects.This is obviously an attempt to cash in on the recent return of teen-slasher flicks, with a slightly new angle.  Over all, it's not too bad, but it could have been a little better in the storyline department.  It's a cast of unknowns, too, so don't expect any Academy Award winning performances here.My Rating:  5/10",Final Destination
267,sumana-m21,Death by Design!,7,24 January 2010,"I loved the idea of ""Death by design"". It brings out the necessary fear in each one of us if we were to believe that we were all somehow interconnected, sitting on this chain of destruction awaiting us. Yet in this movie this interconnected web is a small group of friends who have happened to have escaped death the very first time around.Although the whole plot gets way too unrealistic towards the end, it still manages to capture your mind and keep you guessing what's next and where this is heading.Nobody knows why they are born and where they will go after death or even when they will die etc. Many questions lie unanswered by science only to suggest the idea or even the very notion of - if or whether someone can predict death/destruction coming towards someone or themselves.Its not a great movie, if you like horror or thriller too much you may not enjoy this one, it just taunts your mind with sculpted ideas.6.5/10, acting wasn't good, ending was boring and a little cheesy. Good for a Saturday afternoon flick!",Final Destination

269,swowen-84128,Start of the Final Destination Series,8,19 May 2020,"So 20 years ago today, May 19th 2000 this movie was first aired in UK cinemas. It began the start of the Final destination series of movies that would last 11 years.
In this movie Alex Browning (played by Devon Sawa), is just your standard teenager that goes to Mt. Abraham High School in New York. The school has arranged a field trip to Paris for students and teachers. Alex is going, but the night before the flight from JFK, he is having trouble sleeping. All the students and teachers arrive in plenty of time to catch the Volee Airlines Boeing 747 Flight 180 to Charles De Gaulle, Paris. Alex seems to be a little worried about the flight, he become agitated on the walkway to board the plane. He eventually boards and finds his seat, but Christa (played by Lisa Marie Caruk) and Blake (played by Christine Chatelain) ask him to move seats, so they are able to sit together. Alex does move to allow the girls to sit together, he moves next to his best friend Tod Waggner (played by Chad Donella). When Alex sits down, he has a real to life experience of the plane taking off, circling NYC and then the plane has problems and it starts to tear up and eventually explodes, midair. Suddenly Alex comes around, it was all in his head! He'd been spooked! This then makes Alex want to leave the plane. He becomes involved in a scuffle with Carter Horton (played by Kerr Smith) and both get removed from the plane, along with Carter's girlfriend Terry Chaney (played by Amanda Detmer), late arrival Billy Hitchcock (played by Seann William Scott), best friend Tod, Valerie Lewton (played by Kristen Cloke), who is one of the teachers on board, and Clear Rivers (played by Ali Larter) just decides to leave. They are not allowed to re-board the plane. The plane takes off and......
I do like this movie's concept, i thought the actors, the plot and the screenplay were very good. The producers and directors have done really well with the ""Easter Egg"" clever bits within the movie, you just have to be focused and switched on to see them.",Final Destination
270,Hypercentury,This movie ROCKS!!,10,29 June 2000,"I compare it to Scream, it was actually even better. The plot is completely different. It's not about a serial killer the killer is supposed to be death. That sounds  a little bit silly but it's not. The whole story is about accidents, an accident in which some persons had to die and they didn't. But ""you can't cheat death""!. The first scene is completely exciting and the last is surprising (as in every new horror movie). There were plenty of laughs and chills. I don't want to describe any of the scenes, just go on and watch this movie, It is action, it is thriller, and most of all, it is horror. It rocks! 10/10",Final Destination
271,maxwellsham,I enjoyed this even though I shouldn't have,6,5 April 2001,It is not a film its a movie but It could have been much worse. They kept the plot moving really fast and fairly slick also. They sort of keep surprising you almost to much so that by the end you know whats going to happen. Strange little idea and it really is as good as you could get after Scream and I know... etc. Its been killed this teen horror thing and this was a little better done. If you want to enjoy this movie then expect the worst and laugh your ass off at how stupid some of the situations are. I give it a 6 but still worth a watch. Somehow?,Final Destination
272,sebijin,"I ended up enjoying Final Destination 1, even though the series gets derivative after a while.",8,9 August 2017,"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7-w8NjxzWcI started a series called ""RECAP"" on YouTube where I recap and review movies, anime, TV shows and more. I'm going through the Final Destination series as the first movie franchise and it's been interesting going back and watching these films again after so many years. I know they're older, but I'm interested in hearing other people's thoughts about them as well. I ended up enjoying Final Destination 1, even though the series gets derivative after a while. In terms of a premise for a film, Final Destination was the first of its kind. It's execution in discussing premonitions and death's design is really well fleshed out. We get tons of disturbing, but amazing death scenes, and the rest of the franchise pretty much does the same. As we continue to take a look at the rest of the franchise though, we will start to notice that these things that made the movie unique, ended up creating a ton of clichés. This could be for better or for worse.To say that Final Destination is a horror film is a bit of a stretch, though it definitely has a few moments where you can feel uneasy and the gore is very apparent when it's main attraction is death. I would have to say though that this movie is more of a laugh fest at times than a horror film, of course, I myself tend to laugh at most horror films anyways, so some of that is just me. The acting surprised me the most. When you think of a movie with teenagers in it, you'll commonly think that it's going to be a bad film and then together with the fact that this is a quote-on-quote horror film, the two don't really mix. But this particular group of actors worked really well together and played each of their stereotypical parts without being overly dramatic. Devon Sawa and Ali Larter to be exact, the actors that played Alex and Clear, both showed emotional attachments to their part. Not to mention the fact, that Tony Todd as a coroner was practically the perfect casting.The cinematography was really well done. Even though the foreshadowing was pushed in our face every few minutes, at least it was done with some really neat shots with tons of close ups. What made the deaths particularly interesting, was the fact that some of these close up shots didn't have a thing to do with the actual death, so we actually had to guess what would end up being the final straw that broke the camel's back. James Wong, the director and lead screenwriter of the film did an excellent job with this one. You could say that that's not too surprising, since he's also worked on The X-Files series. But he also did Dragonball Evolution...For a movie that's now almost 18 years old, I must say, Final Destination is still worth watching. It's ironically good at times and for the most part, it's a pretty good film in general. I find myself enjoying it through and through. If you can get past the teenage stereotypes and the sometimes goofy and impossible deaths – this is the movie for you.",Final Destination
273,worldsofdarkblue,Very Twilight Zoney (at the start),5,14 April 2007,"Terrific beginning, kind of like the best twilight zone ever for the first half-hour. Then again, the twilight zone stories were so good because they were so tight, giving all the story and nuance that could possibly be injected into 22 minutes of film. I began to tire of this movie right around the time it would have wrapped up as an episode of that legendary anthology gram. The rest of the way is just watching to see what contrivance? will kill the kids in what fashion? and in what sequence? So, very entertaining start but not enough stimulation to the intellect after the kids leave the airport",Final Destination
274,BrianCTyler,An original and scary film,8,9 August 2006,"FINAL DESTINATION (2000)starring: Devon Sawa, Ali Larter, Kerr Smith, and Kristen Clokeplot: Alex Browning (Devon Sawa) is one of many students boarding Flight 180 to Paris for their senior trip. He can not seem to shake his fear of flying, and for good reason. Alex has a premonition of the plane exploding and ends up getting himself, five other students, and a teacher kicked off. To their horror, the plane explodes on take off. But Alex does not feel as if it is all over. Soon after, the survivors begin dying in freak accidents in the order they were meant to die on the plane.my thoughts: During a time when every horror film involved a masked killer targeting 25 year old teenagers while a virgin tries to discover his/her identity, FINAL DESTINATION was desperately needed by us horror fans.This is a scary and original teen slasher. It has a great scary premise that really makes you think, great performances from all, a creepy music score, some pretty gory death scenes, and a cameo from Tony ""Candyman"" Todd. Devon Sawa is perfect as the teenager with a gift for seeing into the future. He goes through every emotion perfectly and portrays a very layered character. Ali Larter is also pretty good as the lonely girl who feels what Alex sees. She was interesting in a way where you didn't really get to know what was up with her until towards the end, and her relationship with Alex is interesting.Kerr Smith played a jerk off jock perfectly and made me really hate his character. Kristen Cloke is pretty good as the teacher-turned paranoid mess. Sean William Scott is great comic relief. And Tony Todd, Amanda Detmer, and Chad E. Donnella do good with their small roles.However, I highly disliked Daniel Roebuck and Roger Guenveur Smith as the detectives that get in the way. They were annoying, pointless characters that just get in the way of an otherwise great horror movie.This film also spawned two fun sequels and I do not see why it didn't skyrocket Devon Sawa's career.",Final Destination
275,a05102267,Uninteresting,1,22 July 2010,"I never understood what was the big deal with this movie. Some friends made me watch this, promising me that it was something like ""The future of slasher"" films, but what I saw was a crummy, boring and flat film, full of clichés and incredibly predictable plot ""twists"". (I could see the ending coming from the very first minutes) ""Final Destination"" is just another, typical slasher film, made for commercial reasons. Not that I have something against that, butI guess that this film is not my cup of tea. This is supposed to be entertaining. And yet, I found it to be pretty boring and flat. I would say that is even a bland film, despite all the violence. I wasn't entertained at all by this film. I found it to be the kind of film to someone forgets just after seeing it. I found this dull and uninspired. (And uninspiring as well) No wonder why that horrible ""Dragonball"" film was a flop, if it was directed by the same guy who was behind this drivel.",Final Destination

A flight-phobic teenager (Devon Sawa) begins having premonitions and insights to a pattern in the way death comes to individuals. As he begins to predict who among his acquaintances will die next, he and his friends try to intervene to break the pattern. It is a captivating concept, and the grisly deaths and disasters are spectacularly portrayed. Credibility is strained with some of the characters and their reactions, and this is a serious flaw in what otherwise is an intriguing story. Apparently, it was successful enough to spawn a sequel (Final Destination 2, 2003). All in all, it is well worth the watch.",Final Destination
277,ralphgillis,1 Hour And 38 Minutes Of Pure Entertainment,6,5 September 2021,"5 September 2000I missed this movie when it was in the cinema. I didn't have enough time to go see it because it came out a couple weeks before the end of the school term. Thankfully now that I have a copy of the DVD I can watch it and overall it's actually pretty good.It portrays itself as a horror movie with some teens dying one after the other but it's smarter than that because it comes up with an interesting premise that will grip you. Originality barely exists in this specific genre of horror but this movie has that and owns it.Alex (Devon Sawa) is a young adult who can anticipate the deaths of others before it actually occurs. When his class take a trip to France, he has a premonition of the plane crashing. He quickly gets off the plane with the teacher and a few other students. Whilst everyone else is on board, the plane takes off but a few seconds after, the plane crashes. The students who left the plane just in time were supposed to die, they cheated death but not for long. A pattern is discovered showing the order in which the students will die.The deaths in this movie can be very brutal and are taken very seriously. The viewer wants to protect Alex from being accused of the murders by the police. The story is entertaining, there is not a second to lose, it's fast paced and keeps you attentive.I really enjoyed the movie, the performances were good and the high energy of the movie was present throughout it's entire runtime. It definitely stands out in the teen horror movie genre for taking chances in presenting the audience a well thought out plot. It's a good summer movie. It's a popcorn movie though and there's nothing wrong with that because it's a good one and that's why it's getting a good audience and critical reception. I recommend Final Destination.",Final Destination

280,VincentBauer,A Very good Mediocre Horror Movie that is clever.,7,27 April 2006,"Final destination is a very unique horror movie that differs from the others. The reason? You cannot see the killer. In fact the killer isn't an he or she, but rather an ""it."" Not even a monster. It is Death itself. While it lacks good acting, (they may make it look real but you can tell some fake it and the only GOOD actor is Tony Todd.) Final Destination starts off with Alex Browning. Your regular guy at a regular school with regular friends and a regular life. He is taking a class trip to France with his best friends Tod Waggner and his brother George. Along with them are The Jock/jerk Carter Horton and his girlfriend Terry Cheney. The Teacher Valerie Lewton, and the funny guy but with no friends kid Billy Hitchcock and the lonely orphan girl at the school Clear Rivers.Pre-boarding Flight ""180"" Alex sees on his flight board that his flight has been ""Terminated"" weird enough he goes on and sits down. He then takes a break at the bathroom and hears ""Rocky Mountain High"" by John Denver who happened to die in a plane crash.Still a little shaken by the thought Alex boards the plane and sits down. And the plane takes off. At first it seems like a normal ride but then the turbulence builds and all of sudden the masks come down and taking one section of the plane out finally blowing it up into Alex's face.And he wakes up. It was a premonition. Alex goes and has a freak attack and gets Tod, Carter, Billy, Terry, and Clear kicked off while George stays. When they are told that someone must stay with them Mrs. Lewton tells the other teacher to go back. As the arguing continues suddenly the plane does in fact blow up and they are taken by the FBI to be investigated. The agents though happen to be interested in Alex seeming that he was the one that started it all. Though they let him go.A few months later after a memorial service for the victims everyone starts treating Alex like a freak and Tod's father is making him stay away from Alex because he is upset that George died. They all give him crap and the service ends.Later that night while Alex is working at his desk an owl comes by his desk and Alex throws a pencil at it when the newspaper flys to the fan and gets sliced. A piece of paper he happens to read say ""Tod."" Meanwhile over at Tods while inside the bathroom we see a liquid emerge from the toilet and start to slowly make its way towards Tod. Tod slips on the liquid and the falls into the tub with the wire from the curtain around his neck and it strangles him. The liquid get sucked back down into the pipe.Alex comes by later to find him dead having ""commited suicide."" All fingers point to Alex. He and Clear together who think the incident was a little too weird decide to go to the morgue where they meet the mortician William Bludworth (Tony Todd) who seems to know a lot about death. He explains to them how death works. He also points out that Tod was pulling at the wire. He explains that death has a design and that when you cheat death. Death makes a new design to kill those who were supposed to die.Later Clear and Alex sit at a Cafe discussing what they just learned. As he looks to the window he sees a bus go by and then he looks to see that there was no bus. All of a sudden fate brings the group together and Carter starts to give Alex a bad time. Terry sick of it yells at Carter. She tells him that if he doesn't want to stop giving Alex a hard time then he can drop dead. Instantly a second later she is run over by a bus.After this incident they realize that they must try to figure out deaths design and try to stop each other from getting killed.This film is a really unique story that I can see becoming just like the Nightmare and Friday the 13th series. Just have them keep on throwing them at us.The only thing this one lacks (not the other two) is the gore. Otherwise that I can watch this again and again. For a 90 minute horror movie this is one you should see. Enjoy!",Final Destination
281,KrowbOy,The best of the teen slasher films,6,17 March 2000,"The film Final Destination is actually not a teen slasher film in the ways like it does not have a masked killer or a 90210 style cast, what it does have is the extremely talented team of Glenn Morgan and James Wong who did many episodes of The X Files (particularly the chilling ""Home"" episode). The movie Final Destination is a great hart pounding film that explores Death in many ways and is at times a touching movie (especially the first half), a film with the emotion like this one has needs a good actor in the lead role and it has that in actor Devin Sawa (who was also very funny in last years Idle Hands), the only thing about the movie is that the killer IS death and as the tag line says ""you can't cheat death"" so you kinda know there all going to get it in the end and the scene with Tony Todd is kinda hokey but all in all this was one of the best movies of 2000 and IS the best horror movie in a long time (it's way better than Blair Witch Project).

282,mrbishop77,"Ahh ha!! You almost got me, Hollywood.",6,23 October 2000,"So I was watching this movie, thinking what a huge piece of doo do it was, and it decided halfway through to become good up all the way to the end.BUT, let me remind you, we are talking about a pretty boy/girl Hollywood meat grinder movie here.  Every actor is cut out of the hip and now mode, complete with styled messy hair, big boobs, and the knack for overacting and sexual innuendo at the snap of a finger. One can't feel bad that these people get the ax.  They aren't intended to live.  They are intended to supply more meat to the horror money making machine.  So don't start thinking this is the next Citizen Kane or anything (another highly overrated film...so lets find another analogy......I'll let you fill in the blank with your own personal fav.)BUT, the film is fun.  And would classify as a guilty pleasure in my book. I would never watch it again, but I wouldn't say that it was complete garbage.  You've all seen it before with Friday the 13th, Nightmare sequels, Scream, I know who did who last summer, ect..ect..The only dif is that know death gets his turn.  blah blah blah.Oh yeah, The DVD lets you find out when you are gonna die, by answering a bunch of really general questions.

Once aboard the plane, he has a violently disruptive premonition which gets him, five of his classmates including Clear Rivers (played by Ali Larter) and Carter Horton (played by Kerr Smith), and a teacher (played by Kristin Cloke) kicked off the plane. As the students watch the plane depart, they witness the horrifying disaster that proves the deadly premonition true. Now having dodged death once, the terror begins as Fate hunts them down one-by-one. Soon the survivors will discover that you can't cheat death and get away with it...My Review: FINAL DESTINATION is the kind of movie that is so unbelievably suspenseful and intense, that it's hard NOT to shake in your seat. This type of premise for a movie has never been done before, making it officially original. The death scenes are very clever because they show the audience that there are so many ways that the characters could die in their current situation(s), and that is a very big plus. The acting is very good. As the protagonists, Devon Sawa, Ali Larter, and Kerr Smith all play their roles very honestly and naturally. As the detectives, Daniel Roebuck and Roger Guenveur Smith are very stern and realistic, while at the same time being subtly funny. As the supporting characters, Kristin Cloke, Chad Donella, Seann William Scott, and Amanda Detmer all turn in excellent performances. Tony 'The Candyman' Todd makes a surprising cameo as a sinister mortician, whom I believe to be the Grim Reaper in human form. Although his character seems under-written and useless at first, he is actually very important to the story, which you would know if you have seem the movie. All of the characters bring something unique to the film. In fact, there are no weak links in this cast.Being a horror movie, it is inevitable that there will be some 'jump scares'. But, the scares for this movie are different because they are unexpected. Usually, you would have creepy yet obvious music playing as the killer jumps out at the heroine, but not in this movie. The composer (Shirley Walker) was very wise not to score the jump scenes, although her score for the rest of the movie is a masterpiece all on its own.
Director James Wong, as well as the cast and the rest of the productive/creative staff have all done a great job in creating a strong, stylish, and surprisingly intelligent horror thriller that is guaranteed to increase the speed of your heartbeat. You won't look at life (or airplanes) the same way again!",Final Destination
284,shaquanda36,Much potential wasted on gore,3,2 December 2002,"Here is a movie whose premise was one that denoted suspense.  But in the finished product, there was little suspense and a whole lot of graphic death.  I went to this movie hoping to come out of it frightened that death was after me, but I came out of it with the fear that a sequel would be made, and according to this website, one is. Final Destination comes across as an aspiring slasher film with one thing missing: a slasher.  This should be a movie about being hunted by an invisible force, and as such, there should be suspense.  It should be frightening - I should want to yell out to the characters, ""look out, you're about to die!""

287,vladthelad8666,Best of the bunch.,10,5 October 2020,"Final Destination is one of those straight up horror movies, that doesn't really leave any mystery behind it, yet it still manages to be as minimalistic as possible. In a twisted and mangled way, you could say it classifies as a slasher, as the plot of the movie is about Death itself coming to claim teenage lives one by one. It's a much more than that though, as the movie has a very strong lead in the likes of Devon Sawa, who plays Alex Browning, a pretty normal teenager, who has a terrible vision of the plane, which has 40 students and a bunch of teachers from his high school, going down in flames, killing everyone in the process. Managing to get out of the plane with several others, Alex messes up Death's design, giving the Reaper a great reason to come back after them.The whole movie revolves around that vision, as it becomes true, making Alex the odd one in the eyes of his peers, as only the weird girl Claire believes his story. The movie has some pretty great casting, which compliments every character. Pre-Stifler Sean William Scott is in this one, and he is probably the goofiest kid of them all, although his death may be the best in the movie. Kerr Smith is another noticable casting choice, as he plays Carter - the unlikeable jock, with an american muscle car and a hot blonde girlfriend Terry, who happens to have the most unexpected, but still great death scene in the whole movie. Oh, and also Tony Todd is in this. He makes the most of his 5 minutes on screen. Absolute badass.Speaking of the deaths, they are all great, imaginitive and carefully crafted, without much use of CGI, which really helps makes them feel real and impactful, something that will get lost in the sequels (mainly the 4th movie). Death is a creative killer, and is also the only movie of the five, where we get to see the shadow of the Reaper appear in some scenes, something that will not happen in the sequels.Final Destination is great, its the only way to put it. It knows exactly what it is, and it delivers on every level. It's cheeky, entertaining, frightening and it perfectly captures how horror movies will change in the 21st century.",Final Destination
288,dslr88,Entertaining older flick,8,28 April 2020,This has been out a while but its still a great watch. The opening where theyre getting on the passenger jet is quite suspenseful and made me anxious. The deaths were inventive and it was really unique to have fate being the stalker of the story as opposed to some masked faceless bogeyman. I liked it.,Final Destination
289,cutie_mcpretty,Creepy,7,23 February 2008,"I think I made the mistake of watching the final destination films backwards. I saw the third first and then watched the first, because I really enjoyed the third. Either way I didn't enjoy the first as much as I enjoyed the third. The first is the same concept, Kid gets on plane, kid gets premonition, kid freaks out, kid gets in a fight which gets them thrown off the plane, idiot guy who thinks its all stupid and so on. Final destination is quite slow paced as well. It has to explain the premonition and the clues and why this is all happening and stuff, which I think even if I hadn't seen the third, I would have understood without all the talking. The deaths were no where near as gruesome as I expected either. They seemed quite simple, but that shouldn't be thought too much about, I mean this was the first film, they were exploring what they could do. Some scenes are very well done though. One scene that stands out for me is a scene when Carter's car is on the tracks and a train is coming right for it. That scene is incredibly tense, and I honestly was almost standing up screaming at the T.V for him to get out of the car. Another thing about this film that is good, is that it's unpredictable. I had no idea when some deaths were going to occur, which made it a lot more creepy. This film played on my mind a lot more than the third, because in this one things happen for no reason, such as water leaking out of the toilet, there was no reason for that to happen, but in the third it's more in stages, such as temperature turned up in room caused the fan to come on which caused the palm tree to fall over which caused the CD rack to fall and so on. I do think that most people would love this film, because even though it is slow the acting is good, it's tense, very unpredictable and a lot scarier than the third. I must say that I love the third film, and was slightly disappointed when I watched th first, but I still love the final destination series. It's definitely worth the watch, especially if you have seen the others, because for one you will understand the others a lot more.",Final Destination
290,TomPaine-3,Gives us something to think about,8,21 May 2000,"Normally, I'm not spooked by a film but this movie sure as hell gave me the chills. 'Final Destination' was a taut, sharp and intelligent piece of horror, not reliant on that many gore effects for shocks. Indeed the films horror was based on a good use of suspense rather than out-and-out gore. I've got to admit, some deaths came out of nowhere and those who did die, died in less obvious ways than you may have thought of.It gave us mere mortals something to think about too, in that (a)I'm not flying again for a long time and (b) death is not an accident but is planned so that when your time comes, you can do absolutely nothing about it. You can only cheat death temporarily. It'll get you in the end, by any means necessary no matter what plans you have made to avoid it. Morbid to be honest, but entirely true.The downside to this movie was the confusing explanation of how the pattern of 'Death' was explained. It lost me. Can someone explain. It seems as though the writers became stuck for an explanation as to how 'Death' moved from victim to victim and thought hey this'll do for now.This is only a minor quibble about a very good movie. I haven't seen an intelligent horror film like this since. Well, since. Good use of horror movie in-jokes too. I love the use of using surnames of horror directors and actors as character names. Some were obvious (Hitchcock, Lewton), some less so (Waggner, Schreck).Highly recommended but not a date movie.",Final Destination
291,Bsbgirl7,This movie is great!,8,27 June 2004,"This is a really good movie. I had seen the second one before the first one which is probably the stupidest thing to do, however I did it. I liked this one better than the second one however there is one thing. In the ending of the movie, Carter dies, not Alex. So why in the second one is Alex dead? Did he die before the second movie was made? Not in real life of course, I mean before the movie. Anywho thats the only thing that I was a little confused about. I also like how the people died in this one because the first kid who died didn't see death coming, then the second person, the girl didn't see it but as time went on there were signals and such to help them along.",Final Destination
292,BobforTrish,"First Final, Forgettable,Four Following?",4,2 August 2014,"Final Destination can safely be described as a 'teen horror' largely peopled by and clearly aimed at teenagers. The plot, such as it is, concerns Alex Browning (played by Devon Sawa) who is preparing for a school trip to Paris, France. His premonition of imminent disaster leads to him and several other characters leaving the subsequently doomed flight. However, 'Death' will not be cheated so easily...The first act of this film leading up to and including the destruction of Flight 180 leads us to believe that we are watching a horror film with serious intent. Whilst there are comic vignettes being played out in typical teen fashion there is an underlying build up of tension.Unfortunately for this viewer at least, as soon as the characters are delineated and plot development clearly laid out, any serious intent is drowned out by an over-clever reliance on the formulaic filmmaking which has become the norm with this genre. Lead - or rather, 'stock' - characters other than our hero include the obligatory quirky girl Clear Rivers (Ali Larter), tough guy Carter Horton (Kerr Smith chewing up the scenery), his trampish girl Terry Chaney (Amanda Detmer), the hero's best friend Tod Waggner (Chad Donella), Billy Hitchcock (Sean William Scott) and teacher Valerie Lewton (Kristen Cloke). We can gain virtually no satisfaction at this point in working out the survival rate and the order of demise. Minor, yet somehow more interesting roles are given to Tony Todd as mortician Bludworth (a wasted part seemingly used simply to explain what is going on), and Daniel Roebuck alongside Roger Guenveur Smith as FBI Agents Weine and Schreck respectively, nicely bouncing off each other. Death's modus operandi veers between extremely complicated with lots of red herrings along the way (Tod's suicidal tendencies giving way to an eventual accidental hanging; Mrs. Lewton and a bizarre combination of steam, gas, electricity, alcohol, fire and kitchen knives), to the dramatic take-your-breath away split-second splattering moment (both Terry and Billy).Unfortunately this is not enough to sustain our interest for what seems an overlong hour and a half. Clunky dialogue, predictable turns (particularly the 'twist' ending) and a story that (despite other reviewers - probably much younger than myself - claiming otherwise)is hardly original in concept leaves us with a finished product which whilst not being 'bad' simply does not rise above the dross that makes up the vast majority of this genre. for this we have to blame director and co-writer James Wong along with his writing cohorts Glen Morgan and Jeffrey Reddick. The overuse of foreshadowing along with too many visual references - '180' pops up again and again which would be fine if the film were released under the working title of Flight 180 - in-jokes like naming characters after famous horror stars and directors; and an obsession with people sitting on toilet seats all indicate the fun the makers were having. All of which simply detracts from the point of the exercise. Background music courtesy of Adam Hamilton and Shirley Walker could best be described as a cross between forgettable and bland but fortunately remains firmly in the background.The estimated budget for this film was $23 million, most of which, judging by the credits, went on special effects which were actually fairly impressive. Unfortunately special effects alone seldom make great movies. Up to this time, this film has spawned three sequels and a prequel. It is to be hoped by this reviewer at least, that they are improvements on the original...",Final Destination

Oh my gosh was I missing out!tl The graphics on all the death scenes are really cool, and the story is easy to follow and believable. It doesn't fall into that boring category where it's super predictable and unrealistic. And it wasn't too graphic either, I could see myself watching this in Middle School and not getting nightmares the way I got when they watched Saw for the first time.

Otherwise, it is a fairly standard teen splatter-fest, with a really lame ending.

Alex realises that death is killing his friends in order that they were meant to die on the plane.let me start of by saying final destination 1 was 100% the best film of the franchise, simply because it was the best acted and it was something new that no one has heard of before.final destination wasn't a master piece but brings new standards to the table. i wouldn't say this film was scary in any way shape or form. but for people who are watching it for the first time they will be surprised and final destination isn't predictable as the other 4 movies are.the end has a good twist after the last 3 survivors thought they cheated death, but really death is just getting started so ends on a cliff hanger waiting to know if all 3 survived the accident that happened at the end of final destination.overall i would recommend this to anyone who is looking for something new in a horror movie. final destination has great twists with good acting and a fantastic plot that me even the horror fan that i am couldn't think of this. a well deserved 8/10",Final Destination
297,omniscient0001,About a serious error,6,7 December 2018,"The movie is thrilling and totally great. But I think, the concept has an error. Alex did cheat death at first time when he saw they were dying and later prevented that. He could survive because he knew about the future. But after that, when it was time for his friends, he didn't see anything though and prevented their deaths anyway. Like one of his friend was stuck in the train line, they rescued him and boom! He successfully cheated death. As far as I know, that's not how things work.",Final Destination
298,Stenian,"Interesting concept, but instead relied on body count",4,10 January 2021,"I thought the film had an interesting idea. The construct of cheating death is very interesting me and to many. But this film instead relied on violence, body count and cheap thrills to make its point. I would've preferred if this were a dramatic mystery thriller in the likes of Jacob's Ladder (1990). But hey, at that time, slashers were fashionable. So I don't really blame the writers.What was up with Carter? My god, was he annoying. Always mad and angry, but for no reason. Devon Sawa and Ali Larter were the only decent things in this film, with their great performance. I did enjoy Sawa's character, Alex, being all investigative. We needed more of that and less characters getting killed in over the top ways, just for the sake of getting killed that way. I mean, was I supposed to be excited during the scene where a guy gets garrotted to death in a bathtub by a wire? That was just totally unjustified and disturbing (and I've seen even more brutal stuff).It seems like Death in the film was personified. I did not really like that. There wasn't much explanation on its personification, nor was there any reason for it. The opening scene, with all the characters introduced, and the airplane crash was really entertaining to watch. And, as said, I did enjoy Alex investigative and inquisitive nature. I would've preferred if this were a film with just him and Clear Rivers, who are chased by death and are racing against time to save their own lives. Think, something like The Ring (2002). But nah, instead they made this more in the likes of Halloween and Scream.",Final Destination

It isn't a scary movie, although some girls may find it scary, the guys will have to look at it from a different perspective.  It is more a thriller with an original story line.  Than a p**s-your-pants type movie!The starting sequence would have to be one of the best in the movies, then the movie keeps a steady pace until the end, the end is very good, as good if not better than the starting one.  It leaves your imagination to come up with what happens next. The death scenes were somewhat predictable but a lot of little tricks were put in.(SPOILER) Like in the bathroom, it makes it look like he's gonna cut himself then like he's gonna electrocute himself, when finally he's hanged.Overall the movie was quite good and the acting was alright but the plot was very good.  Don't listen to what anyone says before you see it, cause if you go in the movie thinking it's gonna be crap, it will be crap.  So go in with no opinion and come out with one of your own.I give this movie 8.5/10",Final Destination
300,Æthelred,"Great beginning, then fizzles out",4,16 April 2000,"[WARNING:  CONTAINS SPOILERS]You shouldn't be reading this unless you've already seen the movie, so I won't rehearse the plot (both puns intended).  Here are my comments:The plane-explosion scene is very scary.  It's frightening to think that people might actually experience something similar in a real mid-air disaster.  That's by far the film's highlight--it's very well done.So here's why I gave ""Final Destination"" a 4.The plot is shallow.  Death wants revenge against the survivors and goes around killing them.  Where's the suspense in that?The plot contains senseless material.  Does Alex notice the effect of ""Rocky Mountain High"" or not?  It seems not, so playing that tune, along with such other clichés as causing candles to be extinguished, wind to blow, lightning to strike, etc., only serves to tell the audience that another killing is nigh.  Talk about lack of subtlety!I agree with a previous comment that it was insensitive to draw so many parallels to the TWA flight 800 crash (high school group, New York-to-Paris flight).  I also think it's kind of racially insensitive to make Death a black guy.But what I really resented is that, as far as I could tell, the movie bowdlerized its own plot and ruined its integrity by failing to resolve the story.  The two main characters are left alive, but with no guarantee that Death has completed his mission.  And this outcome, I believe, must have been a deliberate marketing gimmick (no screenwriter could be that inept). If ""Final Destination"" had done really well, a sequel could have been made to disclose the main characters' fates.It's sad that Hollywood is willing to screw up its movies for commercial considerations, and how oblivious many people seem to be to devices like these.  I have no hope that Hollywood will improve, but what's wrong with the reviewers?  I am amazed at the positive reviews ""Final Destination"" has garnered in presumably discerning places like the New Yorker magazine. Maybe the reviewers have seen too many mediocre films and are critically comatose.  Or perhaps I'm too cynical and/or misunderstood the ending.  But if I didn't, it's a far cry from ""the kicker of an ending [that] leaves the audience with a perfect final scream,"" as the New Yorker capsule review said.",Final Destination

302,flight_180,I'm about to prove that it was ONLY the plane that crashed and burned...,10,21 May 2001,"Final Destination is just one of those movies that in my opinion stands out completely from any other. It's a horror film, yeah, point taken, but it's just so different from all the others like Scream, I know what you did last summer, Halloween etc.You don't actually 'see' 'death' and I think that makes it really special. It makes you think about things, such as fate, and actually freaks you out a lot, as the whole scenario seems quite logical, unlike most other horror movies. It is original, chilling, and extremely entertaining. It doesn't over do it with the special effects either, and this shows that James Wong and Glen Morgan actually put a lot of thought into how to make things look as realistic as possible.The acting in Final Destination is fantastic. The first time I saw this movie I was left thinking what a great actor Devon Sawa is. You could completely empathise with his character, Alex Browning. In fact, all the actors were brilliant. They could really convince you that what was happening to the characters was real, and that was really spooky. The movie has a great ensemble cast, some of which will be instantly recognised from other popular TV shows or films, such as Kerr Smith (Dawson's Creek) Brendan Fehr (Roswell) and Seann. W. Scott (American Pie, Road Trip, Dude Where's My Car)Final Destination is full of action, and the first fifteen minutes really do get you hooked. It's not like most other movies where it gradually builds up to the action, this movie just has short sharp adrenaline pumping blasts of it, and it's great. There are some excellent 'jump' scenes aswell, which immediately re-grab your attention so your mind never wanders.The movie doesn't have much of a soundtrack, but to be quite honest it doesn't really need it. The atmosphere is pulled off fantastically by the eerie musical score composed by Shirley Walker, and totally fits in with the scenes.Some people might say that Final Destination is just over-rated and ridiculous, but I disagree. It is because it goes just far enough to make you believe, and disbelieve it at the same time. The deaths could actually happen in the home or whatever, but for them to happen is a chance in a million. Yet, they could still happen.Okay, Final Destination isn't one of the most famous box-office smash hits in the world like the Matrix or Gladiator, but I don't really care. As far as I'm concerned this movie is just an unsung hero, and people who rate this movie as being 'awful' just don't know how to appreciate a masterpiece.

I bought the video two days after renting it, then watched it every day for about two weeks. Now it's December, and almost a year since I fist saw it (I saw it on Jan 13th 2001)and I'm not really bothered about it now. Yeah, it's ace. But after watching it 42 times, yes, that's right, 42 times, I've kinda got bored. I've written masses of pages of stories about the characters which if you're interested you'll find at http://www.fanfiction.net. They're all supposedly humorous stories so maybe you'll get a cheap laugh out of Tod and Alex spraying Carter with a hose, I dunno.

I read a 12 page treatment of this film (aka ""FLIGHT 180"") two years ago...THAT story was a smart twists-and-turns-who's-doin-it murder/slasher film. They screwed it up!!! Originally, ""Death"" was inhabiting the body of ""someone"" and was killing off the survivors of Flight 180 in the order they would have died on the plane crash (which is similar to the film), and the survivors were trying to figure out who the killer was before they died. BUT it was a very cerebral and interesting story.
""FINAL DESTINATION"" was a poorly written film and an uninteresting movie...I haven't heard such poor dialogue since the last Akiva Goldsman movie...Yeah...you've gotta give it credit for a few shocks and squeamish moments...I mean...any film that that can somehow top Samuel L. Jackson's death scene in ""DEEP BLUE SEA"" has a tiny bit of merit, but the only thing I could think about through the entire film was how much pancake makeup Devon Sawa had on to cover up his acne.

He panics, and gets himself and a few others thrown off the plane. Then, it explodes. This is where it picks up speed. Death starts stalking them, killing them off in what I have to admit are some pretty unique ways.This is not a bad horror flick. It at least has a plot, and isn't just a spectacle showing off new gore effects. The acting is pretty good, but some scenes could be improved. It has plenty of action and plot twists that will keep you on the edge of your seat. The only thing that could be improved really (aside that it's not the world's best idea for a movie, and is sort of corny), would be some of the death scenes could be extended.

308,bobscott,Laughably Bad Horror Film!,2,3 April 2001,"The fact that this film is so popular seems almost as implausible as the incredibly predictable ""moments of suspense"" it contains!Personally, I found it hilariously bad! The acting wasn't as bad as the story, but no amount of Hollywood talent could have made this film worthwhile unless it had been written as a comedy.The film presents Death as so methodical and swift, but so many times that all of the people who walked off the plane before it crashed are grouped together, Death is taking a breather, apparently! I mean, for cryin' out loud! At least 39 days have passed before Death even decides to take care of his unfinished business!As for the ending, I have to wonder if the writers hadn't been watching some Road Runner cartoons as they wrote it! If you've seen it, you'll know what I mean.So many people have praised this film for being original. But in my opinion, it borrows much from ""The Frighteners,"" a horror/comedy from a few years back. If you want to see a film with someone dealing with Death in a decent horror/comedy context, I'd highly recommend watching ""The Frighteners"" instead of ""Final Destination.""I suppose if you want a good ""Mystery Science Theater 3000"" type of laugh-fest, ""Final Destination"" might be the sort of movie for you.

309,TrickyTheHorrorFreak,A decent idea turned into a fantastic horror movie!,9,14 September 2006,"""Final Destination"" caught me completely by surprise. After watching the trailer I figured it to be another typical teenage driven horror movie with little substance or unique qualities to set it apart from the pack. I'm really glad I gave it a go after reading a few good reviews though, as it turned out to be so very much more than that. This is a rare and wonderful case where an at most decent idea is turned into a really fantastic film due to good performances, direction and great scripting.Without giving too much of the story away, let me just say that Alex manages to avoid death under very strange circumstances. In doing so, he also saves the lives of five of his schoolmates as well as his teacher. But when one of those near-victims then dies soon after, Alex starts to fear that perhaps by cheating death, Death itself is coming back to set things straight. Sounds silly right! Well I guess it is, but it works really well in ""Final Destination"" and that's a credit to director James Wong and his cast and crew.When any and every normal item and scenario suddenly becomes an opportunity for Death to end your existence, life itself becomes a terrifying experience. The creators of this movie had a huge amount of fun with the setup, constantly placing obvious dangers in front of the characters only to have them harmlessly pass them by. Over and over you will find yourself thinking ""he's turned the radio on in bathroom, he's gonna get it!"" or ""that gas has been on for far too long for her to light it, this is it for her!"" only to have nothing happen. There are some brilliant scenes in ""Final Destination"" based on this uncertainty and each one finishes with highly creative and often unexpected death scenes.The cast are great and in particular Devon Sawa and Ali Larter in two of the main roles. But everyone plays their part in the scenario successfully except for perhaps Seann William Scott who funnily enough went on to be the most successful actor. He hadn't quite perfected his goof-ball antics at this point and while he's mildly amusing, he far more regularly appears to be quite pathetic and annoying. Tony Todd (of Candyman fame) has an unforgettable cameo which was a nice touch also utilizing a legend of the genre.There's a real sense of fun to proceedings even though death is a rather serious topic and that's due to the creators not taking things too seriously themselves. They are playing with you as an audience and rather than frustrating everyone as could so easily have occurred, you'll find yourself happily going along for the ride. This movie was a complete success and with two sequels already released to both financial reward and fan praise, we may not have seen the final Final Destination just yet.",Final Destination

I fell asleep while I was watching Final Destination. The way the people died was so unreal and boring. Somebody was killed because the fire escape fell at him.Oh, please that was so ridiculous.

Comparisons with the Scream series aren't really appropriate though, as although there are a few moments of black humour in Final Destination, the emphasis is on mystery and suspense. I think the film's strongest point is that it really never lets on exactly where it's going, even at the end. (OK, that could be said of a lot of films, but in Final's case, it's intentional!) It kept me on the edge of my seat more for this reason than for any shock/horror value (although there are a few gory moments, but these don't dominate the film). Probably the most lasting effect the film will have on you is to make you very nervous about getting out of bed in the morning...",Final Destination
313,cbvb,God awful film,2,27 September 2000,"I was utterly prepared to really like this film. A big fan of James Wong from both the X-Files and Space:A&B, this film is a disaster. Disaster is perhaps the wrong word as it seems to play out exactly as the film makers intended it, which I suppose is a different thing than a disaster. I will save you one torture I had to endure throughout the film: there is no twist. If you've seen the trailer, you know exactly what happens in the film! No Sixth Sense, no Usual Suspects, heck, not even an April Fool's Day (check it out for a much better Dead Teenager movie). This was the big disappointment of the movie.This would not have necessarily doomed the movie if it had not been so dreadfully lacking in a sense of humour. In the post-Scream horror era, a dead teenager movie taking it seriously is bound to fail. This is not to say that every dt has to be a spoof now, but some tongue in cheek here and there would have greatly filled out the movie. Or perhaps to have lightened the sledgehammer with which the director drives home every single plot point in the movie...ugh. I wanted to punch this movie in the face by the time it was done.",Final Destination
314,kfurnas,So far this year it sets the standard for thriller movies,7,1 April 2000,"Few thrillers explore just how terrifying death can be. Most are concerned with mysteries, chases and nearly immortal bad guys.""Final Destination,"" however, seems to want to put the entire focus of fright on death itself. Viewers find themselves thinking much more about how they think characters are going to die, and less about why.Such a result can be chiefly attributed to the plot. Devon Sawa plays a high school student set to take a class trip to France. However, before the plane takes off, he envisions its explosion and demands to be removed from the plane. The commotion forces several other passengers off the plane, and, taking off without them, it explodes in mid-air.For the rest of the movie, those who got off the plane are stalked by death itself, who apparently was not amused by being cheated out of several lives.There's little in terms of a story here, and the acting is just sort of blah. But by having no real villain in the film, it frees the death scenes into becoming among the most elaborate productions of any movie. There are no guns, axes or knives (well, almost no knives) that are standard in every other horror flick. Instead, this movie creates death scenes that require complex chains of events.The thought this movie must have taken is amazing  not only to imagine the half-dozen death scenes that are in the movie  but to create circumstances that mislead the viewer into thinking others will occur.Execution helps pull everything together. As elaborate and fast-paced as the action sequences are, the viewer can still figure out how it works because of perfect camera work.The problems with this movie all result from a fruitless effort to make the movie overly intelligent. For example, as Sawa's character tries to figure out how to cheat death again, he breaks in to the mortuary to visit death's first victim after the plane crash. If that weren't ridiculous enough, he is confronted by the mortician who tells him (in a spooky voice) the secret behind death. This scene could (and should) have simply been deleted from the movie.When the movie is not trying to be too intellectual, however, it's terrificly frightening and makes viewers squirm in their seats. So far this year, it sets the standard for thriller movies.",Final Destination

316,harveyrock12,"A top notch thriller , blasted with gore and suspense",8,28 December 2011,"Now i have seen all the final destination movies date and it all comes back to the original which is clearly the best , the others are good but the concept is just too familiar they didn't introduce any new ideas weather as this one was the first , and when theirs a long line of movies , the first one is always the best (e.g) saw, nightmare on elm street, Halloween, Friday the thirteenth , their all the same.Back to the film, after all of that ranting the film in my opinion is still one of the best thrillers to date , however its not scary as such just lots of teenagers getting slaughtered , which is pretty amusing. the plot line is one of the most clever dilemmas seen in recent movies and will leave you on the edge of your seat the entire film from beginning to end. The characters were amazing, theirs a real connection between them and the audience. A master thriller , packed with gore and suspense.8/10",Final Destination
317,MartinPh,"Mildly entertaining, but silly and inconsistent",4,24 October 2005,"The beginning is actually quite good, though not recommended for those with fear of flying. Main character Alex gets a vision of the plane he's in, and that's about to airlift him and his classmates to Paris, exploding. He panics, and together with some of his friends gets kicked off. Of course, the plane then explodes as foreseen. Alex has cheated Death. But as he finds out, this simply means that the survivors are still listed to die, and to be sure, soon enough one after the other gets killed in the gruesome and unlikely ways befitting, I suppose, of this genre. It's up to Alex to figure out Death's rules, and to thwart his plan. That's where things become silly. It is the usual problem in horror movies with supernatural forces: the supernatural world behaves so utterly banal and childish that it stops being scary. Why on earth would Death play a game like this? Logic is obviously thrown overboard entirely. Why would a girl who knows she's next in line to die, go outside in a raging thunderstorm where broken, live power lines are lashing about, to rescue her dog? How do Alex and his chums know so exactly where and how they can get into the morgue at night? Why does Alex repeatedly almost die when sheltering in a wood cabin, and why does the strange wind that presages a death blow through the cabin, even though Alex figures out a minute later that it isn't actually his turn yet? How come the three survivors eventually go on for six months without trouble, even though it turns out they are still scheduled to die? Did Death need a break?? I don't even care to wonder about the psychology of the characters, who are able to deal with one friend's gruesome death after another without shedding a single tear. Worst of all are the obligatory FBI men, who for some strange reason do not arrest a kid who is repeatedly found at the scene of violent deaths, and whose fingerprints are found on a knife sticking in a dead body. They do pick him up when a scared teacher sees him in her front yard, but then - ...just let him go again. Huh? And oh yes, of course: when they finally do decide to arrest him, in the middle of the night in a dark wood, they obviously turn on their sirens and lights, so that he can see and hear them coming a mile away, and has plenty of time to escape. In short: if you are feeling in the mood for something fairly dumb, with an occasional effective scare thrown in, as well as a few cute kids to look at, this will do. If you are looking for intelligent entertainment, look elsewhere.",Final Destination
318,hkpuppy,Stunning beginning,8,13 January 2001,"When i picked up this video from store i was expecting something liked ""scream"" kind of movie, but it turned out to be something much better. The beginning of watching Alex's vision, the looks on their face after seeing the crash, all these really overwhelmed me, I almost stopped breathing during that 20 minutes of beginning. I must say the director is brilliant in influencing the audiences in that sense. Although the plot didn't seem as impressing as the beginning afterward, the ""design"" of death seems to be quite interesting too. So i gave it a eight out of ten.",Final Destination
319,Dr.Teeth,"A good horror film...no wait, I'm serious.",7,30 October 2001,"There's not a whole lot you can say about a film like Final Destination without giving too much away.  So this'll be short and sweet: Watch the movie.  That's all I really need to say, but since I usually say more than I need to, there's more.This movie crushes all other Teen Horror movies made in the past five years. It's refreshing to have a palatable sense of terror and urgency in the horror genre.  Instead of some guy in a fisherman's coat or spooky mask, they're running from Death.  You don't get a much more unconquerable foe than that.  And they didn't go through a whole lot of cheesy special effects to show you a Grim Reaper or Spectre of Death.  Just a change in the wind, a shadow in the background, a shimmer in the mood.  The filmmakers chose to heighten the tension by not showing the audience much, but leaving it up to their imagination to fill in the gaps.  And we all know the human imagination is the scariest thing out there.  Much more scary than a bladed glove or Al Pacino.Film-wise, it's pretty strong.  The acting ranges from ""as expected"" to ""surprisingly good,"" and the story gives enough plot turns to keep you in a state of confused disbelief.  The cinematography is refreshingly original, and is stylish without reeking of pretense.  The point of view shots disorient and clarify simultaneously, and the camera movement is quite slow compared to other contemporary horror films.  The absence of quick cuts and fast-moving camera sweeps is partly why this film is a treat to watch: all the benefits of modern technology without the migrane-inducing MTV style that seems so popular nowadays.  And before people start saying that old people can't understand the fast-paced world that young people live in, let me just say that I'm in my early twenties and I understand exactly the kind of fast-paced world that young people are living in.  I just don't like flash without urgency, which is MTV.  Final Destination is urgency without flash, and that's refreshing.I'm recommending this film to anyone who likes good Horror movies, and to those people who like bad Horror movies.  Perhaps it'll slap the latter group upside the head.  (7/10)",Final Destination
320,draftyrafters,Fly the Friendly Skies,8,27 March 2000,"If you really want to scare someone, don't tell them another ""guy with a hook"" campfire story.  Skip the urban legends and cheesy ghost story fare. Because what really scares people is real life.Go through the list of every possible way to die in any given situation. Mention how easy it is for a plane engine to fail, or a car to break an essential part.  Comment on the plethora of common household items that, if they were to be involved in just the right coincidences, might result in your death.If you really want to scare someone, take them to Final Destination.The lead character, a high schooler named Alex Browning, is waiting on-board an international flight to Paris along with almost 40 of his classmates. During the wait, Alex has a premonition that the plane is going to blow up. He ditches the flight, taking several classmates and a teacher with him in the broil his panic incites.  These precious few have their lives changed when, sure enough, the airplane explodes just after claiming the skies.The premise:  those people were supposed to die, and now Death is simply getting caught up on his list.  This means there is no killer, there is no hockey-masked looney with a rubber knife.  There is a slight breeze, a brief, anamolous shadow, and then, you're dead.The craftsmanship here is excellent.  The deaths are all very disturbing, all very real, and all very brutal, and the effect is nauseatingly refreshing.  We don't see hysterical people running up the stairs to escape a never-tired creep, or jabbing meat thermometers into supernatural critters.  We see a pattern of easily explained, perfectly normal, lethally designed events that not only cause death, but also adapt to the victim's movements.  No matter where they go, death is at their heels, following them in the endless coincidences.  And it's all the more terrifying because it's supposed to happen, and there's no one to fight.  The most any of the characters can hope for is that Alex will predict it and, perhaps, intervene in time.  Needless to say, Alex's track record for saving his friends drops drastically post-plane crash.The acting, though excellent, is a bit forced at points, and there are parts of the movie created solely to pad the film.  A cringe-worthy expository interlude with a cheesy mortician and some repetitive dialogue are the only weak links in the show, however.  The very concept of the flick is so interesting that it laminates all the duller moments.The premise is, of course, self-destructive.  Death can't die so no matter how many times the characters manage to cheat the traps that seem to be laid for them, sooner or later, the chain of events will be set in motion all over again.  It doesn't end until they die.  This type of problem might have crippled most horror movies, but Final Destination cleverly eludes the chance of a weak and long-overdue ending by cashing in on the repetitive ""tag-you're-dead"" quality of the plot.  It ends with the understanding that it hasn't ended.Not for the squeamish of heart, this movie is a landmark in the horror movie genre.  Although it's not going to win any Oscars anytime soon, this well-timed and moodily constructed film does exactly what movies are intended to do: it entertains.  It reveals the possibility that villains are all well and good, but the true horror lies in real death, in a murderer that exists in every inanimate object you come across.Oooh.  Scary, huh?",Final Destination

323,bendy392,There is no escaping comedic death.,5,16 October 2014,"Final Destination, the first of one of the most popular horror franchises ever. The series of course, is well known for its own sense of how an everyday item or circumstance can kill you at anytime in a freak accident and most of all, it made lots'o money. With such a really creative concept, does this movie work? Well here's the story.Alex Browning, played by Devon Sawa, is about to board a plane along with his classmates on a field trip to Paris. Alex then has a vision that the plane is going to explode. He panics and gets off the plane, along with several other people. And as the plane departs, it really does explode. Everyone's traumatized and tries to move on from it, but it appears that they were all meant to die on the plane, so Death itself comes after the survivors one by one.While it's a first that a slasher like Freddy or Jason is chasing dumb teenagers, I will say it's an interesting concept. The teens, however, fall for the same things as they would in slasher flicks. The two main leads are the only ones who are aware of it while the others are either jerks or just don't care about it. But the fact that a supernatural force after them is interesting enough. Plus, I do like the creepy imagery they use which is to be used to be clues to how they'll die.So, does the movie entirely work? Ehhhnnnnot really. The biggest problem with the movie is that some of the deaths are too comedic. The more drawn out they are, the less believable it is. The most simplistic one is a bus hitting someone, but even then, that was a little too silly. What makes it funny is that it comes right the hell out of nowhere and just smashes into her like a slapstick Tom & Jerry joke. See, if there was buildup to that, like say she tried to get out of the way or someone yelled at her to get away, but ultimately gets hit, it would've worked better. Not a whole lot better, just less unintentionally funny. Even the first death is too much of a stretch. Water leaks in the bathroom, causing someone to trip and have the clothes wire to be wrapped around his neck and it tightens and tightens until he dies of asphyxiation. See, that's just too hard to believe, but say if the water caused him to trip and hit his head on the bathtub, that'd be more believable; you don't need to have anything to be wrapped around his neck. Also, I'm not an expert at trains at anything but they do have BRAKE SYSTEMS, DON'T THEY?!?So, yeah. The deaths are mediocre for the most part. How are the characters? As I mentioned before, they're your two-bit slasher teens. They're not that interesting because we've seen them before many times. The jock jerk that refuses to listen, the comic relief who cracks jokes just to create his own ""identity"", the adults won't catch on. The main character is pretty likable though. I do like how desperate he is in trying to figure out the whole thing before it's too late. I think the only interesting character was the mortician, played by Tony Todd. He's just so mysterious and dark; you can pretty much imply that he is either Death or an associate of Death.So with all this, I don't think it's a terrible flick. I just think it could've been done a lot better. Like I said, it's a very well done concept. It's just too silly at times. It's sort of like watching a montage of Mortal Kombat Fatalities, just with an actual story. So if you're a fan of that sort of thing, than I say give it a view and you'll love it. I'll see you soon",Final Destination

325,burbank904416010,Top-notch horror,9,20 April 2000,"I managed to see FINAL DESTINATION on a recent trip to America and I had high expectations as I had heard the premise and I was intrigued by the possibility of a horror film with an enemy that was impossible escaping from, Death. The film starts with a cracking opener. Alex Browning is (Sawa) about to take a flight to Paris with his school. He has an horrific premonition where the plane explodes mid-air, killing everyone on board. He then wakes and is desperate to get off. Him and a couple of others, including a teacher, get thrown off the plane. As they are waiting at the airport they witness what Alex feared would come true. Soon after this, they soon start dying in mysterious and gruesome circumstances. The death scenes are highly inventive and much more violent than anything SCREAM or URBAN LEGEND could come up with. The film lets you down in one respect as you hope after the opening scene, the film would be a mysterious thriller. All you realise it is used for is a gimmick for a teen slasher movie, without a slasher. But, compared to other teen slasher flicks, FINAL DESTINATION stands head above its peers. The acting is surprisingly great (LARTER is definitely one to watch), the pace is breakneck, the film is well shot and there are some genuine shocks. Think SAMUEL L's nasty surprise in DEEP BLUE SEA. Plus there is a great cliffhanger final scene. An added bonus is the film's non-Hollywood style. The slogan, You Can't Cheat Death is wonderfully cynical and no character, despite their place in the credits is above a gruesome execution. All, in all FINAL DESTINATION is a great teen horror film. Nothing more, nothing less.",Final Destination

You have the cast with Devon Sawa and a few of his costars chatting away during the movies with their input for it.  I did, however, find it annoying because you couldn't understand what they were saying and it was like when you are trying to watch a movie and the people next to you are chatting away.

I realize that a lot of reality goes out the window for this kind of film, but still, when one watches with even a casual eye for detail, there are errors to be picked up.  My two cents are that the guys who put this out should try another one and hire a new script supervisor.",Final Destination
332,Transit,"Looking forward to the remake, anyway...",6,16 April 2000,"Horror? Well, no. Not really. Final Destination manages to be horrifying only in a scene or two throughout its plot, though it is scary in its own way. The obsessive use of symbols and references to death would actually have been clever if it wasn't used somewhat heavy handedly at points. Some of the character relationships just don't make sense, and could have used more background to develop them. And the whole deal about the FBI trying to pin the death of his friends on the protagonist, who is convinced he's found ""death's pattern"" and is working to beat it just never quite worked for me, which is just as well, since it would have been too predictable anyway.I did like the overall concept, though. Don't get me wrong on that. So often to we hear and use the term ""cheating death"" that it is refreshing to see death doesn't always take it lying down. <g> And by eschewing the temptation to make death a personified figure and instead using wild, chaotic forces in the world around us as the agents of death's plan, Final Destination managed to be scarier than a typical slasher style movie would have ever managed. In fact, if only I had felt more for the characters, and understood better their relationships, I might actually have loved this movie.As it is, I am eagerly looking forward to some future film making genius remaking it someday.",Final Destination
333,Chris-448,"Appalling, Abysmal, Ridiculous, Pathetic...",1,19 May 2000,"This movie has to be the most disappointing of the year. I don't understand how people have claimed that it is even remotely original or interesting. The entire film is packed to the brim with the traditional ""horror-movie"" cliches, such as the curtains blowing in the wind and the strikes of lightning occurring every time something bad is about to happen. Not only that, but each death becomes more and more predictable as the film progresses, and by the time Billy was randomly decapitated by a piece of metal sent flying by a train, I was just laughing. The only commendable aspect of the whole saga was that the enemy, Death, was never visible, although whenever he was about to strike, there would be a lamentably stereotypical shadow cast across the room. Not even the plane crash was remotely scary, and the actors showed very little emotion about the fact that 50 of their classmates had just been killed in a mile-high fireball. Several killings were unbelievably improbable, such as Todd's ""suicide"" in the bath, Terry's collision with the bus (which I cannot believe nobody saw coming), and the electrocution and train scenes, where, amazingly, Alex manages to cheat Death. For a film which was supposed to promote the idea that Death is unavoidable, ""Final Destination"" has an abysmally happy ending. The cherry on the cake though, was seeing Tony Todd in cameo role as the morgue attendant who tells Alex, ""I'll be seeing you soon."" Worth seeing so that you can spend a couple of hours mocking every aspect, but this movie can't really score more than a 4.",Final Destination

But at the same time, if you can cope with sitting through an hour and a half of mush and being whacked with plot-device sledgehammers every ten minutes, the ending is great. Having said that...This is typical Hong Kong fare, thanks to direction from James Wong - a movie that quickly and forcibly tells you what is and what isn't, and then proceeds to break its own rules. There are scenes reminiscent of Scream, there are parts that remind you of Police Story, there are bits that seem like something from The X-Files. But then there are the parts that - if they weren't so gruesome - could have come straight from a breakfast time cartoon show, the way they're so contrived. Like backflipping lamp posts, and flying pieces of metal, and sundry other assorted devices. Not to mention the mortician is just ridiculous...But, if you can cope with all the tripe, surrounding it is quite an amusing story of how to cheat Death.

Good premise, great opening, and some imaginative death scenes.*SPOILER* I don't really want to go into the plot, but I have to mention the initial plane crash scene. It is so harrowing, and probably as realistic a depiction as you would ever want to see. You can feel the fear of the passengers, knowing you are going to die must be a terrible thing, and that is basically how the film progresses. The survivors know they are going to die and in what order, and so does the audience. Does this ruin the film? Not at all. Some of the ways the people are dispatched are pretty unbelievable, but then again, this is a film, and tumours or heart attacks wouldn't be particularly entertaining to watch. The second person to get it, being hit by a bus is fantastic. As the director says on the DVD commentary, you know it's going to happen, but it happens about 3 seconds before you expect it. So fast, and so shocking.A great, entertaining film. Brain in neutral to a certain extent, but then again, that's why I watch films. To be entertained, not enlightened.",Final Destination

339,Greg Lord,It's not big & it's not clever,3,30 May 2000,"Final Destination' was disappointing. I expected a clever, intelligent splatterfest along the lines of Scream' but this is a poor imitation. The initial idea is good  a bunch of students cheating death by plane crash by receiving a premonition, then death catching up with them, but it fails to live up to it's promise. This film tries hard to be SOMETHING  but whatever it is it just doesn't happen. For instance, one of the students is in the bathroom; spooky music starts up; he's sitting on the loo (ouch); a tap underneath comes loose by itself & water drips out; he gets up from the loo (phew); he sees a shadow in the mirror; he picks up a razor & cuts himself on the neck; the water moves purposefully towards his bare feet; NO, he's put down the razor & walks away just before the water touches his feet; he plugs in a radio (water, electricity  ouch); again he moves just before the water reaches him; etc., etc. Is this supposed to be funny, knowingly clever, scary, all three? I don't know, but for me it was just dull.This sort of voyeuristically sadistic who's going to get it next & how' game, although basically in very bad taste, can be very funny: for instance in Scream'. The difference is that Scream' is clever enough to make it obvious that the characters being bumped off in increasingly messy ways were parodies of themselves & not meant to be taken seriously; here however it seems we're supposed to believe that they are real. In expecting us to take sadistic delight in guessing who gets it next & in what particularly grisly manner I think makes a movie like this just plain nasty, & childishly so.
At the risk of getting a touch of the Mary Whitehouses (God forbid) I think it is exactly this sort of movie which contributes to making society, (particularly American society & with it the rest of the Western world), numb to pain, suffering & violence in a way that immunises us from the real thing: so that the war in the Gulf, the Kosovan crisis, become just another TV show -  & we forget that there are real people out there suffering & dying horribly, or maybe we just don't care. OK  end of sermon! I said we're supposed to believe the characters are real  supposed' because they are badly realised, & mostly caricatures: either shallow & nasty, stupid or plain dull. It's possible we're meant to think that they are in fact parodies of themselves but if this is the case it's so badly done it just doesn't come across at all. In fact I doubt if that much thought has gone into it. There are a few genuine shocks & funny moments, mostly based around sudden & unexpected deaths, (although in hindsight I think I found it funny because I wanted it to be so), but overall this left me flat. After the 1st sticky death I lost interest, I didn't give a monkeys' about the characters, the story was thin & the direction mediocre. The best part of the whole thing was a brief cameo by Tony Candyman' Todd as a creepy mortician.This is doubly disappointing for me as director James Wong along with co-writer Glen Morgan were responsible for some of the very best of the early X-Files' as well as Space: Above & Beyond' & are capable of much better than this. My verdict: best avoided  unless you're a schoolkid, which I suspect is the target audience: 'it's not big, & it's not clever'. RATING: 3/10",Final Destination

341,thundercaust,Something new to Horror,7,21 September 2004,"Final Destination has redefined horror. Giving us something else to be afraid of. We haven't had that in such a long time. Final Destination didn't focus on the gore of the movies like it did the shadows and music that made this film keep you on the edge of your seat. it follows in the footsteps of the original Hollywood horror films that used lighting and theme music to bring about a story that gets to us all. Everyone was basically tired of the Freddy and Jason movies as the became very predictable. With Final Destination we have learned that there are still things out there that scare us. In the new era of horror Hollywood has been gracious enough to lead us into a different direction and Final Destination is at the helm, with such movies as scream & I know What You Did Last Summer it just shows to us horror fans that Hollywood can still entertain our class of viewers.

And what I consider to a be a fresh, original and a major upgrade to the Horror, Gore and Thriller genre, that no other movie could come up with till date. The villain is well-known, yet hard to be fought or understood. The victims are random people like you and I, so we can all relate. The story is attractive; somehow realistic; the actors were great just like everything else in this movie.

344,jessiedhondt,REALLY good!,9,22 December 2005,"Alex is a normal kid, what I think is a change of you look at all the movies with leads that had a unhappy youth are the ones that are spoiled as hell. I think all the performances are really good. And adding 'Stiffler' to the cast was really a good idea. Because, despise it's a hard ass thriller, it doesn't mean that you aren't allowed to smile once in a while. Kerr Smith playing the jock, wasn't that smart I think because everyone knows him as ""Jack"" from ""Dawsons Creek"" as always laughing, sensitive and sweet. I saw him that way, anyway. Alex wasn't that HOT (at least not as hot as Kerr Smith) but he was really good. I must say, I was really surprised by his skills. And because he wasn't really famous, it makes the story more believable.I saw the movie for the first time and 2001, then I was 11 so, I didn't really remember when I watched him again yesterday. Now I'm 15-year old girl who is really into movies. And I must say, this one is really great. I'm not someone who is really a believer in Faith, but now, I do believe that when it's your time, you will die. You can change the way you will and you can delay it, but eventually you'll die. That is something I learned by watching this movie. I think it will be all but I must say for the people who only read the big letters : THIS MOVIE IS REALLY GREAT! I've you wan't to see a real thriller, take THIS ONE! I give him a 9/10 ( I would give him a 10 but I can't because ""Urban Legend"" is my absolute favorite)",Final Destination
345,David Fick,(5/10) Excellent concept let down by poor execution,5,7 July 2000,"Every once in a while a film gets made that is really bad  but that is, for some reason, enjoyable at the same time.  Final Destination falls into this category, as a film that works with an excellent concept, the potential of which is, sadly, unfulfilled.The film is standard teen horror fare with a twist  the villain is no psycho waiting round the bend, but Death itself and the group of seven must try to find ways to cheat this supernatural power in order to stay alive. The key to solving the mystery is Alex (Devon Sawa)  who has the visions that allow him to save his friends, or ultimately condemn them to the life hereafter.The fault of this film lies with the sloppy writing and the indifferent direction of the piece.  The dialogue is self-indulgent and immature and the level of characterization is poor, with no attempts at development or even a full depiction of the static characters which are presented here.  The vision which lies at the heart of the story remains there  it does not surface for the viewer to see; we do not actually care about the characters whose lives we touch by watching the film.Of course, even the most skilled actors would struggle to perform such poorly written roles as the ones encountered in this screenplay.  Devon Sawa, who has lost his boyhood looks, does not have the presence to carry this film  or probably any other film  to success.  Ali Larter probably fares the best as the outcast Clear,  - the most credibly written character in the piece.  Kerr Smith is wasted in his role as Carter; this is nothing more than an attempt to move away from his television persona in Dawson's Creek. Where this film does succeed, however, is in the elaborate death scenes which punctuate the narrative, creating an horrific and paranoiac tone which is easily taken home with the audience.  The handling of these scenes succeeds in creating large amounts of tension, and the outcome is disturbingly cathartic for those who witness them.Final Destination could have been a great film  there are parts which spring to life, but as a whole the piece remains a mediocre study of the way in which we view death  and life.",Final Destination
346,isaiahc-72408,"Different kind of horror, but great",9,22 August 2021,"Final Destination definitely had a new sense of anticipation for who is going to die next. In a typical horror movie you'll be able to see and accurately guess who'll bite the dust by seeing the killer and a roaming possible victim on the screen, but in Final Destination there is no set ""killer"", only death, and even then they could possibly be saved/skipped. The death scenes caught me by surprise even though sometimes I was anticipating it, I still got a good scare out of the unexpectedness of how they were going to die and when. A new type of horror movie and they killed it.",Final Destination
347,AlgisKuliukas,"Silly, but with a great crash scene",4,28 December 2001,"I thought the film started brilliantly. I love that kind of hallucination/dream switch with reality. I thought the opening crash scene was marvellously horrific.So you find yourself in a really fascinating scenario: The guy had just had a premonition about a terrible disaster and then watched it actually happen. How would everyone cope? - Him with the guilt, the others with their suspicions of how he knew.If you missed the opening fifteen minutes either re-wind the tape or don't bother watching any more.Because.. instead of exploring those things the film took us down a stupidly childish story about hocus pocus and the dreaded grim reaper choosing who would die and who wouldn't and how, no matter how you try, you can't dodge your fate.The clever young hero had worked out what 'Death' had ""intended"" - including the order that the escapees were 'supposed' to die. I hate this kind of nonsense.The film just gets worse the longer it goes on and the ending sums it all up.  I gave it 4 just for the crash scene and the first fifteen minutes.",Final Destination

350,garodardavis-08913,"If you value time, don't watch this.",1,25 August 2017,"Honestly, throughout all my life watching horror movies, I have never came across something so terrible and repetitive as Final Destination. Final Destination fits the rank of a cheap horror movie made as a cash grabbing technique for gullible audiences that would enjoy watching a dog taking a dump as long as its labelled as ""horror"" with some effective sounds to make it ""scary"" and disgusting.The point of the whole movie is that someone see's flashes of their deaths and their friends or random people, then they either stop it or simply ignore it and as u would expect - they fail.The whole movie is centered around praising very gruesome and puke worthy imagery without any real plot. The characters and their acting is so terrible you actually can't wait for them to die, but when they do, you wonder why you're still watching the movie. It's the kind of movie that will make real horror fans hate themselves by the time they finish watching it. The point of the ""story""...? There isn't such. Suspense? Doesn't exist. You can just sit back and have a good laugh at the character's stupidity and awful writing. I actually think this movie doesn't fit in any genre (it's definitely not thriller), let alone horror. Instead, it's a cheap shot to make some free cash.If you watch this, prepare for 1 and half hour of cringe worthy acting, painfully awkward writing and dialogues and some really, really gruesome deaths which is what makes dumb people rate this as a ""good horror"". I honestly don't recommend you to watch this or its sequels.",Final Destination
351,80's Man,Fairly well done,7,26 March 2000,"The concept for Final Destination was a good one. Young kid with clairvoyance cheats death by hopping off a plane before it blows up, then has to avoid death coming back for it's just dues. From there we proceed to watch cast members drop faster than Madonna's pants. The characters were a little underwritten, but the camera work and lighting was done quite well. Our protagonist has a situation similar to a Hitchcock film --- an ordinary man (kid) caught in extraordinary circumstances. The death scenes are fairly elaborate and best of all the killer is the unseen force we all must meet someday. Mix in a cliffhanger ending and we find a thrilling and satisfying movie. I gave it a 7 out of 10.",Final Destination
352,Vasitor,Final Destination: Trash bin (some spoilers),1,18 March 2000,"Okay, I'll give this movie one credit.  The scene where the girl gets obliterated by the bus was shocking and somewhat original,yet totally unrealistic, much like the rest of the film.  Did you know that Vodka can be ignited just like gasoline?  or that a coffee cup hold about a gallon of liquid?  Perhaps that your computer monitor might blow up should liquid get inside of it...even while off?  Or get this--a house blows up, completely engulfed in flames--yet the fbi can get finger prints off a knife in the house, and footprints off the wood floor.  Right.  I especially love the kindness of people in this film--the bus that smashes the girl doesn't stop...guess he figures he'll clean up after he gets back to the station. But even beyond the unbelievability is the horribly contrived dialogue. The entire scene with the mortician I was just shaking my head, ashamed that i had paid $8 to see this crap.  I was actually laughing out loud at the final deaths in the film, they were so pathetically constructed.  They might as well have had bags labelled blasting caps lying around the garages in this film.

While several people claimed to hate it, I heard more people give it positive reviews.  So I gave it a chance.This movie was very good for a genre which puts out so many bad ones.  At some points of the film, the dialogue could have been written better- but who cares?  This film wasn't written for its literary genius, it was written to entertain its audience, and to give them a few thrills.The opening scene on the airplane draws you in so fast, and it does not let you go until the end. And even at the end it doesn't quite let you go, because it leaves you thinking about it's interesting premise that deals with cheating death.  Yes, some of the death scenes were far fetched, but it's a movie.  Films are supposed to place you in another world. So I agree with the majority who gave Final Destination a good review.  It is a good, fun, creepy flick.  Oh- and Stiffler (American Pie) actually plays a dork in this one, yet he's still Stiffler.  Let the typecasting begin!",Final Destination
355,mrghstfacenc17,Sweet Ass terror,10,22 September 2000,I have already commented on this movie before. But there are some things I left out and somethings I just realized after seeing it for the 4th time. Whenever you see this movie it feels you can't escape it. You are brought into this world of dread and fear. DEATH IS ALL AROUND US. This film isn't dark but it isn't bright. It's in the middle. The plane crash is one of the scariest things ever put on film. Whenever I watch that part I get all tense and I get shivers. The crash keeps you tense through the whole movie. I was so tense that even the smallest things scared me. There was this one time where a lady lit a match. I almost p****d my pants I was so tense. The movie is sooo scary. It is soooooooooooooooooooo suspenseful. Every 20 minutes there is something that either makes you sink into your seat or jump out of it. This movie is great and original.

358,Dries Gevaert,Very promising start but a horrible ending.,6,17 July 2000,"(cointains some plot spoilers)Having read a lot of promising reviews here and on other sites, I walked into the theater expecting some sort of Scream-ish movie, but with a story and good acting (despite the unknown actors). But it didn't really turn out the way I though it would. The first scenes, with the unbelievably realistic air crash (vision) and the sudden explosion of the plane (in real life) were magnificent. No one could have done it better. But the problem was to find original ""accidents"" that will happen to the survivors, and that's where the movie loses its rhythm.The first one with the water was nice and very original, but the rest of the movie was just cliché after cliché. The writers seemed to like the story they found, with the dumb coincidences and the ""plan of death"" stuff, and decided to keep re-using that idea till the end of the movie. Special effects and coincidences would do the rest. But the special effects didn't do nothing. All I noticed were some horribly irritating electricity wires flying across the screen. And despite all the coincidences, who by the way make the movie very unrealistic, the movie stays a little predictable.The first 15 minutes were great, the last 15 minutes sucked reeeally hard. It's just a bunch of things happening without a story: Alex escapes death for like 20 times, talks to himself about death not going to get him and stuff, and the last moment he realizes what everybody in the theater had already figured out (PLOT SPOILER:) he hadn't changed seats and it isn't his turn after all (while he had escaped death for 20 times, that doesn't make any sense) and so he runs to Clears house where things keep going wrong. The director must have said ""From this point, f**k the story, let's just have some more electricity, bad luck and everybody doing stupid things nobody else would do in their place."" If the movie had been longer like this I surely would have walked out of the theater. My God.For some dumb reason, (PLOT SPOILER:) everyone survives the car that blew up and nothing happens for some months, until they go to Paris BY PLANE (40 of their friends died in an air crash and they just survived it, and a few months later they travel by plane? Hahahahahaha!) and suddenly death seems to remember them and things start to go wrong again.The air crash and the first killing were great and certainly deserve a 10/10, but in the end its just such a horrible mess. 6/10",Final Destination
359,randhuck,"Good, but not great",7,6 November 2000,"This movie has a great concept, nice plot, moderate acting, but the idea of death choosing the most gruesome and ""coincidental"" death is... not understandable. It also doesn't leave many thought provoking questions hanging for you at the end.Spoiler ahead:A class takes a jet out to Paris, but one of the passengers, Alex, views what is going to happen before the jet takes off, and that is the jet will have a horrendous explosion. When he wakes up to find that he just viewed ""death's plan"" he warns the people what is going to happen. Only one other take him seriously, another follows him to beat him up, 3 others moderate the fight, and a final one just follows them for no reason. The 6 people view their jet exploding from the terminal.Now, the basic concept is that you don't get away with ""cheating fate"" and the students now have their ""debt to pay"" so to say. Death carefully chooses each survivor according to at which point they would have died in the plane. A survivor named Tod is first. Now, death can do many things to kill a person. Tod is in his upstairs bathroom, and death loosens a toilet valve, leaving a slippery leak creeping up on Tod in the bathroom. After a few ""close calls"" with a shaver and a plug with a radio, Tod finally manages to slip on the floor, go into the bathtub with a coil strangling him to death.Another very carefully ""planned"" death is where one of the teachers finds herself with a glass of vodka turning on the TV. A sharp object slices her throat, and a spark from the TV ignites the leaking vodka that was trailing from her mug on her way from the kitchen to the living room. She takes the sharp object out of her neck, and follows the trail of ignited vodka to the kitchen where she tries to get a rag on a rack of kitchen knives. The rack falls down, and one knife goes into her stomach. Alex goes into the house to save the day, but nearly dies when the house explodes from the gas in the stove.Now, if death can control gas stoves, toilet valves, knives, vodka, and a coil of wire, why can't death just use the simplest way, and just push Tod out the window, and have the teacher just drown herself in the kitchen sink, or something else?That is the only flaw I found in the movie. Of course, if death had chosen the ""easy way out"" it woudn't be a ""teen movie"".The ending was completely spoiled, and unnesseccary. I like movies that ""leave me hanging with questions"". I don't mean just end without telling me the climax, but don't baby feed me the aftermath.",Final Destination
360,clay_animator,"Might keep you entertained for an afternoon, but at the stupidity at the characters who drive the plot",3,14 June 2009,"I was lying in my room bored out of my mind. The weather outside was a bit crappy and I decided to see what movies I could stream from Netflix. Final Destination was on my page, so I decided to watch that.So, the movie starts out with a French class on a plane. One kid ""sees"" the plane blow up, and is thrown off of the plane for inciting panic. Several other students leave with him, including one girl who left simply because she believed him. In the terminal, they watch as the plane does explode. It's interesting thinking about this in a post-911 world. The kids are interviewed about the event and then let go after about 3 hours. They know that the kid was yelling about the plane exploding, so why didn't they hold him for longer. If that had happened now, that kid would have been detained for days before they determined he was innocent, if they ever did that at all. What follows seems like a typical slasher movie, just without an actual slasher. The antagonist is supposed to be an abstract concept like fate or death, but it's really just a shadowy Michael Myers or Jason.Now seems like a good time to talk about the characters. They suck. Throughout the beginning of the movie, the survivors are giving the psychic kid(I have a hard time paying attention to names in movies) a hard time about predicting the explosion. I don't have much experience with death, but does this make any sense? I would expect them to be grieved, maybe even happy to be alive, but why would you target the guy that saved you? It doesn't make sense. There is also the girl who got off the plane because she believed him. She talks to him about believing him, and even believes him when the first guy died. However, after they establish that it wasn't a suicide, something that everyone else was saying, she suddenly stops believing him. Why? He made a prediction of his death, said it wasn't a suicide, this was confirmed, so you stop believing him? Idiot.I can go on forever about the crappy characters in this movie. The stupid motives for driving like an idiot, the complete lack of any valid emotion after one of your friends is decapitated, and the convoluted cabin near death scene that occurred right before the main character decides that it shouldn't have.If you're bored, you might get a kick out of watching it for the shear stupidity. But if you are expecting an interesting supernatural thriller, skip this one like it's death was just prevented.",Final Destination
361,Chiidatbe,Good idea but script fails to make movie shine,5,29 November 2008,"I think this movie could have been a lot better.The Negatives: It had a really good idea but bad writing I think failed it. The deaths were also too over-the-top and dramatic, I think making them more simple would have been more shocking. I found many of the death scenes funny due to how dramatic they were. Also, I think a lot of the characters were badly written and the chemistry seemed very forced between them, the film also carried some truly horrible dialogue. Certain parts of the film were also heavily predictable.The Positives: Most of the film was saved by good acting, particularly from Ali Larter. The tense scenes including Carter stopping the car on a railroad track as a train approaches and where Alex saves Clear.Overall, I think this movie only worked as an idea and would love to someday see a re-make of it with a different writer and director.",Final Destination
362,SteveHevetS,Accidents happen all the time ... death has a design,8,25 December 2005,"The first few scenes of Final Destination are designed to grab attention and set the scene for the remainder of the film, with minimal verbalization and a good dose of shock-value. Connections between characters are set in place ... in more than one way. All in all, everything a good intro should have.There is, for a while, a sense of tension between Alex and other main characters during ensuing events. All but one of the characters are to some degree irrational about the situation that has unfolded. This is to me a merit of the film, because people are very often irrational in such situations, and understandably so. The film avoids the trap of simplistic or sentimental indulgences, opting for more complexity in the emotions and actions of the characters.One of the things that stood out in this film from me was how little felt predictable, particularly given design is the central point. In fact, some of the events are downright unexpected, particularly the ... shall we say ... abrupt ones?If you're going to build a film around a well-defined set of rules, then the plot should be developed within those rules, and sufficient information given about why the rules have been broken, when they're broken. Final Destination shows that with some thought it is possible to achieve this, and to good effect (why can't more horrors do so?) And even with a clear design, there is plenty of suspense. The malevolence in this film is subtle, in a fashion, yet at the same time it manages to pack quite a punch. Supernatural elements are used sparingly and effectively as a plot device, without becoming intrusive. The main characters are convincing, even if the acting of some of the more peripheral characters is left wanting at times. The cinematography and atmosphere round things out nicely.This film has a cleverly conceived and coherent plot - one that stands up after the film is finished, and the events scrutinized. So what is the final destination for the characters? Find out ... it's a great ending.",Final Destination

I mean I know it's about a higher power killing them off but seriously, having some of them die right after they say stuff about not dying next?! Over all it was a very solid film with cool deaths and good story even though it kind of glosses over how Alex stays alive after sacrificing himself for Clear (and honestly I'm surprised Alex, Clear and Carter stayed alive for 6 months with death being so eager to kill off everyone who survived the plane crash).

Simpson in the opening scene of ""Naked Gun"".  Fabulous!!  On the star end, Devon Sawa is able pull off the haunted teen bit just as well as his Anton Tobias in the highly underrated ""Idle Hands"" - like Tom Cruise in ""Mission Impossible"", Sawa does his best to rise above and have fun with the craziness around him. And Ali Larter, who has to be the easiest thing to look at since Jessica Alba in the above mentioned Horror fav, is sexy and saucy as the adorable, steel welding Clear Rivers.

One of them Alex has a vision of them all being killed in a plane explosion and manages to get six of his friends off the plane before it actually explodes.  What they didn't know was it was their fate to be on that plane and now Death makes a new plan for them.  In Death's new plan the seven fall victim to some twisted and brilliant ""accidents""  This is quite simply enjoyment at it's highest.  The cast all do well, it's jumpy in places and manages to keep the tension.  The dialogue is often witty and the deaths and effects are quite simply excellent.  All in all a knockout picture highly recommended for any horror fan.",Final Destination

After 30 minutes it is going downhill. The movie comes to close to the average teen horror area. The ending is one big cliche.",Final Destination
369,drocta950,Falls apart more than my car,5,9 August 2000,"Final Destination is the most frustrating of all movies.  It has a great premise, some truly scary moments, reasonably talented actors, but it just can't hold it's momentum.  The first hour here is good, than it just gets goofy.  People die in truly insane ways.  One character is stabbed, has her throat cut by glass from an exploding computer, and is then blown up. What should be a terrifying moment turns into a hilarious example of all that is wrong with modern horror.  Nothing subtle in this movie.  Even features a decapitation, easily the least scary cliche in the genre.  Every time the film really starts to gain speed, it falls apart with some stupid gory death that pushes the limits of plausibility.  Good horror is always based in reality, this movie just gets too silly to take seriously.  They do get points, however, for never showing us ""death.""  I was pleasantly surprised to not see anyone in a mask.  For a film that successfully works this premise check out the 1960's masterpiece Carnival of Souls, ignore this dreck.",Final Destination

This movie had me on the edge of my seat the entire time. I was pretending to be a detective, trying to predict what happens next. I normally don't get scared by movies, but my heart was beating out of my chest. I'm debating which horror movie is better, Psycho or Final Destination. The acting was great, the special effects were incredible. This is quite possibly the greatest movie of all time!",Final Destination
371,theatheist,Bus scene,6,24 January 2003,The bus scene makes watching this movie worth your while. It's about 1.5 seconds long. Nothing much else to say about the movie.

When ""waking up"" from the vision, he panics and is thrown off the plane with 6 other students and 1 teacher. While arguing in the terminal, the 8 people who got off the flight watched the plane lift off and blow up right before their eyes. Shocked and in awe, the school and the 8 lucky survivors hold a large ceremony for those who perished on the plane. Yet, within weeks, the survivors, one by one, begin to die. Alex and a few of those who haven't died yet think of it more than some coincidence. With pieces of the puzzle being put together, and a meeting with a corner, they discover that the are dying in the same order as they would have if they had stayed on the plane according to Death's list.Now don't get me wrong, this is a good movie. But I have to say, it is pretty gruesome. The acting was all what you would expect, the F/X were fantastic, and the writing was great. All in all, it was great, but don't eat before hand.",Final Destination

With classic lines like ""I'm never gunna die"" you can't go wrong just sitting down with some friends late at night, and thrash the living daylights out of it.  I'll give it a 2, because it was too predictable with its unpredictability... seriously man how many times can you misread a simple death chart?  The people oversee death after death, and seem unaffected by it, only thinking of of who's next, having huge philosophical talks... oh the horror!

The setup is good (i.e. if you cheat Death, does he come back to ""balance the books""?) and there are some genuine jolts as the rest of the movie plays out as a slightly highbrow version of more traditional ""slasher"" movies, with the audience hanging on the ""who will live, who will die"" question right to the end.",Final Destination
376,twiglet-2,"Not the top shocker, but a worthy addition to the line-up",8,1 June 2000,"I don't know what the authors of the other comments are on about, I really liked this film. Maybe they tried to look too deep into the film, which is difficult since it is as shallow as they come. If you ignore the facts that the acting is a little wooden and the plot slightly contrived then this is a good enough way to spend a couple of hours, if only for the chance to see the characters getting picked off one by one in increasingly brutal ways. It would seem that Death is not someone you really want to annoy since he is incredibly resourceful when it comes to pay-back time.There was quite a lot of hype surrounding the film in the UK, what with the TV adverts showing people jumping out of their seats in terror every 10 minutes and I must admit that I did jump, but only about twice.

Low point:  rapid-fire exposition following decapitation scene in which none of the talkative characters even COMMENTS on their dead friend at their feet! Low point # 2:  over-the-top mortician scene which tries to garner laughs out of the embalming process (how hilarious!).  Low point # 3:  sudden puppy love appears in the finale' in which one character gives his life so that another can live (when did this romance arrive)... but it's okay, ""'cause I'll always be with you"".  Barf, Gag, who approved this script?  Obviously, this film is targeted to pre-teens who have not experienced enough of life to realize the ridiculousness of every aspect of the plot.  However, I must applaud the filmmakers' bold choice of casting only unattractive no-name boys, but utilizing lots of really cute teenage girls.  Sort of a bizarro-world fantasy of the filmmakers, I'd guess.  Don't wait for video; don't waste two hours of your life EVER on this mess.",Final Destination

This film has absolutely no character development at all.  This is a fatal flaw for any horror movie that aspires to be anything more than a slasher film (and I assume that Final Destination wasn't aiming for slasher status -- there's far too little gore and blood for that).  Throughout the film, there wasn't a single character I cared about in any way -- which means that it didn't matter at all to me how, or whether, they died.  This was a total waste of my time.",Final Destination

This movie actually ""out-Keystoned"" Max Sennett's famous comedy team known as the Keystone Kops (most of you reading this are too awfully young to have even heard of the Keystone Kops but ""never mind"", because the Destination Final movies are much funnier than Max Sennett's gang could ever have been at their finest). Perhaps Pre-Ordained Death should be renamed Max Sennett, because his methods of making up for the cheating of Death, are truly preposterously hilarious. Suffice it to say that if you are in the bottom two-thirds of your class, you will probably find this comedy to your liking and you may even think it is scary. Horror films tend to appeal most to those who will never make it in the top ten-percent of their school's class and will believe that most impossible events are highly possible.

The effects are fairly good, but this is basically ""Faces of Death"" with a plot (actually, not much of a plot).  It seems that if you cheat death, it will come back to kill you in only the most gruesome and creative way...what ever happened to the old quick and lethal heart attack?  ...must be out of fashion these days.  Why does death feel a need to ""cover its tracks"" and make these deaths look like accidents?Not just any accidents, but the bloodiest, most complex accidents ever imagined.   And where did the Candyman come from?  That had to be one of the most bizarre and pointless cameos ever.  The effects and creative killings were all that made this film watchable.

With such a young cast, I was worried about it becoming another teen slasher film, which it most certainly was not.  What I liked best was the pace - not a second was wasted, from the film's first ten minutes until the shocking conclusion (just when you thought you were safe...)
  In fact, I appreciated the fact that - just when you thought you had been cheated - the ending comes about and turns your expectations upside down. Thrilling cutaway shots throughout lead to suspense by hanging clues in front of us.  And just when you think you've got it figured out, something else entirely happens... or does it?  Great, GREAT movie. 8/10",Final Destination
382,sintelars,Surprisingly good movie!,8,12 June 2000,"I went to see ""Final Destination"" without any expectations, I havent really seen any commercials for it and theres no well known actors in it.I was surprised on how good it was. I saw a couple of comments on the IMDb before seeing it, and noticed that it was being said to be quite the same as Scream, for instance. I do not agree.""Scream"" was the first in a series of ""new"" slasher movies, but it`s originallity really disappeared after the first one. The story of a serial killer has after ""Scream"" been portrayed in films like: ""I know what you did last summer"" and ""Urban Legend"". Another likeness amongst theese movies is that there is always young people being slayed of, and that was the only thing that annoyed me a bit about *""Final Destination"" as well.On the other hand, ""Final Destination"" is quite original when it comes to ""the killer"". Now, i won`t give anything away, but it`s really different, and if you`re ready for something else than the story of a mad serial killer doing it over and over (Friday the 13th, Halloween, Scream, and hundreds of others...).The cast is good and the best scene is in the aircraft and when Terry decides to take the bus....Enjoy!",Final Destination
383,Skippy-60,GO EXPERIENCE THIS FILM!!!,9,23 March 2000,"WARNING:  This review contains SPOLIERS!Not in a long time has a movie ""stayed"" with me long after I left the theatre.  I saw it a week ago, and I still think about it everyday, and the questions it poses.If you're reading this, you probably already know what FINAL DESTINATION is about. But I'll cover the bases anyway. A student named Alex Browning (Devon Sawa) has a dream about a plane that he and his french class are on exploding in mid air.  When he wakes up, things start happening just as they had in the dream.  Alex freaks out, and is removed from the plane, along with five other classmates and a teacher.  As these seven are grounded, their classmates are Paris bound, and everyone is mad at Alex for disrupting their plans.  But lo and behold, as the seven (and the audience) watch in horror, the plane they have just left explodes shortly after takeoff.  The rest of the story is like this:  they cheated death.  Now death has to come back and finished what he started.Now that I've set you all up, here is my personal review.  In one word: WOW!!.  Sure the plot may sound a bit cheesy, but believe me, this film is one heck of a roller coaster ride.  The first twenty minutes will hold you breathless as you await the inevitable plane crash.  After that happens, the film sustains the gloom created from the disaster, adding creepiness to the mix because you never know what's going to happen next.  Who will die next? And how?  The movie hints at how the people will die, but it's not until after the fact that you say ""oh, so THAT'S what they meant by that image!""Speaking of images, this movie is filled with images you won't get out of your head for a while.  The horrific plane explosion is just one of many. The writing is such that you actually care for these characters, so when one of them dies, you feel a sense of shock and sadness.  And acting wise, the cast does a great job of showing us that what is happening is real to them. Sawa is terrific as the one who knows deaths design and must convince everyone else, and Ali Larter (who's great in everthing she does) is extraordinary at showing us the human factor of the tragedies.  I was hoping that Amanda Detmer would have more screen time, but she was unforgettable in what little role she had.  And cheers to Kerr Smith.  Not for a second did I see Jack from Dawson's Creek.  He was all Carter.Even though there are some flaws in the film (you can clearly see a ""dead"" body's eyes moving) some of the explanations get confusing (at least they did to me) and some of the lines are corny, it's a wonderfully terrifying film that, on more that one occasion, made me jump out of my seat more that any film has in a LONG LONG time.  The story is an interesting idea that could have easily become a terrible B-movie, but all the writers, directors and cast bring such a maturity and sense of seriousness to it that you can't help but be engrossed by it.  And the film makes you think of your everyday life as well, making you think about what fate (and death) have in store for you. Finally!!! A ""teen"" movie that everyone can enjoy!!For a great hour and a half of stunning entertainment, pay the money and see FINAL DESTINATION.9/10",Final Destination
384,nayruslove14,Death Doesn't Take No For An Answer,8,12 September 2007,"I don't understand all the negative reviews this movie is receiving. I mean it's made for teenagers which should be apparent by the cast, yet people insist on bashing it by saying that it is stupid because it is a teen slasher. Yes in essence it is very well a teen slasher, but it is much more original and thought provoking than most. Sure it has the stereotypical slasher movie type characters, Carter and his girlfriend being the prime examples of this, but thats to be expected.Overall the plot was solid, the characters believable (for the most part) and the scrip appeared well written enough. There was very few cheesy lines and the romance between Alex and Clear was done well, neither rushed nor prolonged too much. The two had a lot of chemistry and worked well together on the screen.There are a few inconsistencies with it that I myself can't overlook. For instance, why in the world would people stay on a plane if someone said it was going to explode. I know that he was just a kid and very few people will take the word of a kid seriously, but his outburst she have shaken at least a few people into walking off the plane. I know I would but then again that's just me.I also don't know how he got away with supposedly killing the teacher when the police were sure he did it. At the end they just showed him in France with his friends rather than in jail for her death. They never did explain how his name got cleared.Despite this though the movie is good. It's a teen movie at heart and perhaps it does lean more towards the slasher genre than anything else but it does so in style. It has the creativity that most slasher and indeed even horror films of it's time seemed to lack and that to an extent still seem to lack.Overall not Oscar winning material but a very good film nevertheless. 8 out of ten.",Final Destination
385,j-thers-2,I don't know how...,10,4 March 2006,"... long ago I since saw a good horror-movie with actually a (great) plot. But ""Final Destination"" sure delivers the fact that the writers is genius! The story goes like this: Seven people accidentally tricks Death without really knowing it, and some time after ""Death wants revenge"". One by one, our heroes gets killed in horrible accidents. One of them, Alex, is the only know who really knows what's going on and try to explain it to his friends... and of course thinks the police that it's him who does the killing.The death scenes in this movie is just absolutely fantastic!

386,Danno,Really fun and inventive,9,27 March 2000,"This movie is up there with the original Scream. It is full of suspense, frightening, and very entertaining. The opening sequence (the vision on the plane) starts out creepy, then gets downright terrifying. The subsequent killings are gory, but done in a creative manner (much like the killings in the early, good slasher films), so you are shocked and laughing at the same time. There are many little horror movie in-jokes and ""signs"" in the background of the movie (check out the license plate of the car) that point towards death, making it a natural for repeat viewing. Sure, there seems to be some inconsistencies (I never really could figure out that ""pattern"" of killings), but you just don't want to think too hard here because you're having too much fun.As someone who has been watching all types of horror films for 30 years, I'm not easy to please or surprise. This film, with it's great camera work, good special effects (used to enhance the story, not overwhelm it), creative use of horror film cliches, and sense of humor, managed to do just that and more.",Final Destination

388,ronell,A much better than average kill-em off one at a time teen-slasher movie.,8,30 April 2000,"After 20 odd years of almost countless movies whose titles include the words ""Halloween"" or ""Friday the 13th"" and all the imitators that followed, it would seem impossible that a truly original idea for the basic teen slasher movie could have survived.   Oddly enough, Final Destination is different, although, for the most part, it still remains as predictable.
In Final Destination these kids are downright geniuses compared to the morons that are usually running scared in those other films.   They have more depth, and deep philosophical insight.   Also, instead of trying to escape a weird psychotic killer, they must find a way to escape fate. Death itself is the enemy, and death is no fool.The major factor that raises the intelligence quotient of this movie is the X-Files alumni Glen Morgan (screenplay) and James Wong (director).   The lighting and camera angles have a familiar look and feel.   The story and dialog have that unnatural creepiness that gnaws at the back of you skull.
The true impact of the movie however comes after leaving the theater. Cautiously stepping off the curb into the parking lot, you wonder what seemingly innocent action may set in motion the grand design that fate has in store for you.",Final Destination

390,Bernie-58,Nice and easy splasher with some novelties,8,16 July 2000,"So in the wake of the Scream-trilogy and the 'Last Summer'-splashers another teen-splash movies hits the screen.The plot: A young teen has some inexplicable premonitions when boarding a plane with his class, gets panic and out of the plane, dragging some classmates (and a teacher) with him. Plane explodes in mid-air, and 'death' is trying to catch up and those who escaped the death pattern. All survivors (bar two ?!?) die in the following weeks and months some strange deaths.Comment: This movie is inspired firstly by a welcome impersonal death, not some sinister serial killer hiding behind masks. Death is announced by simple means, e.g. just by a gust of wind. Next are some real nice new ways to get killed, which leaves the audience shocked, but also laughing (especially the teacher's death is quite far-fetched and complicated in the build-up, to say the least). And the whole movie is driven forward by the 'Scream'-like lurking question: ""who's next?"" when the protagonists try to figure out the death pattern.Conclusion: A movie of no great impact, but some fun involved.

I had my first nightmare in over 4 years because I saw this movie. That's how I know it was good.  Also, I thought the plot was well thought out and the acting was great, especially Ali Larter, the girl has talent.  This flick stayed on focus and provided me with the necessary information and scare tactics that I was looking for. I recommend this movie to everyone! An A+ definitely.  Great idea to put Candyman in there as the coroner.  And, by the way, I love Ali's name in the movie, Clear Rivers, I thought that is so cool.

I think this movie's plot would have been better if Steven King had made this a book.  Think about it.  It seems like a SK premise right?All these people are so concerned about dying that they generally loose it. The dialog is crummy.  I like the one part where Carter says, ""I never gonna die.""

The killer isn't human with motives and a psychotic streak as long as the Bulls championship run!  It is something that cannot be touched or controlled... just delayed.The initial incident takes you by shock, with the realism of event and the order in which things happen hitting you quite hard.  With the next two deaths it really makes you feel quite uncomfortable.  Unfortunately with the fourth onwards it does degenerate into a more teen slasher role which, it could be argued is a bit of a shame. If the psychological aspect could have been kept going then it would have scored higher.  Each cast member played their part well, with Kerr Smith showing the other facets of his acting ability.It is refreshing from the scream trilogy but whether better...  only time will tell.No visions of death yet...",Final Destination

396,pedrogouveia,Interesting concept! Disgraceful development!,6,5 August 2000,"The first 15 minutes of this movie are very promising and worth watching. But the rest is very badly developed. The way events happen in the story are very unrealistic and unexplained. For instance, it's very unlikely for Tod to slip on some water and then suddenly choking himself to death on the bath tub. Things on this movie just wont match or link. It's very odd, and there are no good reasons to why that one guy started a fight on the plane. Also, it's very unlikely that people would treat the protagonist with so much dislike after he has just saved six people's life.Finally, the events don't make a lot of sense, and it disappoints me as I was expecting it to be a lot better than ""Scream"", but now I find it at the same level.

What really annoys me, is that some people have the audacity to applaud this film for being, amongst other lies, ""inventive"" or ""adventurous"". translated for lay-people, no film-maker to date had the nerve to subject viewers to such unadulterated trash. Others had the idea, but dismissed it as too cruel. perhaps the most annoying part in the film for me, is when the woman at the airport check-in, inspirationally notices that the departure time of the plane, has the same digits as our lead ""character""'s birthday. Oh my god! was that the wind on the back of my neck or an eerie coincidence that could only lead the the mid air explosion of an aeroplane ? you decide. the rest of the film is also crammed with similar, ""who cares"" explanations for the irritating sequence of events. To conclude, after seeing this film, you may find yourself washing your eyes with extremely soapy water in an attempt to eradicate any images of the film that lead you to question the realms of human stupidity. yes, you did hear correctly when that 12 year old said, ""ooh, wasn't that good"". despicable.",Final Destination

The thing I dont understand from this movie is the black guy that speaks with the actors, i think that he will be important in a sequel.  Well if you like good movies, WATCH IT!!!",Final Destination
405,rentfreak6,Fantastic,8,19 March 2000,"Looking up reviews of this movie i did not expect it to be good at ALL.  i saw only low ratings such as 3 out of 10, etc, however I STRONGLY disagree. Though the acting was a bit shallow, the plot was FANTASTIC.  The opening was extremely powerful.  While I sat in the Theatre about 10 people walked out in fear.  The biggest thing for me was the incredible imagery that is shown throughout the film, if u have an eye for symbols or subtle elements that make the action in the film all the better than you will love this movie.  My only negative comments are the acting was pushing it, and ocasionally the movie goes into ""Cheesy Metaphor Mode"" (I counted 3 times) but other than that it scared the crap out of me.  LOVED IT",Final Destination
406,chanw,Boo to ending,6,2 June 2003,"Based on the reaction from the audience (apparently consisted of young, much less sophisticating viewers) at the test screening, the staff decided to go with the open ended and yet puzzling ending. The alternate (and claimed original according to the DVD version) ending would have been far better and philosophically more logical. It is too bad that the quality of the film had to suffer motivated by a targeted higher box office sales. I give it a 6 but it can easily be a 7/7.5.On a separate note, the movie can use a bit more romance. That was surprising because the final objective of the film was to aim for young viewers.",Final Destination
407,Red_Scarf,BOTH Thumbs Down!!,3,5 January 2001,"I have lost all my respect for Roger Ebert.  He says ""its the ride you wanna take"" and happens to be the only quote on the cover of Final Destination. This is the ""Rental YOU DONT WANNA TAKE"".THIS MOVIE IS PURE GARBAGE!  It had so much potential to be a creative movie.  The idea of being able to cheat death, it sounds pretty neat but it fails miserably for the following reasons:-Horrible acting...simply horrible -Horrible dialogues (no character in this movie is believable) -Dumb script -Retarded, over-done death scenes -And most importantly:  THE FACT THAT ALL THE DEATHS IN THIS MOVIE ARE PREVOKED BY A MIND OF ITS OWN (A.K.A. the grim reaper) AND DESTROYS THIS MOVIE'S AUTHENTICITY AS A FICTION FILM.To conclude this bogus film, Final Destination could have benefited had it been a little more mature.  If they made it so that we don't see the reaper's shadows and stuff, and that fate itself was the actual enemy (without any grim repear nonsense), this movie would have been so much better.  They wasted this movie.Final Rating: 4/10",Final Destination
408,luckylefty28,Ridiculous,2,26 November 2000,Actually the first scenes on the airplane and in the airport had me drawn into the movie. The movie goes straight downhill into overkill after that. Todays horror picture makers just don't understand you can't put every conceivable mishap or killing into a movie and still have any kind of suspense or believability.  As the movie ended I was wishing that the tape had spontaneously combusted before I had the misfortune of sitting through this laugher.,Final Destination
409,moviecriticuk,VERY GOOD,7,29 April 2001,"This has to be one of the best horror/thrillers I have seen. The story is quite original and the film is absolutely full of suspense.

410,knipshun,"Good, exciting",8,15 January 2002,"Final Destination was an exciting movie that kept me interested throughout the whole movie.  I found it rather suspenseful and I enjoyed the death scenes in the movie.  Not a golden globe, but a new age thriller.  This movie opens up a new genre for thrillers.8/10",Final Destination
411,Muhls,Truly scary in its own way,6,24 July 2008,"The best kind of horror movies now a days are the horror movies with great ideas and strong differences from other movies and Final Destination is that and more. This movie shows many different deaths including the the guy getting strangled in the bathroom, the girl getting knifed by the glass in the exploding computer, the girl getting hit by the speeding bus, the guy getting decapitated by the train, the guy getting electrocuted, and the guy getting hit by the swinging billboard and all of them being so different. This movie introduced death as a force. It also expresses that your death is written in stone and if you somehow skip it it will come after you. There are so many ways that Final Destination can scare you. It isn't a slasher movie but does have it's share of gore and violence but gore and violence that is needed to express it's plot. Me personally loved this movie and could watch it over and over again. I would recommend this movie to any of you thrill goers and horror lovers Probably not the smart plot in the world but do any horror movies have good plots now a days. A horror movie in the new century has to just have a very unique plot that just jumps out at you. I rate this movie an 6/10",Final Destination
412,gwendolyn8,Very fun concept mostly makes up for plot holes and bad writing,7,3 August 2019,"This movie is not for critical thinkers, but the concept is great and highly entertaining. Seven people who escaped a plane crash die off through humorously elaborate ""accidents"" as death reclaims the people who cheated it. Outside of that, there are major plot holes all over the place and lots of things that don't makes any sense even with a suspension of disbelief.I just watched this movie from 2000 in 2019 because it has become such a cult classic I was curious to see what everyone was referring to all this time when it came up on a streaming service. The writing frequently made my brain hurt, but it was ultimately fun and worth it. In short, fun if you can turn off your brain.",Final Destination
413,Straker17,"Original, if Slightly Dated, Thriller",10,10 February 2019,"It's surprising that the first film in a long running series still remains one of the most beloved as, in a series known for high amounts of gore, the death scenes in the film seem a little less memorable in comparison. However, Final destination delivers on all of the campy thrills we have come to expect from teen horror movies, and it does so in a marvelously original fashion.
What has now become an iconic plotline with horror fans, the film follows a group of high school students who escape death after one of them has a premonition of a plane crash. Inspired loosely by the real life story of a real life story in which a woman avoided death because of a gut feeling she shouldn't get on a plane, the movie manages to grasp at some genuine tension in it's earliest moments. As the film progresses, it begins to devolve into a more campy sense of dread, as you begin to await the deaths of the remaining teens.
Devon Sawa turns in a capable performance as the lead, and he is backed up sufficiently by the supporting cast, including Ali Larter, Kerr Smith, and Kristen Cloke. The writing present here is solid, and the story provides us with a solid group of characters. Even despite some initial friction with some of them, you never really want to see any of them bite the dust, and as a result, watching death slowly approach them grasps a true sense of dread.
The film is relatively old, as next year it will be coming up on it's 20th birthday. And while, you never fully expect the effects to look as good as a modern day film, the effects present here still leave much to be desired. However that is easily forgivable due to the amount of originality present in this now treasured movie.
Regardless of the dated effects, it is impressive that a film, generally dismissed by critics of the time, has spawned a series that has cemented itself into the horror canon as well as this one has. The crown jewel of this movie is the now iconic bus death. Providing us with one of the more shocking deaths in a horror film. The impact this film has had on the horror genre is hard to ignore, and as a result the dated feel of the film is extremely easy to forgive. The film is as tense as it is entertaining, lending itself to be a film that will be watched and re-watched throughout future generations.",Final Destination
414,wangop,A real surprise packet - tense and well made,9,22 November 2000,"From the trailer, I was not expecting much from 'Final Destination'. How wrong I was! A gripping, physically wracking horror-thriller that really succeeds in generating tension. And that was on video!Well worth watching.",Final Destination
415,whiffco,Real scary moments and great tension,8,7 March 2001,"This was a film that I had put off seeing because I was not sure that it would be that good. However I finally succumbed and got the DVD and I am very glad I did. The film is genuinely scary and maintains its edge throughout. There are some wonderful moments of misdirection where you think you see the deaths telegraphed and then the result is not what you  expected but even scarier. The acting was very good for such a young cast although the two FBI agents were the most wooden and unconvincing parts in the whole film. This, however, did nothing to spoil the film at all. If you like films with a real edge with some 'jump out of your seat' moments then I recommend this one.",Final Destination
416,lyndsay1,Better than I thought,10,22 March 2000,"I really liked this movie. I went to see it because I'm a fan of Tony Todd, and Chad E Donella. All though the movie is pretty predictable, it was still mildly entertaining. One of my favorite quotes now comes from this movie - ""Let's go take a shit"" - Tod. It really isn't the best movie, but if you don't have your hopes up to high when you see it then it's not too bad.",Final Destination
417,ronfish,"""Innovative"" is something else",5,4 August 2001,"There could certainly have been hundreds of ways to make a better movie out of this ""Death hunts people""-topic. The first mistake was to choose highschool pupils as the main characters, which is surely good for making teenagers go to the cinema to watch the film, but concerning the acting this was catastrophic. The whole plot is built to impress the low-expectations-14-to-19-years-old-audience, not only is the plot as predictable as what day comes after Monday, this ever present ""death has a scheme and all I have to do is find out how it works"" is just ridiculous. Moreover there are five to ten hints every time a person is going to be killed, I think one or two NOT SO OBVIOUS hints would have been enough (I just remind of one scene: ""Tod"" cut out of a newspaper, it really can´t be more obvious!!), but I guess that was necessary to make sure that everybody in the audience would get it. Some special effects were nice but I bet the higher the rating on imdb.com the lower the age of the voter. Hopefully those highschool-films will soon reach their final destination.",Final Destination
418,the_govnor,Enjoyable,7,22 October 2000,"From Glen Morgan and James Wong, alumni of TV's ""The X-Files"" and ""Space: Above And Beyond,"" we, the audience, get an entertaining flick that comes as close to a thrill ride as Hollywood can offer as of late.Alex Browning, played by Devon Sawa who was in the 1999 teen flick ""Idle Hands,"" foresees the tragic crash of the plane that he and his fellow classmates are on; he and six others make it off the plane before his premonition becomes reality. Now, having cheated death and that which was meant to happen, the seven survivors are left to be stalked by the menacing powers of fate. They only have so much time to figure out the pattern that death has set before them and how to prevent the powers that be from deciding their ultimate fate.I enjoyed this movie. It wasn't anything too involved and nothing you really had to think too hard about, and that's exactly what I was looking for. It presented an interesting idea of escaping the path that is set before us and taking control of the things that are often beyond our grasp, if but for a mere instant.The entire movie looked and felt like an episode of ""The X-Files"" and that probably added to some of my enjoyment. If that's your thing, I think you'll really like it. And if you're looking for something other than the cheesy horror flicks that Hollywood continues to vomit at us, then try ""Final Destination"" for a change.",Final Destination
419,cruisinxx7,Boy vs. Death...free will against destined fate...hmmm,7,19 March 2000,"It's hard to explain exactly what I think of this film. If it can be placed under the category of teen slasher horror type flick (along with the ""Scream"" trilogy, ""I Know What You Did Last Summer,"" ""Urban Legends,"" and ""The Faculty""), then I'd have to admit it performed very well. Otherwise, if that is not what you are looking for, then just don't see it.However, ""Final Destination"" gives a new twist to the genre (introduced by the tag line ""You can't cheat death"") by attacking and terrorizing the characters with a killer that absolutely cannot be killed (or stopped, as you will see in the end). And since the killer is not really human, the deaths don't necessarily have to be realistic (anything short of completely unbelievable is an understatement), which is actually somewhat refreshing; it forces you to kind of use your imagination; and if you can't, it provides the pretty (read: gory and bloody) pictures for you.The main principles by which the characters follow regarding ""Death's Design"" was reminiscent of John Calvin's belief of predestination which ignited during the Protestant Reformation. This belief was that God decided in advance who lives and who dies. The movie reconstructs this idea very well, and even leaves you wondering whether they were right about Death's Design or whether they were just following the plan all along.Other than all that, the film proves exciting through the end (you will NOT be bored), because as we all know, Death is relentless. People may complain about the ridiculous dialogue (which it has, but that's not what this genre is popular for) or about the idiotic actions of characters (which they are, but that is all too common and expected in slasher films), or the supernatural causes of death (which is what will make this movie memorable longer than Scream), but overall it does exactly what movies of this genre are supposed to do: scare you--scare you because you don't know who's going to die, and scare you even more if you do.",Final Destination
420,dhagar,Final Destination,8,27 March 2000,"Final Destination was definitely one of my favorite movies.  The unpredictable suspense was amazing, it wasn't all just ""run away from the killer"" kinds of movies.  This had a truly original plot/storyline and made you jump out of your seat.  It sort of gives you an idea of what's going to happen next but you don't know when it's going to happen.  After you forget about what's going to happen, it does, and scares the hell out of you! See it!  Now!",Final Destination
421,QC-2,Spotty Nostradamus versus the Grim Reaper in an excellent film - better than Scream!,8,22 May 2000,"It's not very often, but when it happens it marks the talking point for every movie conversation. A horror movie that is truly worthy of the title. Acting that isn't shady, a story line that's believable and not too far-fetched. Firstly, let me point something out, the advertisements for the movie are real! In no way will I allow for any spoilers in this comment because if anyone had spoiled this for me I'd have hunted them down and destroyed them. Okay, I strongly liked this movie and thought it well worthy of 9 out of 10. Why? Well bad acting ruins a film, good acting enhances a film. For this film the acting was brilliant! I haven't read any other comments so I don't know what the general consensus is but I thought the acting, on the whole was great.   Devon Sawa, as the spotty faced, modern version of Nostradamus was immense. This guy has ability. The film opens, as you may know, with a guy called Alex Browning(Sawa) and a school class going to France. He feels weird and has a strange feeling. Anyway, to cut to the chase he gets on the plane and has a vision of how exactly the next five or ten minutes will play out. As it turns out, he ain't gonna leave that plane for a Kit Kat break....to put it mildly. He foresees the plane exploding and him turning to toast. Low and behold, when this vision ends, two girls ask him to swap seats, as happened exactly at the beginning of his vision. Anyway, the catalogue of events that transpires allows panicky Alex to decide that it would be in his, and everyone else's best interests if they left the plane. Here is a taste of the acting ability to come. He seems genuinely scared, his acting during this scene was as good a performance as I have seen in a long time. Moreover, he was helped by a few other noticeable performances. However, the directing was great as was the story-line. The plot - to defeat death. Throughout the film the manner in which the survivors from the plane crash are popped off by a vengeful and truly annoyed Grim Reaper makes me hope that when the big guy wants me, I don't do anything stupid like survive. If you haven't yet seen this film because of the hype , or because you are fed up with the post-Scream fanaticism that has swept throughout the country for the last few years, think again. I implore you to go to the next showing of this movie cos if you don't you will regret it. By the way, if it weren't for the neds who crowded into the cinema at the same time as my friends and I caught this movie, who talked and laughed for 30 minutes after every death scene and who, basically, could have ruined the film, it could have been well worth a ten!",Final Destination
422,unreconstructed,"Better than average, that's about it: 6/10",6,3 February 2003,"The downfall of this movie begins when two of the teenagers break into a morgue to visit the corpse of a dead friend. They are met there by a really bad plot device in the guise of a mortician. Morticians are expected to have coarsened sensibilities due to working alongside death every day and maybe a little eccentric as well, but this one is way over the top. Of course, he's not there as a real character but rather as a means to give away the plot along with any lingering mystery still contained in the movie. How he knows what he knows we dare not ask, we're just supposed to accept that someone who deals with corpses on a regular basis has a deep metaphysical insight into how death operates. Not only that, he also knows the precise predicament that the teenagers are in even though he's never met them. His only real function is to trim some time from the movie's length so that the real characters don't have to expend any excess energy discovering what they're up against.     I guess the other thing I didn't like about the movie was the ""teenage twist"" factor contained in the movie's ending. You know how it goes: the supernatural or fate, in this case, must play by certain rules so that the movie will seem more like a game to the target audience, mainly teenagers. But rules are kind of constraining and predictable, even to teenagers, so the movie sets up a false ending that's not really the ending because there's one more act to the game before it's over. Most recently the movie ""The Ring"" did this false ending along with countless others before it.    To be honest, the movie overall is inferior to a decent X-Files episode. For example, the FBI agents just do not command respect; somehow they lack the deadly seriousness portrayed so well in that series. The victims in the movie are dispatched in particularly gruesome ways and although some are very effective in jolting the viewer it does give one the feeling you're watching a teen slasher movie with an invisible diabolical John Denver working in place of Freddy or Jason. I'm really kind of disappointed that Morgan and Wong didn't do a better job given their extensive background with the X-Files.",Final Destination

426,monsoon_11,A Standout for it's Genre.,9,15 July 2009,"When I first heard of Final Destination, I was quite skeptical. I was kinda expecting a teen slasher flick with a phsyco killer, but I realized the killers in this movie could be a mug, a bus, a bathtub and a bottle of vodka!, yes, death itself is the maniac killer of the film!The movie circles around Alex Browning, a teen going to Paris with his classmates, but he has a premonition of a deadly explosion in mid-air, he decides to get off, forcing six of his peers off. But in their shock, the plane exploded, just like his vision. After the accident, the people who got off soon begin to die in bizarre accidents, convincing Alex and his peers that death itself is after them, reclaiming the souls that avoided their fate.The film gave me goosebumps and kept me interested throughout. This was, to me, the perfect horror-suspense flick, with an original plot, exciting pace, shocking deaths and believable performances from Devon Sawa, Ali Larter, Sean William Scott and Kerr Smith. Although some questions where left unanswered, the film still kept me on the edge of my seat.So if your looking for suspenseful thrills and inventive deaths, Final Destination is the ticket for you!!!9/10",Final Destination

Look no further than Final Destination! This movie is jam packed with lots of kid friendly material. Whether it be the incredibly funny deaths or the sheer amount of blood and guts, this movie has it all. Starting at the beginning, we encounter a group of high school kids at the airport on their way to France. As they board the plane, we see a stupid looking baby and a mentally challenged man. It must be so nice that they are going to France, right? WRONG! These dumb looking buttheads are gonna die! Not only are we treated to seeing the death of a baby, but as a bonus, we are treated to the hilarious reaction of a mentally challenged man. I bet he thought it was an earthquake, lol. This man rolls around in his seat just as a mentally challenged man would as the plane goes down. Though thinking about that stupid baby dying is quite funny if I do say so myself. Heck, both of them are equally hilarious! The little ones will love watching some dumb cripple roll around during a plane crash. And surely the thought of a dead baby will give them nice, wholesome thoughts about life. But wait, there's more! You still have over an hour of blood and guts to go! There will be plenty of hilarious deaths that will have your kids rolling around in laughter (much like the mentally challenged man in the plane crash). So before putting in that Barney DVD, think about the important life values that your kids will learn from Final Destination. Why, i'm sure it will become your children's favorite film before bedtime!",Final Destination

Final Destination was such a relief because there has not been an impressive horror movie made in these latter years since Scream in 1996. The film had an intriguing idea that was a beautiful back-drop for throwing teeny-boppers in the mix and scare the hell out of an audience. The first half an hour of the film left our entire audience in shock, thirsty for more. It wasn't old hat like all these other films where we see the guy with the hook in the first reel and roll our eyes, trying not to glance at our watches in eagerness to leave. What made the antagonist in Final Destination so terrifying was that it could not be brought on to screen in a physical form. There was no mask, no butcher knife (well, maybe one), and no explanation or motive. It was all up to the viewer to envision 'Death' in any way they wanted to.I fully recommend this movie to all. The story and direction is beautiful, and like I said before, the first half an hour is a sight to see. Besides some pretty cheesy dialogue and a few petty performances, Final Destination delivers the goods and invites you to come fly the deadly skies.",Final Destination

This movie is what the teen genre needs in general for it is actually scary and doesn't rely on the comedy or on the sex, and its a great movie that older generations could be scared of as well.  It fits into the ""get into your head types"" like the Omen and Seven, and is a must see.",Final Destination

This is what horror movies should be like: scary, mystical and with a story-line worth spending money on. I like the premise: a teenager gets flashbacks of things that hasn't happened yet. He gets a few of his friends off a plane, convincing them of that the plane will explode. Unfortunately for the rest of his friends still on the plane, he's right. It blows up.  The survivors think they're safe, but then freak accidents starts happening, making these persons less, less and less as time goes by. Soon there are only a few left. Who's going to live?  It's a little predictable and I thought it was a little to explaining at times. But otherwise it is actually really good. I got scared several times, and that is what horror is all about.

448,jakerhamilton,"Only ""bad"" movies dare to be this bold",7,5 September 2021,"It's not surprising that critics bashed this movie. In a movie review, most critics primarily value cohesion, refinement, calculated expertise; clearly that is not Final Destination.Much of the acting feels reminiscent of day-time TV shows. Lots of the dialogue is awkward, and contrived as ways to clarify plot points and move the story forward. The editing often fails to convey the right mood: seemingly dramatic moments coming off as humorous, humorous moments feeling at odds with the rising tension. In short, as with most teen horror flicks, this is not what most would consider a ""good"" movie.But something special can happen when a movie stops taking itself too seriously:Pure inventiveness.The idea that the ""killer"" can be the fabric of life itself, instilled in me a type of fear I'd never expected from a horror film. Everyday objects like kitchen appliances and fishing rods are now something to be feared; it leads to a sense that you can't trust any aspect of the seemingly mundane world around you.And though many of the deaths feel pretty ridiculous (though in incredibly entertaining ways), in a sense, they are also the most realistic deaths a horror movie could show. Freak accidents happen everyday. Most of us don't know how or when we're going to die; the world around you could be out to get you at any time. The fear comes through in the character's distrust in everyday life, and struggle against the inevitable.From this paranoia comes a fun and compelling story, one with unexpected turns around every corner as the characters fight against this unique existential threat.What Final Destination lacks in refinement, it makes up for in creativity and pure entertainment.",Final Destination

When this movie first came out, as most of you remember, it was billed as a smart psychological thriller.  It wasn't anything close to that.  Final Destination was a cheap thrill fest.  All show, with nothing going on upstairs.  The marketing people behind the publicity of this movie knew that, and they fooled me into seeing this work of garbage.  I've been cheated.",Final Destination

454,bikeman-2,"Teen slasher film without the slasher, see it on cable.",4,12 March 2000,"The premise of the new James Wong film, Final Destination, is that Alex Browning, the protagonist, prevents six of his friends from boarding a doomed airplane, thereby cheating fate. However, fate is not so easily bested, and Alex's friends soon begin dying in unusual circumstances. Essentially, this premise is a clever-way to make a slasher-flick without the slasher.   Unfortunately, this is practically the only clever thing about the film. As far as teen horror flicks go, Final Destination is better than many.  There is enough shocking death, graphic gore, and requisite black humor to provide the essential ""roller coaster"" type thrill at the heart of the average horror flick.  Unfortunately, this film also suffers from the worst characteristics of this genre. The relationships between the main characters are tenuous and their motivations are meaningless except as excuse to set-up the next death. The scene where two of the characters break into a funeral home to view the body of their recently killed friend is suppose to be scary and dramatic but features some of the dumbest dialogue I have witnessed.  If you are looking for a Saturday night thriller to scare your date, this film might do the trick. Other than that, wait until it goes into heavy-rotation on cable.",Final Destination
455,ChiaPet-4,Surprisingly scary,10,18 March 2000,"This movie was not what I expected from the comments of critics.  The movie kept me wondering and waiting for the next kill or scare.  Even though you knew when someone was going to die, or when some scary seen was coming up, I still jumped out of my seat. Alex(Devon Sawa) sees the his plane to Paris explode, and that is when it all started for him and his other friends.  They are being killed off one by one, and only Alex understands why this is happening.  They run from death, but no one can escape their own destiny.  I am not going to ruin the ending for anyone, so I won't say anymore about the plot. I think this movie should be seen in the theater just for the kicks of being scared and it is good enough to spend $7.50 to see it.  Although most critics would disagree with me on this, I will still believe that the acting was superb,(especially Devon Sawa) the plot was interesting, and the movie was very scary.",Final Destination
456,tedm,One of the smarter horror flicks in a crowded field,6,8 July 2000,"In a crowded field of teen horror movies, it's a shame Final Destination didn't stand out more. It's well acted, well directed, and-- for the most part-- smartly written. Trouble is, it's inconsistent. Another problem is that ""Concept of Death"" is such a hard villain to root against (or for, if that's your taste).It's refreshing to see high school characters played by actors who could probably get carded-- for the most part. Devon Sawa was great in the lead and played his role straight.Ali Lerner is one to watch (um, professionally, I mean) though she was more engrossing in the sadly underrated ""House on Haunted Hill"" (a must-have film for horror collectors whose brief box office life I blame on ""The Haunting"" for souring audiences, but that's for another review).Tony Todd's performance as the mortician is fantastic, but it's too brief. He should have been used more, at least in more than one scene.Death has many ways of killing you in the bathroom, the kitchen, or on the street. You know people are going to die --and the writers know you know-- so the appeal is in ""how"" they get knocked off one by one. Glen Morgan and James Wong will treat you to some of the best red herrings in horror films, setting up so many ways to die that you're kept guessing.Sometimes it's over the top. The teacher's death was more like a bloody Wile E. Coyote nightmare, enough was enough. The final confrontation with death is intense but fun-- the teacher's death was comical and uninteresting.Kudos still go to Morgan and Wong for giving us a real storyline with real enough characters (I'd expect nothing less from the team that gave us Space: Above & Beyond), instead of the usual throwaway dialogue to fill time between killings. At times I wish the script had more balance of drama and horror, but they knew where the money was.And more kudos go to Wong for raising the bar on airplane disasters in films. The first 15 minutes of the film alone made me feel I got my money's worth.",Final Destination

So I got my extra popcorn and got comfortable for what I was sure was going to be an hour and a half of me laughing at death chasing these kids. And guess what? i didn't laugh once. Almost screamed a few times thought! But this movie is perfect for the hard-core movie fan who isn't afraid of scream and the zillion other slasher movies.

The Director James wong did splendid job by selecting the right cast and script. Screenplay was breathtaking. While watching this movie I was totally into it, predicting what would be the next scene(who dies next). The first 15 minutes of this film is exhilarating(Especially the Plane crash scene). The story as follows, Alex browning(Devon Sawa) is getting ready to leave on a class trip to France. while on the plane he has a vision that the plan is going to explode and soon he realizes that's really gonna happen. Immediately he goes crazy telling everyone the plane is going to explode. eventually 6 students and alex leave the plane and after a moments the plane takes off it explodes. This is where the story gets interesting by getting off the plane Alex soon realizes that him and his friends have cheated Death and they have to figure out when death is coming back at them.The concept of this movie looks stupid but who cares when there is tight gripping screenplay with lot of thrills to enjoy. I strongly recommend you to watch Final Destination.",Final Destination
461,onlychannelva,A Different Kind Of Slasher...,6,1 July 2009,"I wasn't expecting much popping this movie into my DVD tray. I was surprised to find this film has quite a lot to offer. A group of students board a plane to Paris, before they take off a teen, by the name of Alex Browning (Devan Sawa) has a vision, a vision that involves the plane exploding mid-flight and incinerating all it's passengers. When he awakes from his trance he rushes off the plane taking 7 other passengers with him. They are forced to stay at the port and watch in horror as Alex's vision becomes an all so real reality. Scared, confused, and curious, the students and their families slowly begin to return to a somewhat normal life, that is until the remaining survivors start to drop off like flies. Death has returned for them and with a vengeance!I have a weird thing about kids dying in movies even if they are 17-18 years old, but plot intrigued me and really made me think, for a horror or even ""slasher"" film there is a lot under the surface. I liked the idea that death isn't a force but more of a person and a mind, that can think and analyze problems. Down to the bone though this film is just a slasher dressed up in fancy clothes. Characters are hacked of in a very violent and gory fashion. Instead of an actual killer, there is again the idea of death. Don't take that last statement negatively though, the movie was very well done and I was surprised how well written it was and even the acting. But the real treat here is for the gore fans not many films are released lately that don't have death styles executed before in repetitive fashion. Scenes throw winks here and there for a chuckle or false lead into thinking a character is knocked off in a certain way, a pattern that repeats and get old after awhile and I fear is repeated in a poor fashion. A few of the death scenes are a bit far fetched, but this isn't a movie where your meant to think. Not only are the death scenes creative but they may make you think twice to check and see if your shaving blade is rusty. 6/10",Final Destination

The premise, that people can cheat death but then be fated to die, is not bad. But the execution on the movie is so terrible that it becomes comical and lame. The buildup to before the plane crashes is long, drawn out, and overdone. And that's not even the worst thing about the movie. Each death scene shows a person doing regular activities, and they focus on about 17 different ways that person could die, until finally, after a ridiculous long amount of time, the person dies in the most completely impossible and stupid manner you could imagine. And not only that, the dialogue falls flat on the floor. There's nothing about the movie that even makes you remotely care about whether any of the characters live or die. I would expect better out of a high school project. I won't describe any of the death scenes in case you actually want to watch it, but my advice is: DON'T. I've seen a lot of horror movies, and this is probably in the bottom 3.",Final Destination
466,subterranean-1,quite decent little teen horror flick,7,9 October 2004,"I did not expect much of this movie. The idea, some people surviving a plane crash and then being haunted by death, seemed far-fetched, and I had heard some pretty negative comments from friends. But then not everyone is a fan of teen horror movies, and I guess the negative reactions were mostly due to that. Of course the plot is far-fetched, of course there are some inconsistencies, and of course this isn't anything meaningful. But I think that teen horror movies have to be judged by the standards of the genre. And seen from this perspective, it does pretty well. First of all the production values are good, the editing careful (watch the title sequence with all the little cues), the overall design nicely thought out. Casting is o.k., even though Kerr Smith may seem a little out of place to fans of ""Dawson's Creek"". There are enough graphic deaths to keep the more gore-oriented faction of fans reasonably satisfied, the love story (doesn't every teen horror flick need one) is nicely subdued, and most important - it is at no time apparent what is going to happen next. The end, which some people seem to have found confusing, actually makes a lot of sense and cleared up a nagging feeling of being cheated that I had during the last ten minutes or so, expecting a typical happy end. Instead it leaves the future of the two remaining survivors at stake - inviting the (probably rather cheap) sequel that movies of this genre need. All in all a wholly watchable effort.",Final Destination
467,shechapter127,Final Destination lacks subtlety but is too tame,6,2 June 2013,"From the opening titles it's clear Final Destination is a film about death and the makers really lay it on thick as if the audience is incapable of following a storyline without constant reminders about the subject. There are images of death, deathly screams, even a copy of Death of a Salesman.In the beginning we join Alex (Devon Sawa) a superstitious 17-year-old who is preparing to go to France on a school field trip. ""You've got your whole life ahead of you,"" says his dad, like a black cat crossing his path to smash a mirror over his head.When Alex and his classmates arrive at the airport, director James Wong continues to treat you like the big idiot you are. Alex is handed a 'Death is not the end' flyer and the camera zooms in on the word terminal. Numbers are significant throughout the film, as if to say, 'your number's up'.Before the flight takes off, Alex has a premonition that it's going to blow up. He and some of the other students are subsequently removed from the plane and are sitting in the lounge in time to see it explode in a fireball. But there's no escaping death and one-by-one the grim reaper picks off the survivors.You spend most of the film trying to guess how they are going to die and Wong often leads you down the wrong path ­– like when Tod (Chad Donella) starts to shave and nicks his neck and then plucks his nose hairs with a pair of sharp scissors – neither of these things get him but you're made to think they will and you start to see danger everywhere. It's after the death of his friend that Alex starts to piece together the clues: ""Death has a new design for all of you.""When Final Destination was released in 2000, it was an original concept. It went on to win awards, including the Best Performance by a Younger Actor, and spawned a series of films. But it hasn't aged well and when you watch other horror films it seems rather tame in comparison.",Final Destination
468,tanman91,The best movie of all time!,10,12 January 2006,"Not only are the death scenes in this movie are thrilling, but this movie is what I call 'genuine original horror'. Often when we watch other horror movies that include monstrous creatures, psychotic killers, and weird ghosts or spirits like 'The Ring', this particular villain in Final Destination is the Grim Reaper. The Grim Reaper is a devilish spirit in who some of us believe and some of us don't. In this movie, I believe the tension will crawl up in your nerves, and possibly in the end thinking up of the question - Does the Grim Reaper really exist? or Is it true that some people who die of freak accidents are really stalked by Death or just coincidences? Death is what I would call the most inevitable villain, watching you at all times. Death does not appear in front of your eyes and is an invisible presence. Plus, it's definitely not one of those clichéd horror films! My #1 favorite movie! My rating: 10/10",Final Destination
469,jonny-4,Top-notch teen date thriller entertainment,8,14 November 2000,"Great fun teen horror thriller with an unknown cast and a very original twist on the slasher movie genre. A party of US smalltown high school kids are setting off for a trip to France when Alex (Devon Sawa) has a sudden, fearful premonition that their aircraft is about to explode on take-off (be warned, nervous fliers, this is probably the most chilling crash sequence since Alive). He flees the plane and in the panic five of his schoolmates and a teacher go with him. And sure enough, minutes later, the airline is blown to smithereens. So far so exciting, but if this is a slasher movie, where is the killer? Well, we're getting to that. As they try to rebuild their stricken hometown after the horror of the accident, the surviving kids start dying off and Alex soon realises that, having cheated Death once, destiny is trying to catch up on its homework. In a a sense, Death itself is the killer.And for another twist, Alex works out that the victims are dying in the same order that they would have been killed had they remained in their seats on the airliner. And so, by the logic of rather silly paranormal movie lore, he leaps to the conclusion that by breaking the pattern of mystery killings, he can escape his otherwise certain doom. All this nonesense is delivered with frenetic pace and no small amount of directorial wit from former X-Files back-room-boy James Wong. Although it's not original in its use of pressure-cooker suspense (the train speeding towards the car stuck on the level crossing, the loose mains power cable whipping in the wind as teen X struggles to escape electrocution just millimetres away) but to his credit, Wong never ends these scenes quite the way you expect. Final Destination is delicious date movie entertainment; compares favourably with such comical teen thrillers as Scream and The Faculty and boasts a glorious surprise ending which will leave you with a wickedly satisfied smile on your face.",Final Destination
470,Yazmon,Remember TWA 800?,4,22 May 2000,"There are some very unfortunate parallels with this film and the TWA 800 disaster 3 years ago. Not only is the flight number quite similar, that plan was also destined for Paris. The other obvious coincidence is that the TWA flight also carried a group of students and teachers who as far as I am aware all died on board. I'm not sure where they got the television footage, but I hope it was not from that flight.Apart from that, the film was obvious and unfortunately not very scary at all. The characters were not expended upon, and the things they said and did, didn't always make a lot on sense. (At least in keeping with the character.)There were a lot of loose ends, like the bloke in the undertakers. (Was he death?) And the impossible was constantly happening.Poor, avoid.",Final Destination
471,Doyle,"Excellent premise for a movie, reasonably performed.",8,7 February 2003,"*** SPOILERS ***This was a bloody enjoyable movie. I missed the first 10 minutes or so but it was easy enough to catch up. You couldn't call it horror. I wasn't scared. I watched it in my house on my own in the middle of the night with a storm a-brewing, and anyone that knows me, knows that even watching the Simpson's Treehouse of Horrors episodes on my own at night can put me close to brown trouser time.My point? It was a fun movie.Of the five death scenes (excluding the flight of course), three were so daftly convoluted that you had to laugh. In fact, after the first one I found myself really looking forward to the subsequent deaths just to see what daft ideas they'd come up with next. The second death was more of a shock. It was unexpected, in a way, as I was expecting another 'Mousetrap' scenario but was left with my mouth open at the instant dismissal of an easily forgettable character.The end pleased me. These films need twists, they can never be straight.Acting in these type of films is rarely great. The lead, Devon Sawa, was half-decent, the rest made the minimum of effort. Seann William Scott as Billy Hitchcock was the worst, he didn't seem sure whether he was one of his no-brainer characters from `American Pie', or `Dude, Where's My Car', or was he acting straight. A strange amalgamation of the two happened instead - forget the recurrence of 25/9 and 180 etc., the recurrence of him falling off his bike was the only decent moments for him.Overall it could've been so good; it's a great idea for a movie and was reasonably well executed.

I did last night.Agreed, some films do this intentionally (Patriot Games, Basic Instinct, Evil Dead) but some suffer from the problem of having a great beginning, a fairly solid middle and a seriously disappointing ending.Such is the case with Final Destination.  A French student's clairvoyant dream saves 6 other would-be pieces of fried chicken from a plane explosion that they witness from the terminal.  Thirty-nine days after the thirty-nine schoolchums die (including the professor that not too many seem broken up about), Death wants a little payback...in spades.  Our hero and his doomed friends try to figure out Death's ""design"" (killing each off in the order they would have died) and try to save each other from their fates while avoiding the FBI who want answers.Okay, decent semi-Hitchcockian (note one of the characters named Hitchcock) opening and a decent plotline, What went wrong, right?A few things, actually.  Firstly, there was no real love relationship at all.  This was an extremely subtle part hinted at but more or less was tacked on at the end.Secondly, there is the ending itself.  How terrible was this?  It felt as if the testing audiences didn't like the original ending so some new situation was written and alternate footage shot at the last minute. Even so, did they think this ridiculousness gave closure? Not to spoil the ending but ask yourself this question, would you fly on a plane six months after you've had the forementioned ordeal?Do yourself a favor.  Leave this film 20 minutes before it ends and imagine your own version of an ending.  I'll bet you my $8 movie ticket that your idea far excelled the way it actually concludes.  Sad, isn't it?",Final Destination
473,RARE-T,Teen Movie Only! - Story that lacks depth,6,29 October 2000,"I originally sought out the movie because of the James Wong/X-Files link. I was hoping for some thought provoking movie  in the Horror Genre. But I was disappointed. The story lacks depth. Its essentially a bunch of teens running around getting bumped off. Does that sound familiar? On the plus side - the start was great. After the first 15 minutes, I was left wondering where could it go after this? Unfortunately it went to exactly the same place as the movie ""scream""! I thought it was a great movie to look at and the acting was good, it was just the story that was lacking. I would recommend the movie if your are into teen movies or if you are a ""teen"". I guess if your are into the X-Files - you might want to check out what Mr. Wong is upto - its worth watching - But not buying! 06/10",Final Destination

A good movie which provides adrenalizing entertainment. But to be honest it must be said, that the first 20 minutes (the plane crash and it's following events)and 10 min somewhere in the middle (as it turns out that there was a ""plan"") only were the best. The rest of this movie neither had a good script nor can it claim any continuity those kind of movies usually own. But aside from that it was really scary and exciting. Go, see it and don't mind the little mistakes, they are really not worth  mentioning. 10.",Final Destination
475,chrisb69-2,Superb!,10,17 June 2000,"I don't know what all you people are talking about dissing such a quality film as Final Destination.  Now I would agree not to compare it to Screem, I loved the first Scream but I though Final Destination was much better than Scream 2 or 3.  The film did not 'scare' me as such but it was definitely disturbing and shocking by the very fact the the ""monster"" in this horror movie was the very real fact of death and fate.  It may not have been an ""arty"" film nor completely flawless in it's story but what I did get was my £3.50 worth of movie and it's a film I will happily watch again.  Cast wise I didn't like the film.  I thought Kerr Smith would have been better in the part of Alex, Devon Sawa was very poor in that role.  Also the bit about the coroner didn't make much sense...oh yeah and the ending was a bit rushedI loved this film and despite the odd flaw in the film it is still one hell of a film...I hope Kerr Smith gets the recognition he deserves after this film and he and Ali Larter go on to join the current teen superstars such as Sarah Michelle Geller, Reece Whitherspoon, Katie Holmes and Joshua Jackson.Don't listen to the people in this place, go watch the film and decide for yourself!",Final Destination
476,brightwhitelight,"Oh, dear...",2,3 June 2000,"This was not a good film. That I am sure of. The alarm bells started to ring about 5 minutes into the film, with the ridiculous style of direction - trying to be all modern and cool and keep the pace going, but still missing something - making a massive point of emphasising all of the little 'signs' of what was to come - these are the sort of things any director who assumed even a little intelligence in their audience would make a lot more subtle.After the intro, there were very few redeeming features. As I watched I continued to get bogged down in the really awful, long and drawn out deaths, which had me almost cringing in embarrassment, the laughable dialog and acting in places (Tony Todd's 'creepy' undertaker was unbelievably poor), and the sheer predictability of the film as a whole.In summary? Don't bother - this is one of those awkward films - it's not good enough to be a fun film, and it's not bad enough to be a fun film. If you want to see a good horror film, get the Shining.

What that was, I don't know because as thrill movies go, this one would be hard pressed to beat.  The first 15 minutes set the rest of the movie up, with no let downs for the rest of the way.  I can't believe the movie was as long as it said because the thrill keeps you entranced.   The whole 'Knowing that you are fated to die next' theme is an awful feeling to think about later, causing some sleepless hours I think. *L*",Final Destination
478,reagulf,Clever film that runs like a Rube Goldberg device,8,13 April 2000,"I went into this film thinking that I was about to see a film on par with the Scream series.  Boy was I wrong!  Final Destination is an excellent film that brings about audience interaction when the elaborate death scenes are playing out on screen.  The basic plot is seven people survive a horrific plane crash after Alex (Devon Sawa) has a vision of the plane blowing up. The survivors are soon to learn that by surviving the explosion they upset Death's plan, and now the Grim Reaper is after revenge.  Unlike most teen horror flicks, Final Destination is actually quite low on gore, and actually has intelligent deaths.  What's more, its nature that is killing them, so the movie isn't spoilt by some wacky character in a halloween mask.  If you like suspense (this movie loves to draw out the scary scenes) and horror combined, this movie is a must see.Oh, and for those who don't know a Rube Goldberg device is a machine made up of normally unrelated objects, that when combined in a certain pattern and ""set off"" culminate in a single action.  You'll understand what I mean when you see Final Destination!",Final Destination

Lets just say i will not be flying for a long time!  I have also never been compelled to throw up in a death scene before Todd's bizarro self strangulation shaving accident.  I have rarely jumped as hard as i did when Terry took her impromptu bus trip.  The visceral nature of the death scenes and the terror lying within the most mundane household objects (clotheslines, toilets, computers, coffee mugs etc)caused this movie to leave me with a distinct sense of dread and fear that i haven't felt for a long time (and hope i dont get for a long time again.)  What seperates this from the Screams and I know what.... of late (dont get me wrong - i love them) is that the killer in this isnt some movie freak with a butcher knife (or garage door opener) but the light switch i use to turn the light on, or the pillow i sleep on, or the computer i am typing this review on right now! This is up there for scary sequences alongside Drew in scream, or the opening and closing scenes of When a Stranger Calls (another highly underrated horror gem) Go see this is you want to remember what it is like to be scared.",Final Destination
482,lavendr,"Fabulous, and actually kinda scary. . .",8,28 March 2000,"This movie worried me like nothin since Candyman, which also featured the gloriously creepy Tony Todd. After seeing this, I took the back roads and avoided the highway all the way home from the theater so there would be fewer semi trucks to skid and fulfil death's plan for me. While some of the effects were laughable (the head, etc), I thought that the film took an interesting premise and developed it almost enough. It fell a little short sometimes with the logistics of how Alex was enlightened on the plane, but the scene with the mortician/Death character (the aforementioned Tony Todd) was, I felt, quite necessary and well done. Acting was fairly shaky, especially on the female end, but the beauty of this kind of movie is that it can be absolutely enjoyable without being technically great, or even that good. Despite the flaws in its formal aspects, I give it an 8.5/10.",Final Destination

We left as three paranoid guys making sure we drove the speed limit and trying to determine which one of us was 'next'.  A black cat crossing the street in front of us on the way home either didn't help.Final Destination might seem to others to be 'Scream' without the slasher killer, but as I have not seen any other teen horror movies I am not aware of that.  What I got out of this movie was it had a unique idea for a plot, yet an idea which I, and perhaps many others, have had in their lives.  The idea that the grim reaper is out to get you.  That you won't get a chance to tell your grandkids how you had to drive a whole ten feet to school in a broken down car with no air conditioning and they better thank their lucky stars that they didn't live in the late 1900's.The acting was believable, although some of the characters' motivations seemed...odd.  Like, I believe it was Carter, always wanting to beat Alex and acting irrationally seemed too unrealistic to me.

I knew that the rest of it would be great and it would have a great ending, and I was right!This movie is about a group of teens who escape death after leaving a doomed airplane before it took off.  Alex, the lead character, feels that this is not the end of their problems, because death will definitely try to come back and finish the job.  I sat in suspense throughout the entire movie because I knew something was going to happen sooner of later.  And when it did, whooo boy!

Those of you who say the plot's non existent, lighten up! The originality and brilliant acting of the film make up for any plotholes. I agree with almost everyone else that this movie is not in the same league as Scream, however there are definitely more shocks throughout- whereas in most horror movies there's just one killer chasing a victim, in this film you're continually preparing yourself for the next shock, because you've no idea where and when it will come- or, in some cases, the shocks are completely unexpected (the bus scene???). The film contains everything to make for excellent, terrifying Friday night viewing- suspense (some of the death scenes are incredibly drawn out!), shocks, blood and a little humour! Go see it in a packed cinema to get the full effect- the whole audience will be gasping and screaming. This is one of those films that you just have to see again because there was so much you missed due to hiding behind the seat in front. Also, after leaving the cinema, I guarantee you will look twice before crossing the road.Overall, great direction, great story, great acting, great movie- the last thing I saw Devon Sawa in was Casper, and he's gone a long way since then! Kerr Smith is brilliant, portraying a completely different role to that of Jack in Dawson's Creek- hopefully we'll see much more of him in the future.

The plot holes are big enough to drive that bus through (now THAT was a nice shock).  The dialogue, especially the responses of the characters, is just so unrealistic that the movie becomes laughable.  The death scenes are done very nicely at first, especially the real crash, and then they spiral down into absurdity.

Only in this film someone makes the stop sign swing a little to hard causing really bizarre thing like explosions, impaling, and black 'water' to come out of your toilet all resulting in someone's death.  The plot was...well...pretty typical.  The only really unique thing about this thriller is the fact that every sort of happens via ridiculous chain-reactions.

There is actual suspense and creepiness throughout the film, whereas in Scream and I Know What You Did Last Summer, they were trying too hard to add it in.  Plus what's scarier than a villain you can't see?  Everyone I know who has seen this film loved it, including me, and I despise most horror flicks.  It's not so much that this movie is an incredible movie on its own, but I think its popularity comes from it being a great horror film in a land of cheesy horror.  The only really bad part I wish they would have taken out was the part with the mortician...it's the only cheesy part throughout the entire film.  A+++++",Final Destination

The film brought me thrills and chills and it doesn't fail to disappoint if you're in for a fright. I was shocked by the gruesome deaths and was pleased with the surprise ending. I would definitely recommend this film but it isn't for the faint hearted or squeamish. Although I happily gave the film a 7 for it's plot I would have preferred maybe a more stylised approach to filming. I was impressed with Devon Sawa's acting, maybe one of his best films and teamed with Ali Larter they give a great performance.You'll finish watching this film maybe with a different outlook to life, it certainly changed my attitude to fate and next time you're on a plane you'll think twice about those nightmares you've been having.",Final Destination

He alter realizes that when he got off the plane, we messed up death's plan, and now death was after him and the rest of the survivors, seeking to end up it's job, in the exact same order in which they would have died in the plane.Now, the only way to be saved from it was to cheat death again, messing ultimately with death's plan and have a long normal life.It's a really good plot and the end will really surprise you :)!!!!",Final Destination

Death was a presence that killed using everyday occurences (slipping in the bathtub, fire, car accidents, tripping and falling on the wrong thing, ect.) those were the things that you thought about when you left the theater, that these things can really happen at any time and place.

Maybe it is the fact that it doesn't have fantastic effects etc. The lead is a handsome young chappy who does a good job of his role, the rest of the cast play their parts well and though not the most famous of casts, they fit into their roles suitably well. The story is quite intricate with funky little twists and is good compared to others, I felt that this film had more story to it than most teen horrors which gave it it's charm. I give this film 8 out of 10 simply because I love it! The sequel however I feel failed it greatly and could have been done a lot better, thus I prefer to think of Final Destination on it's own without its sequel, because I know it doesn't do it justice.",Final Destination

The Rube Goldberg death scenes, and the total implausibility of so many scenes had me laughing out loud. Usually before a train hits a car on the tracks, it slams its brakes into emergency, even though it'll never stop in time. But this train just continues to race along after the giant Hollywood pyrotechnic explosion engulfing the engineer's cab. And when friends see their friend decapitated, the don't generally shrug it off and come up with plan B. Live wires on the ground,although potentially deadly, don't fly around through the air setting fire to everything in sight. The death scenes are what really made me laugh. They were so contrived it was like watching a thousand dominoes falling to achieve a ridiculous end. I thought it was terribly insensitive for such a poor story to be inspired by an actual tragedy (TWA Flight 800) where a local town to me lost 16 high school students and 5 chaperons, including the son of a friend and coworker of mine.

It had a philosophical point, you can't cheat death... but it was so badly executed I couldn't bare to watch it to the end.In short, the premise was good, the plot was good, the actors acted the parts they had been given with skill. The direction, the photography were all top notch... but whoever wrote this script should be subjected to some kind of non fatal but painful and permanently disfiguring acid-genital torture.Recently I watched ""Cast Away"" with Tom Hanks, now its not the best movie I've ever seen but it made some points without having to say them and in its own simple way moved me.""Final destination"" however seems to either, aim at an audience that cannot be moved and need everything explaining to them (perhaps the dead, stroke victims, or the population of Norfolk), or, more likely, was written by an heartless UN-imaginative meeting of corporate types.The premise and plot of this movie could have made a wonderful experience if not executed (and I mean that in both ways, conducted by and killed by) utter sh!t heads.",Final Destination

Although at end the story loses interest and is quite predictable.A group of students are in an airplane (go to Paris), but then one of them has one vision that saves his life and the life of some of his companions, and those visions continued in all the story with more or less fortune.Definitively one film more of adolescent terror, but something different, that at least it does not try to do that you laugh, nor presents the deaths like something graceful.",Final Destination
507,Cj-cat,Pretty decent flick,9,27 November 2005,"Final Destination is an original piece with a storyline somewhat out of the Twilight Zone. Basically a handful of teenagers escape death (due to the premonitions of the lead character) by boarding off of a plane which explodes shortly after it takes off. Shortly afterward, they all begin to die one by one...in what at first appears to be random circumstances.My liking of this movie comes mostly due to the fact that movie offers a fairly original screenplay (in todays movies) and its (though light) existential approach. The acting is alright, nothing special, but then again nothing really bad (Ala some of the other slasher films of the late ninties).In short I think this is one of the more intelligent and original films of recent days and would recommend people to watch it at least once. Like I said the acting is nothing special, and the story does have a couple of flaws in it, but overall its fairly enjoyable.(If you haven't seen the movie yet...please READ NO FURTHER!!!) My biggest problem lies after the characters figure out about death's plan. To me it seems that there shouldn't have been anyway that they could have cheated the plan (in the second one it gets even worse)..but they do. I know some of you might point to the last scene...but the fact that they could make it even that long.....well suspension of disbelief I guess.",Final Destination
508,wjb7221975,"not a review, but comment on incorrect ""fact""",7,24 December 2017,"Alex picks up a rusted fishing hook and says ""tetanus"", which is wrong. Plain rust does NOT cause tetanus. Tetanus is caused by a bacteria commonly found in horse manure. So unless that hook was contaminated by horse manure containing the tetanus bacteria...NO tetanus! lol",Final Destination
509,dduh-50062,The Original.,10,30 September 2018,"This movie is unique. Really unique, and probably one of the scariest horror films of all time. Ignore the rotten tomatoes and metacritic. YOU NEED TO SEE THIS MOVIE. I was scared to go on planes after this movie. I'm confused on why this is so bad with critics. You should definitely watch this movie.",Final Destination
510,tongjongsakulsri,Brilliant concept. Brilliant movie.,10,2 October 2018,"Back in the 90s and early 2000s, Most of the horror movies including my favourites as well just had a masked killer chase teenagers. But this was a unique concept, considering how ""Death"" can go after the survivors of the plane crash simply without an entity. The movie is about a French class going on board Flight 180 to Paris, but one of the students called Alex saw how the plane was going to crash. 6 people got off the plane with him, thus Death comes after them one by one. They weren't supposed to get off the plane, their fates were set in action to die on the plane. But Alex changed that. In my opinion, that is a brilliant concept. At least it was during the 2000s.The message they're trying to get here, is that you can't cheat Death. Death will always come back at you. So when you know there's going to be that one day that you will die, spend the time you have left now to live a full life. And people always say the Final Destination franchise has crappy deaths and cgi - Just go look the movies up online or something and watch for yourself. Especially this one, the first movie. I will admit that most of the deaths in the franchise aren't ""realistic"", but imagine if you're a director. You're really gonna let them all die by heart attacks and stab wounds? I'm still pretty sure if we didn't have this franchise we'd be stuck with 10 other masked killers by now. Overall, great acting, brilliant concept, brilliant movie.",Final Destination
511,liajpeace,So good!!!!,10,10 February 2019,"This movie is soooo good! I loved it. It was interesting the whole way through. Normally when I'm watching horror movies on Netflix, I get kind of bored and go in my phone in the middle, but this movie was so good that I was watching the entire time. I would definitely recommend!",Final Destination
512,benthien,an insult to intelligence!,1,8 April 2000,"this movie is plain stupid. No computer screen do not explode, they implode, a knife falling from a 50cm height cannot acquire enough energy to pierce your chest, and I don't think the professor of French stored a tank of gasoline in her house which could explain the sudden explosion of the house....I could continue for a long time the list of nonsenses present in this movie....I wasted my time and my money. I want a refund and a compensation for one wasted saturday evening.",Final Destination
513,IH71,Shouldn't be rated 'R',9,18 March 2000,Great idea of teens trying to outguess Death. How long will it be before they are outsmarted? The special effects and the actors' performances take a back seat to the story line. The camera work is really neat!,Final Destination
514,BlkRose-2,Very disturbing,7,26 June 2000,"All in all a good movie, although very disturbing especially in the fact that it is not concerned with something make-believe like werewolves or vampires but with death and fate which is beyond our control. I found Alex's vision of the plane explosion particularly disturbing, especially as I am afraid of flying and this was just so vivid and frightening. You could tell that the whole cinema was visibly shocked after this. Also, the subsequent deaths occurred as accidents which could happen to any of us!!",Final Destination
515,epiphany_t,The best horror movie around!,10,6 April 2000,"Contains SpoilersThis movie is better than Scream! The acting was good, and It was very suspenseful. You did know that something was going to happen but it turned out to be something entirely different. Sort of. For example at one point in the movie one of the boys head gets cut off but not at the place you thought it was.I also love the subtle little hints that death is around like the wind and the one song some how playing at everyones demise. In this way you know that it was going to happen soon.f your like me and get a little jumpy at blood, you may want to see it twice. I know that sounds weird but when I saw it for the first time I got a little jumpy but when I knew what was going to happen then I could take it. When I saw it the first time I didn't really take in that the same song was playing at everyones death but when I saw it a second time it jumped out at me.I recommend this movie for everyone, it was the best money I have ever spent.",Final Destination
516,PGowdy,Amazing shocker a must see,9,29 November 2000,"This movie will grab you. Although it seems to be a teen horror flick, it will shock and entertain allegedly more grown-up viewers. The acting is good, but it is the script and execution that set this movie apart from most others. It is beautifully filmed. It scared me. It made me rewind it and watch it again. Even the credits were beautiful.",Final Destination
517,jsgordon,Completely unexpected...I soiled my trousers 3 times over!!,8,16 March 2000,"I came into FINAL DESTINATION not knowing what to expect and I have to say I left the theatre pleasantly surprised (actually, that's an understatement. The movie shocked me so unrelentingly that by the end I couldn't wait to get home and change my pants).  I am not usually one to enjoy teeny-bopper thrillers, and I have NEVER been one to clutch my bag of Bridge Mixture in horror in any sort of movie.  However, the throw-away, casual, tongue-in-cheek manner in which this movie depicted deaths was for incredibly shocking...and I can't believe I enjoyed it. That is not to say that FINAL DESTINATION was all pant-wetting fun.  The characters were thinly drawn and the second half of the movie reverts to a few too many teen-horror/thriller cliches.  My biggest quibble was with a character named Carter.  He ruined many scenes by being completely unbelievable in the way he behaved and talked.  Now, this complaint may seem silly in a movie so full of convoluted logic, but the massive leaps of faith that the plot required never bothered me. This movie was ceaselessly entertaining and creative.  If you're willing to suspend your belief for the duration, sneak in a package of Depends, and don't mind graphic, twisted death scenes, I encourage you to go see FINAL DESTINATION. You certainly won't be bored.",Final Destination
518,HesH-2,It'll make you jump....and leave you wondering.....,10,18 March 2000,"Okay, so maybe since I'm 17 I relate to the teen movies better, but I haven't seen a movie this good in quite awhile.  I work at a video store too, so I see my fair share of movies.  I don't think I've ever jumped so many times during one movie.  Even though it was somewhat predictable, it still kept me on the edge of my seat, wondering what was going to happen next.  With all the little surprises waiting around every corner, you'll never become bored with this thriller which has been so cleverly injected with spots of humor.  If you're into the whole idea of supernatural occurrences as much as I am, I definitely recommend you go see it.  For those who have nerves as weak as mine...you'll leave the theater quivering with fear and wondering just what's in store for YOU!",Final Destination
519,Mehrah,The Final Destination should have been straight to video,1,27 March 2000,"Final Destination has to be one of the worst films I've ever seen.  Very seldom do I hate a movie as much as I hated this one.  The acting was mediocre and the death scenes were not only overly gory, but completely predictable and unoriginal.  While the movie had an appealing and interesting plot, it was carried out poorly; The movie threw you immediately into the story line without so much as being introduced to the characters first, which may have helped improve the poor character development.If you really want to see it, wait for it to come out on video.",Final Destination
520,ctheo14,REALLY GOOD DON'T MISS IT,8,18 August 2000,"Final Destination is a very good movie which worths every cent. Well it actually has a lot of scenes that are out there like the one with the teacher and the knifes in her kitchen, but the whole movie is a very good directed one and the actors are nice. After all you are going to the movie to spend to hours having fun. Scary???? Yes in some scenes it gave me the creeps. Better than ""SCREAM"" and much much better than ""I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER"". In the end this movie makes you think: Do we really can avoid death for ever? Should we even try to avoid it?. The grade I gave to this movie is 8.",Final Destination
521,hammoj1,rollercoaster ride,10,7 May 2000,"This film is certainly the best teen horror/thriller that we've seen in a few years (since Scream & I Know What You Did...) It starts with a tense, spooky 15 min opening scene, then picks up speed and never stops. Final Destination ups the spook factor and distinguishes itself with its killer, Death. We never see any manifestation of death other than a shadow here, a sudden wind there, which is much more frightening than a psycho killer. The deaths are truly inspired and surprising. The writers take everyday situations and add an inspired macabre twist. The characters are a little stereotypical, but the young actors are better than most. Kerr Smith stands out, taking on a character completely different from Dawson's Creek's Jack, and though I never particularly cared for Devon Sawa before, he carries his lead role here wonderfully. This is the best night at the movies I've had in quite a while, and I was still spooked well after the movie was over.",Final Destination
522,doubt_not,Excellent,10,27 March 2000,"Ok, to everybody that is reading this, mark my words, you should see this movie and when you do you will be blown away.  This movie affected me on so many levels. I left the theatre feeling different, feeling changed. It isn't like the usual teen horror slasher flick, this has a mind and a good mind it is. But don't take my advice, see it for yourself...> My rating: A+++",Final Destination
523,pauljsmit,A chilling experience...,7,20 March 2000,"This movie had a very unique story.  It could have been one of the best thriller/horror flicks made in recent years, if it wasn't for the less than believable reactions by the actors during some of the intense scenes.  The majority of the work on this film was focused on the several ""death"" scenes, which are some of the scariest I have ever seen.  The details are amazing and the surprise factor is better than that of Scream.  The acting was not superb, but decent enough to carry the story, which was not directed as well as it could of been, either.  I think it was James Wong's first feature film, so he gets bonus points for that.  All in all, it was really entertaining; definitely worth seeing in the theaters.  A big screen with great sound helps the effects tremendously.  Take a girl and she'll be grabbing your arm before you open your Jujubees.  Great date movie. 8/10",Final Destination
524,roycer_nr,Not the best advert for air travel.,6,31 May 2000,"An enjoyable enough yarn, it made a pleasant change not to have an indestructible lunatic coming back for more, post shooting, burning etc...Some genuinely jumpy moments too. Quite surprised at the '15' rating over here, as the kids in front of me seemed to be hiding on a regular basis.Well constructed, with the opening particularly good. If you're not into flying, this will convince you to sail.All in all, this is a good diversion from the current crop of stalk and slash movies but how long before we see this idea repeated - please no sequel - final, final destination might just be pushing it a bit too far.",Final Destination
525,astro1,Scary enough,9,19 March 2000,"The first half of the movie was amazing, but the second half fell apart a bit. Loved the plane exploding, at least they didn't screw that up and had the glass break at the same time as we saw the plane blow up. There wasn't many holes in the plot, but there were a few questionable scenes. Interesting ending however.",Final Destination
526,subland,This movie terrified me... but in a great way!,10,18 March 2000,"This has to be the best thriller I've seen in years. The young actor Devon Sawa brought to life an eeriness that was present throughout the movie. He shows a talent well beyond his years. I would recommend this movie to anyone who wants to be thought provoked and scared out of their wits. You will walk away feeling exactly as Alex (Devon Sawa) did in the movie, very eerie... death is coming. An awesome movie, what else can I say!",Final Destination
527,BGK-2,death is coming,10,19 March 2000,"I don't want to sit down here and type out the premise of the movie, because it's been done already.  What I would like to mention is that people seem to overlook this one: Morgan & Wong, yes, worked on The X-Files, but they also wrote and directed many episodes of Chris Carter's Millennium - a TV series that ran three seasons on Fox, which in my opinion was much better and scarier than The X-Files. In fact it was the best of Television ever, nothing comes close.If you liked Final Destination, definitely check out Millennium (running in syndication on the FX channel).  Episodes: ""The Fourth Horseman"" and ""The Time is Now"" are very much in the vein of FD.  Because of the gore and intensity they brought to the show, I thought for sure it was going to be thrown off the air immediately.  Luckily it lasted for a bit longer.
Morgan and Wong don't pull any punches.My only criticism is their inaccurate depiction of the Hare Krishna devotee in the airport.  They're actually good people, but are depicted as brain dead psychos.  And Morgan and Wong do this every opportunity they get when they have a story in the airport.  Ha.  Oh well . . .",Final Destination
528,halkng,EXCELLENT MOVIE!!!,10,19 March 2000,This was a very good movie. I didn't think it was going to be a good movie because it was only showing on one screen. It kept me on the edge of my seat the whole time. When the movie was over people in the the theater were saying that it was better than the Sixth Sense and even Stir of Echos.,Final Destination
529,evilseed99,The best movie I've seen in years,10,22 March 2000,This is without a doubt the best horror movie I have seen in the 90's so far.  It is everything you could ever want. It has great acting. A great story. The atmosphere is creepy and real. Not to mention the death scenes are original and quite gross. They leave many disturbing images in you head. I don't want to give away anything. It's worth every dollar I spent on seeing it. I might just go see it again.  Final Destination is movie making at it's finest.,Final Destination
530,a_jester66,Creepy and Real,8,26 March 2000,"This movie was frightening for one simple reason, it isn't afraid to go the route of talking about death, fate and if the inevitable is really unavoidable or if deaths plan can be fathomed and subsequently outwitted. The opening scene is downright scary, come on who hasn't got on a plane and wondered if it would crash, and let me tell you I am not in a hurry to get on one now.  Thought the story is a little contrived and a bit predictable(though that is part of the story) the effect is still the same. The movie is not, despite what you may hear, a teen flick, if you're a horror fan from any generation trust me you'll like it as long as you go in wanting to see it and willing to actually think about the film and follow the story line.  Trust me on this one and give it a shot.",Final Destination

I don't have it often that i want to go out a cinema, but this was really bad enough to walk away for me. I hoped for a thrilling end but that was not happening. The end is not saying what happens in the movie. They could not tell it because it was so absurd. Sorry for this comment but i really had to say this.Yorick17",Final Destination
532,tom-537,Save your money.,2,22 May 2000,"There are so many things wrong with this film that it may be unfair to identify any individual features(but I will anyway). The cliche-ridden, boring and predictable elements of this film make it one to miss. From the very start the symbolism is over blown and the father's recapping of the basic plot a few minutes into the film is lazy and assumes the audience are stupid. Similar faults reappear throughout. The script and acting is truly appalling and the film competes with Scream 3 for the worst horror film in recent memory.If you like to watch pretty people run around with no real purpose then this is for you.",Final Destination

You may think that teen slasher flicks are getting boring and repetitive, but once you have seen this, you will be persuaded otherwise. The whole film oozes originality and quirkiness.

534,sshermdog23,it was about a kid that tried to cheat death,10,26 July 2000,this wasn't a regular horror thriller it was very orginal becuase it didnt have your average serial killer stalker. it was faith and death that was the killer which made it impossible to know whats going to happen or how there going to die. so to all those that didnt like this movie because it didnt have same kind horror plot please dont judge until you see it and if u did c it get better glasses,Final Destination
535,eric7085-2,What a great movie Final Destination was,10,9 October 2000,"The movie Final Destination is based on Alex Brownings(Devon Sawa) premonition of a plane explosion which turns out to be true.  7 lives are saved through this, but Alex is only hassled by the FBI, not to mention some of the fellow survivors. One by one, the survivors are killed off in bizarre coincidences and Alex figures out that there is a design as to how every person will die and he sees that they are killed in the order they would have been killed on the plane.  Alex sets about changing this and attempting to save his friends, but as it turns out, when death has finished going through the design, it starts over again . . .I thought that this was one of the best horror movies ever made.  I believe this because it has an original, unique storyline as well as some very gruesome and unsavoury moments.  This film is not for the faint hearted and should be renowned for its ability to shock and to scare.Also, this film has a great storyline with a relatively unknown, but great, cast.",Final Destination
536,moffitzn2gether,I totally loved it!,9,4 October 2000,This movie was great! You never knew what would happen next! It had an amazing cast (Chad E Donella!) There were always so many things that could happen to the people but the things that happened were totally unexpected. It was better than most horror movies because death wasn't caused by a person but by their fate. They couldn't control what happened to them and it made it so much better. My mom bought it for me on DVD and I've watched it over and over again! I recommend it to everyone who loves horror movies!,Final Destination

544,speedemon759,A Balance that most movies lack,10,10 August 2006,This movie was practically perfect. It had the perfect balance of gore and plot development that most murder-horror movies lack. It wasn't a random killing of characters you don't know there was order to it and it made sense in a paranormal way. Most of the deaths were some-what believable too unlike it's sequel which was very far-fetched even though the teacher's death was overkill (A trail of vodka that exploded a computer which slit her throat causing her to slip on her own blood while making her way to the kitchen which caught fire from the trail of alcohol and the sparks from the computer and while on the floor grabbing a town which was on a rack of knives making the knives fall and stab her but not dying until a chair hit the knife in farther. Too much? I think so.). Some creatively sick minds apparently worked on the death scenes in this movie and it came together perfectly The whole plot was completely original (to my knowledge) and turned out to be a hit in my eyes.,Final Destination

""Final destination"" is one of the best movies I've ever seen.I liked it very much, but I'm a bit disappointed that there are only 3 parts of it.I've been thinking a lot about what might happen next if there existed the 4th part.I'm sure, those who watched the 3rd part would agree that this is not the end.What if in ""Final destination 4"" the main character finally meets Death, has a talk with her... for example -- she explains that if Alex did not walk out of the plane in first part there would be no other deaths, no car crash, no accident in the park and so on. That all these are the consequences of one's wrong deed. Just something like that.And than, finally -- the main character understands that he or she has to die in order to stop all those stupid deaths and bring peace to all the people...I understand that this might sound foolishly, but still, I'm interested in your opinions and would be grateful if the directors would still release the 4th part of this film.",Final Destination

Deaths have enough originals to what we have seen so far and very good actors, including Ali Larter, I can not complain. My favorite is the death of Ms. Lewton and also the last (for those who do not remember is the big poster) that horrible! Okay, I think a 6.7 is just as good for a movie (could say it is one of the best in recent years without fear of exaggeration), but after all it is a good result, thanks to the votes of many film buffs who think like me, because some films are lucky to get a 6.0.

Only to wake up, sitting on the plane, and the events begin to play out, he goes total apeshit, causing a commotion leading to several students getting off the plane and being left behind. Then *shocker* the plane which can be seen in the back ground explodes! DUN DUN DUN. There's a funeral, boo hoo. Now a sequence of REALLLLYYY stupid deaths. Beware your toilets people ! If it starts dripping it will come after youuuuu. Tod didn't listen, so he slips , IMMEDIATELY when his foot barely touches it, causing him to do some graceful acrobatic movement into the bathtub and the shower head breaks and goes around his next like 50 times and he suffocates and dies. What a catastrophe. And other deaths include, a house going on fire, where a knife ends up piercing the woman in her chest and then a chair falls over and hits the knife in further lol. and then a piece of metal ricocheting from under a trying slicing a guy's face off. And some other mess. Anyway, this movie was mad funny! Wasn't much at all scary. Except for my mom, poor her lol she was terrified. This movie was good fun.",Final Destination
558,FrogstersMum,Definitely worth the watch.,7,29 December 2004,"The acting... in and of itself was decent, but not great. The script... in and of itself was slightly decent, but far from great. The movie idea, the surprise/shock value and concept of the film were awesome...there were loads of times that i actually went... WHOA! The dream scene... where he dreams what happens on the plane... that was awesome!! totally brilliant.If you have ever seen or played a game called MouseTrap,... well, I really appreciated all the things that happened to people when they died. The ending was a bit silly and overdone, but that is OK.This was was a low budget, B movie... that made it better than it was... if it was given top billing and a bunch of $$$ was spent hyping it.. it would have sucked out big time.",Final Destination
559,LifeWithSerge,First or Second film?,6,6 July 2013,"As a thriller - medium like horror - too trivial and no raisins. But you will not say that the movie is bad!I'll start with the fact that the ""destination"" is somehow reminiscent of ""The Scream."" Maybe bloody murder, though not in the ""Scream"", not ""point ..."" they were not so much. Or maybe a similar atmosphere. Oh, yeah right! The atmosphere is very reminiscent of ""The Scream."" But that's only in the ""Point ..."" is not a killer with a knife.First, let's define the genre. I already wrote that, as a thriller - medium, but as a horror - frankly weak. I would give this film genre - with fantastic elements of the detective .. In the graph are many genres of films.It is said that in the ""Final Destination"" excellent special effects for a horror movie for 2000. Very few films of this genre are used as colorful special effects.That's all I wanted to say about this film. See ""Destination.""",Final Destination
560,JLKESG82,Seen It,10,26 January 2005,"I actually own Final Destinations one and two and Alex Browning LIVES at the end of the first one, but during the second movie at the beginning a police officer tells Kimberly that there was only one survivor out of the seven who got off the plane. Why would someone make a movie having someone live at the end of the first movie but in the second they don't mention that he lived and the person who survived was Clear Rivers? Don't get me wrong I love both movies but its kinda weird for someone to live at the end of the first movie but not mention or show he lived in the second one. I'd love to meet Devon Sawa anyways he's a good actor....I'd love to see what he would be like in real life...Yeah he maybe just another person like me and you but he's a lot more rich than I. Although, I did not remember the police officer in the second movie, look up information on Alex Browning.....the internet stated that Alex died of a Falling Brick.....please disregard my last comment still LOVE the movie though...and DEVON SAWA!!",Final Destination
561,aguilar_jr93,FINAL DESTINATION -the first true horror movie,8,19 November 2005,"Final Destination was a really good film with a few surprises and lots of blood and gore, which made it a nice and decent film. The story involves a high school french class that are going on a trip to Paris. Then one of the Students-Alex(the main character)has a violent premonition that the plane will explode right after take-off. The premonition is very realistic and gory. It was very heart-pounding because the director-James Wong- put lots of work and effort into filming this movie especially the airplane sequence. Then when Alex wakes up from his vision, he tells everyone to get off and causes an argument with Carter Horton- another character. Alex and Cater get kicked off the plane along with Clear-a classmate that felt Alex's vision, Billy & Tod-Alex's Friends, Terry-Carter's girlfriend, and Ms. Lewton-a teacher that decided to stay with the students. Then when the 7 people are sitting in the lounge,Alex's vision becomes reality when the plane explodes after the take-off. Then a month later Tod- Alex's friend ends up dead. Soon the seven friends start dying in mysterious ways-as if Death had been tampered with and was looking for payback. The deaths in the movie are spectacular and are very realistic considering that there is no serial killer or maniac running around trying to kill everybody. It is about a group of normal teens ending up dead because they cheated death. What is most surprising is that the people in the movie die because of normal household items or something that you see everyday e.g.-knives,buses,trains,clothes lines,computers,etc. And the thought that being stalked by Death is just plain scary because Death is all around us everyday. That is what makes this movie a real twist in horror movies and what makes it very successful.",Final Destination
562,chevellefan11,Putrid Bile...,1,1 July 2009,"I hated this movie, I really did. I thought Prom Night and One Missed Call was bad. I was expecting a bad teenage ""horror"" movie, but what I got was worse; an atrocious abomination of cinema that doesn't even have it's cheap thrills.It's not a good thing when before anything happens in the movie you've predicted who's dying in which order, who survives by the end, and then you turn out to be correct. The dialogue is horrible, and the acting is mediocre (with the exception of Tony Todd).The first kid who died (which is almost always the one with the worse hair) got killed by slipping on his bathroom floor and getting strangled to death in his bathtub by a wire I'm not even sure where it came from. How is bathroom strangulation scary at all! This is the most predictable piece of crap I've seen since just about every Sci-Fi channel movie ever! The ways these kids die are so unrealistic, one of them dies from a flying piece of metal that got run over by a train and cut off half of is head...no.Avoid this pile of rotten clichés at all costs. i wouldn't torture my worst enemy with this...",Final Destination
563,elibert,The best teen Thriller Ever,10,23 July 2005,"Probably one of the top 5 movies I 've ever seen ( the others are Armageddon , 8 Mile , 6th Sense & Rocky )and the best teen thriller I 've ever seen. The Idea is Great , the story is great and the execution is such as good. It had some gruesome deaths and it also shows the relationship of 6 teens who are totally different and they stick now together in order to defeat death itself... The end of the movie is unbelievably great and ( for those who have seen the sequel where the last survivors of flight 180 die ) I think that the meaning of this movie is that nobody can cheat the death. I think that this is the best teen thriller of all time and it is a must see movie for all the thriller fans.",Final Destination
