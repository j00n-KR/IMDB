0,MartinHafer,It sure is R-rated!,8,17 May 2020,"A word of warning before you watch ""Love & Other Drugs""....there is LOTS of adult content and it comes by its R-rating honestly. You'll see lots of nudity (more so than in most R films), lots of adult language and situations. So, if you think you might get offended, you might wanna pass on this one.Another word of warning. This movie might be upsetting and difficult to watch for some folks--particularly those struggling with serious debilitating illnesses. The film has a character with Parkenson's....and it's pretty upsetting to watch....especially if you struggle with similar problems.The story is about Jamie (Jake Gyllenhaal) and his new job as a pharmaceutical rep. It would seem to suit him very well, as he's a very amoral guy who doesn't care nor want to know if the stuff he's peddling is effective or if the company's methods are scrupulous or not. He is not above bedding women in order to get orders for these drugs. So, it's strange that Jamie finds himself interested in Maggie (Anne Hathaway). After his usual one night stand with her, he finds he's intrigued...especially since that is all she says she wants. In other words, she is more than willing to have intercourse with no strings attached and opening says she has no feelings for Jamie. If this was all, there wouldn't be much story here. But Maggie is dealing with early onset Parkenson's...and this ends up causing all sorts of difficulties for Jamie...and, unexpectedly, the development of a conscience.The acting is great in this film as is the script. I really appreciated the film....even if it did require some Kleenex to be nearby. Well worth seeing...but not a film for everyone.By the way, and it's NOT that important, but when Jamie drives his car to catch up to Maggie, she's supposed to be on her way to Canada. However, Jamie stops the bus in Charleroi....which is due SOUTH of Pittsburgh...about 45 minutes south....which makes no sense for a bus that's leaving downtown and heading to Canada.",Love & Other Drugs
1,SnoopyStyle,Good actors in difficult rom-com,6,26 November 2013,"Jamie Randall (Jake Gyllenhaal) is a womanizing stereo salesman who got fired for sleeping with the bosses' girl. He's the black sheep of a successful family, and turns to selling pharma for Pfizer in 90s Pittsburgh. During a visit to a doctor, he meets Maggie Murdock (Anne Hathaway) who is suffering from early onset Parkinson's.The backdrop of pharmaceutical sales may not be the best for a comedy. There are attempts at jokes especially some Viagra montages, but it's more eye opening than funny. Jake Gyllenhaal is a great actor who is trying to give humanity to this relatively unlikeable guy. Anne Hathaway adds on a layer of cynicism and anger. It's not an easy silly rom-com. Although I try to like this movie, the tone changes are just too difficult to take.",Love & Other Drugs
2,Horst_In_Translation,"Decent watch, sometimes too ambitious for its own good",6,12 December 2014,"""Love & Other Drugs"" is another example of how Anne Hathaway is one of the most talented actresses from her generation. She managed to score a Golden Globe nomination just like her co-star Jake Gyllenhaal. I have to say I am not his greatest fan, so I was neither too impressed with his performance here nor did I manage to find him likable near the end which was probably the intention. He was just too unlikeable early on. The movie is directed by Edward Zwick, an Oscar-winning producer for ""Shakespeare in Love"".First of all, I want to say that the happy ending felt a bit forced in my opinion that they just had to close it with the two reuniting and it was a bit random. And didn't she say before she had somebody else already? Where did he go? Why did Gyllenhaal's character leave her anyway if he loved her? The whole split-up scene came totally out of nowhere only minutes after they confessed each other that they are in love. Anyway, Hathaway's enthusiastic behavior after the Parkinson convention was great to watch and she really nailed that scene. The entire convention and monologues were written nicely. What I did not like about the film has mostly to do with Gyllenhaal's character. His brother was brought in for some comic relief, but added really nothing else. The final boner scenes were downright bad and brought some terrible ""American Pie"" humor to a film where it did not fit at all. Also, the whole medicine background story in the first half of the film was just not developed at all. That one scene when they talked about the impact of the medical industry at that point and included a reference to a presidential candidate was downright bad. All of a sudden, the movie seemed politically ambitious and it did not work out at all. The movie worked best as a somewhat different, more serious romantic comedy between the two protagonists.The film succeeds occasionally on an emotional level, for example when the older man tells Gyllenhaal's character to leave her and not go through all the struggles due to the illness. Another one would be when Gyllenhaal's character watches the video of his ex-girlfriend near the end. Gave me goosebumps. As a whole, the movie has some great scenes, some pretty weak scenes, but as a whole I'd recommend it, especially if you like one of the two main actors. Lots of graphic nudity too, so stay away if you're a bit on the prudish side.",Love & Other Drugs
3,Prismark10,Drug simple,6,26 March 2018,"To get Pfizer onside, director Edward Zwick probably toned down criticisms of big pharma.Set in the mid 1990s, Love & Other Drugs stars Jake Gyllenhaal as Jamie Randall. Charismatic, confident and clever. A babe magnet who can sell anything. When he gets a job as a pharmaceutical salesman to sell Zoloft which is a rival drug to Prozac he needs to use his considerable charm and cunning. The goal is to meet his quotas and get the lucrative Chicago beat. Once he gets to sell the new drug Viagra, the money comes rolling in as doctors cannot wait to prescribe it. Jamie is the star salesman making an healthy commission.The film takes an initial cynical approach to pharmaceutical companies. There is a boot camp scene where budding salesman are told to massage facts and manipulate medical staff to prescribe their products. It is a job for the amoral salesman. The film then changes tact as Jamie meets Maggie (Anne Hathaway) who is in the early stages of Parkinson's disease where it becomes a sort of love story.The film is all over the place with its tonal shifts, it gets worse when Jamie's brother crashes at his place when his wife has thrown him.Zwick is too good a filmmaker to make just a bog standard, by the numbers movie. He does add some nice touches in this film such as Maggie going to a meeting of Parkinson sufferers which is tender and funny. At the same meeting Jamie meets a husband who has been caring for his ill wife for decades. He tells Jamie to run away and describes the future that awaits Jamie as the disease advances.Zwick also places comic moments such as Jamie placing his samples of Zoloft at a doctor's cabinet and taking away samples of Prozac which he dumps in the bin. A tramp then takes it from the dump. This scene is repeated several times, when we last meet the tramp his life is transformed by Prozac. He has spruced himself up and is going for a job interview.This is a movie for grown ups, but unlike Blood Diamond, I feel Zwick has pulled his punches.",Love & Other Drugs
4,claudio_carvalho,"Sex, Parkinson, Love and Drugs",7,3 December 2011,"In 1996, the womanizer salesman Jamie Randall (Jake Gyllenhaal) loses his job in an electronic store after shagging her coworker. Jamie is hired by Pfizer to sell Zoloft with his colleague Bruce Winston (Oliver Platt) and he uses his charm to seduce the receptionists and reach the doctors to convince them to prescribe Pfizer's drugs. When he meets the twenty-six year-old Maggie Murdock (Anne Hathaway), they have sex on the first date. Maggie is a free spirit that has stage one Parkinson's disease and does not want to have a steady relationship. However, after a period, they both have a feeling that they have never felt before: love. But Jamie is promoted and need to move to Chicago and Maggie is afraid of her degenerative disease.""Sex & Other Drugs"" is a pleasant romance where the former Disney movies' actress Anne Hathaway shines with a bold role of a young woman that loves sex having to deal with Parkinson disease. Her character is very hot and her love scenes have a high level of eroticism. The bitter criticism to the pharmaceutical industry and corrupted doctors is unusual in American films. Jake Gyllenhaal is a good actor in action films but he has a wooden performance in the role of a wolf that uses his appeal to be an efficient salesman. Josh Gad is annoying and his inconvenient character is never funny. Oliver Platt has a minor participation. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""Amor e Outras Drogas"" (""Love and Other Drugs"")",Love & Other Drugs
5,nogodnomasters,COMEDY TO LOVE STORY,8,13 December 2018,"The movie starts out as a great man's comedy with Jake Gyllenhaal charming every woman from 8 to 80 selling them lower tier electronics. This basically lasted through the credits as he gets fired for being a little too charming with the boss's girlfriend in the stock room. His family has money and he gets a job as a Pfizer salesman, something the movie makes out to be an evil job. He uses his charm and ability to have casual sex to sell drugs. During this time he meets Anne Hathaway (multiple nude scenes, thank you Anne) and they have incredible casual sex. The movie was great up to this point. Then we find out Anne has Parkinson's disease which is why she is a free spirit.Jake falls in love, turning this into ""Love Story"", then the comedy simply dies.Some crude humor, sex, nudity, f-bomb.",Love & Other Drugs
6,kosmasp,Getting up,8,7 September 2011,"I'm actually going to refer to another movie called Sweet November too. There are a few similarities story-wise. I won't spoil too much, but just in case you don't want to read about it, that was your warningHaving said that, this is a superior effort than Sweet November. While Charlize Theron and Anne Hatheway are more or less an even match, Jake G. has Keanu number all the way through. And while you could argue that Jakes role in this is better written, it is undeniable (for me) that he is also the superior actor.And while drugs include Viagra (or the beginning of it), apart from some innuendo and quite a few puns, this movie is also pretty sexual. For some viewers this might be too much. Not your typical romantic comedy then (though you might have guessed that with the Sweet November reference). It touches issues that are very real and while the tone does not always hit the right spot (there's another pun for you), it still manages to get you",Love & Other Drugs
7,jboothmillard,Love & Other Drugs,5,9 July 2011,"From director Edward Zwick (Glory, Blood Diamond, Defiance), this came out in cinemas two months before No Strings Attached, they were not competing the same year, but they are both similar films with subtle differences, I watched this one first. Basically Jamie Randall (Golden Globe nominated Jake Gyllenhaal) lost his job selling electronics back in 1996 for having sex with his manager's wife, and he now works for Pfizer as a drug rep. His recent job is to try and prescribe Zoloft instead of Prozac, and while doing this he meets the beautiful free spirited and Parkinson's disease suffering Maggie Murdock (Golden Globe nominated Anne Hathaway). They arrange a date together, this only lasts a few minutes because they rush back her apartment for sex, and they decide after doing it again to make a regular thing, i.e. become ""sex friends"". One night Maggie teases Jamie that he cannot get an erection, and that he needs the latest drug available, Viagra, which solves erectile dysfunction, and he also promotes this drug which becomes even more popular. After some time, Jamie wants a more serious relationship with Maggie, but she refuses, and they break up for a little while, but she accepts a relationship when they see each other again. They spend more time together and he spends nights round her apartment, and one night returning he tells her that he loves her, he has never said he loves someone in his life, not even his family. One day Jamie catches Maggie's brother Josh (Josh Gad) masturbating to their sex tape, he is angered and shocked whatever apology he gets. Going to convention together, Maggie attends a meeting for Parkinson's sufferers, she is moved by the people and their stories who suffer like her, and she comes to tell Jamie she love him. He becomes obsessed with trying to find a cure for her disease, pushing Dr. Stan Knight (Hank Azaria) for results, and after a few too many sessions she argues there is no cure and she wants to live the way she is, therefore they break up. Later Jamie has a dinner with friend Bruce Winston (Oliver Platt), and happens to bump into Maggie, and he decides after initially accepting a promotion to go and see her at the restaurant she works, but she has left for Canada to obtain drugs she needs. In the end Jamie persuades Maggie to have a five minute talk with him, he explains how better his life is with her in it, and she cries knowing she feels the same, so he refuses the promotion and they live together. Also starring Gabriel Macht as Trey Hannigan, Judy Greer as Cindy, George Segal as Dr. James Randall, Jill Clayburgh as Nancy Randall, Katheryn Winnick as 'Lisa' and Jaimie Alexander as Carol. Gyllenhaal is near enough suave and charming, Hathaway I was not expecting to see fully naked and plays her part nicely, and together they make a good on screen couple, it is not necessarily original with the in love, breaking up and back again part, and the ""sex friends"" that fall in love is a bit obvious, but it is not a bad romantic comedy drama. Worth watching!",Love & Other Drugs
8,Quinoa1984,mixed-up and only somewhere to go,5,12 December 2010,"Love and Other Drugs feels like a Producer-tampered movie, or maybe just a screenwriter-tampered script. I have to wonder what Edward Zwick, the director, who hasn't made a movie in this romantic comedy-drama realm in quite some time (look at his credits, it's been, oddly enough, since the 1990's as he's been making international or big-themed epic/action movies for a while), knew what he was really doing with this material, specifically the book by Jamie Reiddy (very likely the influence on Jamie, the character played by Jake Gyllenhaal in the film). It tells its tale with a modicum of professionalism always, but its head is scattered about with what it really wants to do. It's two movies, no, maybe even three, or two and a half may be a nice round number. First, there's the pharmaceutical-insider movie, done with a tinge of satire (if not entirely the same level of energetic and fierce wit) as Thank You For Smoking, which peers into a practice that is not altogether pleasant but is fun to watch in a way, which is the pharmaceutical rep game. Reps, who go to doctors to hock the latest in drugs to sell to their patients, is much like a seminar for any other salesman thing, or better yet for an army. As Jamie gets into this game, he already has sales experience from selling junk TV's to people (this is circa 1996, by the way, just in case the soundtrack blasting Spin Doctors didn't let you know). So it's some fairly easy ground to cover. And over time he gets successful, and chummy with people, and may go on to the next big thing in Chicago.Next, there's the romantic comedy, where a guy meets a girl by a rather embarrassing meet-cute (Jamie poses as an intern and gets to see Anne Hathaway's breasts - not the first nor the most pleasant time), and he pursues her even after she says no way. Finally she gives in under the proviso that it'll be just sex. Yey, fine by Jamie, and the two go at it like jack-rabbits (Zwick, to his credit, does not shy away, and neither by proxy do his actors, from showing skin and, more importantly, being open and vulnerable sexually on screen in a mainstream studio release). Along the way Jamie gets advice, begrudgingly, from his rich- but-loser younger brother (Josh Gad), and there's some funny business with a videotape that Jamie and Maggie shoot of their sexcapades that his brother actually does watch at one point(?!)And then, finally, there's the romantic drama tinged with an illness ala Love Story. I mention Love Story only in some part; to the filmmakers credit they do have a real, debilitating disease, Parkinson's, as what ails Maggie and causes Jamie to reevaluate everything that's come before. The only problem is that Parkinson's, for someone who is 26 years old (the character's age at least as mentioned) is extremely rare (Michael J. Fox, for example, didn't even get it quite that early), and it kind of becomes a big calling-card for the movie's drama when it seems like such a convenient disease for her to have. This shouldn't be to note that the movie doesn't treat the disease seriously. It does, almost to a fault; there's a wonderfully touching scene where Maggie by near accident goes to a Parkinson's help-meeting and real patients are used in the scene. It makes it all the more painful when, ultimately, it's really just a plot point.That would be confusing enough, and yet, also to Zwick's credit as a filmmaker, he does make this part of the movie of a relationship drama work the best. Surely the two actors, who previously had (ironic) chemistry for Brokeback Mountain, are very well suited for one another dramatically and are excellent together when such dramatic or small- range scenes come up (one I really loved, which comes as close to merging comedy and drama together) is when Jamie, a future Viagra rep, can't get 'it' up and realizes and says that he loves Maggie and the two sit it out and talk, that everything just clicks, for a few minutes. There are some powerful scenes and moments between two characters, and it can be a rare thing to have equal chemistry, talent, and some good meaty-relationship dialog altogether....And then it goes back to the romantic comedy, and humor involving (you guessed it) a Viagra joke that gets stretched out (no pun intended) for about ten-fifteen minutes. Another big problem is Josh Gad. Is this guy funny, or do people think he's funny? It's partly that the character just sucks, no other way to phrase it- like a loser Judd Apatow would have written out or marginalized or tried to make funnier with someone like Jonah Hill- and that Gad is so unwelcome with the rest of the material. All of these other actors- the two leads, Hank Azaria, Oliver Platt- are on such another level than Gad, and it's painful to watch. Adding to this is the pharmaceutical-rep satire, which gets dwindled down as Jamie changes (maybe the right decision plot-wise but less interesting character-wise), and tries to become serious in little spurts but goes nowhere with it. Three separate movies can be made out of his material, and there's a descending order that could be made (and I think you get the idea by now) of what is most entertaining, cathartic, successful, and pleasing in storytelling and structure. There's a lot of brave bits in here, and a lot of stuff that feels forced in, as if the demographics were given more precedence over coherence and tact and reason. What else is there to say? Um... did I mention the actors are naked for many minutes of the movie? 5.5/10",Love & Other Drugs
9,tavm,Love and Other Drugs has good performances by Jake Gyllenhaal and Anne Hathaway despite the movie's occasionally uneven tone,6,15 December 2010,"If you're familiar with the names of writers/producers Marshall Herskovitz and Ed Zwick from their TV output of ""Thirtysomething"", ""My So-Called Life"", ""Relativity"", and ""Once and Again"", you may know their reputation of creating characters that are complex and therefore not always likable enough to completely relate. That's the case with this movie that they're also responsible for. Basically, Jake Gyllenhaal plays a drug executive who's always been good with the ladies at least until he meets a patient played by Anne Hathaway who sees right through him. I'll just stop there and just say how nice to see these veterans of Brokeback Mountain have more of each other to play against compared to the previous film's story-dictating of some separations. And despite some character flaws, the characters they play do have some remarkable good chemistry due to both the actors and some of the script/improvisations. But despite some good laughs, Herskovitz-Zwick do provide some rough edges that almost threaten to cast some pall over the proceedings. Still, having said all that, Love and Other Drugs is a worthy adult dramady for all involved though I do have one real caveat: Why put George Segal and the recently departed Jill Clayburgh here and just have them have one dinner table sequence where neither gets to really show their stuff?",Love & Other Drugs
10,sunwarrior13,Hathaway's Brilliant But The Film Is Not,9,11 September 2012,"Love and Other Drugs a romantic comedy film that stars Jake Gyllenhaal and Anne Hathaway.The screenplay was based on the non-fiction book Hard Sell: The Evolution of a Viagra Salesman by Jamie Reidy.It was written and directed by Edward Zwick.Handsome and charming pharmaceutical rep Jamie (Gyllenhaal) falls head over heels for radiant free spirit Maggie (Hathaway), and together the two people who never thought they would fall in love discover that their intense chemistry is more powerful than any pharmaceutical drug on the market.The only redeeming quality in this film is the performances of both leads,who are a match made in heaven particularly Hathaway,who gives a marvelously a brilliant portrayal of Maggie as someone sick that you do care for her.Too bad it is not enough to elevate the movie into its potential that it should have achieved.It is a flawed movie. The script needed another pass to add more focus and perhaps zero in more on the challenges facing Jamie and Maggie both personally and the changes they have been undergoing in life.But in the end,the screenplay just played it safe with a contrived and formulaic elements that are present in most romcoms despite the fact that it could have been more than that especially with the pharmaceutical industry,drugs and ill people in focus in the screenplay.",Love & Other Drugs
11,george.schmidt,More than a LOVE STORY meets JERRY MAGUIRE pitch; Jake & Anna make a dynamite couple,8,4 December 2010,"LOVE AND OTHER DRUGS (2010) **1/2 Jake Gyllenhaal, Anne Hathaway, Oliver Platt, Hank Azaria, Josh Gad, Gabriel Macht, Judy Greer, George Segal, Jill Clayburgh. Well-acted yet disjointed romantic dramedy with cocksure pharmaceutical salesman Gyllenhaal facing his biggest challenge: free-spirited and equally callow artist Hathaway – and ultimately falling in love with some consequences (she has first-stage Parkinson's Disease). While Edward Zwick keeps the pace snappy as director his screenplay with Charles Randolph and longtime partner Marshall Herskovitz – based on Jamie Reidy's book ""Hard Sell: The Evolution of a Viagra Salesman) – has its work cut out for it in attempting to be a breezy sex comedy and a disease of the week TV movie that ultimately is cancelled out by the dynamic chemistry of its handsome leads (and hot sex scenes) yet it is more than a LOVE STORY meets JERRY MAGUIRE pitch; it's what one will sacrifice to be a better person; lesson learned indeed. Trivia note: sadly this is Clayburgh's last film performance, which is more so since it's practically a glorified cameo as Gyllenhaal's WASPy mother.",Love & Other Drugs
12,neil-476,"Funny moments, but this is NOT a comedy",8,6 January 2011,"Jamie (Jake Gyllenhaal) is a charming womaniser and good salesman. On moving into the field of pharmaceuticals he encounters Maggie, an early onset Parkinsons patient. They are initially motivated by strong sexual attraction but, as they have more to do with each other, Jamie discovers that he has deeper feelings for Maggie whereas she has made it clear from the start that the idea was no-strings-attached sex. In fact, it becomes clear that Maggie is pretty mixed up - full of anger and self-pity at her Parkinsons prognosis, she avoids commitment because she hates the very notion of being dependent on someone (and, as her feelings for Jamie develop, she may well wish to avoid the relationship changing to dependent and carer for his sake as much as hers).I liked this film quite a lot, even though it sometimes isn't too clear about exactly what it wants to be. There is an element of acid social commentary (Up In The Air, Thank You For Smoking) particularly early on, but the film is also a romantic comedy, a Hallmark-type disease-of-the-week drama, not to mention definitely dabbling its toes in a couple of other genres too. And the different elements actually fit fairly well together, with the exception of Jamie's fat comedy brother (Josh Gadd) who belongs in a different film, and who could have been written out completely at the loss of one decent gag (featured in the trailer) and an out-of-character philosophical aside which fuels Jamie's actions in the finale.Gyllenhaal is good, albeit he doesn't have to strain any serious acting muscles. Hathaway is very good, and creates a complex and believable Maggie. Plus she looks very good without clothes on, which is the case for a satisfactory amount of running time.George Segal and Jill Clayburgh are wasted, but Oliver Platt, Hanz Azaria and Judy Greer all please.My only big reservation concerns the ending, which was a bit too Hollywood to convince, and glibly avoided addressing the issue raised earlier in the movie of what happens in 20 years' time?",Love & Other Drugs
13,evanston_dad,Has About as Much Spark as a Wet Birthday Cake Candle,4,15 December 2011,"It seems like a no-brainer to me that an adult sex comedy should first and foremost be sexy. But director Edward Zwick and his writers must disagree with me, because, abundance of Anne Hathaway's boobies and the seemingly endless scenes of naughtiness between her and Jake Gyllenhaal aside, I found little to titillate me in this droopy ""comedy.""Hathaway, though a fine actress, has absolutely zero sex appeal, so she's a terrible choice for this role. And it doesn't help that she has no chemistry with Gyllenhaal. Therefore, the entire movie's bottom falls out from under it, because the whole point is that these two oversexed young 'uns with a fear of commitment (he because he's a mimbo, she because she's got a degenerative disease) find in each other the soul mate who makes all the hard things about relationships that they've been trying to avoid worth dealing with. It's hard to believe these two are soul mates when they have about as much romantic spark between them as I have with my own sister.Edward Zwick has long held a place in my top 5 list of least favorite directors, and this movie didn't do much to change his ranking.Grade: C",Love & Other Drugs
14,ferguson-6,Hard to Believe,5,26 November 2010,"Greetings again from the darkness. Based on Jamey Reidy's book ""Hard Sell: The Evolution of a Viagra Salesman"", the film bounces around between rom-com, disease-drama and an editorial on the medical profession and drug companies. The single reason to watch the mashed-up film is the performance of Anne Hathaway, who surprisingly has developed into an excellent actress.Jake Gyllenhaal plays a hot shot, charming, womanizing, always ""on"" pharmaceutical rep who will stop at nothing to eclipse his quota and achieve his promotion to Chicago, the promised land for Pfizer. Struggling a bit to make a name for himself selling Zoloft, Jake's destiny seems pre-disposed when Pfizer introduces Viagra. Talk about a pitch in the batter's wheelhouse! However, as so often happens in life, a speed bump appears. The best laid plans ...When Jake's character meets Anne's character (Maggie), things change for both of them - despite the less than perfect introductory scenario. Turns out, her character suffers from Stage One Parkinson's, while he is a Stage Four jerk. Actually, that makes for the perfect couple ... for a short while. You can guess what happens.When the film transitions from rom-com to heavy handed drama, many of the best scenes occur, but overall the movie suffers. The scene at the un-convention for Parkinson's patients is undoubtedly the film's best. Furthermore, when Jake meets the husband of a Stage Four Parkinson's sufferer, he gets the one minute down and dirty along with the advice to just walk away.Rarely has a love story had so many moments of the couple trying so hard to push the other away. Speaking of ""Love Story"" (my attempt at a smooth transition), it is important to note that despite the drama and dark tones, the film never delivers the expected sobbing out loud moment. It actually does a terrific job of treating the disease with respect and directness. A nice change for Hollywood.Directed by Edward Zwick (Blood Diamond), the film rests squarely on the shoulders of Ms. Hathaway, who doesn't disappoint. Supporting work is minimal and not overly effective. That includes Gabriel Macht (phamaceutical competitor), Hank Azaria (the only doctor who needs help with women), Judy Greer (the eager office assistant), Oliver Platt (Jake's boss in the most confusing role in the film), and Josh Gad (in the Jonah Hill knock-off role), plus George Segal and Jill Clayburgh as Jake's parents. A sad note: Ms. Clayburgh died on November 5th this year. She had a varied and important Hollywood career.What's odd about this film is that I have actually many good things to say about it despite my disappointment. I love some of the fast quips from the early part. The points made against drug companies, insurance companies and the medical profession are spot on (though a bit obvious). The serious portion of the program is handled with dignity and pulls no cheap punches. Much of it seemed accurate and real. But for whatever reason, the film is just not very cohesive and comes across as choppy ... a series of scenes, rather than a full story. That said, it's worth seeing for the continued growth of Anne Hathaway as an actress.",Love & Other Drugs
15,anaconda-40658,You Need Drugs to Get Through It.,2,6 January 2016,"Love and Other Drugs (2010): Dir: Edward Zwick / Cast: Jake Gyllenhaal, Anne Hathaway, Oliver Platt, Hank Azaria, Josh Gad: What drugs could possibly assist someone in getting through a screening of this junk? The drug in question is feelings and it stars Jake Gyllenhaal as a womanizer who recently lost his job then he is roomed with his slob brother and selling drug samples at doctors offices. He meets his match in Anne Hathaway, a victim of Parkinsons disease whom he will suddenly give a sh*t about. This is all very phony and even the disease subject seems like an ill contrived plot device. Director Edward Zwick previously made much different films in Blood Diamond and Courage Under Fire but here he can merely watch his actors become undone by dipstick circumstances. It is easily one of the worst films Zwick has ever attached his name to, and a total opposite to the greatness of Blood Diamond. Gyllenhaal is a fine actor but here he lacks the sincerity required. Hathaway is a stunning presence whose first scene has her exposing a breast. Eventually she shows up at Gyllenhaal's apartment dropping her robe displaying all of her goods. The view is spectacular but it comes off as desperate. In flat supporting roles are Oliver Platt as a job associate of Gyllenhaal's who eats a lot. Hank Azaria plays a doctor whom seeks Viagra from Gyllenhaal. This movie is everywhere. At one point it wants to be charming and funny, then it gets emotional presenting serious talk about Parkinsons. What it doesn't do is suggest the right drugs one should take to erase this drivel from memory. Score: 2 / 10",Love & Other Drugs
16,gradyharp,Gyllenhaal and Hathaway Magic,10,3 March 2011,"LOVE AND OTHER DRUGS is based on Jamie Reidy's highly regarded novel 'Hard Sell: The Evolution of a Viagra Salesmen' and as adapted for the screen by Charles Randolph, Marshall Herskowitz and Edward Zwick (who also directs). It is a little jewel of a film. If the portion of the film that deals far too long with a silly Radio City Music Hall show of Pfizer Pharmaceuticals training program bores the audience (it should have been severely edited for many reasons), it is worth the wait for the actual romance story that follows. Jamie Randall (Jake Gyllenhaal) can't hold a job, preferring to focus on womanizing, much to the disdain of his wealthy obese brother Josh (Josh Gad), and his parents (George Segal and Jill Clayburgh in a role that was to be her last). Jamie best friend Bruce (Oliver Platt) joins Jamie in becoming a pharmaceutical rep for Pfizer and the two are placed on the road to push Zoloft and Zithromax, finding that the market is hoarded by Trey Hannigan (Gabriel Macht), an Eli Lily salesman selling Prozac. Jamie encounters Trey in the office of Dr. Knight (Hank Azaria), studies Trey's success and his own failure, and in the process encounters a patient of Dr. Knight, the free spirited gorgeous Maggie Murdock (Anne Hathaway) who has been with both Trey and Dr. Knight. Jamie's lack of success pushing Zoloft suddenly reverses when Pfizer comes out with Viagra: Jamie is a natural to be the leading salesman for this new enhancing drug - or is he? There is a strange chemistry that develops between Jamie and Maggie and despite their unlikely qualifications as relationship candidates, each finds in the other the qualities that turn wild one nighters into a solid love affair. Maggie has Parkinsonism and that aspect alters the way each approach the relationship. But it is the magic of how this blossoms into one the screen's best romances that is the gift of the film. The story is frequently disrupted with sidebars that are supposed to provide comic relief but in the end simply take up too much space away from Jamie and Maggie. Had the film been edited to clean its shelves the way Jamie cleaned the physicians' sample shelves of Prozac the total product would have been even better. What the film brings into focus is the enormously maturing talents of Gyllenhaal and Hathaway: they may just be the next great Hollywood silver screen couple. This is 'a fine (and sensitive) romance' and well worth watching. Grady Harp",Love & Other Drugs

Jake Gyllenhaal plays a representative (i.e., salesman) for Pfizer who meets up with Anne Hathaway in a doctor's office and falls for her. At first he just assumes she's a prescription medicine junky (which he obviously doesn't look down on, since he's pretty much just a pusher). It turns out, though, that she really does have Parkinson's disease and is refusing to let him get closer to her because she doesn't want to hurt him (or be hurt by him if he runs away when things get too rough). The film does work, though, mostly because Hathaway is excellent. Gyllenhaal's pretty good, too. You also get some good supporting performances from people like Hank Azaria, Oliver Platt and Judy Greer. One big negative aspect: Gyllenhaal's fat, obnoxious younger brother played by Josh Gad. I think they wanted to cast Jonah Hill, but he was too big a star for such a role. Gad is a lookalike with about half as much talent. But, really, the flaw is mostly in the writing. The guy's a pretty poor excuse for comic relief. He does completely unbelievable things (like masturbating to a sex tape starring his brother and his brother's girlfriend, then, when getting caught, asking his brother how his penis got so big?!?!), and his joke lines are completely unfunny.",Love & Other Drugs
18,DICK STEEL,A Nutshell Review: Love and Other Drugs,10,8 January 2011,"The first part introduces us to Jamie Randall (Jake Gyllenhaal), a good looking schmuck who gets his way around women always, possessing an irrepressible charm that make them all feel weak in their knees. Being kicked out of his job at an electronic store for his amorous ways, he soon finds himself applying his innate ways with women into his selling routine, now working as a sales rep in the medical industry for Pfizer, which when he joined hasn't created the magical blue pill called Viagra yet.I'd always wonder whether Pfizer was totally OK with the use of their branding, just like how Up in the Air featured Hilton. After all this section of the film relentlessly pummels you with their sales strategy, arguments and counter-arguments where some aren't really flattering, or even ethical to begin with. It's like a statement of how numbers and quotas are being chased no matter the cost, and their sales training made for some comedic fodder. And to make matters worst, it puts up front how the use of freebies can open up doors which are closed, and to Jamie it also means manipulating women to get at what he wants, especially an account with Dr Stan Knight (Hank Azaria) who in one scene opened up and blabbers about how corrupt the entire industry could be in demolishing one's medical ideals.So I suppose it's fair game for Pfizer since the story, or at least this part of it, is based on the book ""Hard Sell: The Evolution of a Viagra Salesman"" by author Jamie Reidy, himself a former Pfizer sales rep, because at least it gets itself everywhere in the film by virtue of Jamie's job. Besides the lessons learnt and applicability in the corporate world, I totally agree with how being good looking puts one at a certain advantage because people like aesthetically pleasing things and beings, or try as hard to deny that such things exist. Things work, appeals work, and just about everything one touches turn into gold, or you get a leg up in your mission in life. This entire part on the bubbling new career of Jamie's I enjoyed and had a huge chuckle from for its bold portrayal of things that cut close to real life.Then there's the romantic portion of the film that kicked in once Anne Hathaway's Maggie Murdock comes into the picture, piquing Jamie's interest when she revealed a boob and caught him ogling. The love between the two is anything but simple (and I touch on this in a while) since she wants to keep her emotional walls up to prevent from getting hurt again. They reach an agreeable compromise in establishing a relation that's built on purely physical terms, and try as hard as they can to avoid falling into the usual relationship trap. Through their interactions we learn a lot more about their characters, and in these moments come the expansion to prevent them from lapsing into caricature mode. Both Gyllenhaal and Hathaway score in their respective roles, so much so that it earned them a Golden Globe nomination each. Gyllenhaal's Jamie develops from schmuck to an all round nice guy, something which love does of course since it forces you to care about somebody else, while Hathaway has to mimic an early stage of Parkinson's for her Maggie role, and brings to light some basic understanding of sufferers for the disease in which there's still no cure. After all, modern medicine seems to be interested in developing products that have mass market demand (like Viagra) appealing to the primal desires of men (and women too) which automatically translates to profits. Needless to say having been on screen together (sans clothes too in Brokeback Mountain) meant some natural chemistry already established and which they shared But the third part to the film was the home run for me. It defines the concept of unconditional love, other than the innate one that a mom will always possess for her kids. You'll know someone is right for you, and there's no point denying it anyway, when they choose to stick by you when they know the going will get tough, that things will turn out quite the nightmare and disadvantageous, but decide to do so nonetheless. It takes the concept of ""in sickness and in health"" and weaves a strong emotional narrative around it in this film, where a couple not yet bounded by matrimonial vows, decide to adopt its concept implicitly. One is a sufferer from an incurable, long term disease, afraid to get too close to someone in fear of being pitied upon, or unfairly bogging down and clipping another's wings when the other half has opportunities to take off and fly.But no, the film isn't that sombre in mood always, and contains plenty of comedy also courtesy of Oliver Platt as Jamie's sales manager, and that of Josh Gad playing Jamie's uncouth brother Josh, a one time internet paper millionaire until the dot com bubble burst, having to live on the couch in Jamie's apartment, the details of his shenanigans best left for you to find out from the film. The strength of Love and Other Drugs come from the development and transformation of characters and their relationships with each other, which dialogues that reminded me of, of all films, Jerry Maguire, set against an historical backdrop of developments in the medical industry that shook up the whole world. As I said, it's smart and all encompassing for a film like how Zwick likes his films to be, and I'm sure has elements that you'll identify with and enjoy.I'm firmly putting this in my Highly Recommended list, and an early shoo in as one of the best of this year, even though it's early. Now excuse me as I go practice my Hey Lisa routine!",Love & Other Drugs
19,blanbrn,"Blunt and provocative feel good enjoyment film driven by plenty of sex, yet it proves hot feel good sex can lead to love!",9,4 December 2010,"I must say that ""Love and Other Drugs"" is clearly one of the better films I've saw in awhile. For a variety of reasons for one the chemistry between Gyllenhaal and Hathaway is in perfect form as the two worked together before(as a couple in ""Brokeback Mountain""). Second it's an emotional story that involves sickness and finding unexpected love. And finally what can I say the film has plenty of passion, lust and hot steamy love scenes so plenty plenty of sex! So aside from those reasons this picture can best be summed up as a kind of old fashioned romance falling in love story that touches your emotions as you feel the couples(Jamie and Maggie)growing pains of trust, sickness and feel good pleasure. Still the sex overshadows those ingredients leaving a happy and feel good side effect for a viewer like me and it helps because I'm a big Anne Hathaway fan and with this picture you get to see plenty of her skin.Set in the mid 1990's when the economy was booming you have Jamie(Jake Gyllenhaal)who's a young playboy from a well to do family and his biggest love in life is going to bed with hot young females. Then Jamie decides to get a little bit more power hungry when he becomes a pharmaceutical sales rep. he's taken under the arms of an ego driven boss Bruce(Oliver Platt)and the catch and sale of the game is for Jamie to use his charm and good looks to help sell medicine like Zoloft and Viagra(remember the wonder pills of the 90's!). Plus his connection with a cocky Dr. Knight(Hank Azaria)helps his climb and profile in the drug selling world too! Now that Jamie has became a hotshot pharmaceutical rep. he now meets his match in one of Knight's patients that being the sassy and witty sharp tongued free spirited sexy Maggie Murdock(Anne Hathaway in her best and most sexy role of her career)as you can see a lot of adjectives to describe her. Only blemish with the beautiful Maggie is that she has stage one Parkinson's disease. Never mind these hot young attractive singles hit it off perfect as this quickly becomes a relationship of no strings attached lust bedroom making very hot passionate sex(I must say the bed and love scenes were very hot for an R rated film). And this is what both enjoy lots and lots of sex.Yet as the charms of Jamie continues to go both for Maggie and his business he unexpectedly starts to have feelings for Maggie has he finally meet his match can he charm the stubborn sex magnet Maggie? The film is blended well with both comedy and drama as Jamie's slob geek overweight brother Josh(Josh Gad) provides laughs trying to score and it's fun seeing he's addicted to watching internet porn and sex tapes. Plus the scene of Jamie's boner from taking the Viagra pill was down right funny. Still Maggie is a serious go getter by traveling even to Canada to Parkinson support groups in the search for new cures and ways of living with the disease.This film thru it all is wonderful as the sex and hot lustful passion make it a tasty treat to watch and enjoy as the strong chemistry of Jake and Anne is great as Hathaway is sexy as ever. Those factors alone make it one of the better films I've seen. And adding the sickness theme of Parkinson's makes it depressing to some still it proves that anyone can be loved and that it's unexpected and everyone needs someone. Most of all it proves that sex and hot passion can easy lead to strong emotions of feeling and yes you guessed it as this film proves love. Love & Other Drugs is a feel good film that's enjoyable it touches emotions leaves you happy and you don't feel any side effects only love in the end.",Love & Other Drugs
20,lasttimeisaw,Love And Other Drugs,6,19 April 2011,"The film is simply a rom-com wrapped with novel anecdotes of medicine realm's monkey business. The consequence is that it looks fabulous but not consistent, the first half is interspersed with rapid editing and funny wisecracks, which help to establish a sardonic backdrop of Jake Gyllenhaal's character, a man-child with an ambition; the second half slowly fell into a semi-hypnosis status when the relationship turns sour and a stuffy confrontation about responsibilities incurs inevitably, then even the two sexy leads have lost their charisma to lock our attentions on the screen. The entire process looks like a premature ejaculation version of THANK YOU FOR SMOKING (2005) plus a well-worn happy ending after a unconvincing love confession. Thanks to the credible cast, the film escapes from being a disaster, Anne Hathaway strides bravely and charmingly on her way of be the next Julia Robert, however Jake Gyllenhaal's panache style is squandered dramatically by exposing his rear over-frequently by too many sex scenes in the film. Actually veteran director Edward Zwick is a bankable name in Hollywood, I have enjoyed his previous works like BLOOD DIAMOND (2006), THE LAST SAMURAI (2003) and LEGENDS OF THE FALL (1994). This time the attempt to connect with a younger generation through a slightly light comedy with many set pieces like viagra and Parkinson's doesn't accomplish its original purpose, maybe it is not his era to manipulate his skills in this domain anymore. PS: An unexpected surprise is to see the late Jill Clayburgh on screen (unfortunately only one scene in the beginning), she is a great actress, truly overlooked. RIP in heaven!",Love & Other Drugs
21,KineticSeoul,"Decent romantic comedy, plus you get to see the future Catwoman naked",6,19 February 2011,"When I saw the trailer to this flick in theater I was probably going to pass on in and just maybe see it if there isn't anything else. In another words I really wasn't anxious to see the movie, but I enjoyed watching this director's other films in the past so decided to give it a chance. Edward Zwick is a pretty darn good director and can make romantic comedies interesting and even has good dialogue in this. To my surprise though the direction of this movie wasn't simple as the trailer makes it seem. What I found even more shocking is how it shows Anne Hathaway naked in this, not that I found her all that attractive. She probably either liked the script and the dialogue or it's because she was gonna be involved with Jake Gyllenhaal in this or maybe both. The relationship this time is between a guy who is a good salesman and knows how to get what he wants especially sex and a girl who is straight to the point. She is basically all about sex and not about relationship, which maybe a dream to some guys but she has her reason. This really is a sex comedy for adults and not just because of the nudity and it's a complex love story that is put together alright. The first half of this movie had my attention with it's clever jokes but it starts to run out of steam after half way through, especially when it got to the part about Parkinson's disease. Really the movie started to drag when it got serious, if it kept it the same vibe from beginning to end it would have been a more enjoyable flick. The thing is the development of the characters aren't done in a way where you care for the two characters, especially Anne Hathaway's character neither did I care if they stay together or not. One actor that played his role flawlessly is Josh Gad, this is the first time I saw him on film but he played the role of a pathetic, obnoxious and annoying brother of Jake Gyllenhaal's character really well. It was just so believable.6.2/10",Love & Other Drugs
22,Hellmant,"Sex, Viagra, health problems and LOVE!",8,30 November 2010,"'LOVE AND OTHER DRUGS': Four Stars (Out of Five) Jake Gyllenhaal and Anne Hathaway re-team (they also played a couple in 'BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN') for this surprisingly raunchy sex comedy / dramatic romance. The film is directed by Edward Zwick (who directed such classic epics as 'GLORY', 'THE LAST SAMURAI', 'BLOOD DIAMOND', 'COURAGE UNDER FIRE' and 'LEGENDS OF THE FALL' to name a few). It's co-written by Zwick, Charles Randolph and Marshall Herskovitz and adapted from the book ""Hard Sell: The Evolution of a Viagra Salesman"" by Jamie Reidy. The film is full of explicit sex, nudity and crude jokes but it also tells a very serious and dramatic tale about love and relationships.Gyllenhaal stars as womanizing pharmaceutical salesman Jamie Randall. Randall has never known rejection but he's also never had a long lasting relationship as his deceptive charm and good looks have won over pretty much every woman he's ever encountered. His cunningness has helped with his job as well and allowed him to excel at his business with great speed. While shadowing a doctor he meets Maggie (Hathaway) who's suffering from the early stages of Parkinson's Disease. The two are immediately drawn to each other but she's not fooled by his usual tricks. Maggie isn't looking for anything serious either so the two enter into a strictly sexual relationship that of course develops into more. Jamie hits a hot streak with his company when they develop a new drug to solve impotence called Viagra, and he's the lead salesman, while Maggie gets sicker. This complicates their relationship as she doesn't want to get in his way of a happy life and to need him more than he needs her.The film surprisingly has a little bit of everything. It's frequently very funny, including some pretty crude sex jokes, it has lots of sex and nudity, some pretty hard hitting heavy drama as well as a love story to boot. It's greatest strength also might be it's biggest flaw as the film is a little too all over the place. Zwick's directing is good and the acting is all exceptional though. Gyllenhaal is one of my favorite actors and he shines here (although it's probably not an Oscar contending performance like he's been known to give in the past). I didn't used to be a fan of Hathaway's at all but over the last couple years she's proved to be a very talented and diverse actress (and she does turn in an award worthy performance here actually). It's kind of funny to see the old Disney 'PRINCESS DIARIES' girl naked so much as well and the two have great chemistry. Despite it's flaws the film works for the most part and it's certainly better than most of the romances Hollywood has to offer us.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDOVPaC9JIk",Love & Other Drugs
23,MLDinTN,It was OK but...,6,26 November 2011,"Jake Gyllenhaal's character changing wasn't believable in my opinion. Gyllenhaal plays Jamie, a smooth talking drug rep whom never settles down and tries to date every girl he can. One day while trying to sway a doctor, he meets Maggie at the office and is being an ""intern"" for the day. She's there to get scripts for her parkinson's. Jamie basically thinks she's hot, so tries to get her number, but is shot down. He just gets her number from the secretary. From there, the two start having bedroom romps and keep it very casual.Jamie finally tells Maggie he's in love. She's upset but decides to give it a shot. Eventually her parkinson's symptoms show up at times and deep down, Jamie really doesn't want to take care of a sick girl, which fits his character. But in the end, he has a change of heart, which is what I didn't think was believable considering the way his character acts.Also there's lots of sex and flashes of boob and butt if that interests you.FINAL VERDICT: I didn't think it was that great of a romance movie because Jamie is so unlikable with his sluttiness. But I recommend it if you think Gyllenhaal or Hathaway is hot.",Love & Other Drugs
24,secondtake,An overachieving feel good romantic comedy drama...its very good!,7,31 March 2012,"Love and other Drugs (2010)You might think this is yet another romantic comedy with a deeply moving undercurrent made to move you to tears. But this manages to be so consistently funny, and then so clearly tragic, it is really affecting. Jake Gyllenhaal is lovable in his slightly exaggerated and goofy way, and Anne Hathaway is charming and smart. And of course, the two of them are beautiful on screen, too, which keeps it all a bit Hollywood after all. There are flaws, like secondary characters who are just too clichéd to be believable, and like the amount of screen time given over to sex scenes which don't advance the plot or the emotional content one bit, but these are common ones, and easily absorbed in small doses.This is a clichéd kind of movie for a reason--it works. That's why they become clichés. We laugh and sympathize and follow both their intentions and all the surrounding jokes. And once we know the characters we begin to see what they lack, and what they might get from each other. Or not. (I give nothing away.)The larger plot (that doesn't totally matter but is ever-present) is the ins and outs of the pharmaceutical industry, especially the marketing of it. And the introduction of Viagra in 1998, which becomes a comic and central part of the movie. The disease that is far more troubling and important here than erectile dysfunction is Parkinson's, and the movie does pretty good at putting a human face to this still incurable disease. (At times the movie makes you think there might be a cure in sight, and Pfizer has something ready to announce. Not so. That much I give away.)So, I really liked this movie. It's too formulaic to win awards to turn into a classic, but if you want something mostly fun, fast, warm, and well written, give this a chance.",Love & Other Drugs
25,inkblot11,"Lovely story, with an honest look at Parkinson's Disease, but deserves its R rating",8,7 March 2011,"Jamie (Jake Gyllenhaal) is a player on the prowl, most days. Once a promising medical student, his ADD put an end to his studies and he now sells electronics and chases women. Naturally, he can't resist even the boss' lady and he gets fired. Promptly. His parents (George Segal and Jill Clayburgh) don't really push him or overly criticize him but hope that he signs on as a pharmaceutical salesman for a huge company. Not really having other professional goals, Jamie gets the drug job. Now, he and an older, mentoring salesman (Oliver Platt) are roaming the Midwest and trying to push Zoloft on doctors that have been prescribing Prozac, among other pills. Its a hard sell so Jamie goes to work, at first, on the pretty receptionists (one is the great Judy Greer). He does get his foot in the door but runs head to head with the competition, especially the smooth, sun-kissed topdog (Gabriel Macht). Resorting to underhanded tricks, like throwing other companies' pills in the trash, works rather well. One day, Jamie begs a doctor (Hank Azaria) to let him ""shadow"" the healer, to gain insight into what patients need. On the first go, Jamie runs smack into a beautiful female client, Maggie (Anne Hathaway) who, unbelievably, has Parkinson's Disease. An artist and photographer, Maggie is scared to get involved with men and terrified for her future health. She dislikes Jamie, first impressions, because she learns right away that he is not an intern concerned about her case but a slimy pharm-rep. But, Jamie works his way into her graces, for his interest is genuine. The two are definitely ""hot"" for each other and attempt some ground rules. Yet, every day Jamie and Maggie become closer, which complicates the situation for them both. Can Jamie, still working hard at his new career, deal with Maggie's worsening symptoms and will Maggie give up some independence and doubts to get closer to Jamie? This is quite a lovely film with two great performances by Gyllenhaal and Hathaway. Both of their characters are quite complex and not always likable but these two make them very compelling. The supporting cast, too, of Platt, Azaria, Macht, Greer and all of the others, are first rate as well. The setting, a middle-sized, hilly city in the Midwest, is lovely, as are the costumes, photography, and touching, truthful script. Then, too, the direction is fresh and right on target. The only unhappiness for some future viewers is the serious sexual nature of the film, which may not suit all. However, if you love romantic drama and very attractive stars, you could search all year and not find a better film than this one. So, go forth and get it, soon.",Love & Other Drugs

After meeting Maggie (Hathaway) in a doctor's office, Jamie (Gyllenhaal) tracks her down and the relationship begins. This is not at all what I expected, it was so much better. Going in all I heard about it from the interviews was...Anne Hathaway is naked a lot, there is rampant nudity and sex. This movie is much, much more then that. This is a movie about two, for lack of a better work, selfish people who start a relationship based solely on sex. They begin to develop real feelings for each other, and thats when they start to have problems. Much like ""Get Low"" this is another movie that got passed over at the ""Oscars"". I'm not talking best picture, but Anne Hathaway was fantastic in this and to not get nominated is a huge oversight. Gyllenhaal and Hathaway have great chemistry and it really helps you get more involved with the characters. This was a great film, full of laughs, tears and it makes you think.

In fact, after watching this film, I'm all the less likely to go to a movie with Gyllenhaal.The real problem I have with this film, however, is that where is there one character to actually like? Certainly not Gyllenhaal's character, who is low-life all around, and even more so when he becomes a rep for a drug company. Certainly not Anne Hathaway's character. Not Oliver Platt's character, or Hank Azaria's character. It's not that they don't do their acting jobs, it's just that you want to forget these characters and go wash yourself.

29,tabuno,One of the Best Use of Sex in a Romantic-Comedy-Drama,8,17 January 2019,"2 June 2013. What this movie does for soft porn and love is rather remarkable and it is used to great effect in this comedy turns romantic drama movie. It continues to offer Anne Hathaway a distinctive ability to show her acting range apart from her break out role in The Princess Diaries (2001) and her more popular comedy-drama such as The Devil Wears Prada (2006) that solidified her role as popular and reliable actress. Having already gone serious in Rachel Getting Married (2008) and taking the lead role in the psychological thriller Passengers (2008), Anne Hathaway has a delightful relational role in Love and Other Drugs as a rather eccentric and sometimes literally unhealthy character that offers plenty of sex, particularly in the first half of the movie.What makes this movie stand out from other comedy-drama-romance movies is its almost seamless and effective use of sex as part of the relational activities in this movie. Unlike the more graphic, visceral and isolated but effective sex scenes of a man's history comes back to haunt him in A History of Violence (2005) or the period Las Vegas drama in The Cooler (2003), Love and Other Drugs breaks new ground in presenting sex as the legitimate background upon which to present a solid relational themed movie. And unlike the classic relational playfulness of Audrey Hepburn in the classic mystery-thriller Charade (1963), the over the top but hilarious comedic emphasis of Sandra Bullock of All Above Steve (2009), the distant and neglectful male character focus of the haunting relational movie of Jennifer Love Hewitt's If Only (2004), or the purely comedic but delightful relationship found in Music and Lyrics (2007), the focus on the relationship parallels much more closely real love life cycle of infatuation and sex towards the more darker, layered, conflicting elements of a deepening relationship along with a fascinating look a marketing drug representative as a love interest.This movie avoids the harsher look at relationship as in American Beauty (2000) or the stylized over the top but intriguing magical fantasy of the ideal relational entanglements of The Great Gatsby (2013) or bewitching and just as necessarily stylized romantic ideal in contemporary silent movie The Artist (2011). With elements from the romantic drama Sweet November (2001) or even the movie classic Love Story (1970), Love and Other Drugs takes a more layered and uncertain but just as effective path in its storyline. In some ways the story takes a similar track but with more lightness than A Man and A Woman (French, 1966) in its portrayal of a close male-female relationship making this movie a carefully balanced mainstream movie with a distinctive bent for independent realism.",Love & Other Drugs
30,Rodrigo_Amaro,Good movie but it tries to be too many confusing things,9,16 March 2011,"""Love & Other Drugs"" is a funny, dramatic and romantic love story between Jamie (Jake Gyllenhaal) and Maggie (Anne Hathaway); he's a Pfizer's representant who sells new drugs to doctors, and she is a young patient of one of Jamie's potential clients, and she's has Parkinson disease. The background of this story is the appearance of a new revolutionary medication in the treatment of masculine sexual impotence, the famous Viagra, successfully released in the 1990's, and guess who is interested to sell it? Jamie, a sexy and very seductive guy who finally found his place in the world doing something he likes mixing with what he does best (that includes seducing and sleeping with the beautiful doctor's secretaries). But life has some surprises for him. His relationship with Maggie starts with no strings attached, it's just lots of sex and he thinks he can manage that (as he always did in the past) but for some reason he really starts to like her, he's deeply in love and wants more from her. Maggie seems to have mixed feeling about him and the whole situation, she doesn't want to be a burden to anyone because of her disease, and she knows that sooner or later he might walk out of her. Then...Edward Zwick's film moves in too many different genres and shows so many things that it left many viewers bothered and angered, or disappointed, and it's very difficult to say something really good about it, specially for those people who expected just one thing from the film, a comedy. It is a comedy. But, it goes for a erotic side (and unbelievably hated for most audiences) showing Jamie's sex encounters and later it evolves to a drama about Maggie's problems, without leaving the goofy comedy on the side. It is so messed up that is very confuse to say which part is the most interesting and what's not. It tries to be too much when it could be just one thing: Or it could be a dramatic love story, or a romantic comedy, or a historical tale about the Viagra boom in society (and that could have been an excellent film), or it could be just a comedy with giant laughs.I liked the film, the performances of the main actors (Jake is very funny, Anne is dramatically interesting, Oliver Platt steals the show in a few moments), but there was too many problems in the screenplay (again!). The inclusion of Jamie's brother in the story just to make us laugh didn't worked except for one scene or two; the notion of what love really is gets kind of distorted, Hollywood goes to show that sex comes first and then ""Oops, now I love you"" kind of thing which is becoming annoying in films; the melodramatic conclusion with lots of clichés; those things made the film very regular.What lifts this movie up is all the things concerning Maggie's disease (but I think some of Anne moments while portraying a Parkinson's victim wasn't so realistic) and one reunion between Parkinson's patients, a very moving scene (but way too much for a comedy); also great is when Jamie is presented by his boss (played by Oliver Platt) into the world of selling Pfizer's products and how things work between the representants and doctors, a hard business to sell, and a little bit, at my point of view, unethical and disloyal. All the things concerning the medical aspects worked but the story could have focus more on Viagra's appearance and its impact on society; by the way the movie should be focused on just that, and a story could be created from here.At last but not least the debated controversial about the sex scenes presented here. People who disliked them are hypocritical and too sensitive and that's it. These scenes were important to the plot? Yes and no. It was a way to show how good Jamie's life really was before saying that he really loves someone, and these scenes are only for us to make a pattern contrast of his life. It was too much, it was excessive? At some parts it was but nothing so harmful as many viewers classified it to be. It's very soft, there's some nudity (mostly from Jake, oh yes!!!), but perhaps it doesn't fit here quiet right and less could be better. It's difficult to not walk out of this film with some mixed feelings, and that is something everybody will notice and we can all blame the screenwriters for not setting their goal right, and for not deciding what they would like to do. They almost messed up a good movie, but luckily we have a great cast, some good moments and the importance of love and some drugs in our lives. 9/10",Love & Other Drugs
31,Floated2,Started off strong then dragged along and got serious,5,27 January 2011,"Many of the trailers I've seen for this film, made it look as if it was a raunchy type sex comedy. However, the film is rather more serious (still with a lot of sex scenes) and less funny. The film starts off pretty well and convincingly funny with a few clever jokes, then it takes a turn into a drama.Love & Other Drugs stars Jake Gyllenhaal as Jamie, a living, breathing ball of undiluted libidinous charisma whose lust for the opposite sex outstrips his lust for life in general. Whip-smart, but largely lacking in ambition, Jamie gets fired from his job selling stereos and he uses a family contact to get in on the ground floor of pharmaceutical sales with Pfizer. The story starts in 1996, just on the cusp of the introduction of Viagra. Until that game-changer is in place, most of Jamie's time -- shepherded by his more experienced sales partner, Bruce (Oliver Platt) -- seems to be spent trying to get doctors to switch their prescriptions for depressives from Prozac to Xanax.""Love and Other Drugs"" goes from romantic comedy to romantic drama and does not seem to know which direction to go in. I found the film depressing and did not care for the chemistry between Anne Hathaway and Jake Gyllenhaal. Overall, I really didn't care for Hathaway, even towards the 2nd half of the film when she was in pain and sick. Her character just seemed too disrespectful and unconscious. Everything felt forced and unauthentic. I expected more from this.",Love & Other Drugs
32,Movie_Muse_Reviews,Good chemistry is the best drug for any standard romance,6,25 November 2010,"Love stories are essentially the same -- it's a matter of how you dress  them up. Many will see through ""Love and Other Drugs"" and count the  romance clichés and formulaic characters, others will find the 1996  setting and the pharmaceutical angle refreshing. Both forces are hard  at work in this film, but the tipping point goes in favor thanks to the  leads, Jake Gyllenhaal and Anne Hathaway.  There's a reason most romantic films are judged based on the chemistry  of their lead actors. When it comes to romance, it's not about how  cleverly written the two characters are and how unique and special they  feel to us. What counts is whether they can convince you of their  attraction/love and get you to -- without blunt coercion -- invest in  what happens to them. Gyllenhaal and Hathaway have what it takes to do  just that in spite of a script that sometimes tries to lean too hard on  conventional tactics of boys meets girl.  Gyllenhaal plays Jamie, an expert salesman who lands a gig as a  pharmaceutical sales rep for Pfizer, right before Viagra hit the  market. He's also adept at landing any woman he desires. He epitomizes  a Don Juan and he's plays the type well, but when you can predict that  he'll end up in bed with the next attractive woman that shows up on  screen, the writing has taken it a bit far.   As good of a filmmaker as Edward Zwick is, his best credits include  ""Glory,"" ""The Last Samurai"" and ""The Blood Diamond"" -- not exactly  romance. He co-wrote the script (based on Jamie Reidy's memoir) with  longtime collaborator Marshall Herskovitz and thriller writer Charles  Randolph (""The Interpreter""), so no real romantic comedy prowess exists  among them, hence the tendency to stick with genre conventions. One  such convention is Jamie's brother (Josh Gad), who plays the little  brother crashing on Jamie's couch who has a porn addiction and makes  clueless statements, usually to the tune of no laughs, but he does help  break the tension.  Enter girl. Jamie meets Maggie, a bit of a free-spirited cynic who (in  a unique twist) has way early onset Parkinson's. Many will be quick to  jump on the ""diseased girl"" archetype, but don't judge Hathaway's  prowess that quickly. As completely pathetic as Maggie's self-esteem  might be and how strictly anti-commitment she is, when her character  caves in to the romance as they all do, Hathaway gives Maggie a  believable fragility rather than a melodramatic tone.   Jamie's motives for wanting to spend more time with Maggie and not  simply continuing his streak of banging all who possess lady parts are  reduced to the reason of ""she's playing hard to get,"" which is not the  best of reasons. The same can be said about Maggie constantly accusing  Jamie of having pity sex with the diseased girl. However, watching  these two charm each other and overcome the cliché has a definite  appeal.  The two spend a lot of naked time together, making ""Love and Other  Drugs"" the best date movie this holiday season. But on a serious note,  the drug angle and the ""recent past"" setting give us something else to  chew on, which is nice. Zwick never truly marries that story line with  the romance except ""Jamie sells drugs and Maggie has a disease that  lacks an effective one."" The thematic ties are not quite there despite  the plot coincidences and the fitting title.  ""Love and Other Drugs"" is hardly the cure for the common romantic  comedy, but the consistent dosage of its two stars by and large pushes  away those symptoms.  ~Steven C",Love & Other Drugs

There was too much sex scenes,too much of nudity going on and the plot was just dreadful. OK so what is it about well its about a guy who's a sales rep for sex drugs played by Jake Gyllenhal and he meets and later falls for a girl called Maggie played by Anne Hathaway who I must admit was very good in this movie who was at the doctors when he was selling the drugs and the two click. So there's lots and I mean LOTS of sex going on between the two.But what the guy doesn't know is that Maggie is suffering from Parkinson's disease. If you are a fan of Anne Hathaway then check it out,but if you don't like watching Pornographic sex scenes then I would say avoid at all costs.NOT for children strictly for adults 18 over.",Love & Other Drugs
34,meeza,"I had mixed side effects on how I reacted to the cinematic dosage of ""Love and Other Drugs""",7,27 November 2010,"Love makes the world go round, and other drugs make the girl go down. OK, maybe that is not the tagline of the new romantic comedy ""Love and Other Drugs"", but maybe it should be. Acclaimed Director Edward Zwick's movie had its grand moments, but also had its share of overdose of romantic-comedy plot formulism during the film's final act. Let me drug you up, with some ""punicillin"" of course, on my subjectivity of this movie. ""Love and Other Drugs"" is set in 1996. Jake Gyllenhaal stars as Jamie Randall, a lothario go-getter who winds up employed at Pfizer Pharmaceuticals as a marketing rep. During his unsuccessful visits to pitch the anti-depressant Zoloft for el medicos to carry, Jamie ends up meeting Maggie Murdock played by Anne Hathaway. Maggie is beautiful and witty. She has Stage 1 Parkinson's Disease. At first, Jamie and Maggie don't take each other too seriously, but definitely take each other sexually serious under the sheets. I never thought that Donnie Darko and a Princess with a diary can have so much sexual chemistry, but that is what Gyllenhaal and Hathaway can do in their heated intercourse scenes; hats off to Hathaway for being a breast ahead of her famous actress counterparts by bearing her naked body on screen. OK, like many other male humanoids, I was once diagnosed with Male Chauvinistism, Is there a drug for that? OK, back to the narrative explanation of ""Love and Other Drugs"". Jamie's pharmaceutical rep career gets a lift when he starts selling the ""fresh off FDA approval"" wonder drug Viagra. He actually becomes some type of Viagra superhero. Even though how hard can it be to pitch the V? However, things really start to get hard for Jamie with his relationship with Maggie. The rest of the Jamie & Maggie ""love and other drugs"" story I will leave it for you to medicate I mean meditate on. Credit to Edward Zwick and co-screenwriter Charles Randolph for developing a highbrow and atypical romantic-comedic scribe during the film's first two acts. But the last act of the movie gets a case of the PMD (Predictable Movie Disease) that plagues most romantic-comedies. Besides their titillating sexual chemistry, Gyllenhaal and Hathaway did pull in charismatic starring performances. Josh Gad did provide some scene-stealing comic relief in his supporting role as Jamie's younger brother Josh. But most of the rest of the supporting cast of ""Love and Other Drugs"" seemed like they had rather be in other movies, including Oliver Platt as Jamie's pharmaceutical trainer, Hank Azaria as a burned-out sexed-crave doctor, and Judy Greer as a medical assistant burning for Jamie. These are not bad actors, but they were prescribed to play the same old characters they have played countless of times in other movies. I was pleased by the inclusion of 70's movies acting legends George Segal and the late Jill Clayburgh playing Jamie's parents, but why were they just in one scene! ""Love and Other Drugs"" did give me a rise for two-thirds of the movie, but its climax was too soft for my taste. OK, scratch that last pun! *** Average",Love & Other Drugs
35,estebangonzalez10,My Review: Love and Other Drugs,6,21 February 2011,"¨I don't know – you meet thousands of people and none of them really touch you. And then you meet that one person and your life is changed.¨ Love and Other Drugs is not a great film, but it is much better than most romantic comedies that have come out lately. I don't know if you can call this a rom-com, it is much more dramatic and the comedy is left mostly for the supporting characters. Jake Gyllenhaal and Anne Hathaway are both great actors and they have excellent chemistry together. They've worked together in the past when they played a couple in Brokeback Mountain, but this was a different type of film. The movie doesn't just focus on the romance and comedy, it also tries to tell the history of how Viagra became such a hit in the 90's for the Pfizer pharmaceutical industry. It's in trying to balance these two separate stories that the film fails to connect with audiences in a higher level due to the time constraints of the film. We don't have enough time to concentrate on either the drama or the romance and everything seems to lead to nowhere. It's as if they tried to make two separate movies. The film is loosely based on Jamie Reidy's book ¨Hard Sell: The Evolution of a Viagra Salesman.¨ The part that's based on the book is the history of the blue pill. The romantic side of the story was added by the screenwriters, among them director: Edward Zwick (known for Glory, Legends of the Fall, and Blood Diamond). The romantic story is engaging, as is the dramatic side which in a way shows how corrupt the pharmaceutical system can be. It's just not about saving people's lives anymore, it's about making a profit. That is why pharmaceutical companies spend so much money on a performance enhancing drug instead of trying to discover cures for Parkinson disease, which is a lot less demanding.Jamie Randall (Jake Gyllenhaal) is a charming young man who always seems to get his way with the ladies. He's not searching for a relationship or anything serious, he just wants to have a good time and the females aren't making his task any harder. Jamie worked as a salesman at an electronic store and he was pretty good at it thanks to his charm, but his trouble with the ladies gets him fired after he sleeps with the manager's girlfriend. Jamie has no trouble at all finding a new job and he soon ends up working as a sales representative for Pfizer trying to convince doctors to recommend their medicine over other pharmaceutical companies. Apparently Pfizer wasn't that big before Viagra, so they were having a hard time making it in the market. Jamie's selling partner is Bruce (played by the very funny Oliver Platt) and together they dream of selling enough in order to get recommended for a bigger market like Chicago. Jamie begins to use his charm with the secretaries and receptionists in order to get appointment with doctors. One of his biggest clients is Dr. Stan Knight (Hank Azaria) who allows him one day to stick with him at the clinic where he meets one of his patients: Maggie Murdock (Anne Hathaway). She suffers from stage one of Parkinson disease and knows everything there is to know about pharmaceuticals. Jamie becomes obsessed over her and they soon begin a physical relationship without any of them wanting to become attached to each other. Jamie because he's a womanizer and Maggie because she feels sorry for herself and has built an emotional wall over her in order to prevent getting hurt by love. At first the deal works well for both of them, but over time emotions begin to get in the way.The romantic story is actually pretty believable and it feels real. Gyllenhaal and Hathaway have great chemistry together. There is a lot of nudity in this film and it isn't your typical rom-com. It tries to be more raw and real, but I wasn't too engaged with the story. There was just too much going on without anything actually happing. When the story seems like it's going to focus on the relationship between both characters it jumps to the history of Viagra, and when it seems to get serious and focus on how corrupt the medical system has become (there is a particular scene where Dr. Knight tells Jamie that he got into medicine to save lives, but now the system has got to him) then it jumps back to the romantic side all over again. The highlight of this movie are the performances from both lead characters. The secondary characters are really all not that important and they never are developed very well. They seem to be there for the comedic scenes only, while the leads are in it for the dramatic roles. Jamie and Maggie are the only characters who are really developed in this story. Overall the film gave me the feeling that it could have been so much better, but they just didn't manage to balance the drama with the romance well enough. They tried to make two separate movie into one and it didn't work. I would recommend this for the strong lead performances only.http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/",Love & Other Drugs
36,smatysia,Worth a look,7,14 February 2012,"Well, I liked it OK. Some amusing bits early on. Jake Gyllenhaal was OK as the drug rep. Anne Hathaway joked a year ago or so, when she was hosting the Oscars, that she didn't get a nomination even though she got naked. But the real reason she might have expected an Oscar nomination, is that actresses so often do when they play the sick, or the retarded, or the demented, or something like that where they are willing to look ""bad"" on camera. (Bad for Anne Hathaway is pretty good for most people) Anyway, she was pretty, and charming, and total eye candy in her naughtier scenes. It seemed like this film was three or so different genres crammed into one movie. Hard to say what would have made it better, but I suppose there is something. Still worth a look.",Love & Other Drugs
37,juneebuggy,Enjoyed this more when it took a turn towards the dramatic in the second half,5,9 December 2014,"This was okay, getting better towards the end when it takes a turn towards the dramatic and loses the bad comedic edge it had going. Anne Hathaway is (less annoying than usual here) as a free spirited woman who won't let anything or anyone tie her down -she is also suffering from Parkinson's. She meets her match however in ""Jamie"" (Jake Gyllenhaal -looking good) an ultra charming drug rep working for Pfizer.Their evolving relationship takes them both by surprise and I particularly enjoyed watching Jamie's character grow up. There were some sexy love scenes here I wasn't expecting and that moment where Jamie realizes that he's fallen in love and has a panic attach, very well done.

Although, I feel like this film was very sex obsessed, which is NOT good for any film. I understand that sex was necessary to this movies plot, but their is NO need for overloading on it. I mean I just felt a lot of it was unnecessary. I did feel sort of bored in parts, and some of the humor wasn't funny and just didn't really work. Jake Gylanhaal's fat friend in the film was very annoying and I felt like his character would have been better played by a different actor. Jake and Anne did have great chemistry in the film, which was essential to a movie like this. That was Love and other drugs's best quality was the lead stars's chemistry when on screen together.

Obtained the movie, but the box art generally strikes you as a romantic comedy, so I was quite surprised by that scene where Anne disrobed to be surprised by Josh Gad.There are movies out there who purport to be sexual, but they aren't ever as classy sexy as this one. Yes, there is a considerable mix-up of genres in this film, with something for everybody thrown in. One moment it is a romantic comedy, then it is clear that tragedy is inevitably around the corner, but interspersed are some of the sexiest scenes done on film, and then we're back with much, much bleaker stuff again.Morgan Freeman referred to Anne Hathaway as ""the naked girl from LOVE & OTHER DRUGS""...

40,3xHCCH,Inside Stuff about Pfizer Was More Interesting Than the Love Story,6,18 January 2011,"Suave Jamie (Jake Gyllenhaal), whose charm and gift of gab can sell anything and get women into bed. When he gets into the job of medical representative for Pfizer, he meets a pretty young Parkinson Stage 1 patient Maggie (Anne Hathaway). What starts as a relationship based on casual sex eventually becomes something deeper, and that was when complications come in, with regards to his career against her disease. Which will win out in the end?Aside from the uncommon setting in the pharmaceutical industry, the story is pretty old hat and familiar. It is also unusual that a romantic comedy movie starring A-list stars will actually feature a lot of nudity from these stars, and place them into B-sex comedy situations. While the first half of the film was zippy and funny, the second half turns serious and draggy in parts. Of course, when there is a disease in the equation, it is bound to turn weepy, and it does.The chemistry and charm of Jake and Anne is what this film lives on. The two of them look very good and excellent in the delivery of goof-ball dialog. Anne was pretty funny in that scene with her delivery of double entendres about impotence. Although her role turns dramatic towards the end, it is too bad that she had to unfairly compete with Annette Bening (who had a totally serious role in ""The Kids Are Alright"") for the Golden Globe for Best Actress in a Comedy. Jake I think is a natural for this kind of role. I can actually imagine him being like his Jamie character in real life. I don't think he had to do much acting.The character of Jamie's obese nerdy brother Josh (Josh Gad)was for me totally extraneous and distracting. He does the gross-out comedy here, and frankly it was annoying and unrealistic. The character of Dr. Knight (Hank Azaria) shows the conflict of doctors and pharmaceuticals (which I am familiar with), along with their sexual escapades (which I never knew happens).For me, the background stories about drug giant Pfizer, the fight of Zoloft vs. Prozac, Viagra, the job of the medical representatives, and the plight of Parkinson patients, are far more interesting than the very basic love story which this movie is telling.",Love & Other Drugs

42,EUyeshima,Love and Pain and the Whole Enchilada in a Tonal Whiplash of a Dramedy,6,13 March 2011,"To call this 2010 romantic dramedy uneven would be a severe understatement. It suffers from downright ADD as it moves from a snapshot of manic arrested development to pharmaceutical satire to near-porn to romantic comedy to medical melodrama. That the film was directed by Edward Zwick (""Glory"") suddenly makes sense when you think about how he and fellow producer Marshall Hersokowitz created a similarly toned TV series, ""thirtysomething"", back in the late eighties. Both of them also co-wrote the screenplay along with Charles Randolph based on James Reidy's 2005 book, ""Hard Sell"" The Evolution of a Viagra Salesman"". However, what works over several TV seasons doesn't work as well within a 112-minute running time. Fortunately, Zwick chose two attractive leads, Jake Gyllenhaal and Anne Hathaway, to star in this basically schizophrenic movie, and both perform admirably under the circumstances.Beginning in 1996, the plot revolves around Jamie Randall, a young medical school drop-out just fired from a sales job at an electronics store. A typical commitment-phobe, he manages to land a job through his younger brother Josh, an obnoxiously wealthy dot-commer, as a pharmaceutical rep for Pfizer selling Zoloft and eventually Viagra. While accompanying an influential doctor on his rounds, Jamie meets Maggie Murdock, a pretty free spirit with early onset Parkinson's disease. They waste little time in having sex, an arrangement that suits both their situations and libidos. However, it's inevitable that one wants more out of the relationship, and Jamie convinces Maggie to take it to the next level. At a Parkinson's convention in Chicago, they come away with a more palpable sense of what the long-term effects of the disease will be on Maggie. This naturally tests their relationship as they face the prospect of her condition worsening.More at home than as ""The Prince of Persia"" in the sixth century B.C., Gyllenhaal takes on a George Clooney-type role in Jamie with convincing self-assurance. Perhaps because ""The Princess Dairies"" will never entirely leave her screen persona (note her recent Oscar gig as evidence of her cheerleading tendencies), Hathaway does surprisingly well portraying a sexual hedonist keeping a deliberate emotional distance from everybody. The two banter sharply and handle their characters' sexual combustion with élan. When the film threatens to move into ""Sweet November""-type melodrama, the actors avert the heart-tugging predictability with their emotional alertness. As the chubby younger brother, Josh Gad is as irritating as an evasive fly in an unessential role designed to provide intermittent comic relief but failing miserably in what amounts to a Jonah Hill impersonation.The other actors are fine but make mostly truncated appearances - Oliver Platt as a blustery Pfizer salesman, Hank Azaria as the seasoned go-between doctor, Gabriel Macht as a competing rep with anger management issues, George Segal and the late Jill Clayburgh as Jamie's concerned parents in an early and all-too-brief dining table scene. It's also worth noting that Steven Fierberg's sharp cinematography captures the various Midwest locations really well, and Steven Rosenblum's action-movie-style editing captures the manic energy Zwick appears to have wanted during the film's first half. The 2011 DVD/Blu-Ray offers relatively few extras - about seven minutes of deleted scenes, the original theatrical trailer, and four quick featurettes (""Love & Other Drugs"": An Actor's Discussion"", ""Beautifully Complex: Anne Hathaway is Maggie"", ""Reformed Womanizer: Jake Gyllenhaal is Jamie"", and ""Selling Love & Other Drugs"" which features Reidy. Surprisingly, there is no education piece about Parkinson's disease, a missed opportunity.",Love & Other Drugs

What I liked: I'm still working on that one.What I didn't care for: There was nothing romantic here. The leads had no chemistry whatsoever. The only thing perfect was her make up. No matter how distressed she was or how much she cried, it was impeccable. Did we need the character of the brother? The Viagra jokes. Why did this film have to offend ""Porky's"".

44,Enchorde,Actually a good romantic comedy...,7,15 August 2011,"There are a few things about Love and Other Drugs. But first of all, let's just say it's a fun romantic comedy. It isn't through and through hilarious like There's something about Mary, but more balanced with a few weird moments that spins the movie out of the ordinary. It also has a darker, sadder tint with Maggie's illness, Parkinson, and the deep sadness that she harbors because of it. It is always present but doesn't come through until the end. Together Love and Other Drugs is a real good movie, and I liked it. But yes, there are a few things to comment.Nudity. Yes there is nudity. A lot of it. Motivated? No, not really, but it isn't at all sleazy or over the top either. Didn't really augment the movie, and would probably been as good without most of it, but then it didn't hurt either.The brother. He on the other hand is sleazy and sometimes over the top. On the other hand he is also the source of a few of the funnier scenes. Don't know if I love or hate him. He is there anyway, and you won't forget him.Known actors. Yes it is quite unexpected that Gyllenhaal and Hathaway both appear without so much clothes, but that is not what I meant to say. Love and Other Drugs have an impressing cast, with lot of good supporting actors. Without them Love and Other Drugs wouldn't have come close to what it is. Most of all, Oliver Platt once again impresses. But add Hank Azaria, Gabriel Macht, George Segal, Kathryn Winnick, Kimberly Scott and Judy Greer. That's an impressive cast right there.Finally and most surprisingly, Love and Other Drugs has a real good soundtrack. Set around the turn of the millennium a lot of good old favorite songs turn up.Together, it all makes Love and Other Drugs a real good entertaining movie.

45,dierregi,"Not much love, but plenty of mindless sex",3,10 January 2011,"Much as I like Anne Hathaway, who is gorgeous and a good actress, trying to break free from stereotyped girlfriend roles, I found this movie a manipulative mess. It is supposed to have a slightly dramatic background, involving serious illnesses and the misdeeds of the pharmaceutical industry, but it turn out as a limp comedy of some sort.Both main characters are as unsympathetic as they could be. At least, I found them chilling as human beings: the Jake's character is a shallow, serial womanizer, and also a Viagra pusher. The Anne's character is selfish, rude and swallowing in self-pity. Both claim not to have ever said ""I love you"" to another living creature. Such an achievement They get involved in having casual sex, and they have plenty of it. In fact, so much that the movie gets boring. It is unfortunate that two gifted and very good-looking actors cannot conjure any real thrill or chemistry, even if their stunning naked bodies are often in displays in various coupling positions.The plot involves also Jake's brother, as a repulsive, half-wit, greedy character who was dumped by his wife and has to shack up with Jack and some equally greedy doctors and employees in the pharmaceutical field. Everything wrapped up with plenty of nudity in display, vulgar speech and bad taste jokes, as it is unfortunately the norm in most so-called comedies.I guess the audience is supposed to sympathize with poor, young Anne, so incurably (but not terminally) sick, but her character is so fake and selfish that the task of feeling sorry for her is impossible. Besides, only in movies sick people want ""to be left alone"". That is such a cliché I truly wish it was outlawed from movies. I seriously doubt any sick person wants ""to be left alone"". Sickness implies fragility and the need for help. Of course there might be exceptions. However, only in movies loneliness seems to be the rule for the sick.

After a breezy and exceptionally humorous first half hour, Love and Other Drugs turns into a case of the latter. Jake Gyllenhaal and Anne Hathaway, may be at the top of their game, but the material surrounding them is not.Director Edward Zwick who is a somewhat baroque filmmaker, responsible for such bold delicious epics as Glory and the Last Samuri, along with some questionable epics like Legends of the Fall and Defiance may seem out of place doing comedy, but I don't think that is the problem. The story is underwritten and poorly edited, leaving Love and other Drugs feeling shredded, with too many small insignificant scenes and too many abrupt mood swings. As a comedy, there are a few laughs to be had, as a romance it feels reasonably authentic, and Hathoway/Gyllenhaal are able to work quite well off each other, but the movie needs to be tidied up a bit.",Love & Other Drugs

48,p-stepien,Tid and bits,5,10 February 2013,"Jamie Randall (Jake Gyllenhaal) possessing an incurable ailment known as lack of moral spine. Focused only on monetary gain and using his personal charm to corrupt those around him (mostly women). After losing his job as an electronic hardware salesman in Pittsburgh when being caught sleeping with the store manager's girlfriend, Jamie decides to enter into the lucrative business of being a drug rep in the 1990s. Fitting in perfectly to the immoral business of backstabbing, snake-charming your way into hospitals and other health care outlets, Jamie soon starts building up his clientèle, mainly through satisfying varying needs of nurses. During one hospital visitation he encounters the lively and uncompromising Maggie Murdock (Anne Hathaway), incurably sick with Parkinson's disease. This evolves into a sex-only relationship, where Jamie's lack of commitment and moral-free charm-laden demeanour seems the perfect mix for Maggie's needs. Naturally things get complicated, when Jamie starts falling madly in love with the enigmatic artist. Meanwhile Pfizer is about to release Viagra onto the market...""Love and Other Drugs"" starts off extremely poorly with a contrived sequence of Jamie dancing and partying with his store clients trying to sell some hi-fi equipment. Lacking sincerity and any sense of charm, this unfortunately sets the benchmark of things to come. Struggling in his persona, Gyllenhaal just seems too inately sweet and thus unfitting to the guise of a ruthless, self-centred and slightly goofish prick, instead more attuned when he reverts to a more in-character good guy with flaws. Placed on the shoulders of a gimmicky Pfizer sales rep story, where the immorality of selling drugs is used for effect, but hardly makes any in roads to question the practise, apart from one half-hearted drug and alcohol induced heart-to-heart talk with a down-trodden surgeon Dr. Stan Knight (Hank Azaria) who has foregone the ideals of his youth.Zwick's movie only really gets a much needed boost when Anne Hathaway enters the fray with her more layered and contradictory character of a person sentenced to life with a debilitating illness, but trying to make the most of herself, despite this. Here enters a story strongly reminiscent of ""My Sweet November"" (with Keanu Reeves and Charlize Theron), but lacking the same conviction and sensibility, instead laden by conventionality. Nonetheless Hathaway livens up proceedings making ""Love and Other Drugs"" a less irritating watch, making the onslaught of sentimentality a more digestible dish.",Love & Other Drugs
49,Matt_Layden,Poorly Balanced.,6,5 April 2011,"My biggest gripe with this film is that it's a mixed bag of forced emotions. First we are introduced to a character who has stage 1 parkinsons. This little known fact gets really emotional during parts of the film and we feel sorry for the characters who are in tears on the screen. Then we have numerous upon numerous sex scenes in which both stars get naked and show their best sides. Now we have awkwardness in the room when you watch it with your girlfriend and mother. Then we get forced comedy that no one seems to laugh at and it you just sit there waiting for the next awkward sex scene to come up. Love and Other Drugs is a well made film, from a technical stand point, but not something that sticks to one specific genre. The story is clichéd, as all romantic comedies (the genre I have decided to give it) are. Two opposite people have one mutual common aspect in their lives. They enjoy each other's company, in this case it's the meaningless sex. She wants to just have a great time and not get emotionally involved with someone who will split the moment they find out they need to physically take care of her later on in life. He is a playboy that finally finds the one person who makes him feel different, and she just happens to be this free spirited chick who doesn't let him get what he wants. Both leads are great looking and work well off each other. They had great chemistry and their relationship worked for the most part. The comedic relief was in the form of an ugly low life brother who is obsessed with sex. So much that he masturbates to a video of his brother having sex with his girlfriend. Cue laughter? The film had a lot going on, it felt like a bunch of different movies rolled into one. Each story had their own little arc that eventually kind of went nowhere. The millionaire brother aspect was a bust from the beginning. The viagra parts are hit and miss, then Parkinsons aspect tugs at the heartstrings and then leaves for a bit, only to show up later at the end. There are subplots involving ex-lovers, bosses, drugs in Canada. Too much happening in this movie, you loose focus of what you're suppose to be paying attention to. Love & Other Drugs is a film that I can recommend to the casual movie goer. It will make some people laugh, cry and cheer for the couple, as most movies try to do. I just found it to be a little disjointed and a movie that's simply known because of naked Hathaway...ain't that great a movie.",Love & Other Drugs
50,lewiskendell,"Okay, but only half the movie it could have been.",6,15 March 2011,"""I'm going to need you more than you need me.""Love and Other Drugs is bi-polar. It gradually transitions from fun and light to melodramatic and deathly serious, and I can't say that it manages that switch completely successfully. Some people will prefer the sexy fun of the first half (like me), and others will find the more emotional latter half to be more involving (not like me), but I doubt most will equally enjoy both parts (I didn't). And one of the main characters is probably one of the most annoying ever written, and the movie would have automatically been about 10% better without him in it (has Josh Gad ever been even slightly funny in anything?).Other than that stuff, Love and Other Drugs is pretty decent. The characters are interesting and semi-realistic, it avoids being excessively sappy or predictable (at least, until the end), and Jake Gyllenhaal and Anne Hathaway have chemistry coming out the wazoo.Love and Other Drugs could have been something awesome, but it fails to live up to its full potential by eventually giving in to the same clichés that 75% of the movies in this genre slavishly adhere to.

51,bob-rutzel-1,Drug for Chemistry Was Missing,4,20 September 2011,"Maggie (Hathaway) has Parkinson's and meets Jamie (Gyllenhaal) who doesn't seem to care that Maggie has that disease. Jamie is a pharmaceutical salesman who sells Pfizer drugs Zoloft, and Viagra and he is on the rise. Let's see,.. this seems to be a story about a pharmaceutical salesman who meets a girl who likes sex but doesn't want a relationship. And, this works for a while, but you and I know that one is going to fall in love. Yes, we are psychic.Or, it's a story about Pfizer and Viagra and let the good times roll.Or, it's almost an X-rated story about a girl who likes sex, still doesn't want a relationship.Or, it's really about Parkinson's and that nothing can be done about it to a point senior citizens go to Canada for cheaper meds for the disease. Or, it is simply a love story about a girl with Parkinson's who meets a salesman who says that is okay for now, and leaves when the girl tells him to leave because it isn't fair to him. Most of the acting in here is good, but Gyllenhaal in the beginning, as a electronics salesman, wasn't into it and this seemed to be quite a stretch for him. I saw in his eyes that he wasn't into it. Could be wrong, but the eyes never lie. However, when he meets Hathaway all that changes and he is now committed to the role. The chemistry between Gyllenhaal and Hathaway really wasn't that good. If it was, I would have reached for the Kleenix at least once. Didn't happen as that is my gauge. I didn't think Anne Hathaway needed to be in the buff all that much as we got the point of the love story  such as it was. The getting-to-know-you romance in the beginning lasted too long. The sex bouts lasted too long (however the 7th and 8th graders who sneaked in said they weren't long enough). The real story was the Parkinson's thing and they should have gotten to that sooner. Don't look for comedy at anytime in the movie. It wasn't there except for the Parkinson's jokes at a meeting of people afflicted with Parkinson's. Yeah, some were lame and we heard them years ago. This is not good for a new movie as there should have been some new joke material here. But also at this Un-convention was a man whose wife was in the 4th stage of Parkinson's and he tells Jamie the facts of life as to what to expect if he continues with Maggie.Josh Gad as Josh Randall was miscast. He probably was supposed to be the comic relief, but was just annoying with dirty sex talk. Also, I was somewhat disappointed in Oliver Platt as Bruce Winston. I regard him highly as a Class A actor and I don't like to see or hear him use the language he used and to be so animated? What is this world coming to?There was a girl in here that Jamie called Lisa (Winnick) and she looked very much like Scarlett Johansson. And, very pretty. Hope to see more of her. All in all too long, too many sub plots, too many F-bombs, and not the chemistry there should have been between the two stars. Violence: No. Sex: Yes, too often. Nudity: Yes, too often. Lesbian Scene: Brief kissing. Language: Yes.",Love & Other Drugs
52,moviexclusive,A mildly amusing adult comedy saved by a pair of adorable leads,7,5 January 2011,"Sometimes, all it takes to make a successful romantic comedy is having two extremely likable and good-looking leads with sizzling chemistry. And that's what saves Love & Other Drugs, an otherwise befuddled and formulaic comedy with scattershot laughs.Set some time before the launch of Viagra as a treatment for erectile dysfunction in 1998, it charts the rise of a pharmaceutical salesman, Jamie Randall (Jake Gyllenhaal), and his wavering relationship with a commitment-phobic 25-year-old Maggie (Anne Hathaway), who suffers from Stage 1 Parkinson's Disease.Although Love & Other Drugs is worth a look for Hathaway's uninhibited performance, it is too unfocused for me to give a strong recommendation. Director Edward Zwick who cut his teeth in making mainstream epic actioners like Defiance and Blood Diamond can't seem to hold the movie together. It suffers from tonal inconsistencies and often feels like a few movies of different genres quashed into one; it flits unexpectedly from scatological comedy to poignant adult drama (that showcases a lot of skin) to mild satire.With a mishmash of ideas and plot points that are never fully developed or wholly addressed, the whole experience becomes rather unsatisfying and unmemorable. The movie works best during intimate moments when Hathaway and Gyllenhaal huddle together in the bedroom or talk over the coffee table. It is largely due to their easy on-screen chemistry, which makes it easier to overlook the largely flimsy script that is only sporadically peppered with witty one-liners.All thanks to the gamely leads, the things you're likely to remember about the movie are Hathaway's perky breasts and Gyllenhaal's butt, amidst their frequent scenes of humping. Going against their squeaky clean images, Hathaway and Gyllenhaal bare a lot physically and emotionally. But between the two, Hathaway gives the stronger performance as she has the juicier role of a conflicted patient and has to straddle fiery obstinacy and emotional volatility. Jamie's transition from an egotistical bed-hopping Casanova to a selfless boyfriend isn't fully mapped out. But Gyllenhaal does the best he can with his puppy-dog eyes.For those who love puerile humour, Jamie's brother, Josh, provides lots of gross-out dialogue. There is one nasty scene that involves him masturbating over an unexpected video. Enough said.When the ending tries to be emotionally poignant, I can't help but feel I've seen it all before. The goosebumps on my skin rose at the too-good- to-be-true confessional dialogue. But at the same time, my sentimental side started to get the better of me and my eyes welled up. There, I've caved in.",Love & Other Drugs

Only the love story turned sour, is so dull, I suggest you just watch clips of it. The fact that the story takes place in the 90s, would be unnoticed, if it wasn't for little details, like the music.

A period when one lucky guy was at the beckoning of every industry professional in town, because of his status as a sex-drug peddler... Then there's the emotional side; a disease of the week motif, made convincing because the performances make it seem as though these are real people, with real flaws, and real pressing considerations to grapple with. The romantic side of me enjoyed seeing these two people with obstacles win through, to be together. There are moments of sobering reflection, when a viewer may realise that the hard part isn't so much keeping somebody after an illness, it's getting them to fall for you in the first place, despite your illness... It's something that's rarely examined, in plot constructions more manipulative than this one is. Some may find the juxtaposition of playful, carefree sex with harsh reality jarring... and maybe the movie does try to cover too much territory. I could forgive that though, because it's kind of hard (no pun intended...) to make a movie dealing with Viagra that doesn't have at least a faintly comedic side, since a lot of men see impotence as being a joke, unless they're the ones who are suffering with it.Personally I thought it was funny, believable and sexy...

Women are easier.Gyllenhaal has the finesse to turn a womanizing pharmaceutical sales rep from a cliché character into an astute and caring man with actual depth. Anne Hathaway more just likes to prance around naked. Hathaway's Maggie suffers from early-onset Parkinson's disease, and has closed her heart to love. There's not much more to her character probably just because she has the body to shoot sex scenes.""Love and Other Drugs"" suffers from an inability to turn its dramatic scenes into poignant ones, and the many drug and sex jokes into thoughtful commentary.

Despite these problems, at its heart it is just a story of boy loves girl and Gyllenhaal and Hathaway portray that beautifully.",Love & Other Drugs
57,TheUnknown837-1,Ideal casting overwhelmed and undermined by all the crude debris that seems attached to every comedy with an R rating,6,16 November 2011,"""Love and Other Drugs"" is a prime example of how Hollywood's heeding the call of the marketplace frequently overwhelms and destroys many of their potentially fine products. The leads in this romantic comedy are Jake Gyllenhaal and Anne Hathaway, two of the most attractive and talented and beguiling movie stars in contemporary American cinema - two stars who actually deserve to be stars. Putting them in a romantic comedy (or a romantic film of any kind) together was an inspired choice, but what was not was the decision of the studio, director Edward Zwick and his two co-screenwriters (Charles Randolph and Marshall Herskovitz) to pump up the MPAA rating to an R where it would have been much better staying at a G or a PG-13 at the most. For that R rating comes with all the unnecessary, unfunny, uninteresting debris that we have been assaulted with by R-rated romantic comedies for the better part of a decade, if not longer. Has it been longer? The story was one I had hopes for. The three screenwriters based their plot on the nonfiction book ""Hard Sell"" by Jamie Reidy, about his experiences as a pharmaceutics salesman. The setting is just before the eruption of Viagra on the marketplace, and Mr. Reidy is more or less represented by Mr. Gyllenhaal as a struggling salesman. Using clever and devious methods (his believable charm) Mr. Gyllenhaal manages to get into the same room as a beautiful and peppy young woman (Miss Hathaway) during her physical. What follows is predictable dialogue exchanges and countless moments of them sweating the sheets, or whatever piece of architecture they happen to be around at the time(s). But as you would expect, about midway through, their initially without-strings-attached sexual adventures begins to deepen and develop into something more passionate. Before long, they're no longer having sex and crying a whole lot more often. And the sad thing is that these latter parts are really the best moments of the picture.The second half of the movie is much better than the first. Because here it develops into the movie that it should have been: a pure, goodhearted drama. Frankly, that's what I would have preferred the whole movie to be. Because when they are being strictly romantic with each other, Mr. Gyllenhall and Miss Hathaway are absolutely intoxicating. The big twist that wrinkles the third act is that Miss Hathaway's character has slowly-worsening Parkinson's and it is threatening to ruin their relationship. And when the two of them say ""I love you"" to each other, I wholeheartedly bought it. It was here that the two stars had found the screenplay they deserved to sign onto. On top of that, the director, Mr. Zwick, should have realized that his talents were more deserving of a film of this sort. Previously, he made ""Blood Diamond"" and ""Defiance,"" a picture which I enjoyed very much. Serious, down-to-earth movies about real subjects. Does this mean he should never make romantic comedies? Not at all, but should he had gone so low as to make one of such a crude sort? Not the nonsense that came before.Since it is an R-rated romantic comedy, the first half of the movie comes packed with all the wallopingly boring and unneeded R-rated comedy junk that has exhausted me for so long. The gratuitous nudity, the sex scenes so large in number that it was hard to keep track, the overuse of four-letter language (particularly the F-bomb), and the obnoxious characters. For once, couldn't we have an obligatory secondary character who is not repulsive? This time Josh Gad gets the embarrassing role of the younger brother high on calories and short on a sex life, who enjoys masturbating to pornography and his older sibling's sex tapes. Talented as he is, Mr. Gad is absolutely revolting and his part is just barely more memorable than the one he had as Jim Sturgess's friend in the horrifyingly dull ""21"" released back in 2008. Why couldn't there have been more of Oliver Platt as a salesman team leader, who is very energetic and entertaining, and less of the dumb, overused subplot of a jealous ex and rival, this time given to Gabriel Macht. My only compliment on this subplot is the filmmakers' apparent blunder of letting it disappear unexpectedly near the third act.Or perhaps they were starting to realize their mistake? Sadly, ""Love and Other Drugs"" just uses the R-comedy debris to the point of overkill. After a while, all of the gratuitous sex and nudity scenes became really tiring. When a picture takes a subject like sex and treats it more as the private and beautiful thing that it really is, then the power (and potential comedy) increases dynamically. Again, another reason why this movie's rating should have been aimed lower. And while the third act did move me, sometimes quite deeply, there was just so much third-rate junk beforehand that the picture left me feeling empty and unimpressed by the end. I really hope that someday Mr. Gyllenhaal and Miss Hathaway reteam again, only this time focusing on a stronger story (hopefully a more serious one?) and go for more heart than cheap gags.In other words, less nudity, less sex, less masturbation, less F-bombs.",Love & Other Drugs
58,hall895,A struggle to find the right tone,6,3 June 2013,"Love & Other Drugs is a romantic comedy which has one inherent problem: there is nothing particularly funny about a young woman with early onset Parkinson's disease. Anne Hathaway plays that woman, Maggie, and Hathaway is for the most part very good in a challenging role. She captures the physical manifestations of the disease as well as the emotional frustration she feels as she faces her cruel fate. Jake Gyllenhaal plays Jamie, the charming womanizer who inevitably falls in love with Maggie because if he didn't there wouldn't be any movie. Gyllenhaal and Hathaway have good chemistry, playing off one another well both with dialogue and with the physical action between the sheets. But throughout there is the nagging sense that the movie can't quite figure out what it is. It tries to be funny at times then seems to remember that Parkinson's isn't funny so it immediately gets deathly serious. The back and forth is a little jarring. There's a good, compelling story in here but it never all comes together perfectly.In order for the movie to truly succeed you have to sympathize with the two main characters. Easy to feel for Maggie. Jamie is more of a challenge. The movie initially presents him as a guy whose sole interest is bedding as many women as he can. Then he becomes a pharmaceutical sales rep, a profession in which morality is put on the back burner. It's all about pushing pills. So, why should we like this guy? Well, because he's going to fall for dear Maggie and by golly that is going to change him. See, he's really a good person after all. If only it were that easy. Jamie's character grows but you kind of get the sense he wants to be with Maggie to prove to himself how good he is. See, I'm with the sick girl, aren't I wonderful? Does he really love Maggie or does he love the idea of loving Maggie? And what happens when her condition inevitably gets worse? There is a scene at a Parkinson's seminar which bluntly lays out Maggie's future. Is that really a future Jamie wants to be part of? Jamie takes Maggie around the country looking for the doctor who will provide the magic cure. That magic cure of course does not exist. Maggie knows this and rightfully wonders whether Jamie will want to be with her as she spirals downward. There's a strain on their relationship which will test whether they really can be together. Whether they really should be. It's all very serious-minded stuff for a supposed romantic comedy. A little dour at times but that is the nature of the story. Give the movie credit for being far from the typical romance. There's a real story here, a thought-provoking one at that. But the movie has an odd feel to it. It gets so serious than when the movie throws in a joke it feels very much out of place. And yet you feel you need some lighthearted moments to distract from the gloom and seemingly inevitable doom. It's a delicate balance and the movie doesn't quite get it right. It's still a pretty decent movie, with two very good performances at its heart. It has a story well worth exploring. The pieces don't all fit but enough of them do to make the movie worth seeing.",Love & Other Drugs

60,jon.h.ochiai,"Seeing Through ""Love and Other Drugs""",8,1 December 2010,"""Love and Other Drugs"" possesses an erratic poignancy. At the story arc, Jamie (Jake Gyllenhaal) confesses to ailing Maggie (Anne Hathaway) that he can't live without her. Tearful Maggie says, ""I need you more It's not fair."" Anne Hathaway is electrifying. Her performance is award worthy. She and Gyllenhaal have a galvanizing chemistry that anchors the narrative incongruities. Director Edward Zwick's ""Love and Other Drugs"" has unexpected gravitas. The screenplay by Zwick, Charles Randolph, and Marshall Herkovitz, based on the book by Jamie Reidy has a romantic comedy facade. After all, on the surface ""Love"" is about Viagra salesman Jamie Randall (Gyllenhaal). But Maggie (Hathaway), the 26 year-old Bohemian artist, he falls in love with has Stage 1 Parkinson's disease. Rather than enrolling us in the conversation—life isn't fair, the innate power of ""Love and Other Drugs"" lies in the possibility of unconditional love. Reclaiming one's humanity and greatness aligns with what we risk giving up.Set in 1997, Jamie Randall (Gyllenhaal) is the bright, but ADD riddled son of Dr. James Randall (classically bland George Segal) and his wife (the late Jill Clayburgh in a brief but strong role). His loutish younger brother Josh (lovable loser Josh Gad) is a millionaire from a dot com IPO. Jamie is smart enough to be a doctor, but has neither the desire nor discipline for it. Besides he is a hot guy, who can sleep with any woman he desires. Leveraging his strengths he becomes a pharmaceuticals rep, working for Pfizer. He and his mentor Bruce (funny Oliver Platt) court many doctors to prescribe Pfizer products. One of them is slick and surprisingly genuine Dr. Stan Knight (solid Hank Azaria). One of his patients is Maggie Murdock (Hathaway), who has Stage 1 Parkinson's. Maggie smacks Jamie in the head after he poses as Stan's physician colleague and spies Maggie's beautiful breasts. The cosmos aligns: this is the superfluous souls match. Jamie is the charming master player. Maggie's sexual appetite is a self preservation reflex that keeps her isolated and immune to love.There is a lot of gratuitous sex in ""Love and Other Drugs"". This can be a good thing. Anne Hathaway has spectacular breasts, and is naked a lot. Jake Gyllenhaal is shredded, often guarding his loins with a pillow. Fortunately, these are not the most captivating attributes of their performance. What is stunning about Hathaway is her resilient spirit and visceral vulnerability. Her Audrey Hepburn eyes convey both joy and agonizing sorrow. In an amazing scene Maggie drinks dulling the pain of her tremor ridden body; she scares off Jamie saying that he ""pity f***ed the sick girl"". She then weeps to her very soul. When Maggie speaks to the video camera after making love, and confesses her love, her smile lights up the room. Gyllenhaal tempers his charm, and never trespasses into self absorbed. He brilliantly embodies a man resisting becoming a true hero—one who believes and sees the best in everyone. He displays a quiet power as he listens to the husband of a woman, now in the deteriorated stages of Parkinson's.The writing at times is all over the place with glaring omissions. Maggie is an artist, who has a studio in a spacious flat in the city. How does she afford that? She doesn't have showings. This is more puzzling given part of the storyline is that she does not have medical insurance. There are at least 2 too many Viagra jokes. Although amusing, the slumber party pharmaceutical orgy is a calculated punch line. Zwick and ""Love and Other Drugs"" is at its best in its most dire and humane. Maggie never wanted to hear ""I love you."" When she surrenders to this, she embraces her own mortality and forsakes all self. Jake must reconcile tremendous sacrifice, and the cost of not being with Maggie. Life is all about the journey, and Hathaway and Gyllenhaal as Maggie and Jamie do so with courage and compassion. In the end it's about love, and ""Love and Other Drugs"" gets it right.",Love & Other Drugs

It also tries to make real insights about sex, love and relationships, but doesn't quite make it on that front either. It's really just a run-of-the-mill romantic comedy with a way above average quota of nudity and sex, and if that's what you're looking for, then you might enjoy it.My biggest problem with the movie, I guess, is that it never goes all the way with anything. Three quarters of the way, it's a very cynical (almost unbearably so) comedy that actually manages to maintain a level of realism while offering some half-insights about human nature and sexuality. Then, in the very last thirty minutes, it turns into a sickeningly sweet Hollywood rom-com, complete evading so many issues raised before and making most of the movie completely irrelevant, especially the parts that spent quite a lot of energy getting us to dislike the protagonist.Overall, it's just a mess.

Most of his movies really surprised me (especially PRISONERS and NIGHTCRAWLER) so it's no surprise that I had to see this one. And despite it wasn't great like those two movies I mentioned, I liked it anyway.The movie is set in the 1990s, precisely in 1996. Womanizing salesman James Randall (Jake Gyllenhall) gets a job at the Pfizer company as a drugs salesman. After testing some of the medicins he accidentally meets Maggie Murdock (Anne Hathaway), a young woman with an early version of Parkinson's disease. After having a date with her, they decide to don't have a serious relationship and they have lots of s** regularly. In the meanwhile James is assigned to sell Viagra (a new drug to treat erectyle dysfunction) and will go to many conferences about Parkinson's and its treatments and even when he and Maggie break up, they will speak loud about their feelings and will return together.This film surprised me because from the poster I thought it was a rom com like many others, but instead, it's much more than that! Jake Gyllenhall gives another excellent performance as a young drug salesman who will do everything to help his girlfriend dealing with Parkinson's (played well by Anne Hathaway who also shows off a LOT of her gorgeous body in the steamy scenes). Josh Gad looks a bit annoying here as James' brother, and it actually reminded a bit of Seth Rogen.However this is a rare romantic comedy in the sense that not that many movies of the genre give the message of hope that this one gives.

I swear it feels like a 2002 movie.Love & Other Drugs is a lighthearted, pulp-fiction 2000s-era style romcom that like that makes light of the events leading up to the opioid crisis.This movie is a manic ride of a movie that takes us to some exciting highs and dramatic lows. Jake Gyllenhaal plays his role as a natural salesman well. He stays passionate and hyper in his role throughout this movie. There is real connection between him and Anne Hathaway that allows each to play off each other.Yet, in true 2000s-era romcom fashion, this movie comes off as a bit too shallow. No real conflict is felt within this movie and lots of time is spent running around subplots. There are some artistic directions that could have made this movie better.For starters, the character of suffers no real conflict in this movie. He gets everything he wants. If someone says no to him, he gives sad puppy eyes until he gets what he wants. He never fails in his goals and everything goes merry throughout the movie. I can look away for 5 minutes anywhere and Jamie's problem would be resolve. Nowhere in this movie did I felt real conflict.But it's not Jake Gyllenhaal's fault. I felt this was more of the fault of the screenwriter than the actor as Jake performed his role more than well.The other character I had issues with was with Josh Randall, played by Josh Gad. He serves as the comic relief in the movie but plays off more like a mix between Seth Rogan and Jack Black. This extreme Flanderization annoys more than entertains.But I did enjoy Anne Hathaway's portrayal of Maggie Murdock. She is able to portray some dramatic feelings about having a chronic disease at such an early age. She portrayed lots of emotional stresses that comes from living with such a disease. Her character comes off as convincing and even deserving of sympathy at times. Kudos to her.The sex scenes were good for what is allowed but felt a bit overplayed. Some sex scenes weren't needed and made the movie feel a bit sleazy at certain points. At some points, the movie felt more like a teenage boy's fantasy than a fun romcom. And what was with the scene where Anne Hathaway stretches her dirtied feet out for an extended period of time?The other thing I had an issue with was how they made such lighthearted fun of the pharma sales industry. The controversy is brushed over without thought of their consequence. The movie portrays these sometimes less-than-ethical salesmen as rich, arrogant jerks who suffer no real consequences for their actions. Actually... pretty close to real life.

He's a very successful salesman, because he charms everyone, because he's just so damn charming - only thing is, he's not. It's one of those movies where everyone falls for the guy, when in real life people would just find him appalling. That's just the beginning. We stick to this slippery guy who could have jumped right out of an 80's movie he's that empty and material. In one of the next scenes we see him dancing to ""Macarena"" at a pharmaceutical group's assessment center. There's a lot of Gyllenhaal dancing. It's supposed to establish him as this dynamic, success-oriented guy, but it's just awkward and really annoying.We also meet other male characters, and ALL of them are misogynist pigs who only ever talk about getting laid: the successful doctor (Hank Azaria, who at one point gives an incredibly sappy speech about grievance in his job, which is completely out of place), Jamie's working colleague (Oliver Platt, who also does some inappropriate dancing), Jamie's biggest competitor, Jamie's Dad and worst of all Jamie's brother, who's supposed to be the funny side character, but is just detestable and disgusting. Oh, I almost forgot, there's a funny homeless guy, who starts getting his life together after he begins taking Prozac. Nice little message there.Anyway, the most incredible thing happens: Jamie falls for a girl, Maggie. She's got Parkinson's disease. This is where the movie gets all deep and edgy. We're supposed to feel sorry for her, but she's just a very unlikeable character. The movie has a thousand scenes where Maggie and Jamie go back and forth. He tells her about his feelings, she can't let it happen. It's interesting the first four times or so, then you just want them to have a terrible car crash and die in flames.Jamie's big speech to get back Maggie in the end is the cream of the crop: You got every cliché. He tries to talk to her, she rejects him at first, a ""funny"" old couple comments on how cute he is, he continues his speech, the most kitschy music - think something along the lines of the ""Bodyguard"" soundtrack - starts playing in the background as Jamie speaks the words that move Maggie to tears and make her finally give in to her love. NOT FOR ONE SECOND do I believe that these two characters will make it past the initial stages of being in love, when Maggie's sickness really kicks in.This is just appalling. The movie gets a relatively high rating of 4/10 stars from me, because for some reason it is eerily watchable. I hated it, but I could still make it to the end without having to force myself. Also, Jake Gyllenhaal and Anne Hathaway (who I don't like at all), do the best they can with these horribly written characters they're given.But that's about all the positive things you can say about ""Love And Other Drugs"". Edward Zwick ought to be ashamed of himself.",Love & Other Drugs
67,Geeky Randy,Geeky Randy's summary,7,23 March 2011,"Raunchy romantic-comedy about pharmaceuticals salesman and player Gyllenhaal who's breath taken by a free-spirited hard-to-get Hathaway (who has been diagnosed with stage one Parkinson's). The two leads have the needed chemistry, but perhaps lack the needed charisma. Azaria, Gad and Platt are the ones that make this date night outing a hoot. Definitely one of the romantic-comedies the men won't dread--appears to be part of a new trend of kinky carefree sex with passionate elements to make viewers of both genders enjoy the show. That's an okay approach, but the interesting storyline is what also makes this Hollywood love-laugh-riot above par.*** (out of four)",Love & Other Drugs
68,JohnRayPeterson,"Sweet and bitter, if you are fortunate enough.",8,8 April 2011,"I'm glad I decided to watch this film. To be perfectly candid, I read that Anne Hathaway has a nude scene and have been curious to see more of her since I watched ""Get Smart"". Given we all know that Jake Gyllenhaal is a good actor, I was expecting the movie not to be too bad; I had not bothered to read the full movie summary/storyline beforehand. What I was not expecting was to have a lump in my throat by the end of the movie. The trailers/previews I saw were indicative of a comedy which of course is not this movie's real theme. Sure it's a romantic comedy so it has a comedic backdrop and it also has sexual content; it is not gratuitous sexual content and that is worth a mention. The movie slowly, very slowly, but assuredly makes the point so many other great romantic comedy make and that point is that love hurts. The performances by Gyllenhaal and Hathaway were poignant, exactly when the time was right for that. The movie goes deep when it tackles the ugly truth that love hurts more when it is felt strongly by both at a time when either one is facing the sure prospect of death before a full life was lived. If I spoiled it for you, that may not be such a bad thing.",Love & Other Drugs
69,Likes_Ninjas90,The cardinal rule of a romantic comedy is broken: you don't care whether they end up together or not,5,30 November 2010,"Ladies man Jamie Randall (Jake Gyllenhaal) is a super smooth talker working in an appliance store. When he is fired for having sex with a co-worker he is pressured to find a new profession. His brother, a lazy overweight computer geek, has already made a fortune selling computer software to pharmaceutical companies. As such, Jamie uses his charming persona to become a sales representative for a drug company, working to sell drugs to local doctors and GP's. It's a cutthroat business, but he still manages to work his way around people. He meets his match when he meets Maggie (Anne Hathaway), a slightly neurotic artist who initially holds him in contempt but then grows to appreciate his fleeting nature. She is only interested in casual sex but slowly Jaime becomes more attached and more concerned about her wellbeing.Love and Other Drugs was adapted from the book ""Hard Sell: The Evolution of a Viagra Salesman"" by director Edward Zwick. With Marshall Herskovitz and Charles Randolph, he also wrote the screenplay too. It seems like an oddity for Zwick who has mostly specialised in action films like The Last Samurai, Blood Diamond and Defiance. His lack of familiarity with the romantic comedy genre is most evident with the jarring changes of tone of this film. It starts off as a quirky comedy but there's also a distinct lack of wit in the screenplay. Jamie's supposed charm and suave is so overdone and phoney that is difficult to believe that any of the women in the film could fall for it. Annoyingly, they do repeatedly. The intrusion of Jamie's overweight brother, the typical fat character employed for comic relief, is a superfluous addition too that adds little to the narrative. In the second half, the film is nearly two hours, the story attempts to change gears to become a medical melodrama, as Maggie's illness deteriorates. At this point the film seems to becoming more thoughtful and smarter than the typical Hollywood romantic comedy since Jaime has to find a balance between his work and looking after her. However, it's undone by an extremely safe and predictable conclusion, complete with the kind of mawkish speech that only a romantic comedy could provide. Jake Gyllenhaal and Anne Hathaway have worked previously together in the film Brokeback Mountain. Gyllenhaal though is an unusual choice for what this particular role demands. He seems miscast because his smoothness and supposed suave is so artificial. He overplays it entirely in the opening scene. His choice of stealing drugs from rival companies seems like an incredibly unlikely practice. After he transforms into the typical nice guy in the latter portion of the film his character becomes bland, rather than sincere. This is more the fault of the screenplay as the inner life of his character is particular uninteresting. The only particularly memorable aspect about his character is that he never managed to finish medical school. Hathaway is rather spiteful as Maggie, not always likable in the way that she treats Jamie, particular in the second act. The women in the film generally do not come off well here as they are either gullible or in Maggie's case, plain irrational. Notably, the love scenes shared between Jamie and Maggie are more frank than most mainstream comedies. It's just unfortunate that the film is a lot less interesting when the characters have their clothes on. Ultimately, the cardinal rule of a romantic comedy is broken: you don't care whether they end up together or not.",Love & Other Drugs
70,Dan1863Sickles,Brilliant One Minute -- Horrible The Next -- But The Scream Of Anne Hathaway Makes It All Worthwhile!,7,18 June 2012,"The scream.I just want everyone to know about the scream. Anne Hathaway is unquestionably the most beautiful young actress on the planet. But I never knew she could scream like that. About midway through the movie, when Maggie is feeling bitter and nearly pushes Jamie out of her life once and for all, there's a moment where she changes her mind and calls him back just in time. Only she doesn't *call* him. She drops a glass (which is heart-breaking in itself given her physical condition) and then she lets out this horrifying, blood-curdling scream, which is like nothing I've ever heard from Anne Hathaway (or any other great actress) before.It's a scream that expresses everything her character is feeling. Rage, fear, loneliness, shame, frustration, despair, yearning, and yes, love. And even though hundreds of people have reviewed this movie brilliantly, no-one has yet mentioned that scream, or the incredible intensity of Anne's performance.Unfortunately, there is more (too much more) to LOVE & OTHER DRUGS than Anne Hathaway's performance, or the incredible suffering of her doomed artist character Maggie, or even the poignant love story between Maggie and flashy, charming salesman Jamie, who is played with energy and charm by Anne Hathaway's good friend and frequent costar Jake Gyllenhaal. The problem is that while the love story is flawless and deep, the rest of the movie is tawdry, silly, and shallow.If you are going to make a movie that argues passionately for committed relationships, you can't go for easy laughs about porno and masturbation. And if you are going to make a movie that attacks corporate greed, you can't stage every intimate conversation like a commercial for Budweiser or Pop Tarts.Some of this stuff was so obvious it was like a Saturday Night Live sketch. ""Okay, Jake, you're going to really attack corporate greed in this scene. Now, as you're talking it over with Anne on the couch, make sure to lift up your Budweiser bottle so the audience can see you're drinking Bud as you attack corporate greed. Higher, Jake. Keep that label in full view at all times. Higher! Higher! Sing about how much you love Budweiser. Now dance, little piggie!"" The thing is, salesmen are an easy target -- and they have been since long before Jake Gyllenhaal was ever born. It's so tiresome to see him (and the talented Oliver Platt) trading tired Willy Loman monologues about life on the road, the tedium, the horror, blah blah. Oh, and do hold that Budweiser bottle up high, boys. Selling is hell! Anne's character Maggie is problematic as well. Even though Anne's performance is riveting, shattering and authentic, there are a lot of loose ends here. No one seems to notice that this woman is too ill to work, but never seems to need money. She's witty, charming, and charismatic, but has no female friends (or relatives) to help her out.But beneath all that, I kept getting a really creepy vibe about how this character was conceived. There's something very nineteenth century about the notion of a pure beauty who wastes away gradually and in the process ""redeems"" a weak and sinful male. Edward Zwick, I think it is safe to say, does not like women to be too strong. He lets Maggie ""look"" strong early on, in that she swears like a trooper and indulges in a lot of noisy posturing about not needing anyone. But of course it's all an act. When push comes to shove, she's helpless, and that's what makes her worthy of our hero's self-sacrifice and devotion. This stuff is not only pre-feminist, it's pre-automobile. It goes back to the days when tuberculosis was the ""in"" disease for well-bred young ladies, and the hottest writer in America was Edgar Allan Poe! Still, LOVE AND OTHER DRUGS is a movie worth watching for the sheer brilliance of the acting and the beauty of the love story. Anne Hathaway is fearless and unspeakably beautiful. She will do anything to make her character sing -- or scream.************************PS So many people have asked me about ""the Pajama Scene"" and its homage to A CLOCKWORK ORANGE that I have included the following appendix to my review. The key to this scene is the fabulous futuristic house -- watch closely as the two brothers walk up the drive together. If you're into classic film at all, you'll clearly recognize this exterior as IDENTICAL to the house of the writer F. Alexander in Stanley Kubrick's ultra-violent sci- fi drama A CLOCKWORK ORANGE. The parallels are striking. Jamie the Viagra salesman is really Alex, a totally lawless and amoral monster. Thanks to his knack for selling and gift of gab, he rules the night with his medical ""droogs,"" Dr. Knight and others, enjoying high powered sex and mindless orgies with no consequences. Yet here, at this party, our Alex meets his match. For it is Lisa, (known as the ""Cat Lady"" in the Kubrick film) who symbolizes the ultimate horror and disgust Jamie must feel for his own lifestyle. When he spurns the vile Lisa (not by smashing her head in with a giant phallus, but merely by taking his permanent erection elsewhere) we see the exact parallel to Alex in A CLOCKWORK ORANGE. Just like Alex after his treatment, Jamie after the orgy is sickened by the very THOUGHT of crude, degrading sex. And having been ""cured"" of his sickness, he is now ready to go back to Maggie, who represents both Ludwig Van Beethoven (as she is an artist) and also his Pee and Em (since she nurtures him with pop tarts and Budweiser beer.) Note the final scene of the film, where Victorian ladies and gentlemen stand around applauding politely while Jamie and Maggie have sex in an icy lake.",Love & Other Drugs

I think the opening scene took place in 1995 and the small electronics store was selling flat-screen TVs.

And when what starts out as a no-commitment bonk-buddy relationship blossoms into Love, there is romance. There's a nice scene at a kind of AA meeting for people with Parkinson's where the victims assure each other that there is Life After Parkinson's, but a guy whose wife is in Stage Four tells Jake what lies ahead for his beloved, which means that we now know where this movie - or its unmakeable sequel - has to end.Even as you watch - and, thanks to the looks and talent of its stars, enjoy - LOVE AND OTHER DRUGS, you may find yourself questioning its taste.",Love & Other Drugs

I had my concerns when I saw the trailer and definitely when I read the review, but this is a really nice love story. Yes the backdrop is the health care industry (people should actually say that because the health care industry has less to do with doctors and patients than people think. Yes I am a doc myself) but the story is really about two people. One who is afraid of what she will become and the other afraid that he'll never really know who he is. Jake and Anne are perfect together and that's why they were placed in this film. The other characters are only there to give Maggie and Jamie objective insight into what things are really about. Oliver Platt makes sure that Jamie realizes that what he thinks he wants is not important. Hank Azaria makes sure that Jamie understands that being a doctor could be a good thing and Josh Gad makes sure that Jamie understands that empty sex is just that empty. Yes the sex and nudity are plentiful and could have been cut back with the movie being just as good or better.

His life is turned sideways when he meets the beautiful Maggie (Anne Hathaway), an artist with stage-one Parkinson's and a growing skepticism for love. Throw in a raunchily pathetic younger brother (Josh Gad), a hilarious sales partner (Oliver Platt), and a violent former Marine (Gabriel Macht) as the #1 competition, and 'Love and Other Drugs' quickly becomes one of the funniest films in years.The film, which is like 'Up in the Air' with more humour or '(500) Days of Summer' with less quirk, is fantastically acted by the leads and supporting ensemble of familiar faces. The writing is phenomenal with some of the freshest dialogue and wittiest banter I've seen since Howard Hawks's 'His Girl Friday.' The story is also very topical, especially in the days of the fight for healthcare reform. Director Edward Zwick (Glory, Blood Diamond) puts forth one of the best films of his career alongside a list of solid past work, creating some of the most heart-wrenchingly sad and gut-wrenchingly funny cinematic moments in a while. The film is also full of some of the hottest and funniest sex scenes I've seen in a long time, so the movie's humour isn't all guys will want in this romantic-comedy. Overall, 'Love and Other Drugs' is a great variation to the 2010 romantic comedies thus far, giving something worthwhile outside of the typical 'The Bounty Hounter'-type rom-coms.Final Verdict: 9/10.-AP3-(Report from the March 25th pre-screening in Orange, CA.)",Love & Other Drugs

However, the chemistry between Jake Gyllenhaal and Anne Hathaway is spectacular. Most of the time, the romantic film has to put more efforts to persuade me about the storyline and characters' emotions. Well, it succeeded.Two characters have their own weakness and vulnerability at the start of the relationship, and as they fell in love, they understand and complement each other's. The development of this passion and affection is empathetic and not cheesy. First, the writer does not overdo it. The interaction between the two stays perfectly in the balance between being witty and serious. Second, two actors are great expressing how their characters feel and persuading audience of their reasons and emotions.The most important thing I cannot stress enough: This movie does not OVERPLAY it.

An attractive and well-paired couple (Anne Hathaway and Jake Gyllenhaal's chemistry works effectively), the roguish guy turning good, the passionate sex encounters, some romance, some funny shots, some drama. The director shifts quite easily from comedy to drama, in a way as to make the entertaining aim prevail against the committed one. And indeed, in the end it does prevail, as we do not feel so much touched by the tragedy looming over Maggie. The only strong hint at the real thing (showing some commitment and respect from the director), is when Jamie meets at the Parkinsons's convention the husband of a woman at the final stage of the disease, but the movie has a different perspective, and goes on along that line. Certainly, it does not shy away from nudity (but pleasing both the male and the female public), certainly, some shots could have been cut off (such as the pyjama party) as useless and frankly too excessive, together with some vulgar vocabulary. However, it would be unreasonable to criticize it for its entertaining attitude, or for its unlikeliness and unrealistic treatment (as we perfectly know that things do not work like this , and even more do not end up like this), which is evident since from the trailer, even from the poster. For me, it was natural to enjoy the movie, for its honesty of intention and for letting us think, or hope, or pretend, that things could really work out like this and end up like this: this is that magic ""suspension of disbelief"" cinema can thankfully still provide... and we still love it, thankfully.",Love & Other Drugs
80,Eternality,"While initially holding some promise, Love and Other Drugs eventually falters due to a plain script that could have done more to develop the characters.",6,11 January 2011,"Edward Zwick, who has a knack for telling good stories and making decent action dramas such as Glory (1989), The Last Samurai (2003), and Blood Diamond (2006), does not make the cut in his new film, a romantic-comedy starring Jake Gyllenhaal and Anne Hathaway. Love and Other Drugs, which was once considered an Oscar hopeful months before it was scheduled for release due to the strength of the leading cast, and Zwick's considerable reputation as a director, is unfortunately average and at times bordering on insipidness.The saving grace is Hathaway's performance. She plays Maggie, a young and pretty woman in her mid-twenties who is stricken with stage one Parkinson's disease. She is like a free spirit, values her freedom, and does not wish to be attached to anybody. Until she meets Jamie (Gyllenhaal), who is selling drugs for pharmaceutical company Pfizer. Jamie is a sweet-talking, flirtatious man who dreams of getting rich, and enjoys having (empty) sex with women. Well, and this is not a surprise, both Jamie and Maggie do have sex, multiple times in fact.Like any cliché story on the beginnings of romance, they start to have feelings for each other, and if I may add, also doubts whether they should be together for life. Maggie thinks it is unfair for Jamie to want to be her companion, because that would mean loving and taking care of a sick woman. Jamie, who also has doubts of his own, becomes far too attracted to Maggie's personality, and for the first time in his life, finds true love in her.Gyllenhaal's performance is above-average, only occasionally matching that of Hathaway's, though their chemistry is sustainable enough to last for two hours. For a mainstream rom-com (albeit aimed more at young adults than teenagers), Love and Other Drugs features quite a huge chunk of dialogue about sex. Even supporting characters are obsessed about the s word. If that's not raunchy enough, Zwick also cranks up the flesh level by including tasteful nude scenes (most of which appear in the first hour) of the two leads in bed.While initially holding some promise, Love and Other Drugs eventually falters due to a plain script that could have done more to develop the characters. Despite all the physical nakedness, sex, and some instances of quite hilarious comedic set-play, there seems to be not enough involvement for the average viewer to develop anything more than a muted interest in the characters. While Zwick's direction of the cast is adequate, his screenplay (which he co-wrote with two other persons) is much less so. In short, you should give Love and Other Drugs a miss, even if you are an admirer of Zwick's works.GRADE: C (www.filmnomenon.blogspot.com) All rights reserved.",Love & Other Drugs

Maggie is too proud to let anyone take care of her, so she doesn't commit to a relationship with anyone. They both start off as just F-Buddies, but couldn't ignore what's building up. This was one film where I have seen Jake Gyllenhaal to be totally comfortable with his role. We have seen similar characters portraying a similar relationship scenario in the past, what's the difference is this film goes for broke for most part of the movie. Some jokes made me feel that either Seth Rogen or Judd Apatow were part of this project. It justifies it's adult tag for most part but chickens out in the climax to finish off trying to be a crowd pleaser. It didn't gel with the tone of the characters until then.

I wasn't expecting a sex scene about every 20 minutes but there was at least for the first hour and 20 minutes of the film. With that being said, that becomes my first issue with the film. The movie had too much sex and I know that sounds odd coming from a guy. Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed seeing Anne Hathaway's beautiful and amazing naked body but after a while it almost felt like a cheap exploit. I enjoy films that use sex scenes wisely because this film definitely needed sex to work but it went over the top and almost felt like a filler at times.On that same topic, I am growing tired of the whole ""Judd Apatow"" effect in film, which are sex comedies with heart. Nowadays, a lot of chick flicks have turned into a raunchy comedy for the first hour of the film and then turn into this heartfelt love story by the end. Before ""Love & Other Drugs,"" I saw two other trailers using this same ""effect"" in their storyline and I have seen them many times before as well. I think what is happening now is that Hollywood is trying to manipulate males and females by selling them these raunchy chick flicks and putting a hot male and a hot female in the lead. This seems to be a way to get guys to want to see a chick flick. The problem is that in my opinion very few movies are able to achieve this without manipulating it's audience and drawing in on being unbelievable.I know it sounds like I am beating up ""Love & Other Drugs"" because I am criticizing it but truth be told I did enjoy it. Its definitely far call from being a perfect film but Hathaway and Gyllenhaal are truly great in the film and make this film worth watching. The odd thing, however, is that even with the film trying way too hard to balance two genres it works for the most part but that's only because of it's leads. Hathaway has always been in my book an underrated and beautiful actress. She's definitely not your normal Hollywood Scarlet but you know what, that's what makes her so good at what she does. She seems like a real every day kind of woman and this role fit her personality well, not to mention her chemistry with Gyllenhaal was dead on. I also really liked Gyllenhaal in the film as well. He did a good job with the material at hand and played the smooth talking sales guy like a pro. As I said, the two leads are really what helped the film succeed because without them this movie would have been a huge mess.""Love & Other Drugs"" is loosely based on a book called ""Hard Sell: The Evolution of a Viagra Salesman"" and it took three people to write the screenplay for the film. The script is where the film's weakness truly lies. The mixing of sex comedy and romantic drama is a hard sell with the film. Then you add in the typical movie clichés like the fat annoying funny guy (Jonah Hill, anyone), the good looking and smooth talking lead who can get any woman he pleases, and then of course, the notorious ""sick girl,"" just to name a few of the many clichés used in the film. On top of these flaws, the film's script seems almost unbalanced throwing in over the top nudity and sex scenes, which were definitely nice to look at but extremely uncalled for. There are also several plot holes and things that don't really add up in the film.In the end, ""Love & Other Drugs"" was one of the oddest films for me to sit through in recent years because I liked it and didn't like it at the same time. What I didn't like was the over the top sex scenes along with the raunchiness of the film, the overabundance of film clichés, and how unbalanced the film was, which made it hard to figure out whether it wanted to be a sex comedy or a romantic drama and that annoyed me. I know from the majority of my review, it sounds like I didn't like the film but I actually did at times. Its one of those films I had a lot to say about it afterwords. I enjoyed the film's conclusion, I enjoyed the chemistry and performances by Hathaway and Gyllenhaal, and I even somewhat enjoyed the story even though it was extremely clichéd. Overall, I would still recommend this film because it was definitely an adult geared romantic film with great performances by the two leads.MovieManMenzel's final rating for ""Love & Other Drugs"" is a 6 out of 10.",Love & Other Drugs
87,perkypops,Hathaway and Gyllenhaal lift this out of the ordinary,7,10 March 2012,"Romantic comedy dramas generally live or die on the performances of the main leads and this entertaining story follows the tradition. Maggie (Hathaway) and Jamie (Gyllenhaal) work hard to provide a couple of unlikely characters who meet but never seem to really connect in the way that relationships are made of. Maggie has early onset Parkinson's and Jamie is the superficial and sexy sales guy who doesn't much like himself. Maggie has reasons to be suspicious but Jamie is never going to understand why is he? This film doesn't spend a lot of time building characters outside of the leads and this is to its credit since they hold the whole plot together and make it work. We are made to feel the frustrations and exhilaration of the relationship between Maggie and Jamie without needing to worry about what is happening around them, even when it seems the pair are destined never to hit the right notes in harmony. Excellent performances from the leads.It is a good film and worth the effort to see.",Love & Other Drugs
88,colinrgeorge,Love and Other Genres,6,29 November 2010,"""Love and Other Drugs"" has an immediate leg-up on its romcom competition in that it actually has a halfway decent premise. Set against the backdrop of the nineties pharmaceutical boom, and with a charismatic Jake Gyllenhaal shucking Zoloft and Viagra for the umbrella company Pfizer (drugs which today are so commonplace that Microsoft Office automatically capitalized them for me), there is the tantalizing potential that ""Love and Other Drugs"" may do more than play it safe.Now consider Anne Hathaway as an artsy early-onset Parkinson's victim and the hard R for nudity, and it feels as though the filmmakers are genuinely determined to take a few risks— and they do, but not necessarily in the right places. Much of ""Love and Other Drugs"" feels frustratingly formulaic, and conflicting ideas (presumably the amalgam of multiple drafts and authors) lend the film an unkempt, atonal quality. A surplus of half-baked ideas suffices in the place of one strong one, and this nearly two-hour endeavor never amounts to more than the sum of its disparate parts.Its most interesting aspect is surely the pharmaceutical angle, and one of the greatest shortcomings of ""Love and Other Drugs"" is that it fails to take a definitive stance on the industry. The rock-and-roll Pfizer presentation Gyllenhaal is treated to early on is a great scene with irony to spare—the theatrics and sexiness with which the company presents itself is as humorous as it is overlooked later on. The satiric edge that marks a strong beginning is then dulled on narrative millstones that impede its momentum.Eventually, the film skirts or ignores politics wherever possible. Maggie (Hathaway's character) is totally reliant on expensive medication to offset the effects of her first-stage Parkinson's, but she never expresses contempt for the system despite chartering a regular bus trip from Chicago to Canada to land cheaper meds. Strangely, she seems to hold no grudge against Pfizer or its representative, Jamie (Gyllenhaal). If anything, she seems as staunch a supporter as the salesman himself.But once their relationship begins in earnest, the romantic comedy autopilot kicks in, and what made ""Love and Other Drugs"" even somewhat unique is left high and dry in favor of straight up archetype. But what's even more annoying is Jamie's slovenly live-in brother, a Jonah Hill-esquire 'comic relief' character who serves no purpose to the plot whatsoever. He exists purely for comedic potential—a potential that is not once realized. His existence in this world is tacked-on and transient.Still, as far as romantic comedies go—and I can't profess to being an expert on the genre— you could do worse than ""Love and Other Drugs."" Half the battle is establishing likable characters and a compelling scenario, both of which the film manages admirably. Gyllenhaal and Hathaway are fine together, and both have the opportunity to play off of some interesting character actors (Hank Azaria, Oliver Platt). The real shame is that the film never comes together in spite of everything it has going for it. Medical malady drama one minute, sweet romance the next, and lame duck comedy after that, ""Love and Other Drugs"" is ultimately the median between its successful peaks and deep, disappointing troughs.Though the film multitasks poorly and muddles its message, it isn't the disaster it might have been. Even in botching its potential it has spurts of creativity, which is more than can be said for most of its uninspired kindred. Having fun and playing it safe aren't always mutually exclusive, after all.",Love & Other Drugs
89,jessie-39,Anne Hathaway continues to grow as terrific actress. Jake not too bad either.,10,4 December 2010,"My wife and I see over 100 movies a year, having been in the business and now retired. WE DO NOT READ ANY REVIEWS BY ANYONE. WE TRY TO TELL OUR FRIENDS THAT A CRITIC IS ONE PERSON, HE OR SHE IS NOT US. Critics are also a dying breed as newspapers disappear.Therefore, our critique is not biased and based on actually seeing the movie in a theatre. Many critics see the movies 5 at a time in a viewing room.Not a real atmosphere to gauge audience reaction. How can you review a movie without the real deal? Love&Other Drugs is a very poignant movie which is sexy, funny and very sad as well. Anne Hathaway continues to grow as an actress in the role of a 26 yr old with Parkinson's disease.She plays the role simply fantastic.

90,Gideon24,Gyllenhaal create mad chemistry here...,7,16 December 2015,"Love & Other Drugs is a 2010 romantic comedy that combines all the best elements of some contemporary love stories, as well as some classic love stories and takes some effective digs at the medical profession and the commercialism that invades some aspects of same.Jamie Randall is a charming and gregarious womanizer who can sell a stereo as effectively as he can talk a woman out of her panties, who gets fired from the stereo store and becomes a pharmaceutical rep for Pfizer, on the fast track to leading all other reps in the sales of prozac and zoloft.Maggie Murdock is a 26 year old woman who is very bitter about the fact that she has contracted Parkinson's disease at her young age and is afraid to become romantically involved with anyone because she's afraid that her medical condition will scare suitors away or that she will become a burden to them someday.It is the accidental meeting of these two very different people that forms the crux of this unconventional but winning romantic comedy that provides laughs, warmth, and the occasional misty moment without ever becoming cliché or maudlin. This is the real anti- romantic comedy that movies like Friends with Benefits profess to be, but weren't.Jake Gyllenhaal is slick and sexy as Jamie and Anne Hathaway offers one of her most affecting performances as Maggie...I don't think I have ever enjoyed Hathaway on screen as much as I did here...Hathaway creates a character of strength and vulnerability, who tries and mostly fails to disguise her anger about her medical condition and is convinced she can never have a normal life or a normal relationship. And together, Gyllenhaal and Hathaway create mad on screen chemistry that was only hinted at five years earlier in Brokeback Mountain.Director and co-screenwriter Edward Zwick scores points for presenting a realistic look at Parkinson's Disease and reminding the viewer that it is a condition that can be lived with. Zwick also provided the leads with a solid supporting cast including Oliver Platt as a co-worker of Jamie's; Hank Azaria as a doctor of questionable ethics, and Joshua Gad as Jamie's brother. Mention should also be made of a brief cameo by George Segal and the late Jill Clayburgh as Jamie's parents.I have to admit I was on board with this film almost immediately because I happen to think Jake Gyllenhaal is one of the sexiest men on the planet and those who don't might want to take a point off my rating. but there are other rewards to be found here for most fans of romantic comedy.",Love & Other Drugs

92,mirwais-orbit,An easy formula that insults my intelligence (once again),4,23 June 2011,"Here's a recipe to make a romantic comedy about an annoying couple:01) Jake Gyllenhaal's butt. 02) Anne Hatthaway's tits. 03) A lot of sex scenes to attract men audience that are there just for their wives/girlfriends that wanted so bad to watch it because, you know, men are sexual. 04) A lot of drama scenes to attract their wives/girlfriends that, until that moment, wasn't interested about Anne Hatthaway's tits because, you know, women are sensible. 05) An infamous discussion about love, leading to nowhere. 06) A very uncommon disease but not cancer, because cancer is now cliché, so... let's talk about Parkinson's Disease, that happens 99,9% of the time into old people population, but they decided to make a movie about the 0,1% of young people that can be affected because, you know... 27 years old Anne Hatthaway with Parkinson's Desease is now prettier than 81 years old Clint Eastwood. 07) A (un)funny-fat annoying ugly character to make comedy time effective. 08) Some unnecessary war between sexes for later discussions. 09) Some lack of rationality. 10) Confident-hard-as-rock characters that are able to hurt each other but deeply they have sensible souls. 11) And finally: the birth of love no matter its obstacles.That's it. You just have to mix it all and the success is granted and then the movie is able to receive unbelievable 7.3 of general ratings.Awful movie using the same awful formula for an awful easy money return.

93,priyantha-bandara,I was drugged,7,9 February 2011,"My score 3/5 There are so many romantic movies coming out and I sometimes can't really keep track of all. But the good thing is that almost all of them are purely the same. Boy meets girl, there is something unpleasant about their life before or after the starting of relationship, one of them finds out that to be too irritating and they break up and finally in the last 5 minutes they decide that they were born for each other and get back together. We assume that it's the last stupid thing they did and lived happily ever after. And then the credits with some cool song! What is totally different from movie to movie is the cast and the characters.'Love and other drugs' falls quite in the same formula. However there are one or two things which keeps it apart from the mundane date flicks and makes it actually watchable.I actually don't think I have to explain the plot. It's a love story and you know what love stories are like (If your totally out of the movie scene hope you read the first paragraph of this review). What's good about it is that it takes place in mid 90's and it makes you remember some stuff. Just like some good old music and dance moves for example. And our guy Jamie Randall (Jake Gyllenhaal-Jar Head, Brokeback Mountain) is a salesman and is about get rich by selling Viagra. Which brings us to the peak of some scenes with our girl Maggie Murdock (Anne Hathaway-Alice in Wonderland, Devil Wears Prada)who is a hot sick girl who suffers from stage 1 Parkinson's disease. When I mean hot girl it's really the deal of the movie and beware this 112 mts has quite a lot devoted to bed play and skin show...Now where was I? Yes OK. I was at the cast. There seems to be some good chemistry between Jake and Anna. Which runs the story quite smoothly. The viewer feels like they actually exists. Jake was actually nominated for Golden Globes best actor in a motion picture (Musical or Comedy) category for this role. So yes he is watch worthy.Script is well written and intelligent, most of the time throws everything back at your when you least expect it. There is love, fun, sex and pain disbursed throughout.There are lot of feelings and touching dialogues in 'Love and other drugs'.

94,Jakemcclake,Love and Drug Company Morality,7,3 December 2010,"SpoilersFirst, regarding the classification of Romantic Comedy, I call this movie a romantic dramedy, and not a comedy. There are few moments of comedy in this movie. The comedy centers around a certain supporting cast member, that you know is going to say or do something funny, the second that person appears on the screen. That said, I settled in waiting for a powerful romantic climactic ending as we see in other movies of this type. It did not take place. in drama, you need conflict. No conflict, no story.The climatic scene in this movie was a bit of a letdown. This is because the conflict, appears to be between a woman and herself. The conflict also revolves around a man's struggle to convince the ""sick girl"" that she is far more than someone he pities. Furthermore, there were other issues the movie could have pursued in the dramedy fashion, such as drug company morality. The issue was skirted, but far from the focus of the movie. Anne Hatheway was a usual very beautiful, but inexplicably angry throughout the movie. It fits with the anger of the character she played in Rachel Getting Married. But it does not make one care about whether she winds up with the guy.",Love & Other Drugs
95,JankiSharma,nicely done,8,20 December 2010,"I enjoyed the movie Love and other drugs. Anne Hathaway as Maggie Murdock did a wonderful job. Maggie is in her 20s and has Parkinson's disease. She lives on her own and manages to keep a brave and happy front. She tries to cope with her resting tremors secretively and also has moments of acute sadness about her disease condition. Jake Gyllenhall as Jamie Randall, also in his late 20s, is a fun loving guy. He loves fun and is smart. He becomes a pharmaceutical drug rep and because of his charming personality does well. He sells Zoloft and then Viagra. He meets Maggie while posing as an intern in her PCP's office. She had gone for her meds refill and of course to make sure hyperpigmented area on her left breast was not a significant medical problem. Jamie enjoys quick flashing of her breast and then on there is pure joy of having sex. Jamie and Maggie are great and have excellent scenes of nudity without making sex look cheap and vulgar. Even the scene when an older gentleman warns Jamie of having a bleak future of diapers with Parkinson's's afflicted wife sound sincere and real. The whole movie is done very well. Director Edward Zwick did a good job. There is great fun loving chemistry between Anne Hathaway and Jake Gyllenhall. Thanks, Pfizer, that couple does not need Viagra. They deserve to be Oscar nominees.",Love & Other Drugs
96,neenahhh,A lot more than the poster suggests,7,3 February 2011,"I wasn't expecting a lot when coming into this movie, so I guess I can say that I enjoyed it. I was expecting this movie to just be about sex after seeing the poster, but I was wrong. There was so much more.After watching the movie (and becoming biased from a few posts on the board), I realized that there were 2 separate stories and only one interested me. The first story was about a man becoming rich because of his sales of Viagra and Pfizer. The second story is about a woman who has Parkinson's and is afraid to fall in love. Heh, I'm a young girl. Take a wild guess at what plot captured my attention more.I liked the soft porn. Anne Hathaway was sexy. Jake Gyllenhaal was sexy. Everyone was sexy! Except for that disgusting pig of a brother, who I thought to be quite useless in this film. Sorry, Josh. I thought that the sex was done beautifully. Not too much, but it left the viewers wanting more. Or maybe that's just me. OKAY. Enough with the sex scenes.I really, really liked the whole Parkinson's plot! It made me curious about that disease. I learned new things while watching this film. Anne executed her role greatly. She played Maggie who was suffering from that illness and was hesitant to fall in love, for reasons that are unknown to me up to now. Jamie, who is played by Jake Gyllenhaal, gets to know her and after many sexual encounters, falls in love with her. I found that sweet, although many people complained that there wasn't enough emotional contact between the two. Psh. The ending got to me, with Jamie's speech and such. I didn't cry, though. But it was good.Nice movie. I don't get why the US version had to edit it, though. I guess I was lucky enough to watch the original unedited version. I'm giving this film a 7. It was supposed to be an 8, but the whole Viagra plot thing threw me off. But other than that, it was a good movie, I guess.""Sometimes the things you want the most don't happen and what you least expect, happens.

The performances in it are top notch, both Jake Gyllenhaal and Anne Hathaway are so on point it's scary. The best part of this movie is that it shys away from the traditional boy meets girl, girl falls in love, boy cheats on girl, and girl comes crawling back routine.The basic movie is jamie(Jake Gyllenhaal) is a sales rep who just lost his job so as a way to make some money he figures he'll become a drug rep and turns out its not quite as easy as he originally planned, he meets maggie on one of his jobs and it just starts going from there.

I felt no chemistry within these two very repellent characters with even worse terribly awkward interactions. So this is what happens when you put two celebrities who may have been packaged to a project because on paper it looked appealing and money making. Any additional negative words I have to say about this lame film would be more of the same. I do like Jake, but he was just cast w the wrong actor. I do believe Anne Hathaways is talented, but mostly miscast in this movie.

Hathaway is a winning presence (though I am afraid She had those grotesque lip expanding operations) and for the first time I found Gyllenhall not completely boring. Yet as if to insist we take notice of the attractive stars, the film makers give us not one but two fat slob characters who's every moronic utterance we are supposed to find hilarious. You know, because they are fat. Yes, not only Oliver Platt but the surpassingly revolting Jason Gadd make there excessively sweaty and fleshy presence known. The material is the standard cute cynical/sweet underbelly stuff Hollywood will shove in our faces until we finally say ""Enough's enough.""

100,lhhung_himself,Guess who's coming to Parkinson's,6,1 February 2011,"This is not a very good film overall. The characters are comic-book caricatures and the plot is unfocused. However, at least it didn't get all of the facts wrong when it came to the Parkinson's.Ann Hathaway's portrayal of a young person with Parkinson's was spot on, at least of the psychology, if not the symptoms (though she made a fine effort there too). Gyllenhaal also got the core of the caregiver/boyfriend relationship which was no easy task given the script he had to work with.Unfortunately, the film missed it's mark on everything else. There was the irony of the Viagra sales there, next to the reality of the Parkinson's. There was a great opportunity to make the point that some drugs like domperidone are only available in Canada because of FDA politics. Instead the film wimped out by having it prescribed by her neurologist rather than explaining that the bus load of people for Canada were going there, not just because drugs were cheaper, but because some are not marketed in the US. These drugs have to be brought in personally to avoid seizure by US Customs protecting drug patents.The convention of Parkinson's patients was not good. I would have preferred it if they had portrayed Parkinson's patients more like Maggie, trying to live life in a world that is designed for Jamie. I would have liked it if they had shown more of the stereotypes and unsympathetic reactions that Maggie would have to endure.But it's a start. ""Guess who's coming to dinner"" (the original) was not a very good or accurate film, but it was a necessary first step towards understanding and acceptance. Kudos to Hathaway and Gyllenhaal for having accomplished this and helping people understand a bit about Parkinson's.",Love & Other Drugs
101,bjones,A Grown Up Love Story,8,26 November 2010,"I admittedly had an inkling of what this was going to be about before going in. The trailers give enough away for that. I wanted to see this movie because I thought that, a) it would be fun, and b) it might have something to say worth hearing. Both turned out to be true.The premise is simple enough, young man who seems to be constantly on the make meets a sort of kindred spirit; or is she? This is a modern story in a number of senses of the word. Yes, it does involve the subject of sex and male/female relationships in a frank, modern way. But for me this went further. It made a deeper foray into the psyche of both of the lead characters in a way that surprised me for a film putting itself out there as some sort of romantic comedy. Yes, there are certainly comic moments to spare and yes, there are open, modern relationships laid bare to fully appreciate; a kind of full ripening more mature kind of love than we usually see in such vehicles.Both characters are shadowed by an almost blatant kind of intelligence, so their involvement gets more interesting than most (besides, any girl who keeps an engine lathe in her bedroom certainly draws my interest) as they begin to fillet each other down to the bare essentials - and their bare essentials are very bare and particularly lovely. As most films do, they try to find a way to inject some sort of conflict to ""make it more interesting"". I don't think that was necessary here. In real life, a relationship with their blatantly terrible challenges simply surviving is harrowing enough (I know as I've been down that road more than once).The lead characters do give more than just a certain life, a way of wanting them to succeed, to find a way to be in each other's grasp. The man, Jamie Randall, quite ably portrayed by the perpetually handsome Jake Gyllenhaal, is a study the type. Young, arrogant, nice looking and not a care in the world. Not a care, that is, until he meets Maggie Murdock, a character infused with life, beautifully animated by the alluring Anne Hathaway. They bring terrific performances, every bit ringing true, to their characters. It was great to watch them develop and it was very pleasurable to watch their on-screen ""chemistry"".I have to say that whoever staged the ""together times"" and love-scenes did an over the top job. Not for blatant sexuality or any kind of artistically displayed steaminess, but for a greater sense of reality that I've seen in almost any other film. I completely bought them as a couple, their little joys and affections with each other joyful to watch. The later manufactured conflict does nothing to diminish that chemistry and few actresses at any time have ever looked lovelier.The principals managed to carry this off and, at the same time, give dignity and concern to a very real, terrible disease and explore some of very real problems such diseases leave in their wake and the very real people who must live with them.Of course, there were a number of other performances fleshing out the story. That list is headed by Josh Gad as Gyllenhaal's brother, a hapless nerdy type who invites himself to stay for a while. Not to be outdone was a fine performance by Oliver Platt as Gyllenhaal's business associate and the equally good Hank Azaria as a doctor who becomes friendly with Gyllenhaal. Others such as Judy Greer, Jill Clayburgh (who just recently passed away in what is now her next to last film) and George Segal added depth to the surroundings, especially Platt who is always fun to watch with an added prize for ""playing-it-straight"" going to Teri Clark as an ER receptionist.All-in-all a night of entertainment worth the price of admission in spades.By Bruce L.

103,Macleanie,Not quite right,6,18 June 2019,"I do admire rom coms like this and how they can make you laugh even in the most serious of situations. Love and Other Drugs does this very well. The on screen rapport between Gyllenhaal and Hathaway is effortless, they complimented each other gracefully and the fact they are both wonderful actors meant they could deliver drama to the highest quality. Gyllenhaals character is not always likeable, however whilst the situations he faces in this unique job can provide much of the humour. I feel the movie's pace was its main weakness, it should have spent more time on these two brilliant characters rather than dipping in and out without any real conviction. It felt like Zwick really wasn't sure what to do with this rather complicated scenario at times. The films interpretation of this horrible illness and using this to make us laugh is truly wonderful and it was heartfelt to watch this relationship be built around it.

105,Criticalstaff,"Hey people, isn't Pfizer great?",3,8 October 2021,"So, Love & Other Drugs is the story of a guy who works as a sales rep at pharma giant Pfizer. Hence, love and other drugs. Haha, get it? That is the level at which the movie operates. That is actually one of the better jokes, it's all downhill from there.This movie is a long ad for pharma giant Pfizer. A corporate ad even, which makes it even less enjoyable to watch. The rest of the film, namely the characters, the plot and the emotional beats are only there to remind you how cool and awesome Pfizer is. And how there is a miracle drug for everything.We follow a dude named Jamie. He looks like Jake Gyllenhaal, that is to say he is good looking. He is smart, charming, he comes from a good family, he is ambitious. The only problem Jamie has, is that he is so good looking and good at sex that he ends being not as insanely rich as his rich brother. That is the premise. So naturally he goes to work for Pfizer, which we are explained is the richest and therefore the best company. It is actually amazing how liberated the movie is about money. Money is discussed openly. Most of the characters talk about money or take actions motivated by money with no consideration for ethics nor welfare. Women talk about how they want to date doctors. It is kind of gutsy. Money is not a way of fulfilling your dreams or living comfortably. But as a means to an end. Money is good to get rich and that is it. Rich good, not rich bad. It is jarring, but at least it is transparent. It feels like the filmmakers misunderstood the ""Greed is Good"" motto from Wall Street.The film's worldview on money is utterly gross, but that is nothing compared to the movie's worldview on sex.I have to admit that for a corporate ad, there is an unexpected amount of nudity. Even if you label this as a romantic comedy, and I don't know why you would, there is an excess of sex and full-frontal nudity. Sex is a constant preoccupation for most of the characters. Not love mind you, not even physical intimacy but plainly physical intercourse.This film is so bad because it completely misunderstands the grammar of the romantic genre. The main character is unredeemably unlikable. The romance between the leads is not established nor fleshed out. They meet and then they instantly have sex. There is no meet-cute, there is no obstacle to overcome. They have no reason to be together or to even like each other beyond they are both good-looking. Ultimately, that is the case in any number or romantic films, but you still have to have suspension of disbelief. Here the film has that very cynical money-is-everything tone it makes the love subplot stick out as superficial and even more contrived than it is.The Internship and Castaway were also corporate ads, but they were at least competent movies.",Love & Other Drugs
106,Jim-500,Standard Hollywood romance disguised as something else... but what?,5,3 December 2010,"This movie would like to be a moving commentary about love knowing no bounds, but it just ends up being another tired ""boy meets girl, boy loses girl..."" formula. This is combined with the ""jerk meets woman who makes him care about people"" (a la any Hugh Grant movie) storyline. Add a gross, immature male sidekick--ostensibly for comic relief--straight from a Judd Apatow movie and you have two hours of tedium.The woman in this case has Parkinson's disease, but despite the initial impression that this is going to make and shape the story, it actually plays a small role. Anne Hathaway's hands shake in a few scenes, and then she stumbles a bit, but in the rest of the movie she's as fine as ever. We have one scene where we meet other Parkinson's sufferers, but that's as close we get to addressing her affliction. The next minute, she's back in bed with Jake, acting as unafflicted as ever.The movie is full of sex jokes that often fall flat and dialogue that is supposed to be funny and isn't--mainly because the punchlines are often unintelligible. A quasi-orgy scene near the end makes no sense to the story and seems to serve only as an excuse for a few more sex jokes.The ending is completely removed from reality, as Anne Hathaway's character goes against the instincts she has trusted throughout. In real life, what her boyfriend does would be considered stalking. But this is Hollywood, and we must have a romantic speech from the man about how he desperately needs her (And yes--we even have an angel chorus as the music swells! At least the filmmakers didn't have the people on the bus break into applause--I'll give them that.). But true love doesn't come from need, it comes from want. And it seems to imply that no matter how strongly an independent woman rejects a man's advances, all he needs to do is to keep harassing her, and eventually she'll come around--because she's not capable of knowing what she really wants, and she needs him to point it out to her. I really didn't want the movie to end the way it did. It would have been much more interesting for both the audience--and the characters--to have kept on trying to figure things out. The ending speech says nothing more than he's already told her; alas, this time, she finally capitulates. I asked myself, Why? Good movies usually have the main characters showing some sort of growth and learning. But here, both characters regress: Anne's character doesn't stick to her guns, and Jake's character ends up codependent, needing her to fill up his empty life. Seeing them several years down the road and how Jake reacts to Anne's increasing feebleness would have added substantially to how we felt about both of them. As it was, they were merely two attractive people in lust with each other. A second plot line is about drug companies and the way they work to make money rather than care for people. In fact, the first part of the movie has some very entertaining scenes between Jake and his supervisor as we learn how callously corrupt the industry is. Just the fact that Jake knows this already, and is willing to speak out about it, is compelling and attractive. But this goes nowhere. Late in the movie, as Jake is trying to help Anne with her disease and investigates cures, he suddenly stops his efforts for no plausible reason. It's generally poor form to critique a movie for what it isn't as opposed to what it is. But the filmmakers have churned out a melodrama that wants to be a comedy that wants to be a melodrama, so it's hard to know what it is. Revealing the health care industry's inner workings, coupled with the Parkinson's story in light of the romance could have made for both an entertaining and thoughtful movie. What I thought was to be a love story with a sad twist, turned into a storyline as old as the hills. Using Parkinson's as a plot point but then not doing anything with it was quite clumsy. The disease thus becomes a MacGuffin in that it didn't have much to do with the story. You could have had the same storyline minus the malady, and it would have been basically the same movie. Overall, I left feeling empty-handed and wondering what I'd just seen.",Love & Other Drugs
107,jonnyhavey,Comedy + Drama + Romance = Life,8,25 November 2010,"Love and Other Drugs is a film that combines comedy, drama and romance into one film based off of the nonfiction book Hard Sell: The Evolution of a Viagra Salesman by Jamie Reidy. The film derives its power from the combination of the stories of the two main characters Jamie Randall (Jake Gyllenhaal) and Maggie Murdock (Anne Hathaway) and the journey they go through together in the medical sector of the United States. Jamie is an aspiring salesman for the pharmaceutical company Pfizer. He lives an empty life consisting of sleeping with a new woman every night and using them to get ahead in his career. His empty life style has left him all alone, however, everything changes when he has an awkward meeting with Maggie in a doctor's office while pretending to be an intern in order to coerce the doctor to sell his products Zoloft and Xanax. Maggie is an artist diagnosed with stage 1 Parkinson's disease and has found it very hard to become close to anyone because she has been let down her entire life. Jamie and Maggie both find a purely sexual release in one another that eventually turns into something more.Anne Hathaway has matured as an actress since her debut in The Princess Diaries in 2001 and is on track to receive her second best actress nomination for her role in Love and Other Drugs from the Academy. She has the best performance of her career for her heartfelt and terrifyingly brilliant performance that will leave a mark on your heart. Romance films usually suffer from a lack of originality making it hard for actors and actresses to connect with their character. However, Hathaway is able to embody her character emotionally and physically and combines her talents with the star power of Jake Gyllenhaal's portrayal of a complete heartless jerk creating an original and enjoyable film.Hathaway and Gylenhaal become one in the film through their numerous sexual escapades that break through the hard exterior barriers of their two characters and unmask their true identity. Therefore, the immense amount of nudity in the film is necessary in order to place the actors and characters in their most vulnerable states revealing the truth and showing that everyone has a hidden story.The character of Josh Randall played by Josh Gad tries too hard to create comedy throughout the film and fails over and over again. Instead of creating a laugh he comes off as very desperate. He is a very awkward character that does nothing more than just make the audience feel uncomfortable. Also, the MPAA R rating for this film should not be overlooked. Even though the nudity and sexual scenes in the film are necessary to the story, anyone who does not like movies that have a lot of sexual scenes and nudity should definitely skip seeing this film because of the vast amount sex.The film is able to balance comedy and drama flawlessly intertwining the two genres into a thoughtful natural medley that I recommend seeing now. Some people may call the film a romantic dramedy while others may call it a romance. While neither one of these is incorrect, a more accurate classification is the reality of life.",Love & Other Drugs
108,montera_iulian,This movie is a great stamp of failure put on every Anne-disbeliever's forehead.,7,3 February 2011,"I might be the only serious guy around here who actually enjoyed this flick. Love and Other Drugs directed by Edward Zwick, the guy behind movies like Blood Diamond, captured my attention mainly because of the chosen actors for the leading roles and in an ultimate desperate moment, because of the great reaction from the critics concerning the actual portrayals of the two leading actors.Of course this movie it's a love story, not like Love Story though but reminded me in a way of that movie simply because our female protagonist here, Maggie Murdock, portrayed by the talented Anne Hathaway suffers from a terrible disease which we all know as parkinson syndrome or parkinsonism. Besides that, Jake Gyllenhaal as Jamie Randall, is the same guy raised in a educated family and by chance also rich. Despite all the goodies that surrounded him, he grew up as being the rebel of the family: dropping out of school, living a life without engagements and being the playboy of the town (whichever town he lived, visited, went through or in... it doesn't really matter). Till this point, the characters are pretty much similar with Jennifer and Oliver from Love Story. The difference though is that the chemistry, the love story itself, the emotions revealed in the film are nowhere near that level. However, this doesn't mean the movie is bad. Not. At. All.The relationship between Maggie and Jamie is developing pretty well and realistic till some point. You are attracted to these characters, you care for them even if one appears to be a total douche and bastard while the others looks to be just another random silly slut. Two sex-buddies that once you're introduced to their deeper emotional states you find out a lot more nicer things about them. The clichés are here, especially considering the ending, but the movie must be taken for what it is, which is a movie that promotes unity in a relationship whatever the cost. It's like a big slap to all the douches that once they find themselves surrounded by problems and engaged in certain unwanted activities they quit and ran to the local cheap whor*. It's a good film to watch with your girlfriend/boyfriend because it's not that sad thanks to some really funny characters like Jamie's rich brother Josh played by Josh Gad (I don't know why I always think of God when saying that name)... It's a really impressive romantic drama filled with just enough comedy to keep you entertained enough to want more from this.The two protagonists, Jake Gyllenhaal and Anne Hathaway, give great performances, Anne especially because of her interesting role. I don't understand people who claimed Anne can't act. She did an amazing job before. Just because she started in more romantic comedies than serious movies that doesn't mean she can't act. This movie is a great stamp of failure put on every Anne-disbeliever's forehead. The acting itself, accompanied by a good structured story, a very good choice of music and a good technical execution made this movie one of the best romantic and -if I could say- dramatic comedies in 2010. I love the fact that this is a real mature movie even if it has it's childish clichés but the analysis itself of the characters and the issues emerged within their relationship are mature enough to entertain every adolescent out there.",Love & Other Drugs

111,Nobody-27,What a waste of talent!,1,12 March 2018,"I started watching this film more because I had to than because I wanted to. I was fully aware that I may not like it. I can usually tolerate even watching terrible stuff like the new Bladerunner, when there is a good reason.But this time, around 60 min mark, I had to stop. This film was hurting my brain, and burning holes in it. Why, you ask? Oh boy, where do I start. Let's see:
A brother who jokes about oral sex (they used much more crude language in the scene however) with his brother during dinner with their mother present. That was supposed to be funny.An alienated looser of a drug salesman who has not a trace of humanity in him, falls in love with a girl who has no personality, other than her Parkinson. And I am supposed to care?Dialogues which confuse swearing with meaning. Crude and dumb to no end.Any time those things (bad dialogues, untenable relationship) fall apart, we get a sex scene, which is even worse. Sex is uninspired, loveless, crude, unfunny, uncaring, and all too logical/brainy to be interesting. It is what a teenager who never had sex imagines sex scenes should be like. Oh, and she does not want him back, and he falls for her even more, just like that. Bring that gawd-awful brother back!Jake G. and Anne H. were quite good, but good acting does not a good film make, especially not when the script is awful. They should have rejected those roles. I bet this film did not look any better on paper either.You get the idea. The film or script was made by people who have no interest or ability to understand human condition. They have the finesse of a nuclear weapon, and artistic flair of ""paint by numbers"" book.

I thought that the story-line was good and I liked how it was two hours long but it didn't seem to drag. Overall I would say that Love and Other Drugs is a great film with some great actors.

115,iReviewFilms,Fanaticalaboutfilms Review: Love And Other Drugs,7,21 March 2011,"In general I fit the stereotypical male movie goer- guns = good, action = good, comedy = good, romance = good...as long as it combines a lot of guns and action and so it was with a bit of trepidation that I approached Love And Other Drugs which I had down as a bit of a romcom.The movie is about Jamie (Jake Gyllenhaal) who is a bit an all round confidant chap and knows how to handle himself with the ladies. After hopping from sales job/woman to sales job/woman he finally lands another one as a pharmaceutical rep selling to all of the local clinics in his area. Competition is tough between reps though so wooing the receptionists is all part of the game plan which plays nicely into his hands. During one such visit he meets Maggie (Anne Hathaway) and is determined to have her.Maggie is a creative type who has been limited by the onset of Parkinson's Disease and shares Jamie's belief in how to have a good time. I got the feeling that this is more due to her underlying hatred of the disease meaning she doesn't want to guilt anyone into having to look after her in the future and so intentionally tries not to form a relationship whereas Jamie just doesn't want a relationship in the first place. The movie does bring up the issue of Parkinson's Disease especially in younger people and is handled with the respect it deserves. Where a OTT romcom might have used it as a way to get a few cheap laughs, this treats it with importance and helps make it slightly better than the generic romcoms.The plot does become a bit predictable in places and I was never really left wondering what was going to happen at the end. It would also have been beneficial if during the movie some idea of time had been kept so as to stop me from wondering if one day, week or even a couple of months had flown by.Some of the best laughs come at the expense of Jamie's brother Josh (Josh Gad) a self made millionaire (although you would never know it) who is nothing like his brother in any respect. There is lots of boisterous brotherly banter and awkward moments between the two which is refreshing and reminds you that this movie is not just about the romance. Hats of also goes to the people picking the soundtrack as they hit the nail on the head with great tunes at just the right times.In the end though this movie stands up due to the on-screen chemistry between Gyllenhall and Hathaway who were not afraid to get down and dirty for the cause. Quick quips and teasing jokes between the two of them and copious amounts of promiscuity help the cause in defining their complex relationship.Was I blown away by this movie? No but it was better than I thought because it made me laugh with a few good comic scenes, showed off plenty of Anne Hathaway (wolf whistles please) and opened up the less well known world of what it's like to try and live with Parkinson's on a day to day basis and the emotions that come with it.For further reviews feel free to check out: http://www.fanaticalaboutfilms.com",Love & Other Drugs
116,hjames-97822,Not Worth The Time Unless You have Nothing Else To Do,2,9 April 2015,"I won't take up a lot of your time here. The script is the biggest problem here. It is mediocre at best. It tried to cover way, way too much ground. From their relationship to the state of big pharmacy in America to dealing with a major disease, the focus gets spread way too wide here.In another time this would have been a Rock Hudson/Doris Day film, except they would have kept their cloths on. It's fluff, not great movie making. For my part, in this film, I found most of the nudity and sex (this routine Hollywood simulated sex has become boring, at least for me) was written in for marketing purposes. More on that to follow.I have nothing against any of this, I just thought it was raunchy and mostly out of place. I think every director and writer have a professional obligation to take their storyboard scene by scene and question themselves as to whether or not what they want to film is A) in good taste and B) something they really--need--to ask their actors both male and female to do. That includes nudity, simulated sex, dangerous car chases, jumping out of planes, etc. You owe it to your people to ask ""Is there any other way to shoot this scene that will do the job?"" One of Jake Gyllenhaal's finest roles was that in Brokeback Mountain. Of course the film had some very graphic scenes, that was in my opinion quite different. First, the screenplay came from two of the finest writers and authors of our generation. It was IMHO a masterpiece when it hit the directors desk. Second that script and those actors (all of them) were in the hands of a genius director who gave us a frame-able painting with every shot. Nude or not.Frankly I have a personal list of actors whom I would respectfully say may keep their cloths on for the foreseeable future. Whatever they have to show has already been seen, ad nauseum. Both these leads have made my list.One last note. Your first clue that sex and or graphic nude scenes have been deliberately added by the producers and or directors is what you see coming out of the studio PR and marketing machine. Watch the trailers. And specifically watch the interviews the actors are contracted to give with the media. The PR folks are looking to fill seats and they will prepare media relations kits that literally coach interviewers on what to ask and appropriate clips will be provided. When you see (as is the case here) interview after interview after interview that has the actors spending 75% of the time answering questions about nudity with other actors and giggling about what to say (without saying too much) I guarantee you, you've been played.",Love & Other Drugs

If it were even more realistic it would be a documentary, and lose most of its audience. I'm not suggesting this is a great film; I don't think it is. However, I did feel that there was a level of honesty here one does not get in most ""rom-coms"" (not that this was intended to be one). Overall, the characters were more human than what one expects from a big budget Hollywood film these days. The plot was clearly ""forced,"" but how many films can't be criticized on these grounds? I somewhat agree with the reviewer who said that it doesn't ""add up to anything satisfying,"" and that Hathaway's acting was a distraction (Gyllenhaal was good).I would have liked this to be more about how the pharmaceutical industry manipulates people while selling drugs that may be dangerous or not particularly more effective than ""tried and true"" medications, and the first part of the film, which was focused on this, was well done. Then it became something quite different, not as realistic nor as involving, and the pace slowed down as well. It almost felt like two films were merged together, with a nod to the ""rom-com,"" perhaps to entice more young females. I think this could have been ""saved"" if the Gyllenhaal character had been given a reason to ""grow up."" My ending would be that he realizes he does not possess enough ""character"" to deal with her illness as it worsened, and he ""let's her go."" He pulls up aside the bus, sees that she does not notice him, and then takes his foot off the gas. We see his car slowly fade into the distance.

125,scarletheels,Mildly Schizophrenic,5,6 August 2011,"Love and Other Drugs is based on Jamie Reidy's Hard Sell: The Evolution of a Viagra Salesman, a book about his years at Pfizer during the pharmaceutical company's Golden Age. Jamie (Jake Gyllenhaal) is a womanizing, smart-mouthed slacker who gets fired from his job at an electronics store after he's caught in the act with the boss's girlfriend. He lands a gig as a sales rep for the big pharma giant and, true to his ways that have never failed him before, uses his charm and good looks to get an 'in' with Dr. Stan Knight (Hank Azaria). He convinces Stan to let him observe his appointments and take notes, under the guise of a medical intern. This is when he meets Maggie (Anne Hathaway), a sharp-tongued, free-spirited artist who also suffers from early onset Parkinson's disease.They form a kind of friends with benefits relationship that serves them well in the beginning. Maggie doesn't want to get too close to anyone for fear of becoming a burden and Jamie is focused on scoring a big promotion to Chicago. As their casual sex arrangement transforms into a more emotional connection, Jamie must come to terms with her Parkinson's long-term in order to open himself up fully to love but it's Maggie alone who finally accepts her illness. As he struggles with his own demons, he must also indulge the whims of his younger brother, Josh (Josh Gad), who's moved in with him, constantly find new ways to one-up a rival pharmaceutical rep (Gabriel Macht), and pimp out hot females to Stan in order to stay his numero uno.I am a fan of Ms. Hathaway. Her personality and smile light up a room, she's a versatile and talented actress, and she seems like a down-to- earth individual. But I don't think she was right for this role. I didn't get the artsy-fartsy vibe from her. Sporting beanie hats and bohemian clothing doesn't make a person an artist. Ordinarily, nudity doesn't bother me but seeing her naked all of the damn time became tiresome. To be fair, I was sick of seeing Jake Gyllenhaal's butt, as well. Jamie's transformation from insensitive jackass to adoring boyfriend is hardly believable amid steamy pajama parties and threesomes and flesh-peddling for doctors. Nice, melodramatic ""I'm head over heels in love with you"" speech at the end but, by that time, I didn't care.I think I would have liked Love and Other Drugs more if it hadn't come off so schizophrenic and desperate for attention. It was trying to be too many things for too many viewers - weepy romance, light-hearted comedy, social and corporate commentary, soft core porno, Pfizer documentary... therapist. If they had concentrated their efforts on two, even one, less sub-plot, it would have made a noticeable difference. There's no doubt that this is the film to watch if you're hungry for healthy doses of Hathaway's rack (which is beautiful, by the way - full and all-natural) or Gyllenhaal's ass (also decent) but as a rom-com, it lacks depth and the laughs.",Love & Other Drugs

It has been a long time that I have seen a movie couple with such a natural chemistry. Anne Hathaway and Jake Gyllenhaal are delivering close to brilliant performance and both them almost got rewarded with a Golden Globe.People who want to see a romantic comedy in this film might be right, however if they ignore the other aspects in this movie they might don't understand it or they kill puppies for fun! A Romantic comedy has 2 medium talented actors that meet, split up for a shallow reason and get back together... the end! There are no questions asked because the audience demands it. Dealing with a girl that has Parkinson's disease with a future ahead of you that can only get worse while you self are in your prime and a rising star in a major company is a different and a more serious scenario! Some reviews said the disease was meant to manipulate the audience... like I said before, they don't get it or they kill puppies. Parkinson's disease is serious, millions have it but nobody talks about or draws a picture what the spouses and families are going through. It is great that a major studio took the risk to produce this bumming story and put 2 of their finest actors in it!Before the release there was a lot of fuzz around the nudity in this movie, it is America, people still care and find it shocking... While i just padded the studio execs on the shoulder I have to be mad at them for the way this movie was promoted! People are lead to believe they'll see a bratty romantic comedy with lots of nudity of 2 incredibly attractive lead characters, I can see why they get disappointed. An audience with a fetish for these light movies without any substance will walk out of the theater and are probably bummed out, or don't understand the decisions Jake Gyllenhaal makes in the end of the movie. Those who didn't have any expectations will find this movie brilliant.Love and other drugs got a great mojo, it is an interesting story topped with 2 absolutely great actors who made it look natural and real.

Because the subject (the attempt of turning cinema goers attention to a dreadful disease of Parkinson) is made in such a way, that doctor James Parkinson must be now turning in his graveDo not waste time on this ""romantic"" ""comedy"". This picture has very little romance; this picture is almost completely not funny.

With actors like Anne Hathaway and Jake Gyllenhaal in the lead, not only is the automatic on-screen chemistry but if in your opinion the script may go weak(which it didn't for me),their performances and very strong and excellent. The awareness of Parkinson's disease and upcoming of Viagra not only gave the movie meaning but made it even more interesting. If you are in the mood for an adult comedy(and it is adult as is shows a lot of skin) then you need to see this movie. As for Hathaway's and Gyllenhaal's Golden Globe nominations...Yes they are definitely strong contenders. It a movie that everyone can enjoy so go see it.",Love & Other Drugs
130,jsmith98-1,Accurate Portrayal of a Pharmaceutical Representative!,8,9 April 2021,"This is a much better and deeper movie than you get from the trailers. First it has Jake Gyllenhaal and the incredible and extremely talented Anne Hathaway as the main characters. They have great onscreen chemistry and must like working with each other. She played his wife in the break out film, ""Brokeback Mountain"" and did an excellent job with the part. The plot is a lot deeper than it seems from the trailers. It's definitely a movie worth the time to watch. This movie starts out as an interesting look at the Pharmaceutical Representative business and it's pretty wild. My sister graduated from college and she worked as one for almost four years until she was able to afford to get her degree in Veterinary Medicine. She has similar stories about crazy parties and getting trips to Cabo and other places if she nabbed the right Dr or surpassed her sales goals. So Gyllenhaal's part isn't that much of a departure than what real Drug Reps we're getting away with back then. Then he meets Maggie and Jamie, Gyllenhaal's character fall deeply in love with Maggie despite her lack of wanting to be in a commented relationship. He eventually finds out that she has the early stages of Parkinson's Disease. In my opinion, one of the saddest scenes in this film is that Maggie has been helping Senior Citizens go across the border into Canda to buy their medications cheaper. Senior Citizens are still having trouble now in 2021 with affording their medications and some are skipping doses and using less of some medications as they can't afford them! It's just unbelievable that this is the America we live in almost 30 years after this movies time frame was suppose to be reflected by. I'm not going to give away the ending as it should be watched and maybe people will see that Love is more powerful than any Drug!My sister was the actual reason I saw this movie in the first place. Back before the government started cracking down on the incentives Big Pharma would offered to these Drug Reps she would get trips to tropical destinations and huge bonuses if she could persuade a Dr or Hospital to use the medication she was sponsoring. She was fresh out of college and a friend of hers got her into this field. She traveled extensively and made a bunch of money. Now she is a Veterinarian and she has to deal with similar issues in veterinary medicine with Drug Reps. She sometimes calls to tell me when one comes in and they want to try and sell her on dog and cat psychological medications! Yes dogs and cats have anxiety problems. She is more interested in how much the business has also changed. She was young and really cute, hence the main reason she was hired.

Perhaps, this movie should be a film school problem -- what went wrong here and how can it be fixed.

134,jimrin,A wide view of opinions on this film..,8,18 February 2012,"Looking over the comments, it's almost as if it's a love it or hate it relationship with this movie. The hate it part typically centers around there's nothing special about this movie. While there was no love interest in the book from which the movie is based, the book is based on the true story as told by Jamie Reidy. Therefore, for me, it was interesting to have a retrospective view of the hey day of the 90's, especially how companies including pharmaceuticals were doing every they could to increase their bottom-line (well, and still do in fact). The love interest part was also touching. Anne Hathaway did a admirable job portraying someone with stage 1 Parkinson's Disease. The clips from the ""other"" convention were priceless as well to reflect what people with Parkinson's Disease have to go through. I don't know this for a fact, but I felt that some people with Parkinson's Disease were used as extras as other people listening to the speeches. I think Hathaway's portrayal of Parkinson's Disease is as significant, if not more, than Dustin Hoffman's portrayal of autism... (Not that it was necessarily that accurate, but Hoffman received a lot of praise for his portrayal.) Anyway, I thought this movie provided a truly touching story between two people who face their own challenges in the world and realize what is really important in life.",Love & Other Drugs

139,myc4971,A Rom-Com Trying Hard to Break Out of the Mold,5,30 January 2011,"Let's face it. There's a market out there for romantic comedy and the truth is even the plot of these movies are tired and formulaic, we still go to them because it makes us feel good. It makes us hope that it can happen to us.Once in a while, there are some movies that shine from these genre that pushes boundaries --- ""Four Weddings and a Funeral"", ""Love Actually"", ""Jerry Maguire"", As Good as it Gets or ""Tootsie"" that does it wonderfully. And then there are those who fails miserably. And I'm afraid it's the case here in ""Love and Other Drugs"".It has all the right things --- a great director, a great assembly of talented actors and a great idea for a movie. However, something went wrong with the execution. Jake Gyllenhaal, as much he is talented --- was totally miscast in this movie. It was just so painful to watch him be the adorable player that everyone loves.... it just doesn't work. I never felt he was totally comfortable and connected with the character he was portraying. I just feel that there are other actors who can slip in perfectly in the role of the player going straight (Ryan Reynolds, James Franco, Jonathan Rhys Myers, to name a few).I'm not sure if the self-indulgent nudity helped in moving the plot and if it helped in the believability. Okay we get it, sex is such an essential part of any relationship and that it's the most basic attraction that we respond to but I just felt it didn't do much to set the movie apart from all the rom-coms. It tries so hard to be different, it tries to be honest at times, it tries to pull off things that you won't normally see in other love stories --- but bottomline, it wasn't just successful in breaking the mold.Anne Hathaway, I think, was the only one who was able to pull up some weight in this movie. Portraying her character with believability and impeccable detail that made her endearing. She's definitely a rom-com leading lady! So here's wishing that if Zwick and Gyllenhaal decides to take a shot at this genre again, they rethink their position and perspective. You don't have to do so much to push the envelope. Charm goes a long long way.And for those critics and guys who keeps on dissing rom-coms. Cmon, if you're not into the genre, then don't come in and see it!",Love & Other Drugs

Anne Hathaway and Jake Gyleenhaal have good chemistry on screen and secondary characters help to bring equilibrium to a movie that other way could turn to be a little depressing. I also think that this movie doesn't deserve the R rating just because it deals with sex ( I live in Mexico and here we have something like PG-15)hopefully people don't feel to uncomfortable with the sex scene because it gives more credibility to the story.In the end the film works better than others of its genre and its worth a look ( probably not for a first date) but if you are already on a relationship it will give you something to think and talk about.",Love & Other Drugs

Both Anne and Jake put in terrific performances of a very sharply written script, with Anne's possible Oscar material. It did get a bit maudlin at the end, and one has to wonder whether true love really will overcome the dark picture of the disease painted for Jaime (Jake) by the spouse of a Parkinson's sufferer, but hey, let's hope it does. The only depiction I didn't like was of Jake's doofus brother, obviously put in to gain some guffaws from the 16-year old male moviegoer. In the end, very enjoyable and interesting, especially in light of how often we've seen these gorgeous young pharma reps sitting in the doc's office and wondered what they were all about.

142,SkyPowers,It blends genres and emotions and it works.,8,30 November 2010,"This is what happens when filmmakers ferment like a fine wine. They let their art breathe and only by doing so can it come to life, often in a form not originally envisioned. Ed Zwick knows how to ringmaster, in this case as insiders know, listening to Anne Hathaway's interpretation of her character and letting her run with it. As Maggie, a spunky-bright woman dealing with prescription drug addiction, she encounters Jamie (Gyllenhaal), a charismatic seductive salesman whom Maggie tags immediately ... and allows him to sell her -- mainly wild and vigorous sex. We soon learn her drugs are used not for recreation, but to subdue a serious condition we find out later. As a result, she has erected an emotional wall by using detached sex as cover ... insisting never to seriously get involved with Jamie. The supporting cast is flawless, zipping in and out as the film segues between slapstick comedy, light romantic comedy to drama ... organically interweaving plot and character twists and building to a walloping crescendo. For writers and directors, you know how delicate it is to balance light with darkness and these guys appear to do it effortlessly and at breakneck speed, the moment you feel a tear coming on ... boom, comic relief.

Their respective friends -his loser brother and her gay black friend (sounds familiar?) are just useless for the plot.The ""originality"" is in the ""dramatic"" story of Hathaway's character and the 90's background, with its medical consumerism and the negotiation with the health system.

What is wrong with Hollywood these days, cannot even find a decent extra. Minimal usage of cameo also. I like the comedy a bit, but in most cases there is no comedy lines here. Just funny scenes and awkward situations.All and all, it is nice to see a movie like this. I like the use of songs, makes me wants to buy the soundtrack.

146,alerter,"smartest dramatic romantic-comedy in ages; nay sayers suffer from cold hearts, narrow minds",7,19 November 2010,"The story of Anne Hathaway's Maggie Murdock and Jake Gyllenhaal's Jamie Randall has been told before in what was once known as tear-jerker, ""disease-of-the-week"" TV. The difference here is the organic layering of a ""romantic-comedy"" atop three dramatic subtexts -- the overall health care crisis, pharmaceutical companies' influence over physician scripts and the trials/tribulations of living with Parkinson's disease. The smartness of the framing drama is signature Ed Zwick and is superior to the moronic contrivances that are typically used to stitch together most romantic-comedies today.It never hurts to have highly talented ""eye candy"" filling the screen, too.Jake has maintained his non-gym rat ""cut"" from Prince of Persia and I had no real idea about Anne's considerable physical assets, until this go around. Beyond physicality, they add palpable on-screen chemistry, with ample acting range that makes some people wonder about these two being a real-world, off-screen pairing. By no means is this just a ChickFlick(TM). It's an Equal-Opportunity-to-Enjoy date movie.Jamie's a natural born salesman, a self-described ""sh*thead"", with suitably situational ethics and mores. He knows that sex sells and never shies away from it. He feigns ADD, but is really a whip-smart, premedical college dropout -- the oldest son, in a family spoiled by medical and financial success. He's a prototypical 1990s ne'er-do-well. Gyllenhaal nails the part with a gee-shucks, then pour-it-on charm, telegraphing that Jamie knows he skates on his good looks over the thinnest ice. Once the ice gives way, Jamie is forced to suddenly flee from commissions-based consumer electronics into entry-level Big Pharma sales. Being a newly minted ""health care professional,"" by Pfizer's sales organization, Jamie is shipped to Pittsburgh, where he is to prove himself in market-share battle, under the tutelage of minor-cog sales manager Bruce Winston (Oliver Platt).Maggie's a talented and nonconformist visual artist, in multiple media, who's living with early onset (stage 1) Parkinson's disease. She seems to make ends meet by waiting tables at a small-but-trendy coffee house, as well as by organizing senior citizen excursions to Canada to buy affordable prescription medications. Young, beautiful and incurably ill, uninsured/cash-economy Maggie has a serial history of romantic (or were they merely sexual?) liaisons with men who would be her savior. But Maggie doesn't want to be saved by anyone. She considers herself to be a ""sh*thead,"" of sorts, too.Maggie and Jake first cross paths during one of Jamie's doomed-to-fail efforts to try to meet his Zoloft sales quotas. Prozac has a 100% lock on the scripts of local market trend-setting GP, Dr Stan Knight (Hank Azaria). Jamie has managed to bribe his way into Dr Knight's private practice rounds in order to study the latter's daily workflow. Posing as an ""intern,"" Jamie rides Dr Hank's coattails into a medical consultation with (and impromptu breast exam of) Maggie, who needs to have her multiple scripts for Parkinson's, and all of the attendant side-effects, refilled.After Jamie's deception is exposed and the requisite, unethical persistence in obtaining Maggie's phone number, the two find ostensibly ""honest"" common sexual ground, where neither wants anything more from the other, other than an ongoing FWB arrangement, with hot-and-heavy emphasis on the B-part (pretty much the stuff that fuels a lot of Craigslist ""CAS"" fantasy.) If that's all there was to L&OT, then it would be just another dumb-as-a-bag-of-screws romantic-comedy, no matter how beautifully and tastefully lensed.What attracted Zwick and co-writer Charles Randolph to tell this story were larger (harder?) issues raised in Jamie Reidy's non-fiction book, Hard_Sell:_The_Evolution_of_a_Viagra_Salesman. Viagra is played to the hilt for jokes, but... We're living in the midst of an ongoing health care crisis, where physicians confront ongoing undue influence from Big Pharma, HMOs and insurers in decisions that ought to be strictly medical. What was once an ""higher calling,"" has become just another job (albeit, highly compensated, with accompanying high stress and high professional/financial risk).Physicians are routinely enticed to write scripts through offers of free gourmet meals, paid vacations (dressed up as educational junkets), outright cash payments (for ""teaching"" speaker-ships) and ""miscellaneous"" services. All of that really happens and, just maybe, contributes significantly to the high-price of name brand prescription medications.We also see an highly compressed story (it's not supposed to be Medical School) of living with Parkinson's (with many technical advisers thanked in the end credits, including Michael J Fox).Yes, Maggie's story is fictional, but it rings with authenticity.People who find themselves saddled with debilitating, life-threatening, chronic illness, who strive to live the best life that they can manage to, have a right to make their own choices as to how best to do exactly that -- and to be accepted, respected and even loved for those choices, however they pan out, without pity. (That's not even easy to write down.) Sometimes, True Love is asymmetrically, even messily, welded to Real Needs. L&OD conveys that, from the writing all the way to the faces and eyes of Gyllenhaal and Hathaway in extreme close-up. It's straight up Drama, that doesn't diminish the romantic-comedy. The former only serves to accentuate the latter and vice-versa.Platt and Azaria are to be thanked for their supporting turns that help carry the film without ever stealing it away. They're every bit as versatile as the leads. I don't need or want every film I see to be ""Oscar worthy,"" but I always look for smart entertainment that doesn't insult me as a member of the audience.L&OD is the only romantic-comedy that I've felt compelled to write something about to date. I was taken completely by surprise.(I will also miss Jill Clayburgh, 1944-2010, who lost her long-running battle with lymphoma. We may get to see her work one more time in 2011's Bridesmaids.)",Love & Other Drugs
147,seanebuckley,Tiresome.,2,1 April 2012,"Love and Other Drugs is in a word, confused. Its a film that doesn't quite know what it is. Is it a film about the ever expanding morally murky world of pharmacuticals? or is it a re-run of the much tried and very tested love through adversity schtick? if i'm honest i don't think either story presented here is particularly engaging or interesting but if Zwick were to have focused on just one maybe the movie would have been at least bearable.I must say that Hathaway does the best she can with what she is given here and is believable as a trodden artist cum parkinsons suffer. She handles the superficially complex duality of her character with aplomb allowing herself to be both (seemingly) care free and independent whilst always relying or needing the attentions/affections of a suitably shallow male here played by Jake Gyllenhaal. Just to be clear, Gyllenhaal will never be an actor of substance, he is too defined by his odd mannerisms and his strange, intriguing looks. Here Gyllenhaal re-treads the familiar Tom Cruise, Matthew MacCournehey styled cock sure alpha male, who is of course always slightly more fractured than his bravado would have us believe. Like previously stated, its all a little tired.Probably the most tiresome element of the film is the regularity of the 'sex'. Since the re-emergence of R-rated comedies we have been peppered with crude references to hyper real sexual situations but this definitely the most insulting example of the trend. Here sex is used to make the film seem more adult and grown up, when in reality the way the screenplay treats the 'real' elements of the plot is superfulous and superficial. The sex is never a plot device nor does it aid us in getting to know the characters, its just something that happens like when a car blows up in an action movie and our hero doesn't even react to it as he walks away. Therefore, the disease is never disected or respected nor is it ever used a serious tool. It does however feel more like a desperate and basic attempt to make Hathaway more likable and therefore by association Gyllenhaal if only because he sticks around and still wants to have sex with her. The parrallel between Gyllenhaals job and Hathaways disease should the movies emotional anchor but instead its ignored as we watch them fool around. I do understand that they are both ignoring the elephant in the room as it were, but here it feels laboured and shallow and not grown up and challenging.Finally, i am not someone who cant enjoy the simple pleasures of these types of film. If you were to ask me, i would champion movies like Friends With Benefits which somehow manages to both syrupy and racy which is surely down to two fun-loving leads and a neat and tidy screenplay. I would even reference something like Knocked Up for a movie that walks a similarly 'adult' path with more regular levels of success. Its a shame then to watch a film with such talent behind it (Zwick is/was full of promise, Hathaway is by all acounts a good actress) become something that is just so full of nothingness and boring nevermind unfunny.Crap.",Love & Other Drugs
148,PopcornJury,"Solidly Entertaining, But Mildly Depressing: A Dramatic Film Disguised as a Rom-Com",7,4 December 2010,"Love & Other Drugs could've been a standout movie. In fact, it probably could've been two. What starts as a light hearted rom-com starring Jake Gyllenhal quickly turns into a dark character study on what it's like to fall in love with someone who's ill. The first part of the movie is great. The second part is too. But when both plot lines blur together in the middle, the film turns into a quiet game of cat and mouse, leaving the audience a little confused as to whether they should laugh, cry, or simply sit in the theater in silence.Love & Other Drugs tells the story of Jamie Randall, a med school drop out who happens to be one hell of a salesman. After losing his job on the sales floor at a local entertainment store, Jaime decides his next step should be pharmaceutical sales. Next thing you know, he's working for Pfizer, selling Zoloft, and eventually Viagra to doctors in the Ohio area. These scenes are fun, filled with a lighthearted energy and charisma from Gyllenhal. He's the man we want to be, selling his way to the top, or at least trying not to be at the bottom.One day Jamie meets Maggie, an independent girl who happens to be a patient at one of Jamie's frequented offices. He finds out early on that she has Parkinson's disease, a disorder of the central nervous system that impairs motor skills, cognitive processes, and other functions. They sleep together, they grow apart, they sleep together, and they fall in love. Little does Jamie know, dating someone with an illness isn't an easy task. Just when things seems to be great, they fall apart, and it leaves both parties physically and mentally drained.Love & Other Drugs asks a lot of deep moral questions. That's the good stuff in the script. It tackles questions head on that most people don't necessarily think about when falling in love. What if the one you love is ill? Would you take care of them for the rest of your life? Wouldn't it just be easier to walk away? The scenes that deal with this subject matter are some of the strongest I've seen this year, but when one scene begs these questions, and the next deals with an unwanted (and unending) erection, I can't help but feel like there's an elephant in the room that is clearly bordering on inconsistency.Overall, I just can't help but label Love & Other Drugs as a collection of wonderful scenes that when brought together just doesn't quite work. It's sweet, romantic, and the on screen chemistry between two A-list actors will be enough to entertain, but overall, I just really wish this film could've been something better. I wish it could've stayed a rom-com, with Gyllenhal sleeping his way too the top only to realize that it's one of the girls at the bottom that truly makes him happy. Even moreso, I wish it would've started as a drama, with Gyllenhal working as a representative for a Parkison's research fund that just happens to meet Maggie at a convention. The rest of the story would be a sad one, with both parties falling in love only to come to the realization that there would be no cure, but their love alone could pull them through. Instead, it's a hybrid, an unfortunate meeting of the minds. Regardless, the two halves are solid, but as a whole, I'm left entertained but underwhelmed.On a side note, there's one scene where Maggie and Jamie attend a convention with other individuals who have Parkinson's disease. It's one of the most powerful scenes I've seen this year. The emotion, truth, and subtext present in this scene is what could've made this movie a standout. Instead, we're left with an assortment of funny, sad, cute, and cuddly that hits a number of notes, just not necessarily the right ones.Michael Buffa Editor, Popcorn Jury http://popcornjury.com",Love & Other Drugs

Having worked at a big studio, I could feel the hands of the creative executives and their ""notes"" all over the screenplay: suck us in in the first thirty minutes with laughs and sex and then try to get us to buy into the drama of beautiful woman who is going to live a horrible life. Oh, don't forget that vulgarity is in vogue, so throw in the obese, sophomoric, internet-rich brother, to bring the sophistication level down to the worst Judd Apatow movie and let's throw in a totally unnecessary role for Oliver Platt. This seemed more like the first draft of a novice's screenplay than a professionally crafted effort. The screenplay (and the director) never could figure out where to go next. My biggest problem was that the Gyllenhall character, whose ""arc"" moves form a charming womanizer to a committed man. He was never a jerk or a bad guy and never did or said one thing in the movie that the audience could dislike him for; hence his transformation to a guy who loves a fantastic, beautiful, sexy woman wasn't that big a step or, rather, not an impressive arc. This movie needed a page one rewrite as it moved from rom-com to dramady to expose of big pharma, to vulgar for no reason andfailing to succeed anywhere. No red blooded man will ever complain about seeing Anne Hathaway nude but after a while it seemed like a gimmick--we get the fact that she was sexually liberated. Ten nude scenes didn't make the movie any better.",Love & Other Drugs

Love and Other Drugs is not your typical romantic comedy; Elements of drama and reality are frequently too present to make it so. A fine performance by the all grown up Anne Hathaway nonetheless fails to capture on a dramatic realm. In spite of the well-timed comedic aspect, punctuated with laughing out loud moments throughout the film- A recurring product placement for Pzifer, throughout the entire film, becomes really annoying.

The writing was incredibly tight and Edward Zwick's direction was flawless. I had a problem with Maggie at first but as this film develops she manages to win you over, scene by scene. Jake, Anne and Oliver were dead on. Hank Azaria nailed it as a doctor having to deal with today's realities in his practice, Josh Gad was wonderful even if his character did not had to be such a stereotypical side kick. About the thing that was a little force was Jamie's brother and even his character arc grew. This has to be one of the best romantic comedies I've seen since I don't know when. Intelligently writing, masterfully directed and superb acting makes me give it a must see.",Love & Other Drugs

Like, we all need some high budget, highly stereotypical romantic movie with foreseeable plot sometimes, don't we? Well, I got more than that, yet a lot less too... My biggest problem with this movie is that it's trying to be so many things at the same time, and I don't see it working out. In some scenes it's this really beautiful, well acted, highly emotional type of movie where I can really connect to the characters and understand their struggles. But then in the next scene it's trying to be some sort of stupid comedy with shallow 'jokes' about penises. I'm not saying that all movies based on this kind of comedy are dumb or bad, I'm just saying that in this particular movie, it's most certainly not working out. The acting is good, the scenery looks good, it's just confused. If they could have just tried to straight up the style of the movie, either way really, it could've been so much more than what it turned out to be.",Love & Other Drugs
154,brian_dines,Risky love ... and thoughts on Hathaway,7,17 February 2011,"This is a decent movie, to start with. Let's call it a rom-com, but this isn't some thoughtless schlock like ""Must love Dogs"" or ""Valentine's Day"". It starts out in the usual fashion with Jake Gyllenhaal playing ""Jamie"", a charming schmoozer who's irresistible to women. After losing his job, the former med school student signs on as a drug rep for Pfizer and struggles to get his career going. We don't see Anne Hathaway as ""Maggie"" until Jamie accidentally intrudes on her doctor's visit 20 minutes into the movie. Jamie and Maggie, after a few compromises, end up in bed ... again and again and again. Maggie has Parkinson's Disease (incurable) and the crux of the movie is whether these two characters, well acted by Hathaway and Gyllenhaal, can over come their fears and forge a real relationship from an extended fling.The fears both characters have are very real, not some little plot prop. Maggie knows she'll never improve and only get worse as time goes on, and she's not interested in inflicting that pain on, or becomin dependent on, anyone. And Jamie is unsure if he's really up to the task, after a very frank conversation with the spouse of another Parkinson's patient.Hathaway has been doing comedy for some time, and she is somewhat funny in this role, but the performance she gives as a woman wanting to live out her remaining time on the planet to the best of her ability, unhindered by legal or romantic attachments, is quite good. Her portrayal is layered and believable. You can see her struggling against her attraction and love for Gyllenhaal's character, breaking through the fear in little fits and starts. And when Gyllenhaal expresses the slightest doubt that he's man enough to see her through this disease, she bolts. It's a thoughtful, real and metered performance by her. Gyllenhaal is also good.",Love & Other Drugs

Not a typical fluffy Hollywood romantic film (it's actually more drama with many light elements). Quite adult in it's subject matter and execution, though not to the degree of ""serious"" European and Asian films - still a Hollywood movie after all.There's some unnecessary nudity (for anyone concerned, and not for young kids), well acted all round (especially the leads and Josh Gad), with believable chemistry between the leads.So, a good date movie: Not for an early/burgeoning relationship, but for those who've been going for a while.",Love & Other Drugs

Anne Hathaway is Wonderful",8,8 December 2010,"The movie starts out as a generic and even pedestrian romantic comedy and appears to be headed in the typical cliché driven direction but, fortunately, evolves in to something more. Jake Gyllenhaal's character and his alleged ""funny"" fat side kick are established almost purposefully as illustrations of what's wrong with most romantic comedies. It's Anne Hathaway's character that is the catalyst for the transformation from two dimensional rom-com to something deeper and more enjoyable. As she is fleshed out (pun intended because the more Anne Hathaway nudity the better) her character forces both Gyllenhaal's character and the film itself to grow (almost Viagra like). What follows is a deep, sometimes moving and genuinely interesting film. Commentary about battling illness, life and enjoying the moment are all relevant and poignant. Even supporting characters are given moments to shine. Oliver Pratt's drug rep has a wonderful scene delivered over dinner and there's even a smart drunken ramble explaining what is wrong with being a doctor and a commentary on the state of the Hippocratic Oath. From an emotionless and even tedious start, this film surprised me and is worth the price of a ticket.",Love & Other Drugs

What could have been a decent romantic comedy with a little drama turned out to be a complete and utter disappointment in the all the aforesaid genres. Not romantic but desperate, not a comedy but without any comic relief whatsoever and not some drama but a whole lot of nonsense that, in no way could have touched the hearts of viewers.There was a whole lot of distasteful sexual scenes where, without a second to be wasted, we'd see Anne and Jake both get naked on top of each other, with a lot of breasts and ass on the screen, in your face. And this happened quite a few times after which I (don't know about others) felt disgusted. If this was porn, why the hell not but this was not porn. It was just so unnecessary up a point where it makes you uncomfortable, seeing lead actors like Anne and Jake, doing what they were doing.",Love & Other Drugs

But, my wife and daughter wouldn't let me. It calms down after maybe ten minutes -- perhaps the director took a Xanax -- but it gets stupidly frenetic at other times throughout. The biggest issue is that it drags; this movie could have been done easily in 85 minutes. Perhaps the director got paid by the frame.The characters are just OK, though the storyline was at least a bit unusual (dealing with the illness of one of the leads). Jake G played a wise guy and BS artist -- never really likable -- and Anne Hathaway's character alternated between lovely/sympathetic and mousy/neurotic (though she does have a good reason for her neuroses).In sum, a decent diversion that doesn't need to be paused if you have to go to the bathroom.",Love & Other Drugs

This movie is very realistic, because it's not the typical romantic comedy where the guy gets the girl and they live happily ever after. It's about the struggle of being able to fall for someone completely without being broken after wards. It's realistic because they start off hating each other, and then they are friends with benefits, and then they happen to fall in love unexpectedly. But they don't just say ""I love you"" and kiss and all those clichés. When he realizes he's in love with her, he has a panic attack, and I believe that that is a more realistic way of realizing you're in love with someone. Sure, there might be a lot of sex, but the message of the movie is being able to love someone for everything they are and seeing past all their flaws, ad that's a beautiful thing. I respect Jake Gyllenhaal and Anne Hathaway so much for being apart of this film, and they played their roles so well.

The pose struck by the leads Jake Gylenhall & Anne Hathaway on that poster just screamed ""knock about rom-com,just like hundreds of others"" It isn't though and that was a pleasant and engaging surprise.Jake Gylenhall pulls off the role of super bright but super slacker son Jamie in a high achieving family well and is convincing as a magnetising presence that women find irresistible.The absence of Anne Hathaway's character Maggie in the first segment of the film is the first suggestion that this will not be a routine paint by numbers romance and Maggie's introduction sets the scene for the complex character she successfully portrays.This film covers a lot of ground and both of the leads are engaging and believable.Issues such as serious illness, the workings of the big pharmaceutical companies and their attempts to influence the decision making of medical professionals, the struggle people have to pay for treatment and a believably complex love story are woven in without significant signposting or obvious plot twists.Once again, the two lead actors were excellent and overall this made for an enjoyable and engaging film",Love & Other Drugs

Slosh them all together into the same bucket, and it doesn't make sense. After watching the movie, you ask yourself lots of questions.""Why did they even mention the brother's millions at the beginning? It never comes up again."" ""Why is the millionaire brother living on his couch while he's struggling to pay his credit card bills?"" ""Why does Maggie know the drug reps and their game?"" ""Why does the office seem to know Maggie so well, if that's her first visit there?"" The list could go on and on. Maggie having Parkinson's does nothing for the movie, and honestly doesn't even tie into the pharma rep scenario. (Ironically, early in the movie Randall says to Maggie that he reps a Parkinson's drug... but they never go back to that either).All in all, a serious miss of a movie. It made no sense.

165,mikefox-04778,Carried by the cast and the music,6,23 May 2017,"Starting with the bad, this movie has no originality in its story, in no way can it lay claim to digressing from the overused Hollywood romantic movie plots. Boy finds sick girl who sets him straight, boy and girl separate for stupid reasons, boy finds out how much he loves girl, boy wins girl back with grandiose romantic speech. I also find the psychology and philosophy of the movie flawed. It treats the fear of being hurt or the fear of needing someone as inevitable ingredients or even likable qualities, where they are normally expressions of low self esteem and lacking courage. Realizing you do *need* each other is what brings you back together? Need is not love, need is selfish, where love is giving.I did not buy: the homeless guy's Prozac transformation, the drug agents and doctors milieu constantly partying like wall-street wolves, the convenient parkinson-conference across the street with all its positivity, the panic attack originating from telling someone you love him, the closing scene.Apart from that, I largely enjoyed the movie. Jake Gyllenhaal has found its most natural role as a slight nimrod with emotional deficiencies (adding depression in his 2015 movie Demolition), Anne Hathaway is breathtaking in her sensuality and sensibility, and also the supporting cast is wonderful. Combined with a resourceful soundtrack (The Specials, The Kinks, Fleetwood Mac, Regina Spektor, ...), it's hard to watch the movie without finding something to like.",Love & Other Drugs
166,reelcouples,We give this couple a 50/50 shot,5,12 December 2010,"Is this couple The Reel Thing? So – Maggie and Jamie. Jamie is a handsome hound dog from a wealthy family that actually expects something more from him than living off his trust fund. So far that dream hasn't been realized, so after yet another failed career (because he was sleeping with the boss's wife) he decides to give pharmaceutical sales a try. During his early hungry days he badgers his way into a consultation with a doctor and meets the lovely Maggie, 26 years old and suffering from early stage Parkinson's. Posing as an intern he gets an added bonus when Maggie shows her breast to the doctor to ask his opinion on what turns out to be a spider bite. He is later rewarded for his daring when she clocks him in the parking lot with her bag after realizing who he really is.He still manages to hit on her despite the fact that she is beating on him. Impressed by his audacity she agrees to meet him for coffee, and an hour later the two of them are writhing around on the floor of her apartment. From there they embark on what they both agree will be a strictly physical affair but which of course begins to turn into something more.While we won't say this couple has no chance of making it, we don't know if we see them as a 5-reeler either. It is inevitable and understandable that they would fall for each other – both have beauty, brains, and biting wit. And as Jamie's brother Josh knows there is no more sure-fire way for a woman to get a man than to reject him, so the more Maggie pushes Jamie away the more he wants her.But for an operator like Jamie this still usually results in a short term relationship at best; it's just a matter of time before he'll be out chasing tail again. He's spent a lot of time perfecting his craft and we don't know if we see him abandoning it that quickly. It's not that he's a total cad. Boyfriend Jamie is actually a great guy – caring, generous and concerned. But Salesman Jamie is so slimy that it would be hard for us not to have some misgivings about him. Maggie certainly has her weaknesses as well but they are primarily fear of intimacy and the future. We don't see her cheating on him the minute he leaves for the office each day.But mostly we just can't see how Maggie's illness is not going to get in the way. The two have not been together long enough for him to be fully committed to what may become a lifetime of caring for her. Jamie is not yet 30; still young enough to want to be out partying. We're not sure if he's as ready to settle down as he's convinced himself he is. He has already had his doubts and the two part for a short time. When he meets the husband of another Parkinson's sufferer at a holistic health convention he starts to envision what his life with Maggie could possibly become and not unsurprisingly it freaks him out.He does come back in the end but we still see trials ahead. Maggie has many ups and downs with her condition, and we are hopeful that she will find a remedy that will allow her to live a healthy life. But if she does worsen we just don't know if Jamie has the wherewithal to stick it out for the long term. What happens in 10 years when he is a sexy, sculpted 40 with a past history of philandering and an ailing wife? There's a good chance his love may turn to a mix of guilt and resentment. He has decided to give up sales for medicine; a decision clearly and admirably spurred on by his desire to make Maggie well. But if his plan doesn't work, how is that going to affect his feelings – both towards himself and her? We think they have a 50/50 shot. We think Maggie's wellness will be the barometer for their relationship.www.reel-couples.com",Love & Other Drugs

You can basically guess most of the movie (& certainly the end) down to the details within 20 minutes of the movie starting. Even the so called comic relief parts were standard fare. The only two reasons I gave it 4 (& I think 4 stars is kinda stretching it) stars was that: 1) The movie made no real pretense to be anything other than it was & 2) Some men may find Ann Hathaway's bare body enough reason to watch. But I'm not sure either of those reasons would be enough to motivate most people to sit through the 100+ minutes of tripe that makes up the meat of the movie though. **BUT I have to admit, I did like Jill Clayburgh in the bit roll, or was it a cameo?, as the mother and Kimberly Scott as Gail.

I'm no prude, either. However, the volume of boobage on display during the first half of the film is just plain distracting. Where it does its damage is the last half, where both characters finally take a stab at the plot that's been building (if you can call it that) throughout the first half. While there is a tender moment here and there, they pale in comparison to the emotionless dribble that is the first half. Was this on purpose? Was I supposed to loath both the characters by the second half of the film? Are Anne Hathaway's boobs a metaphor for her... No I'm not even gonna bother finishing that joke. In the words of Aldous Snow, they're ""a metaphor for a crap movie,"" one which had some promise given it's nostalgic setting. A setting which is completely wasted on the plot of the movie except for a few shots of pagers being used and a rather weak bit at the end which I won't reveal because of spoilers and whatnot.

Thus, Jake must meet Anne, learn about her disease, face her doubt about him, deal with her leaving him, go to rescue her – all this because that's what the story should do. But the scenes between the two of them are just like a well-acted acting class-type escapades, with Jake very good and Anne always a little over the top. They, the scenes, don't add up to anything satisfying.Zwick can't quite get the feature thing down. All his movies lack a real resonance; they don't hold together as a whole. You don't feel you've seen a real story because he understands writing and directing scenes but he does not understand that plotting is an emotional thread that builds into something more than just the addition of one beat on another.

It was much much better than I expected going it. I was expecting something good from Ed Zwick and Anne Hathaway but Jake Gyllenhal really tore it up. This movie is very, very good and will be a huge hit commercially and critically when it comes out. I will say it is long. It has the perfect mix of gross out comedy, serious dramatics, and emotionally connecting love story. The film is really stuck in my head since i saw it. I go and see as many films as I can, and have seen many but this was a fantastic DRom Com. It was parts of Knocked Up, Funny People, and 500 Days of Summer, but with some Up in the Air and Thank You for Smoking and genuine Julia Roberts love story territory. But I must say, as a 20 year old guy, it was very goddamn good.Anne Hathaway was very convincing with her Parkinson's. The film does a great job with teaching the audience both about Parkinson's and (legitimate) Pharmaceuticals sales. She is stage 1 and acts the part. She is a rebel girl and does a great job. She is EXTREMELY sexy in this movie and this will probably get her voted #1 Sexiest woman in every magazine on earth next year. Brave girl and completely sexy and tasteful...most of the time.This is absolutely, hands down the best role Jake Gyllenhal has ever played. He might have been dramatic and gay in Brokeback but he is so comfortable as the smooth talking, answer for everything, sex seeking Jamie it really shocked me. I actually have faith he will be good in Prince of Persia after seeing his range in this. He is the cocky part of Thank You For Smoking, with better and more prolific dialogue, but the heartwarming lead of 500 Days of Summer, but with even more redeeming qualities.The movie was laugh out loud funny the entire film. It never let the film get too serious without a few laughs or the characters making a few jokes about the drama. Supporting characters were great. Oliver Platt played a great typical Oliver Platt role but with great writing and no restraint. Judy Greer was cute and bitchy Judy Greer. Hank Azaria was also quite memorable and hilarious as a womanizing doctor. Jamie's brother is definitely a Jonah Hill type/looking guy but as the movie goes on you can't help but like him. He is in some of the best scenes in the film.The chemistry is off the charts between Jake and Anne which is obvious but the other characters do a fantastic job standing out as well.

(She is a phenomenal actress, and will someday soon, have that little statue we all associate with greatness.) For the most part, 'Love and Other Drugs' wasn't much different from 'Morning Glory', in that we've all seen this before. The top of the world, protagonist, who doesn't know it yet, but his life is missing something. The guy who can't please his parents, but spends most of his life pleasing women(if you know what I mean). So he (Jake Gyllenhaal by the way) takes to selling drugs (legally), which, like any other salesmen position, is really mostly about charisma. His character, meets Hathaway's character, and at fist all is well (it's just about sex), blah, blah, blah, they kiss and make up, the end. I honestly have no idea what my problem with this movie is, it just rubbed me the wrong way. Maybe it was the fact that it was set in the 90's which was actually pointless(and unnoticeable), except to give Jake Viagra, and big cameras and cassette players to sell. At the end of the day, although the performances were good, and the difficulties they overcame were actually difficult, I just didn't care enough about any of it to actually consider this movie noteworthy. The movie didn't stick with me, or give me any hope, which is what a good movie should do.

178,theslayer2112,"Love : Yes, Other drugs : Yes, Worth watching : hell yeah",7,29 July 2012,"Love and other drugs is yet another attempt at soft romance aka chick flick (don't we have a lot of them already?). However, with near stellar performance from the lead actors and a good, tight and sensitive story, this makes for a good entertaining Sunday night flick (well, I watched it on a Sunday night anyway). It has its fun moments, the ambitious young salesman (Jake) who moonlights as a womanizer to meet his sales target, the (not so usually and at times super) sensitive girl and a sensitive subject. All ingredients for a classic boy-meet-girl-fall-in-love-with-a-twist tale, a classic chick flick, I know. But the film delivers. The male protagonist's transformation from a womanizer to a true-to-one lover to a Parkinsons patient, brings about the sensitivity this movie required, to make it different from the hundreds of other romantic flicks. The sensitive nature of dealing with a partner who has a life- long affliction, staying committed to that one person despite their constant pushing you away in denial & realizing that they need you more than you need them and therefore you stick with them no matter what, really sets this story apart.I am happy with the main characters' performances in the movie, yet I feel Gyllenhall could have put in some more emotion when convincing Hathaway that they need to be together come what may. Apart from this one small thing, the overall feel of this movie is good. A one-time watch for romantics, I know my fiancée will. :)This rates high on my romantic movie list (not that difficult seeing it is not that long a list though :D).",Love & Other Drugs

They have absolutely no chemistry on screen. If you just want to see Jake naked then it's the movie for you. Otherwise it's a waste of time and money. The plot line is weak, mostly just lots of screwing. The movie really promotes Pfizer and maybe they approved of the publicity, but it does not paint Pfizer in a good light. Although from first had knowledge, this is how drug reps act. They are hired mostly for their good looks and charm. The doctor in this movie is nothing but a sleaze ball and is very unprofessional. One of the stupidest scenes is Jake, naked, but covering his privates in front of his brother (who is a major dumb ass). The best parts of this movie was shown in the trailer.",Love & Other Drugs

But it shows how so many people see only one thing, and can't wrap their mind around anything else. No, this is not an ad for Pfizer, nor are the people who are making jokes about their own disease disgusting. This is real life, happy, sad, sexy, vulnerable, competitive. lonely and ultimately human.Both stars are excellent and the dichotomy of emotions works very well. They are both scared. and unable to commit for different reasons. A couple of unnecessary scenes not withstanding, the film works at so many levels - they change each other for the better. No, it's not your typical rom-com. There's more at stake, and the humor is a welcome distraction. There is a lot going on here, even a few shots at the pharmaceutical industry, but if you freak out over nudity or expect a one-note movie so you can absorb it, this isn't a movie for you.

The guy didn't do anything for the girl except at the last minute decide (unconvincingly) to go after the bus she was in. All he did was screw her around, allow fate to make things right and allow her at every occasion to go downtown when really she was supposed to be the fragile one and she is supposed to feel accepted and desired because of her disease. So really he should have been the one going downtown. It was all like a cheap pornographic movie with no real tenderness or genuine care in the love scenes. Real romantic movies show you meaningful love scenes with acts that show caring, love and respect. It started out wrong when the guy was infatuated with the girl because she flashed her breasts at him. Until the end, i was not convinced this infatuation was turned to true love but was more of a disguised form of lust and denial. if we had to do a sequel to this stupid unromantic sexist movie it would result in the guy cheating on her at some point because he got someone else using their mouth to be his blue pill! not when the other person kisses him or removes her clothes but only when she goes downtown!

The script was convincing and the acting was great . Even with some necessary nude scenes , the movie takes you in it and when finished you feel happy about just being normal and healthy and asking yourself , did I ever lived a moment with someone and did anybody ever looked into my eyes like Anne did .

The theme is all age-old, tried and tested one - a reckless playboy meets a kind-hearted girl with a non curable disease and then they go away and come back with a happy ending. But, the execution is what this film sets apart and makes it a one time watch on a lazy afternoon. The situational comedy suits well in parts but, the overall tone is more romantic and dramatic.

Most of the movie is Anne Hathaway showing her nice body. Nothing wrong with her body, but it just screams: ""We know the movie is crap, and we're not even trying to do something about it!"" The actors can act, but the writers and the director don't give them anything to work with. The basic plot could have been worked into a decent movie, maybe even Oscar material. Hollywood loves its cripples. Hey, if Forrest Gump can win it, anything can.

The movie starts off with Jamie Randall(Jake Gyllenhaal) being fired from his sales job due to his services for a woman and he ends up as a medical rep.He then meets Maggie Murdock(Anne Hathaway)in Dr. Stan Knight(Hank Azaria)consulting room as she has early symptoms of Parkinsonism which is quite rare for a 26 year old and the movie moves beautifully from thereon.In addition to this you have oliver platt and josh gad playing as a partner and brother to jamie's character. The screenplay is really good as it is very uninhibited in its portrayal of maggie's character of being free spirited and jamie a habitual playboy which usually doesn't fit to a normal Hollywood film which we have all watched till now.With previous movies like glory,last samurai,blood diamond and my personal favorite being about last night,the director edward zwick has handled the movie so skillfully.Every scene is so beautiful to watch.At the same time the performances of the two leads and the chemistry between them them is electric.Anne Hathaway is brilliant and extremely beautiful and the nudity gels in with the movie,definitely one of the best actresses of our times.Jake Gyllenhaal is spot on in his portrayal of a character who is so unsure about himself at a personal level and at same time being so confident with the women,he carries out the character with ease.Taking the movie to another level is its catchy soundtrack.

And the funny thing is, it's not even the parts where the film obviously tries to be funny when I laughed most.The performances were great, the story was interesting (excepting maybe the a bit too slow build-up) and really made you care. The film was at times philosophical and very critical of today's pharma industry and medical care without being dry or boring about it.

Her part, played so frighteningly convincingly, was in itself a masterpiece, every slight tremor in her voice demanding to be heard. The plot follows a classic romance storyline.

202,StephenEWonder,Great Love Story,10,16 March 2012,"I loved this movie even though I did not like a good third of it (the juvenile humor scenes with the brother.) Watching Jamie and Maggie falling in love, culminating in a very emotional crescendo when they reunite after Jamie's plea to get her back near the end of the movie, simply blew me away. Tracy and Hepburn. I was especially impressed with Anne Hathaway's entrancing and endearing portrayal of a delightfully witty Maggie, her dead on acting performance as an independent woman who doesn't trust love relationships, but nonetheless falls hopelessly in love, as well as her exceptional portrayal of a woman besieged by Parkinson's disease. Her gestures, facial expressions and manner of dialog delivery were perfect, even though I could not quite catch some of her words several times. Actually, the fact that she did not sound like a Shakespearian actress made her all the more believable. Jake Gillenhaal was extremely convincing also, although I did not like much of the movie that featured him but did not include Hathaway. I haven't seen this in many reviews but he played someone with attention deficit disorder perfectly (ritalin at age 8. Jake Gillenhaal's key scene eloquently trying to persuade Maggie to take him back in the highly emotional segment mentioned above was perfect, totally convincing and, again, very moving. The emotions shown in his expressions were so well done. Anne's part in this scene, without as much dialog, but with heart wrenching non verbal communication was riveting also. Many have criticized the ""gratuitous"" sex scenes, but I found them to be realistic and important to support the basic love story. Edward Zwick deserves high credit for writing and directing the love story part of the movie, but thumbs down for the juvenile male humor scenes (like the mistaken gear shift) that hurt this otherwise ""Best Picture"" level movie. I also really enjoyed the performances of Hank Azaria and Oliver Platt, who nailed their roles to the maximum possible. Ditto for Gabriel Macht in his small role.",Love & Other Drugs

I think I made a mistake giving it 10 stars and now I made it only 6 (and I'm still doubting if it's not too much). The plot is kind of exceeded. Jackass that falls in love for the first time for a girl who has large walls built around her, but who at the same time apparently owns a huge self security (and has Parkinson). I don't think this is much of a spoiler, but, they fall in love with each other and in a relationship which, started by only casual sex, is surrounded by insecurities from both sides, they broke up, and then they come back again. I probably thought it was a great story and some kind of ""masterpiece"" of the current cinema (which is not THAT current though) because I was passing through some stuff in my life and I just got emotional watching it. But it is not like that. I just couldn't watch it for more than one hour the last time: somehow the story is weak and not even the talent of the main characters could save this movie from boredom.

I do agree with the first ""real"" reviewer that I read, this story is not built scene by scene into a one cinematic story--driven by a tight cinematic PLOT. As a matter of fact, that's what I said, before I left the theater, this movie -- not film -- is not cinematic. Yes, it certainly is comprised of a series of disjointed scenes which some are quite entertaining but after an hour of sitting in a dark room looking up at the screen, you certainly do question whether or not this is the perfect use of your time at the moment...And once again, this film proves that in Hollywood it really is all about who you know (this script should have never made it out of development like that) ...but Jake G is cute, so for that I give it 1 star (I know, how shallow of me)--but even after an hour, his appeal wore off.

212,TheBobbyjames,'Love and Other Drugs' are enticing,10,30 November 2010,"Jake Gyllenhaal and Anne Hathaway deliver inspiring, charismatic and dimensional performances in Edward Zwick's latest directorial venture. The film, like the performances, arcs from shallow objectives and arguably questionable behaviors to capturing the essence of love. It's the classic tale of boy meets girl except as Maggie (Hathaway) puts it, ""...this isn't about connection for you, this isn't even about sex for you. This is about finding and hour or two of relief from the pain of being you, and that's fine with me because all I want's the exact same thing."" Maggie's quote is perhaps the single most foreshadowing moment that will cause their parallel paths to intersect, putting forth a moving story of human compassion and love. Jamie (Gyllenhaal) is intent on becoming the most successful sales rep for the pharmaceutical giant, Pfizer. His aspirations are simple; sex, the Viagra account, and getting to Chicago. Maggie's objectives are a bit different. While she too is intent on the escapism she finds in sex, it's subtly presented that her goal is to be an artist - a goal that may be no longer achievable. What transpires is a character arc for each person and the realization that meaningless sex may have led to the ultimate human goals of companionship and love.'Love and Other Drugs' is a nicely told story that keeps you laughing and hoping but will ultimately leave a tear in your eye. It exudes, to perfection, human emotion and leaves you feeling the reality of the situation and of each character, while doing its best to present a diagnosis with antidepressants and Viagra. It's cinematically beautiful and nicely paced to deliver a stand-out film containing all the chemistry Gyllenhaal and Hathaway had in years prior while filming 'Brokeback Mountain'. Acting is where the film garners much of its success through beautiful nuances, flawless delivery and strong eye contact. It leaves you hoping for the future, of both Maggie and Jamie and of a reuniting of Gyllenhaal and Hathaway.Grade: A+",Love & Other Drugs

I have got to say ,I am not very agree "" Roger Ebert"" comments ! says that ""Jamie Randal is pharmaceutical salesman"" . this is just a cliché which indicates the standard words for any movie for who wants to comment in quicker way .that guy Jamie Randal is not a just salesman as that Mr Ebert wants to describe .there is definitely more about that simple sexy idol guy !he has history ,past,life, even he has feelings we gotta not miss that one especially.i guess director hidden that small details in a secret wall . many of people may wants to see that guy in charm ,capable for sales who has the body or beauty. but simply there are more to see;which is his humanity and his sense.director has inspired me to see the picture from another angle which reflect the details from the real life , we need to face with the truth . oh no! not only Parkinson's's ! many more like this !well another thing is that, in this movie there is certain things , which is with commercial and shows us; how Pfizer defeats Prozac ! despite i don't like that that was effect with an additional color to strength the movie ,anyway for the patients Alzheimer,Parkinson's's or whichever disease effects the body for lifetime , i am happy at the end this movie remind us that we should see closer where we are who we are . I am saying gladly that i enjoyed watching this movie in romantic ,comedy ,drama acting Maggie Murdock role played lady Anne Hathaway performed great ( i really wasn't like to see her an actress till now,or maybe it wasbad luck to see her as first in the princess diary) anyway she done well !congrats to director Mr Zwick , i just couldn't watch his 1st one ""about last night"" which is not able to be obtain around here :)",Love & Other Drugs

We ignored the reviews and saw Prince of Persia and while it wasn't terrible it was a long way from Donnie Darko.We got to see Love and Other Drugs early after we were turned away from another movie screening the week before and we could not have been more excited. The previews are great, the commercials are funny and it seemed to have plenty for both of us.The first third is actually the movie the in the commercials. Jake and Anne meet, fall in love and start to hilariously change each other for the better. Then it hits, she's dying and the movie does a 180 and the next 90 minutes are a mixture of them naked and her getting worse.If we had paid to see this movie we would have demanded our money back.

Some people actually get influenced by this kind of things, its all i m saying. Also, another not very clear to me thing about this movie was why there was so much of hathaway's body and not so much of gyllenhaal..! Movie was good. For a movie, not the kind of thing you d expect to get in real life though..least not to my experience..! You get to see some of the fear for commitment, some more of the passion that can be between two people, and maybe reminisce, the freedom you can feel with someone and the sense responsibility that willingly grows within you as love becomes the binding force.

With several sex scenes and a great deal of nudity the film played the sex card well if not excessive.It was spattered with company logos and main characters repeating the names of these companies many times in several scenes. I have to give some credit to the quality of the film but its not hard to guess how it was so well funded.Overall the movie would have been decent to me, if I had not been so frustrated with one too many elements.Maybe worth a watch, but I wouldn't buy it!",Love & Other Drugs
218,smart_chap08,Interesting emotional romantic with life lessons,8,31 January 2021,"I specifically liked the movie for the way it drove the point about relationships and what do humans need. It was slightly haphazard sometimes but that's okay for me. For a long time, I thought that it would be just about sex and drugs, and judged the movie.But, just because it popped up on my Amazon screen I went ahead. It did surprise me! It made me smile and towards the end feel glad that they got together (in an somewhat expected way).Liked Anne's acting with through frustration when she was unable to do daily tasks. Also, how she showed her joys in little things of life, her expression listening to the stories at the conference. Jamie too was good with the moments when he would get emotional at times.There were a few hilarious moments when Jamie's brother was watching the scene of Jamie in bed and he enters or the doctor requesting for the drug suddenly the moment it is launched.My eyes were wet towards the end, and I also had some smiling moments but I would not put it under the Comedy category.

219,marcelb3,Horrendous,1,7 September 2013,Absolutely horrendous film. One of the worst I've ever seen. I usually enjoy romcoms but this was terrible. The characters weren't very likable. The story was weak and it just dragged. I watched it to the end and it made me feel angry that I wasted more than 2hours on this crappy film. Don't bother watching it. I'm looking at this from a mans point of view. Maybe if you're a girl it might be great. I'm not sure. But what a nob the male lead is. He comes across as an arrogant a-hole and the female lead comes across as a neurotic nympho. The acting was rubbish by the way. The best character was the lead's brother who was mildly entertaining.,Love & Other Drugs
220,samcorderoo,Just like any other comedy-romantic chick flick film but touches deeply into relationships and self confidence,8,26 April 2017,"The story conveys the reality of self confidence and relationship hardships for those who may have a disability. One with a disability might need to do things differently than one who is able-bodied. I believe the film appropriately expressed the message of how one may lack self confidence and maintaining relationships even though they might express differently to others. One never knows what goes on in one's life until one truly gets to know them. The negative that shown in the film was when Jamie and Maggie attend the convention in Chicago, an older man advises Jamie to find and marry a ""healthy woman."" The older man expresses how unhappy he is caring for his wife, who is a stage- four Parkinson's disease patient. This is what pushes the character Jamie selfishly to find a cure and have Maggie get better so he doesn't have to be like the older man. Also another negative was how the doctors and other salespeople characterized Maggie as ""a sick girl"" as if she was incapable. There was also a positive in film when Maggie attends the UNC Convention and she listens to other Parkinson's disease patients talking their own lives but they were also humorous towards it. Overall, I recommend watching this film, you'll definitely have a few laughs throughout the film.",Love & Other Drugs

The plot lines are totally stupid and predictable and some of them are not even finished. There are characters and events which are totally unnecessary for the plot. The dialogues are an endless repetition of the same ideas and the acting is mediocre. You know what the ending is going to be right from the start. The movie looks like a giant advertisement of Pfizer. And I don't understand why the characters go around naked - this has nothing to do with anything. Not that I am opposed to nudity in film, but it has to have some meaning at least(if it is not a pornography film).I hate the time that I lost watching it.

Anne Hathaway's character is incredibly rude and annoying the entire time, yet Jake Gyllenhaal is striken with her because he liked her breasts, and perhaps he likes being mistreated by women. There's nothing likeable about the character except that she's attractive. So the whole story falls flat, because there's no reason for Jake's character to fall in love, even more so to the point of sacrificing so much for her. Hardly believable, but Jake and everyone else did a good job nonetheless. It is possible that Anne has simply made the character so unlikeable and rude, but we'll never know.",Love & Other Drugs

225,BrowncoatByNight,"An enjoyable, interesting and refreshing romantic comedy",6,30 May 2011,"I found myself really enjoying this movie. I rarely like romantic movies because, like horror movies, they're seldom done well, in my opinion. Movies like (500) Days of Summer, Garden State, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, these are the ones that grab my attention. And it's because they tell the story of dysfunctional relationships, as is the case in Love and Other Drugs. I appreciate movies like this because love in itself is dysfunctional. Real relationships are hard and take work and are basically about two people wading through the crap but learning to enjoy and appreciate the good times along the way. It's not all sunshine and rainbows. But it's not all Ike and Tina, either.Back on topic, Love and Other Drugs is about cocky, ladies man Jamie Randall who, during his career as a pharmaceutical rep, meets the free-spirited, Parkinson's-suffering Maggie Murdock. And so begins a sex-fueled, leave-your-emotions-at-the-door relationship that slowly starts to turn into something more.When hearing about this film, I really, REALLY wanted to see it promoted with the sentence: 'From the director of The Last Samurai, Blood Diamond and Defiance..."" but alas, no. Nevertheless, Edward Zwick does well in this refreshing change of pace, energetically transferring this true story (based on the non-fiction book Hard Sell: The Evolution of a Viagra Salesman) to the big screen. Jake Gyllenhaal, as charismatic as usual, immediately gains likability as the piece of crap with a creamy center of pure gold. Anne Hathaway, showing her development since The Princess Diaries (in not only a physical way) shines, showing the female class of romantic comedies, which includes Jennifer Aniston and Katherine Heigl, just how it's done. The drama is just as important as the funny, girls. Edward Zwick realizes this as well, throwing in an unsettling scene involving the husband of a Parkinson's Stage Four regretting marrying his wife, while dosing out quotable comedic gems, ""What's the quota for masturbation?"".It's tricky business tackling serious illnesses in light-hearted films. Judd Apatow's Funny People tried and failed because Adam Sandler's character was not only an jerk but was rich, too, making it harder for the audience to sympathizes. Hathaway's Maggie is a regular girl trying to put her deteriorating condition out of her mind, but struggling to do so. Zwick delves into the juggling of life and sickness, sending the message that things may get worse, but you've got to enjoy life while you can, which is a message that everyone should be able to take something from.",Love & Other Drugs
226,carlabag,Portrayal of degenerative disease SPOT-ON,8,2 December 2010,"Like Maggie, I was diagnosed with a degenerative, neurological illness (with no cure or treatment) in my early 30s, and also met my husband around that time. Hathaway's acting (and the script) captures with devastating accuracy the emotions one goes through when confronting a degenerative illness at an early age, particularly when falling in love (i.e. trying to push someone away/set them free before you become a burden on them; stubbornly seeking independence/avoiding vulnerability, though in real life, you really do need someone to love and take care of you; wanting to avoid the grief inherent in your diagnosis, and particularly, wanting to avoid pulling someone ELSE into that grief; going out and seeking support groups, and feeling empowered by this; getting angry at your partner's refusal to accept what is; etc. etc.) I agree that portions of this movie were VERY Hollywood and over the top,and also that it was trying to be everything for everyone (love story,guy's flick, corporate commentary, light-hearted comedy, melodrama,etc.) Regardless of any criticisms, though, I was sobbing like a baby during the last third of the movie. It was just too real, too familiar,too spot-on, and I know that unless people have walked in similar shoes, they wouldn't be able to fully grasp the depth and grief of what was unfolding on screen. In a way, I'm grateful for all the fluff and comedy, because I wouldn't have been able to get through the movie otherwise.So I say, overall, this movie was incredible due to its sensitive and accurate portrayal of Maggie's illness, and all of its emotional ramifications. Good job.",Love & Other Drugs

If you are interested in her breasts, watch only the first half of the movie. I can assure you that the movie doesn't become more interesting or less boring. I wanted to stop the film and forget about it, but someone on IMDb said that it ""fortunately, evolves in to something more"". I believed the user and now I'm sorry. I think that the producer thought of the most popular things in a movie and he came up with the perfect recipe: drugs, money, hunger for power, sex, even love, unshared love, a young girl's incurable disease, disgusting brother sleeping on a couch, nice old persons who don't have enough money to buy their essential medication and even the greedy drug industry, etc. Unfortunately, is like mixing main course and desert in the same plate, even if they are great if you eat them one by one, the combination can be disastrous.

228,smith39-908-732946,"thoughts about several of the films themes, sexuality, male roles, health care",7,26 November 2010,"Today I saw a film, Love and Other Drugs, in which Jake Gyllenhaal and Anne Hathaway have several high energy sexual encounters. One particular depiction (?) of a mutual orgasm was so beautiful that many members of the audience may have vividly recollected this state. It was sexual connection based on both characters knowing they loved each other. The film displayed a peak erotic and spiritual connection. For some theater goers it may have seemed too much, but I don't think anyone would have thought a similar personal experience was ""too much"".The film had many cinematic forebearers, stories of lovers whose partners are ill and one or both struggle with leaving or staying. Most of the plot turns at this level of analysis were better than most of the progenitors. A chance encounter with a man who did stay with his partner and had to watch her become immobile and unable to communicate, allows Gyllenhaal's character to see the future. This vision moves him out of the moment in the relationship and results in a separation that he is both regretful of and relieved by. This is one example of how the film makes the couple's dilemma real to the audience. Even someone who is less confused that Gyllenhaal's character about commitment would have great difficulties with this challenge.There is a strong subplot that looks at male sexuality as it is prescribed for men in modern culture. The chance to have unconnected sex with numerous women is presented as the main character's one certain accomplishment and the envy of other men. On one occasion his younger brother actually achieves this status. The younger brother is able to recognize that it isn't what he wants or enjoys. As he shares this insight with Gyllenhaal's character, a piece of a developing understanding occurs within him. His vulnerability is uncovered by his partner, Anne Hathaway's, Maggie, who assists him in recognizing his value as a good man.When he finds his way back to his center, his relationship also rights itself. The film's essential statement is that the immediate moment that lives in all of us is the center from which loving connection is conceived, nurtured and revitalized.The Big Pharma aspect of the plot is humanized by looking at its effect on several levels of medical personnel and patients. A variety of human betrayals are shown as a part of corporate health care. This story line develops the idea that corporate greed can subvert the best parts of our humanity if we do not recognize our most important needs.",Love & Other Drugs
229,bellnatalie,Skip it!,3,27 November 2010,"I have never reviewed a movie before, but I disliked this one enough that I felt the need to express myself. I was really expecting a lot from this one because of my respect for Jake and Anne, but whether it is because they are both so good-looking and successful in real life, or because the production was that bad, I found the whole movie completely unbelievable and I was incredibly disappointed.There was not much in this movie I could relate to. I am in love, but I didn't feel happy for them, especially not when Jake has to go sleep with other women just to know how he feels for Anne, or when Anne keeps taking off her clothes and jumping him and then telling him to leave her alone. Really, the nudity in this movie seemed there just to distract the audience from the fact that the dialogue was actually really unoriginal. In an interview I read with Anne, she says she thinks nudity is important to the movie because both characters express themselves through their bodies while at the same time, shutting off their minds. I get her explanation, but I didn't get this from the movie.The really good parts centered around the discussion of Parkinsons and the world of pharmaceutical drugs. However, I feel that the actors involved wanted to produce a blockbuster with lots of boobs, not a serious movie that centers around these issues. The movie was reaching to get to a point that it could never achieve. I personally came away feeling that I wasted my time.",Love & Other Drugs

Boy, was I disappointed! I admire both leads. Jake was magnificent in Brokeback Mountain and Anne Hathaway was wonderful in The Devil Wears Prada. Unfortunately, there was no chemistry, whatsoever, between these two people in this movie. I wanted to feel something as their relationship progressed, but it never happened.

231,kate-910-439421,It is what it is - Good Date Night Movie,8,29 November 2010,"While at first I awkwardly could not get Princess Diaries and Ella Enchanted out of my head (maybe it was Ann Hathaway's super-long princess hair? maybe it was her naked body coupled with the super-long princess hair?) Also, there was little background or other explanations for why Ann's character was the way she was so I struggled to find out who she really was. But I eventually overcame my actor verses character struggle and came to believe in Ann's character and became invested in the story along the way.Most importantly Love and Other Drugs had enough to keep both me (story, attractive characters both inside and out) and my husband interested (sex, sex and more sex). And it did capture that ""new found love lust never leave your room and who has time to eat or go on any real dates"" feeling which I personally wish existed once you were married. It also was serious and amusing at the same time without having the typical Rom-com staleness that I prefer to watch in the comfort of my own home.Although there is a lot going on in this movie and too many story lines being explored all at once (e.g. I would have gotten rid of the ""brother"" character), it is what it is: A good date night movie made for a broad audience.

I went to see it without taking the time to read reviews because of the past performances of the leading cast. While I was intrigued enough by the storyline to watch the first part of the movie covering my eyes and trying to ignore the constant use of the ""f"" word, when the ""threesome"" scene was introduced enough was enough. I wanted to stay and see how the character's handling of the Parkinson's played out and I wanted to find out how the medical community responded to the pressure of the drug reps.

233,vday_now,Excellent story of redemption of the heart,10,5 December 2010,"The acting of Jake and Anne are excellent portrayals of two characters who each have significant personal issues that prevent them from finding fulfillment in love; that is until they meet each other. The story centers around Jamie's overwhelming desire to hide his insecurity of self worth by being an overachiever in his work and social skills. Whereas Maggie's incurable Parkinson's disease, with it's progressive lifestyle deterioration, causes her to protect herself from those who would pity her or not be able to carry the burden of the support she will ultimately need.The story presents these two characters with extreme passion for life and sexual prowess, that at first hides their personal issues from each other, but which also increases the desires of both to connect more fully with the other. The juxtaposition of these two very intelligent and talented characters makes for an intriguing portrayal for their discovery of love for each other.That desire is largely manifest by Jake's character (Jamie Randall) in that Maggie makes him desire to be a better person thru her insightful understanding of his weaknesses, yet her total acceptance of him. Ironically this insight makes her feel less threatened by Jamie, yet very concerned about letting Jamie see her trials with Parkinson's disease.I found this story to be completely engaging and well performed by all the actors and the director.

236,stillnessinthemove,A good movie hidden amongst two or three bad ones,4,5 January 2011,"Jamie Randall (Jake Gyllenhaal) is the ultimate ladies' man. With good looks, charm and confidence he can, and does, bed any woman he wants. Like your typical Hollywood womaniser, he moves on pretty quick, and when the girls fall for him he'll just brush them aside.His charisma also proves to be useful in his new job as a pharmaceutical sales representative. Sweet talking the receptionists, and fraternizing with doctors, he work his way to the top. Whilst visiting a clinic he meets a patient, Maggie Murdock (Anne Hathaway). Maggie ends up being the first woman Jamie sees as being more than just a one time thing. Alas, Maggie just happens to be the girl immune to Jamie's charm. Like Jamie before, all Maggie is interested in is casual fun. Of course Jamie won't give up without a fight, working the charm twice as hard. Though it appears at first that Maggie doesn't want to develop any relationship, in reality it's all a cover. She may want more but shes just scared of anyone getting too close because of her deteriorating health (would any girl in a romantic comedy ever truly just be interested in a casual relationship rather than a full blown romantic one?).The film tries to be both a 'bro movie' and a sappy romantic 'chick-flick'. It manges to fit in to the clichés of both. The guys make crude jokes, helping each other to get ""pussy"". Jamie's brother (Josh Gad) would fit well into a Apatow comedy. Meant to provide some lighthearted, frat comedy, he just comes off as incredibly annoying. The 'chick-flick' side of the movie is filled with cheesy romantic dialogue, and even cheesier music.It's sounding like a pretty awful film. Except it's not completely. This is largely thanks to Gyllenhaal and Hathaway, two very charming and watchable leads. Even in the films worst moments both kept my attention. The real chemistry between the two creates some surprisingly genuine emotional moments in the latter half of the film. Sadly these moments are far too few.There are also hints of the ethical concerns of the role that pharmaceutical corporations and business politics plays in the American health care system. However these moments are not developed enough to be truly interesting. Similarly the film touches on the cultural impact of Viagra, but doesn't develop it much further than the very basic.Fairly enjoyable in parts, Love & Other Drugs could have been undoubtedly better.

241,ukmedic,The epitome of unconditional love,8,13 March 2012,"I suppose this love story is, for the movie makers, the finding of the one true love that we all strive to find. Where this story differs is where in real life you are left with the dilemma of choosing to stay with love (warts and all) or cut and run. All love is flawed as anything worth having is rarely perfect; there are always flaws even if they are not immediately apparent. This movie examines how we might handle these flaws. Usually in modern life if we can't fix our partner's flaws we generally seek the divorce route. It, very briefly, touches on the fact that caring for a loved one who you've watched deteriorate over years, becomes a duty of care for someone who, through ill health, has become a stranger or a burden.I loved this movie because it does tell of the oath ""in sickness and in health"" and our choice to stay or go. It also tells that money cannot buy good health or true love for that matter. I thought this movie comes close to ""Love Story, 1970"". The Ali Mc Graw; Ryan O'Neal movie began the search for the next chick flick rom-com smash hit. For me this is the Love Story of 2010-11. And maybe even 2012.

243,aniskywlker420,"Pharmaceutical rep, don juan, Jamie Randal (Gyllenhaal) meets his match Maggie Merdock (Hathaway) and they connect with an ever growing passionate and emotional relationship.",9,22 April 2011,"Love & Other Drugs was not like most romantic comedies. It has a fantastic storyline set around a med-school drop-out Jamie Randal (Gyllenhaal) and Maggie (Hathaway) a 26 year old with early on-set Parkinson's. Jamie (Gyllenhaal) is introduced as an electronics salesman who is very good at what he does both on the job and in the bedroom or wherever the mood strikes him. He loses his job for seducing his bosses girlfriend in the storage room and his younger brother gets him a job as a pharmaceutical rep at the drug company Pfizer. He has trouble at first getting doctors to prescribe his assigned drug Zoloft. Attempting to do whatever is necessary to make his quota, he shadows a well respected doctor Dr. Stan Knight (Hank Azaria)he meets Maggie (Hathaway). She seems to be just another girl but when she is as eager as he is to put things to bed things start getting emotional. One night she tells him about a new ""sex drug"" that Pfizer has made called Viagra. Having trouble selling Zoloft, he speaks to his boss at Pfizer and requests the opportunity to start representing Viagra. Being the don juan he is, he makes his quota for a year in less than a month. Meanwhile Jaimie and Maggie are tackling their relationship with hidden emotions that become uncovered as they grow closer and more in love. Jaime becomes obsessed with finding a cure for Maggie after he is told by a man with a wife who has stage four. Maggie again sees right through him and finds that he wants her to get better so he doesn't have to spend the rest of his life with someone who is sick. She breaks-up with him and while moving out of his apartment, he watches a video that they made of themselves where she tells him that no matter how many more moments she has like that one nothing will compare. He is then compelled to follow her bus to Canada in an effort to win her back in a very romantic way. He then tells her exactly how he feels. It is a great movie with something to offer anyone being a cynic or a hopeless-romantic. The acting was phenomenal as was the directing and the editing. The continuity, though, had some holes if you look for them. All in all it was a movie that made me laugh, cry, and it touched my heart. 9/10",Love & Other Drugs
244,pfunkera9,Real ... Funny ... Passionate ... Compassionate,9,15 April 2012,"Love & Other Drugs is a fantastic movie. It is funny, romantic, and real. I'm surprised that it didn't rate higher, but I suppose I don't watch romantic comedies very often. In that, I guess I haven't been desensitized to the various elements of such movies. For me, it served as a reminder that some people walk into your life and change you forever. It is those subtle, self reflective reminders that bring out the best aspects of human behavior ... humor and compassion. When a movie can tug deeply at your emotions and perhaps even move you to reflect about your own life, it gets at the true power of film. If you are the type of person that can immerse yourself in a movie and melt away from your surroundings, this is a movie that can take you away. It can lead you into a world where you can feel the difficulties of complicated love and the immense hurdles that life can present. All the while, it breaks up the emotional intensity with precisely timed moments of great laughter.Simply an excellent movie!!!",Love & Other Drugs

246,Amina16,lots of sex which sums up as love and drugs,6,25 July 2013,"I love to predict the story line of every movie when I start watching it and I thought that this movie is about a playboy who makes girls fall for him, has his way with them and disappears when he finds a better one and then one day he meets this so called ""amazing"" girl and they fall in love and suddenly this sick playboy turns into a caring and loving boyfriend. What i predicted was ALMOST right, so yaaay!!The plot is simple but has been portrayed efficiently. This movie was actually good unlike those cheap romantic comedies that Hollywood is offering nowadays. Jake Gyllenhaal's is quite impressive as a pharmaceutical representative and a womanizer. This movie is funny and dramatic. As i said before, story is predictable but its worth watching.",Love & Other Drugs
247,tmafalda-barbosa,Product placement ruined it for me,4,27 September 2021,Product placement is common and many times it can be relevant but in this case I ended the movie wondering perhaps if the whole story wasn't more than a big pharma ad administered as a melodrama romcom pill.,Love & Other Drugs
248,ahmed-hashmi1994,What real romance is,7,22 February 2013,"OK first of all, let me start out by admitting that Anne Hathaway was one of the significant reasons why I enjoyed this movie. Having said that, I would I like to emphasize that she was certainly not the only reason. This movie takes you on a wonderful journey through the lives of two people who meet under somewhat unfavorable circumstances, yet have undeniable chemistry. Their back and forth is hilarious, without being dumb or stupid like most of today's sitcoms. The real world premise of the drugs boom in the 90s, with the lead up to the release of Viagra provides a nice setting. The characters in the movie are satisfyingly diverse as well - you've got Maggie as your complex, hurt woman; Jamie as the suave, yet lazy man, and a host of others who do a wonderful job of promoting these two and helping their relationship remain as the focal point of the movie. Although my review may be serious, don't let that be an indication of what the movie is like. 90% of it was very lighthearted, but that serious 10% tied the movie together to make it one of the ones I most enjoyed. Admittedly, some of the sex was gratuitous, but don't let that turn you away from what otherwise is a very good movie",Love & Other Drugs

251,famdoc-3,"Tired, old manipulative plot",2,19 October 2010,"Hard-partying, emotionally-detached man meets sensitive, artist woman with fatal disease. They fall in love. They fall out of love. Will man come to his senses? Will woman allow herself to feel love despite downhill course of disease? Will the sappy music ever stop? Will we keep watching this dreck? Will attractive people getting undressed and having sex keep our attention? You know all the answers to these questions, as this film is just a rehash of dozens that came before it.The film raises, without subtlety, some questions society needs to confront: the role of the pharmaceutical industry in the medical-industrial complex, how we treat people with incurable diseases, how people with incurable diseases search for cures and what to wear to a pajama party.Perhaps I should give this film more credit for avoiding flatulence, it nevertheless gives us a few laughs on the subject of erectile dysfunction and its cures, masturbation, three-way sex and internet porn. So original.",Love & Other Drugs

254,supastarla,Great Movie All The Way Around,8,28 November 2016,"The film raises many questions society needs to confront: the role of the pharmaceutical industry in the medical-industrial complex, how we treat people with incurable diseases, how people with incurable diseases search for cures for themselves. This movie was a touching story that involves sickness and finding unexpected love. It had a plethora of passion, lust and hot steamy love scenes. besides those reasons this movie can best be summed up as a kind of old fashioned romance falling in love story that touches your emotions as you feel the couples (Jamie and Maggie) growing pains of trust, sickness and feel good pleasure. Jamie (Jake Gyllenhaal) who's a young playboy from a well to do family and his biggest love in life is going to bed with various beautiful young females. Jamie becomes a pharmaceutical sales rep. and he's taken under the arms of an ego driven boss Bruce (Oliver Platt) and the catch and sale of the game is for Jamie to use his charm and good looks to help sell medicine like Zoloft and Viagra. Plus, his connection with a cocky Dr. Knight (Hank Azaria) helps his climb and profile in the drug selling world too! Now that Jamie has become a somewhat successful pharmaceutical rep. he now meets his match in one of Knight's patients, that being the sassy and witty sharp tongued free spirited sexy Maggie Murdock. Maggie has stage one Parkinson's disease. This film thru it all is wonderful as the sex and hot lustful passion make it interesting t to watch and enjoy as the strong chemistry of Jake and Anne is amazing. Those factors alone make it one of the better films I've seen. And adding the sickness theme of Parkinson's makes it depressing to some still it proves that anyone can be loved and that it's unexpected and everyone needs someone. Love & Other Drugs is a feel-good film that I would recommend to anyone of age. This movie is very much enjoyable it touches emotions, can have you laughing one moment then crying the next, it shows that people who have Parkinson's can still live a happy and fulfilling life.",Love & Other Drugs
255,jakeandmatt,Worth a Watch,8,1 November 2021,"Love & Other Drugs (2010) is, as a whole, a good movie and worth the watch. It's not only funny and clever, but emotional and sincere. I've never watched a movie before that had me laughing out loud in the first half and nearly crying in the second half. It's well acted, well cast, and the writing is done in a way that captures the humanity of the situation beautifully.However, the film is not without its downsides. First, there is an obscene amount of nudity in the film. A certain amount was to be expected, but there were points where it just seemed like the producers wanted to see Anne Hathaway's body again so they added a sex scene.That brings me to my next point: this movie could have been just as good (if not better) had they cut ~20 minutes of footage. There are some developments in the plot that lead to nowhere or are simply irrelevant to how the ending is resolved.Additionally, some of the motivations for the main characters are not fully fleshed out. The main character, Jamie (Jake Gyllenhaal), is at the center of the film and yet the origins of how his personality developed is never really talked about or doesn't make any logical sense. Similar points could be made about the other protagonists and antagonists.Nonetheless, this is still a very very good movie and well worth the 2 hours to watch.",Love & Other Drugs
