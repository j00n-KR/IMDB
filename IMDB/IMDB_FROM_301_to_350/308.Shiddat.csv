0,SAMTHEBESTEST,"An Ullu App Product mistakenly dumped on Hotstar. Shiddat deserves slaughtering, not normally but Shiddat se..",4,1 October 2021,"Shiddat (2021) :
Movie Review -Shiddat gave negative Vibes from the trailer only so i wasn't really expecting it to be even an average affair. Well, I was expecting a below average film or a headache but not this MESS. The film is such a mess created by mixing multiple storylines of different different movies that it doesn't hold anything for its own identity. To be specific and sarcastic at the same time to describe it, i would say DDLJ + Love Aaj Kal + Jagame Thadiram + Laila Majnu + Argo = Shiddat. I hope, i have made it much clear now.Shiddat is about a passion of love and even its title refers the same but unfortunately it's more curved towards sexual appeal, immature love statements made by undisciplined youth and weak bond held between relationship. Mohit Raina plays Gautam who is in love with Ira played by Diana Penty and they get married. In wedding reception speech he talks about passionate love and a gatecrasher named Jaggi (Sunny Kaushal) finds it touching. Jaggi meets a gorgeous girl Kartika (Radhika Madan) and both have an intimate affair. Things looked quite funny till here then we get to know that Kartika is already engaged with someone and moving to London for the wedding. Jaggi confronts Kartika about this and she calls it a platonic affair and asks him to wait 3 months and to come to London if he really loves him.The story is told with the reference of DDLJ but the only difference here is that the true love feeling is missing. As expected Jaggi gets involved in an illegal immigration scam where he meets his saviour Gautam, who, now is separated from Ira. The Fiasco gets even more messy as we get involved into multiple storylines at the same time. What happens in the climax? Let's not reveal it here as i don't want to give away spoilers. Who knows you might like it.Performances of Sunny Kaushal and Mohit Raina are good. Sunny is definitely a promising young talent and this is the second time i am saying this after Forgotten Army. Diana Penty is decent whereas Radhika seems up and down after a while. Dialogues are senseless, cheap and too vulgar sometimes. Even forwarded adults jokes on whatsapp or immature teenagers' conversations are more funnier than this. The writing is definitely problematic as it tries to glamourise immortal love sagas from old days with modern definitions of love. It fails flat, completely annoying and unbearable. And it takes so long to end it, i mean one can get bored like hell. Kunal Deshmukh as director fails to leave an impact but thankfully his framework doesn't go to B Grade level as we saw in recent crap movies. Overall, another bad film from Bollywood and another wrong choice by Hotstar. Skip it.. Shiddat se..RATING - 4/10*",Shiddat
1,MuviFan73,"Tinder ke jamaane me, ham ek dusre k no. one hai!",8,3 October 2021,"Story: The story consists of two parallel running stories. 1). Relationship between an embassy officer for a particular country in Europe and his wife who helps (NGO) the (illegal) migrants. 2). The second story consist of two love birds gaining ground from Sports. In the age of tinder will the number one love of given hockey player, ever materialize?Cinematography, Direction, Acting (& music): Justified.Final Verdict: What I most liked about the movie the nature of male hockey player in the lead of second story. To be frank the second story is highlight of the movie, but it's the place where it shows negative ending. First story shows positive ending but will still leave u sad.Second story: The female lead goes well with male lead and one enjoys to see her on screen. The male lead never loses passion and that's where shiddat as title comes into play. Thus inspiring the first parallel counterpart.First story: Two people in a relationship on the verge of trouble, and heading towards end rejuvenates love again by looking at shiddat (passion) of the male lead in parallel story.Overall story is engaging and entertaining. Do give your time.",Shiddat
2,katyayan-12892,Passionate Love Story,6,13 October 2021,"Review By Kamal KIt's love at first sight for Jaggi (Sunny Kaushal) when he sees Kartika (Radhika Madan) coming out of the swimming pool. But sparks don't fly instantly, as an elaborate 'nafrat pyaar ki pehli seedi hai' kinda process follows, with Jaggi trying every trick in the book to woo the girl. There's some fun to be had here, as director Kunal Deshmukh transports us to the 90's brand of cinema that's played out in the modern setting.As a passionate love story, 'Shiddat' is driven purely from the perspective of its male protagonist Jaggi, whose manic obsession is given enough time to build. The entire first half is light and breezy with campus romance, flirting and a lot of naach gaana, basically everything but academics. What works here is the unpredictability factor, as you wonder what will become of this improbable love story.There aren't many characters in 'Shiddat',' which is refreshing, but their individual arcs could have been more sharply defined. There is little conviction in Mohit Raina and Diana Penty's story that seems to exist merely to aid the central storyline, which is fine, but it doesn't feel organic. Sunny Kaushal has the hardest time playing a bouncy lover-boy with serious boundary issues and while the actor gives it his best to make it convincing, his character graph starts becoming too hard to believe. Radhika Madan struggles to portray Kartika's inner conflict effectively on screen, mostly, resorting to fumbling to convey her anxiety. Mohit Raina is well cast as Gautam, the upright Indian immigration lawyer in a foreign land. Diana Penty looks gorgeous as the independent young Ira, but her character could have been developed more effectively. For a love story, 'Shiddat' has above average music (Sachin-Jigar) that grows on you and is effectively used to enhance the narrative. With rich cinematography (by Amalendu Chaudhary), the film shows visual finesse.The major problem with 'Shiddat' is that it's an exciting idea on paper that tends to drag in execution, especially in the second half. The story is highly unrealistic at times and preposterous too, but what keeps it going is the sense of volatility and suspense. However, it's true that in today's world of realistic cinema, we often don't get to see completely mad, raw and defiant love stories. This one goes there with Shiddat, but doesn't leave you deeply moved.",Shiddat
3,sameerlodaya,Unreal shiddat,4,2 October 2021,"The movie is totally unmatching today's eraWho is going to accept the story of a lover who illegally travels ,swims ,sits below the planes tyres to reach LondonSunny was looking pathetic and was over dramatic Mohit has stealed the show and he was amazingDirection was ok humor was good and love story presented was touchy with good songs and background scoresIf you are ready to see unreal madness then this is for you.",Shiddat

5,vinayshri,A story that gives major lover goals.,9,20 October 2021,On a brief note i can say this movie is way more better than bollywood/hollywood college life drama. Sunny's acting was amazing. The storyline and cast was fabulous. Watch it with your ONLY ONE. Thank you.,Shiddat
6,shashankpatel-37369,Unrealistic Shiddat.,6,12 October 2021,"A movie of a love relationship between kartika and Jaggi where it's been portrayed that jaggi tries to pass various national borders in order to meet his love of life. But the story seems very much non practical and unreasonable. It's missing lots of facts bases. It's shown in the movie about jaggi who had a hook up with kartika played by Radhika and then he falls in love with her. At the same time, kartika behaves practical and just in order to get out of the situation she tells him to come to London and then she won't get married to someone else. And thats where the story begins of chasing her down. Mohit Raina and Diana's love relationship is shown as a support of the story and Mohit tries to be a god father of Jaggi to help him meet his dream girl. It's a cute love story with some illogical script writing. One time watch. End will make you sad a bit, most of the time through out the movie, you won't be bored either but you won't be able to watch again either.",Shiddat
7,madanmarwah,"Stalker, desperado, lover in action",7,10 October 2021,"This one is for the hopeless romantics who like to hear and believe in stuff like "" I will climb the highest mountain to reach you "" or "" I will swim across miles of the deepest sea to get to you "" or "" I will fight everyone, everywhere to be with you for ever and ever"". There is also a message coming across in the movie that love can exist in a long distance relationship and it may be missing in a loveless marriage.So we have a crazy, obsessed lover boy Sunny Kaushal who is besotted with pretty lady Radhika Madan and he stalks her all the time. He is all passion (Shiddat), full of energy and refusing to take ""No"" from the girl. Despite knowing that Radhika is getting married in London, he entreats her to cancel this marriage and wait for him. Like many of the illegal immigrants who take to sea/ land/ air routes to get into the land of opportunities, Sunny also does likewise, but gets caught by the law. But not to be deterred, he continues to make desperate efforts.Director Kunal Deshmukh has a difficult script in his hands but he converts it into a watchable film for Indian audiences. Could he have reduced the film by 30 minutes and made it better? Yes, undoubtedly. It sags at places.Sunny Kaushal has a complex role to perform which gives him a chance to showcase different shades of the character and he does it well. Radhika also acts well as the hapless girl not knowing how to handle the tricky situation.",Shiddat
8,Prince-the-cat,Who is Sunny Khaushal,8,5 October 2021,"Well the movie is a crazy love story for sure, is it unrealistic, I would say that's in the eye of the beholder.I enjoyed the movie, the songs are fantastic and Sunny Khaushal, who the hell is Sunny Khaushal??? I thought he was excellent, he carried the entire movie on his shoulders.The support cast was good, as for Radikha Madan, she just doesn't do it for me.Watch Shiddat, probably one the better movies that has been released this year.",Shiddat
9,i_lalindra,Silly but hit hard on your heart,7,29 October 2021,A story about crazy one side love do whatever it takes to reach and win the heart of his girl.At many points you will feel the boy is very silly but shiddat(Passion) keeps him ticking till the last effort.It is full of romance till the last 5minutes and at last fall apart. Great acting by all four main characters. More credits to them.Music and songs are ideal for the theme. Overall ut is a good effort.,Shiddat
10,mohinderchugh,Really Boring Movie,2,2 October 2021,Started watching movie after seeing good rating at IMDB. Could not watch beyond 15 Minutes. Total Bakwaas No Seedhi Baat.,Shiddat
11,puranjanbasak,Shiddat,8,5 October 2021,"Shiddat is a romantic drama movie directed by kunal deshmukh. So, here are the positives and negatives:Acting-acting is top notch. Mohit raina has done a wonderful job. He is such a naturalist. Sunny kaushal was equally good. He has shown in this film that he has an aura about him to be the lead. But my word is radhika madan so stellar. He is cute, beautiful, and extremely talented. Another female lead who can carry a film on her shoulders. Superbly impressed. The supporting cast including diana penty is good.Music and bgm-bgm is decent. But the main highlight is the music. Beautiful music is what it is. Be it 'barbadiyaan', 'shiddat' or 'chitta' all r beautifully composed and sung. A romantic movie deserves beautiful music and shiddat has got that.Writing-the first half writing is problematic. Stalking is a problem. It was and it is. Jaggi literally stalks her to the swimming pool even clicks a photo having her in his background without permission. But the second half is really beautiful. The conversations, the relationship problems are really good.Chemistry-there r two chemistries specifically. One between jaggi and kartika. Its beautiful. Both of them jel so good. The second one is between jaggi and gautam. A brother type realtionship where the latter really takes care of the former. Very nice to see that.Philosophy-the philosophy of love is fleshed out nicely. Jaggj,-kartika and jaggi -gautam hv numerous conversations regarding the love philosophy. There r certain references to soni mahiwal as well. It was really good to see.Climax-i was literally shocked by the climax. I never thought that this would happen. But at the end all matters is the shiddat, the passion which both jaggi and kartika had for each other.Shiddat is a film u really need to watch. Its a really good film. I rate it 8 out of 10.",Shiddat
12,ayusht-05021,Fake reviews,2,9 October 2021,"I have watched this movie for first 15 minutes and rest I survived. This movie degrades the position of sportspersons, as well as film creators. Above all I have now started judging Radhika madan for doing such an immature movie, Rest of the cast is non mentionable. Don't fall for Mohit Raina, he is also not that great worth hype.",Shiddat
13,sanjeevanwar,Another star launched,5,5 October 2021,"Anwar Says: Few genius joined hands, to write a so called unusual love story for the Jannat and Kalyug famed director Kunal Deshmukh but failed to deliver. You have Sreedhar Raghvan (War and Khakee) , Pooja Ladha Surti (Andhadhun) and Dheeraj Rattan ( Bhangra Pa Le) amongst the screenplay and dialogue writers but hardly found anything new.Another product from Kaushal Factory, Sunny Kaushal, though doesn't have a lover boy face, showed his potential. Radhika Madan also looked fresh and talented. Mohit Raina looked subdued but carried his character well. We would like to see more of Diana Penty.Deshmukh's direction gets stuck many a times, he hardly made any experiments and taken safer route. Sachin- Jigar gave some peppy numbers . Overall, had all the potential to be another Kabir Singh or Aashiqi , but Sandip Reddy or Bhatt Saheb or even Shaad Ali's magic is missing.Watch if you are unable to sleep some night.#disneyhotstar

14,a_filmcritter,different but underwhelming,6,2 October 2021,"First of all, what is with Bollywood filmmakers making movies where the guy is so adamant to be with the girl even when the girl says no, and it's being viewed as being romantic?Ok moving on. The movie wasn't bad but it wasn't great either. It's a different kind of ""romance"" movie; with the way the story was written, the direction, and it's production, which is the main reason why it seemed refreshing and unpredictable and wasn't bad.However, the acting was hit or miss in scenes. Sometimes you could relate to the character as to why they were feeling of behaving a certain way. But other times, you couldn't and it was mostly due to overacting. And that's why this movie wasn't great.And there were technical issues throughout the movie that broke the flow of the movie and made it feel quite unrealistic (swimmer not doing proper CPR; the boy falling from the top floor and can still walk, etc.)",Shiddat
15,sndpkumar,Decent love story .. Enjoyable..,8,9 October 2021,Decent love story with emotion but great in terms of screenplay. Engaging but a bit over drama . Enjoyable...,Shiddat

Cast done the job well but many times I felt that 'presentation' in the sense of character's emotions and different part of story that changed suddenly did not go well. And somewhere it gone illogical and unrealistic.",Shiddat
19,riteshcse-42558,Not worth watching,1,30 October 2021,"I have stopped watching Bollywood movies for a long time as most of the movies are all about hot scenes, good looks with no story.

20,coolhunk55,Started good but then became illogical - cute and tragic.,5,6 October 2021,"The first 40 minutes of the movie is real fun till the time Kartika's parents come to India. Sunny kaushal is great at his acting. Very spontaneous and full of energy. Radhika madan is cute and she has done her part very well as well. But after that though the acting remains good, the plot goes illogical with Sunny trying ti cross the English channel in sub zero temperature and then flies hiding inside the plane wheel and then ultimately falling to his death while landing. The end is tragic but this didn't need complications and all this nonsense. The songs are good. Especially Shiddat and Barbadiyan. Diana penty still can't act.",Shiddat

You are still in the 1990s era, wake up dude you are in 2021 where such things are condemned and this film shows exactly that.Regarding other things, story is decent, concept is good, mad love , ""pyaar ke lie kuch bhi krenge"" typzz. But it tends to drag mid way. Easily it would be a 2hr film at the max . Good thing is that the initial love story between Jaggi and Kartika is not rushed .Quite some scenes , especially the climax is not believable. Reminds you of Afghanistan thing that happened recently. Could have captured the plight of illegal immigrants better.Songs are good and HUM DUM by Ankit Tiwari is the best along with its choreography.Mohit Raina's stale expression didn't impress me.

56,Internationalreviewer,Interesting observation,10,8 October 2021,"Some people call it a waste film in the era when web-series are favorite. There are special group of viewers who like to watch romantic movies, they grew up thinking DDLJ/ Rab ne bana di jodi was an epic and they think Kabir Singh is the real romance, some of them secretly worship The notebook. If those movies are not waste of time, then this movie has the legitimate right to call itself wonderful.Music is good and the ending has a twist.There is nothing new in romantic movies anymore but still people watch them because it is a total fantasy.So do not hesitate to watch this movie, because plots of romantic movies does not make any sense in real life but they are still guilty pleasure in watchlist.",Shiddat
57,nitinjaiswal06,A story which make u cry,10,7 November 2021,Yes it is different and unique story which rarely come in bollywood. I loved it in simple words. End is sad but he did to save his bro. These types of movies should come.,Shiddat
58,bidish14,Beyond idiocy. Do not recommend.,4,9 October 2021,"What a stupid screenplay. And the ending is just ludricous and pathetic. If the writers wanted to kill the protagonist, they should've done that while he was swimming the English channel. That would still be stupid but at least a bit believable and work with the flow of the screenplay. The writers killed the guy after everything was sorted, really like really? Anyway the movie was already just so so before that cringy and unbelievably unnecessary and stupid ending. I would've given 6* and a one time watch rating if not for that horrendous ending. But as it stands, this is a movie that you want to miss because you value your time. I watched it for Radhika. She's stunning but sadly her acting style is getting repetitive. She needs to reinvent herself. You can't act the same way in every character. Happy to see Mohit and Diana but sadly this isn't the type of movie they should add to their filmography. Sunny still needs a lot of work to flourish as an actor. Nevertheless it was an earnest effort from him. The entire blame lies in the writers and the director who must've thought that this is an out of the box story. But no.",Shiddat

64,igreviews,Could have been a much much better movie,5,1 October 2021,"Plot: Jaggi (Sunny Kaushal) fell in love with Kartika (Radhika Madan) who is getting married. He is ready to go ""one hand distance"" (you will understand this reference if you watch movie) for her. He meets Gautam Kapoor (Mohit Raina) in between and came across his love life and many things changed afterwards.Positives:
+ Music
+ Lead cast performanceNegatives:
LengthMany things don't make sensePredictable storylineFinal Verdict: It could have been a much better movie if the length is trimmed to 2 hours only with songs (that's right! Music is very good) and a gripping storyline. There are many points where scenes doesn't make sense so just remember may be because of 'Shiddat' all things falls in places and it could have been happened.",Shiddat

Wish Sunny is give much more challenging roles . He is promising next Gen actor !!!",Shiddat
67,tkmce2008,An old wine that hasn't aged well!,3,3 October 2021,"Shiddat is the story of love (the grand gesture of love). Jogindar or Jaggi (Sunny Kaushal) is inspired by Gautam's (Mohit Raina) philosophy of love. Jaggi pursues Kartika (Radhika Madan) unrelentlessly, by literally scaling rough terrain and crossing huge water bodies.Mohit Raina, Sunny Kaushal, @radhikamadan & @dianapenty are all talented actors but movies like Shiddat add no value to their resumes. Penty has the smallest of roles and she doesn't disappoint. Sunny Kaushal & Radhika Madan make an interesting pair but there are moments when they seem off tangent by a lot. Mohit Raina continues to deliver strong performances. Well, what went wrong you ask? It is too illogical! It is a story from a bygone era set in the modern world. So much so that Madan's character asks; ""who does so much for love these days?Shiddat has amazing songs (long due) but as the trailer had so rightly predicted; the plot turns out to be a massive letdown. It is too far-fetched & nonsensical. But I love the route they took for the climax.",Shiddat

69,kareshsam,Good acting but illogical movie,4,3 October 2021,"Jaggi had a great career in front of him and a whole life. And he wasn't even in a relationship with Kartika, they met just a few days back and he went on to destroy his life, family, career everything without any commitment from Kartika's side.No doubt, everybody's acting was superb but the story is very outdated.The character played by Mohit Raina was actually very close to being practical and he even gave some very good advice to Jaggi in one scene, ie, ""Tu salad pe hi atak gaya hai, main course, desert sab baaki hai.""",Shiddat
70,kashmiester,Decent but flawed,5,17 October 2021,"It's not bad but don't think too much into it. Firstly the girl is cheating with her marriage, date, venue all already booked, secondly he is a stalker but both are made to look like it's acceptable. No! It's not, both are in the wrong, and this movie fantasizes and celebrates cheating and stalking here. The editing is strange as when in Europe they are sometimes driving on left then on right, sometimes UK numberplate sometimes European, that was odd and poor editing.",Shiddat

It's all because of mohit raina. His screen presence and performance was amazing.

138,shaikhin,Surpassed the products of Megastars,9,5 October 2021,Lets just consider Upcoming young talented actors are doing great movies. Rich in content and genre. These movies are entertaining and at the same time not the pathetic repetitive stories as is created by big bollywood starts. I think gone are their days....,Shiddat
139,sunnybagde,So much potential but...,3,3 October 2021,"When I saw the first look of this film, I got excited for it as I am a great fan of both kaushal and madan. At the day of its release, I watched the review of the film by TRP on YouTube and I thought maybe he was too critical for such a love story but after I wasted my hours into the film I realised I share the same views. The film is very problematic like Kabir Singh stands flat against it, the music is fabulous, acting is decent by everyone be because kaushal has done a very similar role in Bhanga Paa Le. Surprisingly the special effects of the film were good enough to not feel jarring like the other bollywood films released in lockdown. The most disappointing part is the end needed to be justified by a strong connection between the leads but it feels hollow. Instead the secondary pair had convincing moments that we could resonate with like a scene where he trades the cheap food for migrants by his wife just so that he could eat food of her hands, while the primary couple always felt like kaushal is forcing her to love him and in all the ruckus of her life she has now got confused and has no other choice but to listen to him. The end is highly inspired from 2011's rockstar instead they couldn't emulate the magic between the duo despite having a talented actress than in rockstar.The core plot of the film is too loose to get off that despite with a mindset of it's a movie let's not find sense in it and enjoy, you'll endup disliking the film no matter how much you want.",Shiddat
140,rahil-08234,Waste of time,5,30 October 2021,"Highly immature, rubbish, and overrated. I decided to watch after seeing rating of 8 on IMDb. But it was completely waste of time. Started really well, but after 20-25 mins it became clear where it is going. There was no chemistry between two leads because of poor writing. We cannot connect with any character. Acting by Sunny kaushal, Mohit Raina and Diana was very good but they were all wasted because of kachra script. Radhika was little off.Don't try this at home 😅",Shiddat

A guy swimming through english canal and making it without a much fuss, deportation officer taking the main hero home because of the detention center is closed at weekends!, National level athletes always partying and drinking without any disciplinary consequences!

Diana Penty also did her part with honesty. Radhika Madan though needs to work on her expressions.. not her greatest work here.Everyone expects all Millennials to be practical.. but some of them are just crazy.

248,afraunnisa,"We only want to see those movies where both the individuals end up together. Maybe that's why some people didn't like it. 'Shiddat' is not a movie, it's an emotion.",10,1 November 2021,"'Agar koi iss movie ko samajh nahin paya toh usne sachha pyaar dekha hi nahin hai'. We live in a world where definition of love is something very different and we think that is what love really is. But love is much more than that. If we have not witnessed this type of love which is showed in the movie, it doesn't mean it does not exists(no doubt, it's very rare in today's world. Infact, Kartika herself says in one scene where she's talking to Gautam, 'kaun karta hai aisa, woh bhi aaj ke zamane mein'. There they try to give it a real touch.)This movie and Jaggi showed us what 'sachha pyaar' actually is. Jaggi, who is so much in love with Kartika that boundaries doesn't really matter to him. He just wants to reach her to win her over. His love is his strength. This movie is not 'cliched' instead it's 'raw and real' but unfortunately we're unable to understand it.These are my thoughts about the movie. Many people won't agree with me which is completely okay because everyone has its own way of seeing things but still we must atleast try to think about what other person is saying. Also, i see many people commenting about washroom scene, that scene isn't added for the sake of it. There is a meaning behind it to showcase the character build-up in the film. I'll say it's a MUST WATCH movie. People who are emotional and really believe in 'sachha shiddat waala pyaar' would love it. On the other hand, those who think very practically might not like it.",Shiddat

Diana Penty is also Ok.Overall the movie has everything good story. Some madness and good music as well which I feel is necessary in Love story Movies.The only negative point of this movie is its bit stretched also slows after the interval.Ending according to me is justified and logical which some people are complaining.",Shiddat

258,oazam-94021,"""Shiddat wala afos"" (Rampancy of Regret) is a better title for this film. Kunal Deshmukh really took the audience for granted",5,1 October 2021,"Romantic films have been a huge staple in the industry but in today's generation, this genre is borderline dying because of the same chemistry and climaxes. The music might do justice to these films but the thing that engages the audience is the script and the way it is directed.Joginder Dhillon a.k.a Jaggi is a Punjabi happy go-lucky state level hockey player who falls in love and flirts with Karthika, a girl who has come to India to train in swimming for the Olympics. Despite her getting married to a British-Indian named Karan, they both have feelings for each other and go their separate ways but with a promise to be reunited.So how Jaggi's journey to love is basically what this film is about and how he takes the help of an IFS officer that Jaggi encountered before whose marriage is on the rocks.Honestly, this film doesn't cut the mustard and it without a doubt the most underwhelming film on the platform. I know how desperate such people are to fulfill their love but this one is just too much to bear.From a long walking trail to a long truck ride to Paris until lastly an attempted deep sea swim to England, I mean this is just ludicrous that even Imtiaz Ali would think of this as a drag.The screenplay was over dramatic and beyond predictable as whether he gets to his manzil or not, you can still easily know what will happen in the end.There was no twist or drama that you'd expect in the romantic drama and writers Sridhar Raghavan and Dheeraj Rattan might have had less sleep that night when they came up with something like this.Acting is not that badSunny Kaushal tries really hard to become like his brother who is now a big star but he still has a long way to go. He wasn't bad in Gold & Bhangra Paa le but this one, he tried too hard to pull of his Punjabi style Majnu but failed. But it's affable in partsRadhika Madan wasn't bad and for a first in a romantic film, she hasn't done such a bad job with the emotions but the ending was definitely a justification of overacting.Mohit Raina had some potential as an IFS officer who tried to help Jaggi but his mixed emotions couldn't do justice to his character.Diana Penty was a ghost for a while and hasn't appeared in a lot of films but she was doable in certain parts of the film and she had that charismatic charm in the 1st half.Music was pretty good and it wasn't all that bad. The title track has managed to stand out majorly as such along with Jug Jug Jeeve & Hum Dum.Overall, this love sotry is dull and too underwhelming despite the music being the only standout, you would wanna either watch something else on Disney+ Hotstar or cancel your subscription.",Shiddat
259,ansh-33212,Problematic but Passionate,6,7 October 2021,"The appreciable duo of Sunny Kaushal and Radhika Madan are seen in this illogical, problematic but passionate and teary romance, Shiddat. Shiddat in its core is problematic to say the least, and tries to portray the difference between practicality and love. It's been a long time since we've seen a very outlandish love story in today's realistic cinema. This movie takes us back a couple of decades back where romantic movies were quite frankly, unrealistic, problematic but passionate.Shiddat is a movie about Jaggi who falls head over heels for Kartika during an All-India sports meet, they have problematic conflicts but soon anger and hatred melts into love but only for Jaggi to realise that Kartika is about to get married. This then makes our lead cross borders illegally and even attempt to swim across the English Channel to reach the love of his life to crash her wedding with the help of Gautam, an IFS Officer supervising Jaggi who tries to figure out his own love story along with him.The Pros:-
The Soundtrack: The movie genuinely has an amazing soundtrack, probably one of the best this year right after Shershah. Tracks including the title track, 'Shiddat' and 'Hum Dum' are very soulful and are used very well. The title track especially is used in different versions depending upon the mood of the scene. There is a really good dance number 'Barbaadiyaan' which is quite groovy. The track 'Chitta' is also a good listen and the scene that goes with the track is also quite heartwarming.The Cast: The lead pair included Sunny Kaushal and Radhika Madan. Sunny carried this new energy, although his character is problematic, he plays it well. Radhika was a pleasure to watch especially in some of the emotional conversations on call with Raina. The supporting cast was probably the best watch, Mohit Raina who plays an IFS officer in France is amazing to watch, his character is probably the only real character in the film. Diana Penty plays a social activist and Raina's wife and it was good to watch her on screen after a while.The Chemistry: Radhika and Sunny share great chemistry on screen. They seem quite comfortable and realistic especially in some of the intimate sequences.The Cons:-
The Messaging and Nature: The movie is extremely problematic with something like stalking termed as love in 2021. It starts off with a problematic sequence of boys calling girls 'jalpariyan', objectifying them and clicking non consensual pictures which apparently goes viral which results in these girls barging into the boys dressing room and clicking non consensual nudes which was basically harassment. The problem doesn't stop here, Kartika never tells Jaggi that she is getting married, he only gets to know this after they've been together. Even in the second half we see Gautam objectifying women with Jaggi. Jaggi is detained with Gautam but seems to run away a number of times which makes you question the competence of this IFS Officer. The movie seems to be set in the wrong era. The problematic and illogical nature of the film takes you back to the 90s and early 2000s where movies with similar messaging were prominent and successful.The Romance: The movie being a proper romantic movie forgot to focus on the romance between the leads, The leads spend just about twenty five minutes on screen together which wasn't enough to develop that love in them on screen although their chemistry in those few minutes save this portion but there is nothing that makes the viewers root for the lead pair except for the fact that they are the lead pair. It spends too much time on the illegal immigrant sequence instead of building up love between the leads.The Editing: The movie lacked good editing and visual effects. In almost all sequences the green screen was quite visible and lighting was a little off and in some scenes some parts of the characters did disappear due to the green screen.The movie, although problematic in most sequences, is entertaining to some extent. The cast, The soundtrack and BGM especially in the non-comical sequences keep you going. Some emotional scenes in the movie will be heartbreaking owing to the performances. The movie does bring out some contrast between practical and crazy love as we see the contrast between Kartika and her father but it did require a more romantic and a less outlandish film to make this plot point more relatable and likeable. The illogicalness of the film is quite jarring at some points and genuinely makes you think what the makers of the film were trying to achieve. Despite the problematic and outlandish nature, the film can be watched for the soundtrack, the cast and some heartwarming sequences.",Shiddat

Only because Jaggi(main male lead) clicked a picture of taking her in the frame intentionally and posted it online without her permission. Not saying that it was cool, that was totally wrong that he took her In The frame but was she naked? No. When jaggi's friend was clicking the picture, she herself stood there and posed showing her middle finger. Inshort both the scenes were absurd and problematic for me.

Shiddat is one of those movies. To begin with, the movie gives an impression of a simple, regular love story. At some point though it achieves an emotional scale that is nothing short of spectacular. The performances are amazing Sunny, Radhika and Mohit are impressive. Diana does a great job in the limited scenes that she gets (especially the one where she is breaking off with Mohit). The climax is a clincher - anything less might have turned it into a regular movie, which it definitely is not. Congratulations to all the actors - don't go by Critics (Saibal Chatterjee - You don't have a heart or it's not in the right place). All actors have done a great job.",Shiddat

375,sweetrashi-65824,Stalking Stupidity Sickness in the Name of Love,1,2 October 2021,"Shiddat is everything that is wrong with bollywood romantic movies. Scenes are illogical and stupid. Jaggi's character is a problematic one. What he has done in the movie is simply called stalking and people like them should be called pervert. Taking picture of a girl without consent and posting it, flashing, stalking, talking vulgar, behaving vulgar are everything which is wrong with this film.Movie is illogical to its peak. Jaggi crossing borders in an illegal way, swimming in English canal and no consequences, sits below the planes tyres to reach London, an IFS officer taking an illegal immigrant to his home, National level athletes are partying and drinking that too a day before a big competition. It really makes me cringe to infinity.Expected better from Radhika Madan. Mohit Raina is really fine actor he needs better opportunities.

And Mohit Raina, kudos bro; Your character effortlessly shows the insufficiencies of the so called Blue bloods.Overall, repeat watch. Watched it today morning, gonna watch it again tomorrow.All I can say is I felt the emotions; laughed and cried with them; didn't want the movie to end; and now that it's ended I feel like I lost something personal; Yes I liked it that much.

399,pankajyp,Same feeling i got in 2011 after whatching Tum Bin,10,3 October 2021,"What a classic movie, its all about love and relationship. How different people value it, and as a audience one gets a strong message of how love is not a perfect thing, but is something which has to be made perfect with efforts, till the end of life. Musicians and singers have taken loads of efforts and you gonna listen to songs even more after watching the movie . All actors did very fair job and offcourse the rising star Sunny( i call him combo of vicky kaushal and rajkumar rao) he has killed it. Aome of the scenes which leave an impact of the scenes when Sunny goes to buy the Yellow single piece dress in france, the way he explains the size of dress. Has any one ever consoled you saying that move on, by a buffet example, that was so deep. For people who like guessing ab yeh hoga, will have a tough time and this will keep you enthusiatic till the end of the movie, where again it plays with youe mind and what you want to see, but ends up in what shall really happen.

unrealistic many a times but if you go along with this you can feel the obsession , passion and stubbornness of the guy wanting to get united with the girl and he is ready to go to any length ..... we don't see that happening now a days ..... that's why you feel good ..... ignites the passion in you for lovebeautiful songs

Agar hero English channel mein marr jata toh bhi acceptable tha that he sacrified his life while achieving his love...wo heroine bhi ready toh wapis aane ke liye ready thi toh bekar ka drama kyun karwaya director ne ....
I really praise the love of kartika and Jaggi but I m rating this movie as 1 because of director who ended a movie in worst...

507,bhanuca,Utterly boring and born out of nepotism,1,19 October 2021,"The movie is a launchpad for the ""Sonny Boy"" - the Kaushal sibling who seems to be forced to act and prove his mettle when none exist. His looks and body language appears tiring and forced rather than effortless. The scenes with his romance especially the CPR part is not only laughable but horrendously ""C"" grade. Radhika Madan is a good supporting actress and lesser of a lead - she lacks the oomph and comes across as a girl next door from a suburban Delhi neighborhood. Mohit raina is a saving grace but put to dust by shoddy story writing and equally pathetic cinematic liberty. Wish the writers could spend some quality time leaning the story toward reality rather than pompous inaccuracies. Diana Panty looks stunning and appears gorgeous only till the time she is mute - her height and looks could surely give her a Lakme Fashion walk but the movies are surely not her cup of tea.Avoid this disaster even during a lockdown - its worth watching a Mohabbaten repeat than to sit through this painfully boring piece of lazy work.",Shiddat

511,ajaysingh-1998,A movie not made for all types of audiences but if you like romantic dramas (regardless of the realistic/unrealistic approach) this movie is for you...,8,20 October 2021,I'll not go into much details about the movie but will try to cover the concept of movie instead People need to overlook the negative comments by people who are way too serious in their lives and always looking for a serious realistic fictional dramas. And 2nd thing this movie is definitely not made for all types of audiences but instead a part of audience . There were flaws in the movie surely but i'll overlook them as the main purpose of most romantic dramas is not to give away a much realistic approach but instead a whole new world where a person feels like he's lost somewhere in it like we've seen in most hollywood romantic dramas. So basically shiddat is completely unrealistic movie (atleast for me) . Although i like to watch movies which have a realistic approach in it but when it comes to romantic dramas where thats not a case here. I am a big fan of romantic dramas and i look for the movies which just connects directly to my heart and shiddat is the type of one i can say where it connected just directly to my heart . Im a lazy watcher but shiddat (2.25 hours) i just completed it in one go like i was completely lost with the movie and with the vibes it gave. So instead making a decision based on reviews i suggest you guys to watch the movie and make your decision if its your type or not ... NEVER EVER MAKE A DECISION BASED ON REVIEWS as everyone have a different taste and preferences so instead give every movie a try who's plot looks interesting to you.,Shiddat
512,shubhankarb180,Unrealistic Love Story but Worth Watching Once,8,31 October 2021,"Overall the story plot is not realistic but still has a lot of appeal. Story line moves with a gradual speed and ending is good. Main highlight is the Sunny Kaushal, great performance and some how manages to make it believable. Radhika Madan acting is good but is overshadowed by the male lead. Parallel love story of Mohit and Diana is a great blend of modern marriage crisis and merges well with the other story to provide a great contrast. I understand realistic stories are better but life is realistic as well and it was great for once to watch something like this.",Shiddat

1. It normalise stalking and sexual harrasment. The hero kept stalking her when she is in her swimsuit. If someone does that to you just imagine how horrifying it would be. The heroine in turn sexually abuse all his friends by posting their naked videos. That would be such a nightmare. How is this funny or normal.2. It is illogical, coz the hero does all illegal immigration to reach London. He could apply legit visiting visa from India for holiday and it's not difficult to get one. Else he can try from another country as well. He SWIMS THE SEA to see her. That is so unrealistic. And he sits on plane's tire and nobody sees it.I wish Radhika and Sunny finds good movies ahead because they are talented.",Shiddat

Lead Actor's Acting was good but not that tough on the opposite the Heroine got some ""Angrazi Keeda"" on her. Maybe 80% of her dialogue's are in English . Or maybe the director wanted to give a British accent to her tongue to feel like ""Yeah ! She's British"". The Actress is pretty but i think she needs more practice to get a boost in her career. Her Acting is not that good in Shiddat .But If we look at the script , its a wonderful Romantic story they got . There are reality filled in it .
