0,MartinHafer,Brilliantly crafted and well worth seeing....unless some idiot told you THE secret!,10,11 July 2011,"I am making 100% sure I don't in any way reveal the surprise twist in this film--too many have and I think those people are evil. So, if you know THE twist, you'll probably not enjoy the film nearly as much when you first see it. But, if you haven't, it's a heck of an enjoyable film.Haley Joel Osment delivers a truly amazing performance considering his age. He is THE reason the film works as well as it does and I wish the Oscar folks had given him some sort of special award to honor his great work. And, in addition, I can't believe I am saying this, but Bruce Willis and the director, M. Night Shyamalan, were at the top of their game as well. The other huge star here is the writing--and it was superb because it was so original, creative and the story bears many repeated viewings as each one reveals yet another layer of complexity.By the way, while nominated for six Oscars, the movie somehow won none. Instead, the darkly cynical ""American Beauty"" carried off five of the trophies--though I really didn't think this winner was nearly as good a movie. Good, yes...but not great like ""The Sixth Sense""....provided some moron didn't tell you THE secret.",The Sixth Sense
1,TheLittleSongbird,Shyamalan's best film and the only film of his I consider a masterpiece,10,6 January 2012,"I have to say I am not a fan generally of M Night Shyamalan's films, but I absolutely loved The Sixth Sense. It is a beautifully made film with an afterlife that is anything but angels and harps, and the score has lots of subtlety and atmosphere to it. The script is chilling, intelligent and poignant and the story complete with a knockout twist ending(easily the best and only wholly believable ending of Shyamalan's movies) is simplicity at its finest. Shyamalan's direction is wonderfully controlled, which is exactly what the story needed. Haley Joel Osment gives perhaps his best performance here, though he's superb in AI too, while Toni Collette plays the troubled mum very convincingly and Bruce Willis is suitably quiet and reflective. Overall, a wonderful film and Shyamalan's best by a mile in my opinion. 10/10 Bethany Cox",The Sixth Sense
2,Leofwine_draca,A thoughtful ghost story that became a Hollywood blockbuster,9,21 December 2016,"My latest outing to the local multiplex was to see this, the second biggest horror film of 1999 after THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT. Unfortunately for me, the film had already been ruined partially by trailers, which give away all the key moments of the film. I for one could do without them, as I spent most of the time waiting for the kid to say ""I see dead people"", ""...all the time"" and ""she's standing by my window"". Seeing as these are the best moments of the film, a lot of the impact was softened.Saying that, THE SIXTH SENSE is still an expertly-crafted, entertaining film with some great acting (something lacking in a lot of recent blockbusters), and I'm glad that it's enjoying huge success at the moment - hopefully horror film-makers will turn their minds to something a bit more insightful and psychological rather than the latest gore fest. This is an extremely slow-moving film with no action in it whatsoever, no screaming girls being chased by maniacs, just important dialogue and realistic people in real situations. There are plenty of reasons to watch the film for. When we eventually start seeing the 'ghosts' that Cole himself sees, there is ample opportunity for some chills, and the ghosts themselves are really quite frightening - both in their behaviour, and of course their gory looks. These spooks are of the kind THE HAUNTING remake could have done with.The acting is of the highest calibre, with a relatively unknown cast headed by that great action star, Bruce Willis. Willis turns in his most sombre, thoughtful performance ever, and surprised many people who didn't realise he could actually act. In fact I would say that this the best I've ever seen him - his character is sympathetic, and Willis really does excel himself in portraying a believable, faded and disheartened man. Toni Collette also puts in a good role as the frustrated mother of Cole, and even though she doesn't play a likable character and has a relatively supporting role in the proceedings, she remains a totally believable and understandable character, and the same can be said of Olivia Williams. However, it's Haley Joel Osment who really shines as the star of the piece, and his acting is spot on, conveying a boy totally in fear of his own unnatural abilities, and who labels himself a 'freak'. Thankfully, Osment doesn't get too many opportunities to do 'cute' scenes, which I was grateful for.Aside from the many genuine chills at Cole's revelations that he can see dead people, there are a few too many 'jump' scenes for my liking, where somebody brushes past the camera and somebody screams. A variation on the cat in the cupboard, really. However what seems to be initially an average film is suddenly boosted by the now famous twist in the tale, which really changes your entire perception of the film and makes you think about how clever it was long after the images have faded from the screen. This ending was brilliant, one of the best I've seen, and I should probably watch the film again now that I know the outcome, in order to spot all the clues, as it were. THE SIXTH SENSE may not be the greatest horror film ever, but it's one of the best we've had in a long time.",The Sixth Sense
3,SnoopyStyle,one of the greatest reveals of all time,10,7 September 2015,"Child psychologist Malcolm Crowe (Bruce Willis) celebrates an award win with his wife Anna (Olivia Williams). Deranged ex-patient Vincent Grey (Donnie Wahlberg) breaks in and shots Malcolm. Vincent then commits suicide. The next fall, Malcolm is treating distressed Cole Sear (Haley Joel Osment) who lives with his single mom Lynn (Toni Collette). His suffering leaves him an outcast at school. After another episode leaves him in the hospital, he tells Malcolm his secret that he ""sees dead people"".This is one of the best reveals in movie history. It's not simply a shocking twist. Anybody can write a random twist that aims to shock people. This twist is well-planned and constructed from the first moments of the film. Shyamalan lays out not only clues but the right amount of clues. It is a twist that people are unlikely to foresee but then beat themselves for not forseeing it. He gets the perfect balance.The other question is whether this is a good movie without the twist. The great thing is that the intensity does not rely on the twist. HJO has the perfect wise innocence quality. It has great creepiness. It's a traditional ghost story and a well made one. The intensity ramps up as the ghosts reveal themselves. This would be one of the great horrors even without the twist.",The Sixth Sense
4,Hitchcoc,It Really Captured My Attention,9,3 April 2006,"I rented this and watched it around midnight a couple years ago. This film, like ""Poltergeist,"" has contributed a line to the eternal world of cinema: ""I see dead people."" I will not spoil this for someone that has not seen it. My comments are on the craftsmanship that is this film. It starts with Haley Joel Osment, who will go down as one of our great child actors. He has the vulnerability and pain that expresses itself so well. His continual bouts with his ""gift"" bring him more pain. He gets an ally in Bruce Willis's character, and they begin to face things together. Unfortunately, like most movies that present something supernatural, a set of rules apply to the world and it these rules that make it fairly easy to pull this down. However, I would rather have them craft it as best they can than try to keep consistent in every aspect. Like ""Memento"" which I saw pretty close to the same time, I don't want to think too much or the fine fabric of the film starts to unravel. How's that for cowardice?",The Sixth Sense
5,Horst_In_Translation,A boy who sees dead people,6,10 February 2015,"""The Sixth Sense"" is a film written and directed by M. Night Shyamalan and usually seen as his best work. It runs for slightly over 100 minutes. The director also appears himself in the film again just like he usually does. I personally believe, however, that ""Signs"" is still his best work to this day. I have to say I enjoyed the first half of ""The Sixth Sense"" more than the second. It feels more intimate with basically the whole first half (after the shooting) being communications between Willis' and Osment's characters. If you know the final twist, it does not hurt the film at all. It even makes the interaction between Willis' character and his ex-wife more interesting: the Zoloft, her not speaking except ""Happy anniversary!""... I've seen this film two or three times already and I always find something new and intriguing about it. The second half with the play and the interactions between the boy and other dead people did not do so much for me.The film scored six Academy Award nominations that year. The only one I'm a bit baffled by is Toni Collette's, who I did not find that memorable. And Osment is obviously lead and not supporting. Back in 1999, over 15 years ago, this was the second most successful film of the year at the box office, right behind the newest Star Wars film. I felt the film was at its weakest when it tried to go too much for horror instead of mystery thriller. Most of the dialogs were very well written, so no need to include any of the cheap thrills instead.Funnily enough, I watched the Witherspoon/Ruffalo comedy ""Just like Heaven"" before ""The Sixth Sense"" and in a way they are both about seeing dead (or almost dead) people. Of course, this one here is much more serious in tone. I recommend it and believe you should have seen it at least once, even if it certainly has more rewatch value than most people will admit, even if you know the final development of Willis' character. (I myself have to say I did not see it coming the first time I watched this movie.) Oh and if you liked Osment's work here, make sure to check out some of his other films. He did not have a career as great as this suggested he could, at least not yet, but he is a talented young actor, just like his sister Emily.",The Sixth Sense
6,mark.waltz,Those who are unaware that they are dead have a lot of problems.,8,25 August 2021,"I do not know if I could ever watch this chilling movie ever again. It only took me 22 years to break down and see it. For Haley Joel Osment, it will keep his image alive forever as the sad little boy who softly declared that he sees dead people, much like ""They're here!"" kept Heather O'Rourke alive past her sadly short life. Reruns of ""Murphy Brown"" on Nick at Night made fun of the line in phony interviews with Candice Bergen, but like many famous lines in movie history, the subtle way the line is said is often dramatically altered. I see now why this is considered one of the scariest thrillers of all time, more psychological than horrific and definitely a different type of scary movie that shows the ghosts for their ongoing pain than for going out of their way to haunt people.This has to also be the greatest, most subtle performance in the career of Bruce Willis, soft spoken and in fear of the unknown, Haunted early on by a patient who shot him then killed himself over apparent drug addiction. Osment doesn't utter this line until 50 minutes into the movie, and when he does actually see the dead people, you can't help but feel sorry for them. A few do seem subtly demonic, but the dead who appear to them are often more wounded emotionally than the living, and yet appear as if evil forces have put up a barrier to keep them from finding peace.The narrative is a bit too complex at times, but once you have grasped what's happening, it's smooth sailing as far as viewing goes if not in grasping everything that is going on. It could take several viewings to really comprehend all that happens but I have grasped enough to move on. The film seems to be a big circle of circumstance, and the mystery is in connecting everything together. Could Osment really be the child version of Willis or is he really a ghost himself? The possibilities for twists in this are endless, but there has to be just one conclusion which makes this all the more chilling. Toni Collette and Olivia Williams are perfect support. It is a film that starts with a mystery, turns to be horror, and quickly twists and turns to be a spiritual thriller that will have you thinking about it for hours after it is over.",The Sixth Sense
7,classicsoncall,"""I don't want to be scared anymore"".",8,1 April 2011,"I have to admit, when I saw this film the first time, I never saw the twist coming. I'm thinking now I should have, like I should have been paying closer attention to the principals and their relationship to each other, but somehow they sneaked one past me. This film and ""Unbreakable"" made me a Shyamalan fan for a time, but then he went ahead and squandered it with ""The Village"" and ""Lady in the Water"", but that's another story.Movie fans tuning in expecting to see a down and out horror flick here might come away disappointed. It's got some scary stuff to be sure, but I don't think that was the point. What the director was going for here was a treatment of the life after death theme, and the concept of lost souls hanging around until their mission in life has been accomplished. Watching the picture a second time, the clues become obvious, as when Dr. Crowe (Bruce Willis) responds to young Cole's (Haley Joel Osmont) question whether he was a good doctor - ""Well, I used to be"". 'Used' to be! Willis' character telegraphs the punch line for the viewer without making it overtly obvious, and that's the brilliance of the film.I think this kid Osmont has a wonderful career ahead of him if he doesn't get sucked into the Britney Spears/Lindsay Lohan school of dysfunctional celebrity. Though he looked younger here than his actual age (11), I thought he did a superb job, especially during the heart wrenching admission when he confesses his ability to see 'dead people'. It was at that point that believers in the hereafter got on board with the theme of the film, that there's a life after death and that there are things that can't be rationally explained once a spirit passes on. Dr. Crowe realizes that it's time for him to move on once he's helped Cole get beyond his grief over a father that's abandoned him. In Cole Sear's case, it meant dealing with the visions of spirits who departed in conflicted circumstances instead of peacefully passing on.",The Sixth Sense
8,lee_eisenberg,a thriller in the real sense of the word,10,19 October 2005,"Dr. Malcolm Crowe (Bruce Willis) is a Philadelphia psychiatrist meeting with Cole Sear (Haley Joel Osment), a boy who can - OK, I'll say it this one last time - see dead people. While too many horror flicks have relied on gore, this one relies on the subconscious, and other things that we don't realize. And of course, there's the ending. I literally did not see that coming, although there were a number of clues throughout the movie. All that I can say is, you are going to have your mind blown. M. Night Shyamalan truly created an impressive piece of cinema history here, and of his later movies, only ""Unbreakable"" came close to equalling this one's quality.On another note, I think that it was appropriate that ""The Sixth Sense"" came out in 1999, when I was 15. It was named by Entertainment Weekly as one of the many movies that year that revolutionized the movie industry (along with ""Election"", ""The Blair Witch Project"", ""American Beauty"" and ""Being John Malkovich""). Similarly, in 1967, when my parents were 15, movies such as ""In the Heat of the Night"", ""Bonnie and Clyde"" and ""The Graduate"" - all revolutionizing the movie industry - were released. Some things just work out perfectly.",The Sixth Sense
9,jboothmillard,The Sixth Sense,8,20 September 2005,"You probably know the five human senses: Touch, Scent, Sight, Sound and Taste, and this is a terrifying idea for a sixth, from director M. Night Shyamalan (also starring as Dr. Hill). Basically Malcolm Crowe (Bruce Willis) is a child psychologist recently awarded, and on the same night visited by a mad ex-patient who wounds him by gunshot. A few months later Malcolm is visited by the troubled 9-year-old Cole Sear (Forrest Gump's Haley Joel Osment). He does not tell his secret for a while, but when he does, it is one of the iconic moments of the film, it was number 44 on 100 Years, 100 Quotes, ""I see dead people"". It is because of this he is a freak in school, and his mother Lynn (Toni Collette) is very concerned about his increasing problems. Malcolm is now trying to find out whether he is seeing things or not, and trying to rekindle his relationship with wife Anna Crowe (Olivia Williams). Also starring Saw II's Donnie Wahlberg as Vincent Gray, Glenn Fitzgerald as Sean, young Mischa Barton as Kyra Collins and Jurassic Park III's Trevor Morgan as Tommy Tammisimo. The film has a great conclusion as well with Cole's mother weeping at the idea of Cole seeing his Grandma, and Malcolm finding out why his wife has been ignoring him for so long, he wasn't wounded in that gunshot, he died. It was number 60 on 100 Years, 100 Thrills, and it was number 33 on The 100 Greatest Scary Moments. Very good!",The Sixth Sense
10,ccthemovieman-1,Still Very Good Even When You Know The Ending,9,8 November 2006,"This was hyped big-time when it came out and, if memory serves me, was a good conversation piece among those who saw it at the theater.I didn't see it for a few years afterward, on tape and now on DVD. It was very good but I didn't find it as ""the greatest movie ever"" as some did. It is an involving story, however, and I've come to appreciate it more with multiple viewings. I've seen it three times, the last one looking for mistakes to disprove the surprise ending....but couldn't find any. The filmmakers covered their tracks. However, a couple of scenes were misleading. Those who have seen this movie know what I'm talking about. For those who haven't, I'm not going to spoil it here.I enjoyed both Bruce Willis and Haley Joel Osment as the two leads. Willis has had many action-packed, profane macho roles in his career but I like him best when he's low key, as he is in here (and in ""Unbreakable,"" to name another fairly-recent movie) The story is slow-paced but it sure is not boring. In a way, it's nice to see a slower-paced film be a big hit, as this was.Osment, meanwhile, is a terrific child actor, as he has proved in other films. He's simply one of the best of his young generation. He and Dakota Fanning are the two best child actors I've seen in many years.This isn't just some supernatural-horror movie. It's a nice human interest story. There is one scene late in the movie in which Osment's mom is having a talk with her young boy in the car. It is an extremely touching scene that brings tears - a great moment in the film.",The Sixth Sense
11,rmax304823,Sluggish supernatural mystery.,4,21 February 2007,"I realize this film had many good reviews. That's why I bought it. But it somehow managed to get by me without hooking me in. Its lack of impact had little to do with the acting, which is pretty good all around. Toni Collette is especially noteworthy. And Willis gives what is for him a subdued performance except, I have to say, that when he tries to grin with happiness or gets misty eyed with love, something within me begins to churn. The kid, Osment, is okay. Thank God he's not a cutie-pie.The direction is deliberate but effective, supported by a semi-somnolent score that throws in a sting from time to time, as when the first ghost appears briefly, to wake the audience up.The plot, alas, is a mish mash of overly familiar themes. Is it RIGHT to try to cure a kid who seems to know more than we do? (Cf., ""Equus."") Even if the kid is frightened by the ""dead people"" he sees, who sometimes scream at him and scratch him? (Cf., ""The Shining."") How come the kid speaks Latin? (Cf., ""The Exorcist."") Or is this the momentary hallucination of someone who is dying? (Cf., ""Incident at Owl Creek Bridge,"" or ""Point Blank."") Who are these ghosts anyway? Why do they taunt the kid? Why does he see only tortured ones, people who have been hanged, poisoned, killed in car accidents, shot in the belly, or who slashed their wrists? Do they see each other? Do they eat and excrete? They seem to have the power to move objects in their environment. They can steal bumblebee pendants or scratch the kid. They can, to give a more specific example, shove a box containing an incriminating tape out from under a bed and ask Osment to show the tape to their bereaved father. Well then why can't they themselves give Dad the box? Or leave it where he's bound to find it? If someone has done them dirt why must they use Osment as the middleman? Why not just kick ass? Oh, and a final question. By the end of the film we know why Osment finally spills the beans to Willis, but why on earth hasn't he told his mother about it a long time ago? ""I'm ready to communicate with you,"" he tells her solemnly when they're trapped in a traffic jam. Well, why now?There is one way, though, in which the plot is cleverly constructed. In fact, the surprise revelation seems to have been thought of first and the entire movie structured around this anagnorisis. Yes, the story is as full of holes as a slice of Emmenthaler cheese but the whole point is the onion soup beneath. That climactic twist is a big relief in another way. Now we know why nobody wants to talk to Bruce Willis except Osment. And it's not his aftershave lotion.It's a pretty gloomy picture actually, awfully low key, though the photography of Philadelphia is engaging. Willis and his wife, Olivia Williams, are shown admiring an award he has just won, as the film opens. They're drinking wine and joking about Dr. Seuss, but even then there's no exhilaration on the screen.However, people seem to have given this film a cornucopia of plaudits so the weakness may be mine rather than the story's. There is no statistically significant difference between women and men in the user ratings -- he said confidently after merely eyeballing the results. I would have predicted a greater appeal for women. Maybe you'll get more out of it than I did.",The Sixth Sense
12,Tweekums,A classic chiller,9,22 April 2015,"Dr Malcolm Crowe is a happily married, successful child psychologist, of course he isn't entirely successful and one of those children he couldn't help changes his life for ever when he breaks into Dr Crowe's house and shoots him before committing suicide. Some time later Dr Crowe has another young patient; a troubled boy named Cole; a boy with a secret. Cole reminds Crowe of the patient he failed; this time he is determined to succeed. At first he doesn't know what is troubling Cole; he suspects abuse but he has a loving mother and there are no other obvious suspects and there is definitely something strange about the boy; he knows things he should not know mostly things involving people who died in unpleasant circumstances. That is Cole's secret; he sees dead people! Will Dr Crowe or anybody else be able to help him cope with his situation?I doubt many people have managed to avoid this films main twist however just in case somebody has I won't spoil it here. The story is well told with details being drip fed to the viewer rather than everything being explained at once; indeed the 'I see dead people' revelation doesn't come until the film has almost reached the half way point. Bruce Willis is on top form as Dr Crowe but it is young Haley Joel Osment who dominates the film as Cole; a character who is gentle, somewhat troubled and at times more than a little creepy. The support cast, which includes Toni Collette as Cole's mother and Olivia Williams, who plays Dr Crowe's wife put in solid performances in their smaller roles. While this isn't a horror film there are some chilling moments but none too disturbing. Writer/director M. Night Shyamalan did a great job in what is probably still his best film it is certainly the best of the ones I've seen. Overall I'd definitely recommend this; even if you've seen it before or know the twist it is worth watching as there new things to be spotted when you know certain facts.",The Sixth Sense
13,ma-cortes,Stunning drama with horrifying and hair raising images and wonderfully directed by Shyamalan,7,2 November 2007,"The film focuses a child psychologist named Doctor Malcolm(Bruce Willis).One night, when the doctor and his spouse(Olivia Williams)find themselves their home, they are visited by a nutty patient and the tragedy take place. More later, the Doctor sees a traumatized young boy named Cole(Haley Joel Osment), he communicates with dead people who don't know they are dead. Cole's mummy(Tony Colette)is worried about her terrified son's nightmares ,increasing problems and episodes of acting out. Because of this, Cole is named geeky in the college where appear various dead people who ask his help.The film provides creepy scenes, a well-knit drama, grisly terror when the living dead appear and suspenseful throughout.The flick contains the more famous plot twist from cinema history, because the ending leads to a breathtaking and unexpected outcome on what's happened before. For that reason , gets a highly original and imaginative script by Night Syamalan,-also director and secondary actor, as usual in his films-, and has been copied and imitated several times, such as, ¨Stir of Echoes¨(David Koepp) and ¨The others¨(Alejandro Amenabar). Acting by main actors is top notch, Bruce Willis is magnificent as restrained psychologist and Haley Joel Osment is awesome as traumatized little boy, carrying the movie on his frail shoulders; furthermore, appear future promising actors as Mischa Burton(OC) and Trevor Morgan . Mysterious and sinister cinematographic atmosphere is well made by Tak Fujimoto and eerie soundtrack by James Newton Howard, both are Shyalaman's usual collaborators. The motion picture is produced by famed Frank Marshall and Kathleen Kennedy(Spielberg's producers) and stupendously directed by M. Night Shyamalan.",The Sixth Sense
14,BA_Harrison,M. Night's masterpiece.,10,16 September 2013,"Watching The Sixth Sense for the first time is a seriously creepy experience topped off with one hell of a clever twist. Subsequent viewings might lack the same level of spookiness, and prior knowledge of the ending robs the film of its novelty factor, but hindsight still makes for a very interesting watch: knowing the twist means that the viewer sees the film from a different viewpoint, paying particular attention to the details, thereby driving home what a superb film this is, writer/director M. Night Shyamalan clearly having gone to great pains to ensure that all possible plot-holes can be satisfactorily explained.Bruce Willis, taking a break from his usual tough-guy action roles, is excellent as child psychologist Dr. Malcolm Crowe, but the star's thunder is stolen by 11-year old Haley Joel Osment as Cole Sear, the child who can see dead people, who puts in an amazingly assured and thoroughly believable performance for one so young. Also making an impression are Toni Collette as Cole's concerned mother Lynn and Olivia Williams as Anna Crowe, Malcolm's wife.Sadly, M. Night Shyamalan has earnt himself a pretty rotten reputation as a film-maker in recent years thanks to succession of box-office flops, but don't let that put you off checking out this wonderful film.",The Sixth Sense
15,moonspinner55,"Polished, efficient, derivative, inert...",6,26 March 2006,"Bruce Willis looks appropriately grim throughout thriller about a child psychologist who attempts to help a troubled young boy who claims to see ghosts. Surprisingly popular other-worldly yarn (surprising because the film is so old-fashioned), it goes to sometimes hokey means to get a scare out of the audience, but is nevertheless very well-made and engrossing. Written and directed by M. Night Shyamalan, the picture is low-keyed, somewhat ambitious, but not very delicate, with plot-holes and moments where there seems to be no driving force behind the narrative; for such a deliberately-paced movie, Shyamalan doesn't show much grace, only technical finesse. ""The Sixth Sense"" is like a good ""Night Gallery"" episode: occasionally suspenseful, with solid, non-showy performances, but with the general feeling that we've been down this road before. **1/2 from ****",The Sixth Sense
16,dbdumonteil,I see dead people....,8,17 January 2003,"Here comes Bruce Willis again in the skin of a rescuer! But unlike ""the fifth element"" and ""armageddon"", he mustn't save the whole wide world. Neither, must he save a group of persons from a terrorist threat as it was the case with ""die hard. No, he simply must save a little boy called Cole, haunted by morbid visions and Willis, a reputable psychologist tries hard to heal him... With ""fight club"" and ""the blair witch project"", ""the sixth sense"" ranks among the best movies made in 1999. It also ranks among the movies that you must watch several times before really appreciating it. If you're watching this movie for the first time, you might be disappointed because there are numerous details that can escape your attention and however, they are important for the development of the story. The same thing can also be said for a few scenes, especially the one when Willis is in a restaurant with his wife facing him... Because the main strength of the movie is its screenplay. Rarely, a movie has been so well served by a watertight screenplay. It's disconcerting, disturbing and however perfectly coherent. For a long part, the movie is a beautiful ""trompe l'oeil"". On another hand, it's a pleasure to see Bruce Willis get out of his usual roles where he mostly plays the he-man. In ""the sixth sense"", it's obvious that he's between the hands of a conscientious and well-organized director. But he isn't the main center of the movie. This place goes to Haley Joel Osment. His performance in the role of a tormented and neurotic boy is extraordinary. Besides, he can be considered as a faraway cousin of Danny, the little boy in Kubrick's ""shining"" because they've got a common point: an odd power supernatural and all in all, the dead people who haunt Cole aren't so terrible as they look like: they're simply asking him for help... At the end, a fascinating movie held up by two great actors.",The Sixth Sense

Night Shyamalan's The Sixth Sense is the best thriller of the year because it has an old fashioned ghost story put in with today's modern thriller.

21,sunwarrior13,The Sixth Sense Deserves The Highest Rating,10,19 October 2012,"The Sixth Sense is a psychological horror film that features Bruce Willis,Haley Joel Osment and Toni Collette. Added to that,it was written and directed by M. Night Shyamalan.The movie tells the story of Cole Sear, a troubled, isolated boy who is able to see and talk to the dead, and an equally troubled child psychologist who tries to help him that established Shyamalan as a writer and director, and introduced the cinema public to his traits, most notably his affinity for surprise endings.Dr. Malcolm Crowe is a child psychologist whose new patient has a problem far outside his usual area of expertise. Cole Sear is six-years- old and claims to see the spirits of dead people all around him. It seems that Cole has psychic powers and can channel the ghosts of those who were troubled. Cole doesn't understand his powers, and he has little control over them; he's constantly terrified by what he sees, and Dr. Crowe is the only one with whom he feels he can share this secret. However, as the doctor digs deeper into Cole's strange powers, it leads to strange and unexpected consequences for both of them.An excellent premiere for new director as he packs a punch with a great story, excellent directing, a great cast, great performances, and a surprise ending that will leave you breathless for days on end. Osment is excellent, as is Bruce Willis, as a melancholy child psychologist scarred by his failure with a similarly haunted youth, and Toni Collette, as the boy's fiercely loyal mother.It was a twisty ghost story with all the style of a classical Hollywood picture but all the chills of a modern horror flick that deserves the highest rating.",The Sixth Sense

23,hitchcockthelegend,The Sixth Sense phenomenon.,10,25 May 2008,"Child psychiatrist Malcolm Crowe takes on the case of a deeply troubled boy named Cole Sear. At first Cole is reluctant to be helped, but as Malcolm gets closer to the boy, Malcolm learns the root of Cole's fears, he claims he sees ghosts.The Sixth Sense was a monster hit back in 1999, a deftly crafted ghost story with a kicker that was talked about by all and sundry, the box office bulged and the critics did rave. Nowadays you will find hundreds of people proclaiming that the film is boringly formulaic, that they worked out the film's premise easily in the first quarter of the film, or that the film is a mere cliché, funny how I don't remember it like that back in 1999! The box office bulged because many went to see the film more than once, they went (myself included) back to see just how director M. Night Shyamalan (Academy Award Nominated Best Director) managed to bluff us and pull the rug from under our feet. I remember vividly both times I saw it in the cinema, the crucial turning point of the piece bringing a collective audible gasp from the viewers sunken in their respective seats, that's the sort of impact that carries a film's reputation far and wide, and that's the reason why I will never rate the film lower than 10/10.Repeat viewings of The Sixth Sense obviously dim its star appeal because we know the tricks of the directors trade, but the film still ranks to me as one of the best of its type for so many other reasons rarely mentioned. The writing from Shyamalan (Academy Award Nominated Best Screenplay) is surprisingly complex, the piece masquerading as a horror picture is emotionally charged, linking children with the paranormal through loss and a need for understanding, the need for closure of unresolved differences, but chiefly and crucial to the film's heart is the message of connection before it's too late.The performances are incredible, Bruce Willis as Malcolm Crowe is perfectly understated, all the pointers for the denouement are there for us to see, but such is the actors performance, and we now know he is cutely having to play his cards close to his chest, are hidden from us until the revisit of the picture reveals it all. Hayley Joel Osment (Academy Award Nominated Best Supporting Actor) is wonderful, for a child performance in a film of this type to not be over sentimental, is quite an achievement. Sympathetic Cole may be, but Osment never lets it become less than the accepted level of child vulnerability. Rounding out the great trio of leads is Toni Collette (Academy Award Nominated Best Supporting Actress) as Cole's mother, Lynn, fabulous in portraying the love and confusion in Cole's troubled world, this story arc between the two is expertly realised. The direction from Shyamalan is very restrained, forgoing out and out shock value for periods of disquiet, he uses sounds to make the audience sense the unease unfolding in this creepy tale, while his camera work, full of draw ins and pull outs-and subtle side shifts, is adroitly in tone with the narrative. The score from James Newton Howard flits beautifully between the uneasy periods and the sustained moments of query, while Tak Fujimoto's cinematography puts a gorgeous funereal texture over this part of Philadelphia.If you haven't seen it then don't believe the naysayers, because The Sixth Sense deserved every penny/cent it made, its a wonderful, creepy, and yes, at times, a beautiful picture. A film that still ranks as one of the best ghost stories ever crafted. 10/10",The Sixth Sense
24,Theo Robertson,I Knew The Ending Before I Saw The Film .....,7,2 February 2003,".... but strangely enough that didn`t stop me from enjoying it . This even more surprising because I found the start of the film slightly tedious with its shots of city streets and the close ups of characters faces which kept reminding me of the work of Stanley Kubrick , a director I`m not at all keen on . But THE SIXTH SENSE is a haunting film with more than a few spooky atmospheric moments . The more I think about it the more I like it . Here`s hoping that the critics are wrong when they say that M Night Shyamalan is a one trick pony",The Sixth Sense
25,Doylenf,"Puzzling, absorbing, good twist as the final touch...",6,16 September 2006,"To fully accept the premise of THE SIXTH SENSE, you first have to accept BRICE WILLIS as a prominent child psychologist after seeing him in all those DIE HARD films. He goes from an action star to an intense doctor absorbed with a child patient (HALEY JOEL OSMENT) who claims he can see the dead.Struggling professionally after a maniacal ex-patient has shot and wounded him in the heat of rage, the psychologist is determined to help Osment from going off the deep end the way his former patient did. That is the crux of the story.It involves flashbacks, flash forwards and all kinds of camera tricks to keep you guessing how it's all going to end, since the big hype about the film was that it had a twist ending. Well, it was a surprise to me--but now, years later, after seeing so many films of this ilk which are obviously copycat types that deal with ghosts or the supernatural--I'm not so sure I'd be fooled so easily again.However, a surprise it was for me and it's done so cleverly that you'll want to revisit the film to see just how the trickery was managed.BRUCE WILLIS cannot quite do away with the smirk he had as the anti-hero in many a film, so I have to reserve some criticism for his performance. But it doesn't matter since the film revolves around the dark secrets and behavior of HALEY JOEL OSMENT, very good child actor who manages to keep the plot believable and interesting.Absorbing thriller, even if it starts out a little slowly and doesn't really build up its suspense in a taut way. But that ending is clever!",The Sixth Sense
26,poolandrews,A fine horror film.,7,27 September 2006,"The Sixth Sense is set in Piladelphia where child psychologist Dr Malcolm Crowe (Bruce Willis) & his wife Anna (Olivia Williams) are enjoying a quiet evening in when one of Malcolm's former patients Vincent Grey (Donnie Wahlberg) breaks into his house & shoots him... Jump forward to 'The Next Fall' & Malcolm has a new patient, a young troubled boy named Cole Sear (Haley Joel Osment) who is withdrawn, isolated & seems unhappy. As Malcolm befriends Cole & earns his trust Cole confesses a shocking secret that may well have a great impact on Malcolm himself...Written & directed by M. Night Shyamalan The Sixth Sense was a huge hit back in '99 with 6 Oscar nominations & it became only the fourth horror film to be nominated for best picture, as a film it is as good as ever. The script is somewhat slow & deliberately paced, The Sixth Sense relies on quality storytelling & strong character's for it's impact & entertainment value rather than the recent trend of Hollywood horror films that want to incorporate as many fancy expensive computer graphics as they can. The much talked about & often spoiled twist ending is highly effective especially if you are unaware of it. The character's are well developed & you actually care for them which makes the film what it is, the dialogue is good & I can't remember a single swear word in it. The Sixth Sense is a fantastic modern day ghost story that hits all the right notes & may even bring a tear to a few people's eyes. The only negative is that I don't like long films which The Sixth Sense feels like, that's not a specific problem I suppose as it's a personal preference that I just don't like long films as I lose interest very quickly & that's just the way I am so if your looking for explosions, fights & car chases every five minutes you'd best give this one a miss. When all said & done for what it is it's still a great film though.Director Shyamalan does a functional job, there's no flashy camera-work here but again this is a film which relies on good storytelling & character's that is set in the real world. Keeping things very low key works well. There's a good atmosphere & some pretty creepy scenes.With a supposed budget of $55,000,000 I don't quite know where the money went & The Sixth Sense doesn't look like it cost 55 big ones. It's flawlessly made & has great production values. The acting is fantastic & everyone puts in a heartfelt performance.The Sixth Sense is a great horror film, there's the odd scare, some great performances, an absorbing & engaging story together with a classic twist ending. Well worth a watch, definitely recommended.",The Sixth Sense
27,grantss,M Night Shyamalan's sleight-of-hand masterpiece,10,2 January 2016,"M Night Shyamalan's sleight-of-hand masterpiece.A child psychologist, Dr Malcolm Crowe (played by Bruce Willis), is shot by a deranged former patient of his, Vincent Grey. Grey then kills himself. A few months later he is counseling a boy, Cole Sear (Haley Joel Osment), who shows similar symptoms to Grey. He is worried that Cole will go down the same path. However, Cole has certain special, supernatural abilities...Great movie with a brilliant twist at the end. For the most part it feels like a slow-burning horror movie. Writer-director M Night Shyamalan, directing his third movie (though the first two were very low-key), expertly builds the tension and intrigue. The twist, when it comes, is so unexpected, but works so well and fits so perfectly with the plot. Even watching the movie a second time you are hard-pressed to fault how the twist fits in with the plot.Some great drama too, and quite emotional at times, especially towards the end.Solid performance by Bruce Willis in the lead role. Good work from Haley Joel Osment as the boy. Good support from Toni Collette and Olivia Williams. Osment and Collette got Supporting Actor/Actress Oscar nominations for their performances.Just a pity Shyamalan couldn't reproduce this form in any of his subsequent movies. His next movie, ""Unbreakable"", was good, but not brilliant. ""Signs"" was mediocre and ""The Village"" was okay, but not great. After that his movies were very bad - ""Lady in the Water"", ""The Happening"" and ""The Last Airbender"" were very silly and pointless. One keeps hoping for a return to the creative brilliance that was The Sixth Sense but, considering how his movies seem to get worse with every attempt, this may be hoping too much.",The Sixth Sense
28,Boba_Fett1138,An original new kind of horror movie.,10,28 July 2004,"With the coming of ""The Sixth Sense"" M. Night Shyamalan (how to pronounce it, I have no idea!) introduced a new kind of horror. The kind of horror that is more psychological than it is scary, although ""The Sixth Sense"" still has some good scares! The movie inspired many other movies like for example ""The Others"" with Nicole Kidman but also M. Night Shyamalan kept making movies in this new kind of horror style, movies like ""Signs"" and his most recent one ""The Village"".It's hard to say what it is that makes this movie such a masterpiece. It might be because of the superb mix of drama, thriller and horror elements. A thing why all these elements flow so well isn't only thanks to the directing but also due to the acting. Bruce Willis shows that he is a good actor and can also play a character without guns. Toni Collette is also good and warming as troubled mother but real discovery of the movie is of course Haley Joel Osment. He is more than just a child actor, he is a real actor! He really deserved his Oscar nomination for this movie and I wouldn't had mind him seeing winning it. Oh well, his hopefully his time will come, after all he is only just 16 now. The movie got nominated for 5 more Oscars including best picture and best director. The movie eventually went home empty handed, a shame because the movie deserved at least an Oscar nod.Already trademark M. Night Shyamalan element in a movie is the surprise ending. ""The Sixth Sense"" does have a good surprise ending, it's a kind of ending that makes you want to see the movie again after you finished watching it for the first time. Although not my favorite movie surprise ending of all time, it sure comes close to it!See this movie for the tension the drama and the surprise ending.10/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",The Sixth Sense
29,view_and_review,Best twist since The Usual Suspects,10,1 July 2008,Absolutely superb! This movie was excellently done. I am floored at how Shayamalan was able to keep my attention on Cole Sear (Haley Joel Osment) and his ordeal while the entire time the man who's trying to help him is a ghost. Not since The Usual Suspects have I seen such a twist at the end of a movie. This movie definitely had me pondering over it in its totality long after it was over. Along with the spectacular ending the movie was just spooky enough to keep me alert looking for what would happen next. It takes brilliance to make a movie scary without the use of rampant killing and bloodshed. The movie was just wonderfully done and the best way for Shayamalan and Osment to break onto the scene.,The Sixth Sense
30,evanston_dad,A Movie to Watch Once,7,28 June 2010,"""The Sixth Sense"" is really a film to only be enjoyed once. It's an effective little ghost story with one of the most famous twist endings in history, but the film relies too much on that gimmick, and without it, it doesn't hold up all that well.The movie is a cut above others in its genre because it devotes a healthy amount of time to developing its characters, and Toni Collette, who plays the frazzled mother of a troubled little boy, invests the film with a tremendous amount of warmth and emotion it would otherwise lack.It's far and away M. Night Shyamalan's best movie, as his dependence on gimmicky storytelling and his inflated ego have resulted in progressively worse clunkers.Grade: B+",The Sixth Sense

Bruce Willis stars as a doctor who is shot by a patient in the film's opening. Haley Joel Osment plays a kid driven to paranoia with visions of dead people. His widowed mother is concerned and protective. Osment believes that Willis can help him but Willis lost faith after he lost communication with his wife. All of this weaves together into a shocking conclusion of truth and discovery. Directed by M. Night Shyamlan who details the plot with surprising developments while hinting the obvious. Great performance by Willis as a man trying to piece together both his home and professional life. Osment is brilliant with a power he cannot comprehend. Toni Collette plays his frustrated mother who struggles to understand her son's trauma while being made to face her own. Olivia Williams plays Willis's depressed wife who ceases to function or embrace reality. Donnie Wahlberg has a brief but pivotal role as a disturbed patient of Willis's. Great suspense shocker full of spine tingling visuals and a narrative full of ideas. It raises questions about unresolved circumstances that numb our understanding and all our senses.

32,HotToastyRag,Iconic scary flick,6,2 July 2019,"Is there anyone who hasn't seen M. Night Shyamalan's masterpiece The Sixth Sense by now? My parents were extremely smart, knowing what a scaredy-cat kid I was, and didn't let me watch it until I was sixteen. I still screamed at the top of my lungs and ran out of the room. It's not the most upsetting movie I've seen, but it was at that point in my life.Young Haley Joel Osment, endearing himself into the hearts of every audience member around the world, is having a problem. He's struggling against the normal childhood bullies and getting along with his single mom, Toni Collette, but he also sees dead people. Sometimes they just scare the pants off him with their wounds, and sometimes they talk to him. Child psychologist Bruce Willis tries to help Haley through this difficult time, and the two bond. Since this movie is obviously a vehicle for Haley's incredible acting chops-although, you have to wonder why his parents let him act in such emotionally damaging roles-it's quite a feat that Bruce is able to shine as well. In the immortal scene when Haley tells him, ""I see dead people,"" both actors show off their chops. It's not just Haley's scene, because Bruce has to react to him with understanding, compassion, and trust.If you can handle it, this movie really is a classic that needs to be watched. I couldn't handle it, so I say to my fellow squeamish viewers, if you don't like the sight of blood, you're not going to like this movie. And whatever you do, if you've never seen it, don't talk about the movie with anyone or watch the movie 50 First Dates, as a critical plot point will get spoiled for you.Kiddy Warning: Obviously, you have control over your own children. However, due to scary scenes and upsetting scenes involving a child, I wouldn't let my kids watch it.",The Sixth Sense
33,AaronCapenBanner,Sight,9,15 December 2013,"M.

Later on, he is assigned the case of a young boy named Cole Sear(played by Haley Joel Osment) who claims to see ghosts which terrify him(and alienates him from his schoolmates), which troubles his disbelieving mother(played by Toni Collette) while Malcolm tries to reconnect with his wife(played by Olivia Williams). The truth of the situation will come as quite a shock to Crowe by the end... Chilling film with outstanding direction and performances(particularly Osment, who is superb) and a smart script.

Because of this, he is called a freak in school.Crowe, at first thinks he is seeing things, but after spending a lot of time with Cole (much to his wife's dismay), he discovers Cole may be telling the truth after all.....First things first, this is an amazing film, but it never has the impact on you like it did the first time you ever saw it.To be honest, I never knew the twist right until the very end, and it took my breath away. It was something that had never been done before, and 1999 this was classed as a Bruce Willis movie.But as you get older and wiser, you become aware of the massive plot holes that cover the narrative.How was Malcom discharged from hospital? How did he get Coles notes? How did Coles mother let Malcom in the house? How does Malcom feel about his wife never speaking to him? These are endless questions that could bug you, but you find yourself never asking them whilst the film is on because it's truly gripping.Willis is as excellent as ever, and the creepy sense of unease you get, is sometimes unbearable. The line 'I see dead people' always brings a tear to my eye, and it's a shame that Osment never really took of, because he is phenomenal in this.The rest of the cast are great, and the film can be very uplifting as well as scary, and this is the high watermark in Shyalamans career.Close to perfection.",The Sixth Sense

It is also a very somber movie with very little humor in it at all.  The color of the screen also seems to be somewhat grayed.  All in all though it is a pretty good film, but once I watched it once I wouldn't want to see it again.  I didn't really find the ending very shocking, but then I watched this one on video and not the theater so I knew to look for a surprise ending.  The story of the movie is that of a boy who sees ghosts and has other problems.  Bruce Willis is a doctor who wants to help him.  That is all I will say of the plot, because it kind of moves all over the place.",The Sixth Sense

Olivia Williams plays the wife of the therapist and Toni Collette the mother of the boy.Written & directed by M. Night Shyamalan, ""The Sixth Sense"" (1999) was his breakout film. It's a slow-burn drama with paranormal elements. When my wife & I first saw it we didn't know anything about the story except everyone was raving about it; and the ending really does elicit a 'Wow' response.Seeing it again, I was wondering if the movie works if you know the big reveal and it does. While the drama's a little tedious, it's refreshing compared to modern blockbusters with their idiotic explosions every five minutes. Furthermore, the film is aesthetically pleasing, which is helped by the unique locations (Philadelphia & areas nearby). Lastly, it is interesting to view the flick to see how Shyamalan was able to successfully hide the twist.The movie runs 1 hour, 47 minutes.GRADE: B",The Sixth Sense

38,zetes,I think the surprise ending hurts the overall greatness of the film,9,14 December 1999,"I saw this film months ago when it first came out, and I never stopped thinking about it. It is the only film of this year that deserved to make a lot of money (The Matrix and The Phantom Menace disappointed me terribly). It is unlike the rest of the movies Hollywood throws out. Unlike the empty Matrix and the Phantom Menace, the Sixth Sense is a character driven drama. It comes to a conclusion that no other ghost movie (that I've ever seen) has touched on. I think the film has a good chance to snatch up some Oscar noms. I think it deserves nods for script and definitely Best Supporting Actor in Osment (though he really is the main character, he is pushed to second string because of the bigger star). I wouldn't even be offended if Willis got a nom, seeing that this is his best film besides maybe 12 Monkeys and Pulp Fiction. Now for the ending that I mentioned in my summary. Most people will know about it this late in the game, but I won't tell. I think it pulls attention away from the true greatness of the film, which is the characters. It is what we were talking about after we left the theater, and I'm disappointed at myself for doing so. Sure it was neat, but I have gone through it in my mind several times, finding flaws within the film. Surprise endings are almost always detractors. If you remember a film just because of its surprise ending, it is a worthless film, just like The Usual Suspects, a very bad film if anyone would actually think about something besides the ending. overall 8/10, being a 9 originally, but losing 1 point for its supposed hook.",The Sixth Sense

Anyway the story takes place in the city of Philadelphia with Bruce Willis as Dr. Malcolm Crowe an award winning and well thought of psychologist who's assigned to a young man by the name of Cole Sear(Haley Joel Osment)who's a timid and confused eight year old boy who's clearly different as he can see things before they happen even seeing dead people. And Cole has a loving and tough single mom(played by Toni Collette)and thru it all this is a journey to learn what haunts the young boy and his life. As the film becomes a work of flashback and future seeing all while trying to throw it's viewer for a loop. I for one left after the viewing as to wonder and ask does the mind really play tricks on people during life, I think that's what ""The Sixth Sense"" tries to prove.",The Sixth Sense
41,MovieAddict2016,A very good modern thriller/horror with good acting(some possible spoilers!),6,4 May 2002,"M. Night Shyamalan's thriller 'The Sixth Sense' strikes a cord, being a very good modern thriller/horror with good acting a key a lot of thrillers lack.  Haley Joel Osment breaks into acting playing Cole Sear, a boy who we find out has a ""sixth sense""-a gift(call it what you may) that makes him se dead people. Bruce Willis plays his Psychiatrist, who is trying to help him as a way of making up for a past patient who killed himself. Not only does the film feature an edgy feel of mild horror, but also a touch of thriller, drama and even mystery. The chemistry between the genres introduces us, the audience into a new kind of movie.   Unlike cheesy horror/drama/thrillers before, 'The Sixth Sense' also offers us good acting, which even earned the 11 year old Haley Joel Osment and Oscar Nomination for best actor(which ended up going to Russel Crowe for 'Gladiator', a movie I personally thought was dumb). Bruce Willis also adds his acting skills to the movie, in one of his best dramatic performances ever. After this movie, not only did it boost the movies actors higher in staredom, but also the director, M. Night Shyalaman. Since I have seen his directing skills in films like 'Unbreakable'(which starred Bruce Willis and Samuel L. Jackson) and the upcoming Mel Gibson movie, 'Signs'. If you like drama, horror, mystery, and/or thrillers, you will thouroughly enjoy this movie. Although it's not one of my favorite movies, it is a great movie, with great acting and directing skills. If you haven't already seen it, rent it. 3.5/5 stars",The Sixth Sense
42,MovieAddict2016,Don't let a disappointing initial viewing turn you off...,6,11 March 2004,"Some movies manage to scare us, and some movies manage to move us, and ""The Sixth Sense"" is a film that successfully does both. It took me three separate viewings to finally realize the genius of it all. I was not exactly impressed after seeing it for the first time on network television, after hearing so many good things about it. Then I stumbled into a theater playing ""Signs,"" and I was blown away by M. Night Shyamalan's directing style, and I decided to revisit ""The Sixth Sense"" again and again--and finally, all in one viewing, everything struck me as a wonderful, perfect whole.The film begins ominously in the cellar of a dark house. We see Anna Crowe (Olivia Williams) wander into the basement and grab a bottle of wine. We follow her upstairs where she finds her husband, Malcolm (Bruce Willis), drunk on rich wine and admiring his newly-acquired plaque, given to him by the city of Philadelphia in honor of his work in the field of child psychology. He thinks it would look good on the bathroom wall.Then everything falls apart. Malcolm is shot by an old kid whom he failed to help. Some number of months goes by before we meet up with Malcolm again, as he walks down a street in Philly, watching Cole Sear (Haley Joel Osment). Cole has been having trouble at school. He seems to be haunted by something, but Malcolm is unable to place a finger on what's wrong.Then Cole tells him. He sees dead people. (""They walk around like they don't even know they're dead."") Considering Cole a sort of ""do-over"" for that kid he failed to help so many years ago, Malcolm makes it his personal vendetta to get to the bottom of Cole's troubles, and perhaps even face the most terrifying of all realities: the kid is telling the truth.John Travolta had ""Pulp Fiction"" and Willis had ""The Sixth Sense."" This film reanimated Willis' somewhat faltering career, and for good reason: it's one of his best performances. Sure, the fake wig gets a little tiring, but the mystery surrounding Malcolm and his interest in a patient will connect with most viewers. We're a lot like Malcolm, at first, trying to figure out what's wrong with the boy. Then, later on, we find out that we were really viewing everything through Cole's eyes.A major problem with movies about kids is that kids often can't act very well and rely on their cute, forced one-liners for audience approval. Not Haley Joel Osment (who was nominated for an Oscar due to this film). He actually acts, unlike most kids his age, which is refreshingly satisfying. He's no Macaulay Culkin--and I mean that in a good way.You may not be as scared by ""The Sixth Sense"" as you will be haunted. The movie connects with a primary fear of our inner psyches that we all experience starting as early as childhood: the supernatural. A realm where rules of the mortals do not apply. There's a sort of satisfaction in knowing that only so many things can happen in this world that we live in. We know there's a limit as to what can appear before us, or what restrictions apply. But anything could be possible in a separate realm, and that is what most supernatural horrors miss. They mistake true nail-biting fear for creepy images of ghosts. M. Night Shyamalan doesn't. He strikes a chord with the audience by respecting them more than that.Shyamalan is a self-confessed Steven Spielberg fan, and also admitted that Spielberg was a huge influence on all his films. I'm not too terribly surprised. Indeed, ""The Sixth Sense"" carries a sort of elegant structure that some of Spielberg's early features such as ""Duel"" and ""JAWS"" contained--some sort of majesty about the curiosity of it all. We never saw the truck driver; we rarely saw the shark (and when we finally did it was truly startling); and here the supernatural overtones of the movie carry a sort of otherworldly mystery that this genre often lacks. I can see how ""The Sixth Sense"" may have been ample straight-to-video effort. A kid who sees ghosts. It's not exactly brilliantly conceived.But its execution and surprise ending (that almost everyone knows about by now and few actually guessed ahead of time) are what make ""The Sixth Sense"" something more than just another supernatural thriller. It's more of a tender, subtle character piece with spiritual overtones. Shyamalan has created an eerie second presence in the movie that is a lot scarier than showing ghosts parade about. ""Signs"" wasn't about aliens. ""The Sixth Sense,"" despite what people tell you, is not *really* about ghosts. I think that's part of what makes it engage the viewer, and seem so very intriguing, even to this day. After setting a groove for films of the genre to later follow (and knock-off), ""The Sixth Sense"" stands strong and proud and strikingly different. You have to admire both its ambition and respect for the audience, two fundamental elements of which are often lacking in many of today's motion pictures.5/5 stars.John Ulmer",The Sixth Sense

45,KineticSeoul,Paved the way for other horror movies to try and emulate,8,18 August 2015,"This is the film that boosted M. Night Shyamalan career in the movie making business. When this movie came out it was a direct hit and brought something new to the horror genre. It was creepy, thrilling, suspenseful and yet still had that heartfelt elements. What I liked about this movie is how it didn't really on gore or jump scares to get the audiences attention. But because it brought that clever detailed build up that a lot of the horror movies now a days are missing out on. As a matter of fact this is a film that the whole family can watch without really offending anyone...Much. But it's still a really good film. The two main leads were the perfect match for this film. Bruce Willis's role as Dr. Malcolm Crowe was perfect. As a matter of fact I heard that Dr. Malcolm Crowe actually wrote the role for Bruce Willis. And Haley Joel Osment was amazing as an actor when he was little. Overall this is a great horror filmmaking and was a clever idea when it came out.8.6/10",The Sixth Sense
46,OllieSuave-007,A very average ghost movie.,6,27 November 2013,"This was a very average ghost movie about young Cole Sear (Haley Joel Osmont), who sees spirits of the deceased who do not know they're dead, and seeks the help of a child psychologist (Bruce Willis) to deal with his problems.There are some scary moments in this movie including the appearances of the wandering and pale-looking ghosts, and the part where Cole utters the classic line ""I see dead people"" while cold breath is coming out of his mouth.However, I think the lack of emotion in the film overshadows the horror elements, making this a pretty dreary movie at times. Most of the characters lack emotion passion and appear very wooden, except for Osmont's character. And, the plot was slow-paced and the cinematography was dull. I guess this is director M. Night Shyamalan's style, as other movies I've seen of his use the same elements. But, this style isn't really appealing.Again, overall, this is a very average movie.Grade C",The Sixth Sense
47,sddavis63,Definitely Watch This At Least Twice,8,29 June 2001,"I find this a very difficult movie to review, because everything in it is so tied to the surprise ending that to say anything at all about the story is virtually to give everything away. Believe me, though, that you have to watch this twice to really appreciate it. The first time I watched it I found certain elements of the story to be so confusing that they were distracting. I also noticed a number of plot inconsistencies that bothered me. In the light of the movie's ending, most of it makes sense (although a few plot inconsistencies are actually created by the ending.) In any event, I found ""the Sixth Sense"" to be far more enjoyable the second time than the first. Without giving the whole thing away, what can I say about this?The performances are very strong. Bruce Willis is excellent as Dr. Malcolm Crowe, the child psychologist seeking to help young Cole Sear with his visions of dead people. Sear, of course, was played by Haley Joel Osment. Osment put on an astonishingly good performance, and was well deserving of the Oscar he won as Best Supporting Actor. Also offering a strong performance in a supporting role was Toni Collette, who played Cole's mother Lynn, struggling to make sense of Cole's behaviour. On the down side, I found much of the dialogue in the movie was offered in rather hushed tones which sometimes made it difficult to follow what was happening. That, however, is a relatively minor criticism. I would rate this movie as an 8/10 without any hesitation at all.",The Sixth Sense
48,Buddy-51,solid suspense film,7,24 October 1999,"The concept of people who are able to see the dead has served as the foundation for any number of suspense films in the past, including the greatest horror film of all time, 1962's ""Carnival of Souls.""  Now comes the most commercially successful of such films, ""The Sixth Sense,"" which, although it does not begin to approach the quality of that earlier film, still emerges as a solid supernatural thriller that eschews graphic violence and gratuituous gore for understatement and thought-provoking creativity.Bruce Willis stars as a renowned child psychologist who has just been awarded a major honor by the city of Philadelphia where he works and lives. On the same night, however, a former child patient breaks into his house and shoots Willis while his terrified wife looks helplessly on.  Cut to a year later as a recovered Willis pursues his latest patient - a troubled child who harbors a terrifying secret: he is, for reasons unbeknownst to anyone, able to catch fleeting glimpses of dead people, whom the little boy argues, are not aware they are dead.  As Willis begins to slowly learn to believe the child, a warm relationship of mutual trust and bonding develops.It is this concentration on character rather than the more customary grue and gore that separates this film from so many other horror films of recent vintage.  Also, the director manages to create and sustain an atmosphere of slightly off-kilter otherworldliness through the use of visual correlatives: the eternally grey October sky, shots of creepy statuary or gloomy buildings caught at odd angles, a lyrical use of shadows, leaves blowing forlornly along an empty, windswept street, a glancing glimpse of a graveyard as it momentarily catches a frightened child's sight as he races by on a city bus.  It is these moments, taken as a tapestried whole, that give the film its cumulative suspenseful power.As to the film's widely heralded surprise twist ending, it will come as less of a revelation to those with a knowledge of such films as ""Carnival of Souls,"" ""Jacob's Ladder"" and ""Ghost"" from which ""The Sixth Sense"" seems to derive much inspiration.  Still, the audience does leave the film feeling that it has, at least, been in the hands of a group of filmmakers who respect its intelligence and have carefully thought out the elements of the narrative before rushing the production before the cameras.  In this day and age, that is a rare treat indeed.",The Sixth Sense
49,sol1218,Top Psychological Thriller; When the analyzer becomes the analyzed,9,14 October 2003,"M. Night Shyamaina's ""The Sixth Sense"" has come a long way since movies about psychological issues hit the big screen back in 1945 with Alfred Hitchcock's ""Spellbound"" and shows how much we learned about the subject since then. Dr. Malcolm Crowe, Bruce Willis, is on top of the world a success in his chosen profession, child psychology, and married to a beautiful and caring wife Anna, Olivia Williams. At the beginning of the film Dr. and Mrs. Crowe down in the living room drinking themselves almost drunk with wine. Celebrating Dr. Crowe being awarded the Mayor's Citation for Professional Excellence Award from the city of Philadelphia. Going up the stairs to the bedroom Dr. Crowe sees that the window is broken and there's someone in the house. When he looks towards the bathroom Dr. Crowe sees that the light is turned on and there's someone in there. Dr. Crowe trying to get the intruder who's very emotionally disturbed at ease by talking to him finds out that he was one of his patients that he treated who went wrong Vincent Gray, Donnie Wahlberg. Before Dr. Crowe can go any further Vincent pulls out a gun and shoots him point blank and then turns the gun on himself.The movie then jumps some six months later when Dr. Crowe recovered and back on the job is assigned to his first patient since being shot. He's to treat a six year-old boy Cole Sear, Haley Joel Osment, who's having problems at school and at home. Cole can't get along not only with his classmates and his teachers but also with his single parent mother Lynn Sear, Toni Collette. Cole withdrawn and quite and he gets scared and frightened for apparently no reason when he's looking at seemingly harmless people and places or at nothing at all. Dr. Crowe starts to talk to Cole as he tries to analyze him and to the Dr.'s surprise little Cole seems to come out of his shell. Cole not only responds to him in an unafraid manner to which he doesn't do to any of his classmates and teachers, whom he knows a lot more the Dr. Crowe, he also also confides in him to what his fears are. Young Cole has hallucinations that, as he tells a very interested and concerned Dr. Crowe, he ""sees dead people"". He sees them everywhere, in school, in the streets even at home. He sees them everywhere he looks and there are some that don't even know that there dead. Dr. Crowe at first feels that he's getting through to young Cole and puts all of his attention and efforts to curing him of his psychosis. What he doesn't realize is that the attention that he's paying to Cole is jeopardizing his whole life by neglecting his wife and his friends. As well any other cases of child psychological disorders that he may have to examine and cure in the future.You begin to wonder why Dr. Crowe is paying so much attention to Cole? Is it that Cole reminds him of Vincent Gray whom he failed so many years ago which ended with him being shot and Vincent killing himself. Is Dr. Crowe afraid that young Cole if not cured will end up the same way? Did that terrible incident at the beginning of the movie damage Dr. Crowe so severely that it completely wrecked his ability as a child psychologist to do his work and made him need psychological help himself? What really surprised me about ""The Sixth Sense"" was the quality of Bruce Willis acting in the movie even more then the already legendary, although it's been only four years since the film was released back in 1999, surprise ending. Bruce Willis carried the movie with an academy award caliber performance without a shoot-out explosion or car chase or almost any action at all which Bruce Willis movies are noted for. Willis played the exact opposite a role that he would usually play and excelled in it.You also have to give top acting credit to the young Haley Joel Osment who played the young boy Cole Sear who held his own and sometime even eclipsed Willis in every scene that they were in together. If ""The Sixth Sense"" showed anything besides being a top psychological thriller is that when Bruce Willis is too old and unconvincing to play action hero parts he'll still have a very bright future in films that would only require acting.",The Sixth Sense

51,ElMaruecan82,A Milestone for Psychological Thrillers and a Masterpiece of Suspense and Drama ...,10,13 February 2011,"The amazing climax of the 90's have enriched our cinematic knowledge with extraordinary movies, from the immersion into a parallel universe named ""The Matrix"" and the unforgettable heart-breaking ""Green Mile"", to the powerful social commentary of the pre-millennium consumerist society in ""American Beauty"" and ""Fight Club"", not to mention the resuscitation of the legendary ""Star Wars"" saga  and still, only one movie managed to get so rapidly and deeply rooted in Pop-Culture: M. Night Shamalayan's ""The Sixth Sense"", one of the most memorable movies of the last 15 years.What makes this achievement even more remarkable is that ""The Sixth Sense"" didn't use breakthrough visual effects contrarily to its contemporary films. It had quite a minimal cast, and a very sober directing, yet it managed to create a particular atmosphere that seemed to belong only to this new classic. I don't think any other horror film reached such a level of originality since the 1970's. Indeed ""The Sixth Sense"" creates the reminiscent feeling of Friedkin's ""Exorcist"" and seems to remind us how horror is one of the most likely movie genre to create unforgettable films, when handled correctly. I mention the 70's as the decade that preceded the slasher era which made gore so ordinary and laughable it killed all the purpose of a horror film, which is all about a psychological dosage of expectations and thrills. And this dosage works in ""The Sixth Sense"" : there's a whole feeling that something is going to happen, yet it takes its time, time for us to get into those characters, to discover Dr. Malcolm Crowe (Bruce Willis) the no-emotion child psychologist, and Cole Sear, the enigmatic kid who inherited a strange power, a sixth sense that looks more like a doom than a gift. The movie is renowned for a revelation featured in one of the most iconic quotes of the last 20 years, thus revealing this power is not necessarily ruining the premise of the film, but anyway, I will focus on the cinematic achievement aspect responsible of the extraordinary rebirth of the horror classic genre. And again, I think the comparison with ""The Exorcist"" is relevant since the movie approaches the genre with a long build-up in an ordinary family house setting, which gives enough time to approach the characters and their background, so we can identify with them. And step by step, the supernatural elements are patiently introduced, with an efficient timeliness, leading us to an unforgettable climax.The supernatural elements are perfectly handled thanks to the amazing Oscar-worthy performances of Haley Joel Osment, as Cole Sear, the kid who's not a kind of know-it-all smart kid or a whining victim, but an innocent doomed little boy, Toni Collette as Lynn, the supportive mother who suffers from the torments of despair and powerlessness to help her little boy and her struggle to bring back some ounce of normality in Coles 'life is particularly heartbreaking. The mother and son relationship is the heart of the film when the dorsal spine is Dr. Malcolm Crowe's back-story with Bruce Willis in one of his most underrated out-of-character performances as a mysterious doctor who tries to help and assist Cole in this painful experience, which seems to be a two-ways therapy inhabited by a profound will of redemption. Carrying the whole narrative structure of the film, Willis' job looks like a psychological investigation, that gives a movie a sort of noir feeling and the film is an intricate puzzle that respects the audience's intelligence by letting enough hints to guide us to the climax but not obvious enough to decrease the sensational aspect of the ending. The last minutes, the last ten minutes of the film are so emotionally rewarding that you can't help but feel like watching it a second time. It's one of the few films where the experience of the first viewing is so harrowing you can't perceive yet the intelligence and cleverness of the script, only after a second viewing.The script is certainly the strongest element of the film, too often overlooked in other horror movies, here it works because of the realism of the dialogs and the directing that makes the story scarily believable. The film would never have been so memorable if it only relied on special effects and cinematography: the viewer can be fooled by what he sees, but fooling him with words, with verbal interactions, with actions, looks and silences is a challenge that have been successfully achieved by talented directors like the master Hitchcock (""Psycho"" being the most obvious example) but the director was not Hitchcock, M. Night Shamalayan was a young débutant who would never have been thought to make a movie so iconic and so rapidly. Yet, if it didn't win the Best Picture Oscar, it definitely was the movie that impacted the viewers the most. No wonder ""The Sixth Sense"" made it in AFI's Top 100, as a recognition of the significance of the film and the revolutionary aspect it had on cinematic storytelling by paving the way for movies with long build-up and spectacular conclusions, an impact, even the director could not match it with his later films.""The Sixth Sense"" is a heart-pounding thriller like any other one has been made before. But don't expect countless deaths or disturbing gore, instead you'll have an extraordinary atmosphere, amazing performances and an intelligent script. Expect another viewing, expect some scary moments and some deeply emotional ones, and if you don't say a big ""Wow"" at the end, either this film has been spoiled for you, either you're one of the most exceptionally intelligent people that doesn't get fooled by little cinematic hints. In both case, it's unfortunate without prevent you though from enjoyment, because ""The Sixth Sense"" still works on the emotional level, thanks to the amazing performances of Bruce Willis, Haley Joel Osment and Toni Collette.",The Sixth Sense

But this must be the most understated entry ever in the genre, with its mood of quiet portentiousness and overwhelming solemnity.  And though the final twist is neat, its also very clearly telegraphed.  What saves The Sixth Sense is some fine acting, from Bruce Willis as the so-concerned psychologist, and Joel Harvey Osment as the child who sees ghosts.  It's very nicely done, but not so original.

Instead, the ominous sense of mystery created by the relatively slow and self-assured pacing; the mature and well-crafted scares stemming solely from our connection to the nuanced characters as opposed to obnoxiously loud musical cues; the layered and intelligent screenplay that dares to assume its audience is smart enough to understand what it is presenting; and the phenomenal performances that cement 'The Sixth Sense (1999)' as existing within a grounded reality - including what is arguably the best child performance ever put to film - are what make this emotional, gripping and complex drama stand out as one of the best horror films of the last twenty years. 8/10",The Sixth Sense

55,ThomasDrufke,No Re-Watchability,6,26 October 2016,"The problem with a film so synonymous with a shocking twist or an ending reveal is that there isn't much value to re-watching such a film. Sure, there are plenty of good things about The Sixth Sense, but I can't help but think without the famous twist, this movie would have been just your average thriller.Being a huge film fan, it was always hard admitting that I haven't seen M. Night Shyamalan's ""masterpiece"", The Sixth Sense. But because I've known the twist for years now, I had a difficult time mustering up the motivation to watch a film knowing its ending. I can't stand knowing endings going into the viewing experience. With that said, there are a lot of things about this film that are good, so I'm mad at myself for taking so long. But also keeping that in mind, I hardly believe this film was best picture quality, nor deserves to be on ""all-time great"" lists.Besides the twist, The Sixth Sense is perhaps most notable for being the coming out party for Haley Joel Osment, who plays a child with the ability to see and speak to the newly perished. He, Toni Collette, and Bruce Willis are the best things about this film. The performances alone make it worth the price of admission, with Collette being the clear standout for me. And Willis perhaps hasn't given as good of a performance since.The problem for me is that knowing the twist going in really tramples any sort of enjoyment I had. The ""thrills"" weren't all that thrilling and the plot seemed to never truly pick up pace until it was too late. That falls on the shoulders of Shyamalan and his directing. I feel like people were so enthralled with the late-game revelation, that they forgot how plotting the first hour and a half feels. There's a lot here I liked, but it's nowhere near the high praise that people give it.+Performances carry the film+Emotional connection is felt towards the end-Plot drags-No re-watchability6.4/10",The Sixth Sense

63,ironhorse_iv,Have some common sense. Go get the Sixth Sense. It's a horror masterpiece!,9,19 January 2017,"According to director/writer M. Night Shyamalan, the idea of making a horror movie about children seeing ghost; first came to him, while watching an old 1990's Nickelodeon show called 'Are You Afraid of the Dark: titled, 'Tale of the Dream Girl"" (1994), directed by David Winning. Hoping to capitalize on that success, he wrote and pitch a similar idea to studios as a kid movie, until rewrites made the script's subject matter, more mature and harder to sell. That's until, the most unlikeable of sources, came to him, looking to buy it, which was Walt Disney Studios. It seem that then-president of production, David Vogel read Shyamalan's spec script and instantly loved it. Without obtaining corporate approval, Vogel bought the rights, despite the high price tag of $3 million and the stipulation that Shyamalan could direct the film. While, Disney later dismissed Vogel from his position at the studio, and apparently show little confidence in the film value, by selling the production rights to Spyglass Entertainment, while retaining a few distribution rights and 12.5% of the film's box office receipt. They still greenlit the project and gave their share. Lucky for them, the film was the biggest jackpot gamble win of all time, becoming one of biggest box-office hits of the 1990s. The reasons, why everybody loves it, are very clear. The film's chilly astrosphere, acting, and unexpected twist ending are some of the best moments, cinema can give you. It was a very memorable movie from a then-unknown director. The story of redemption was also great, with 'Six Sense' telling the story of a once-prideful disheartened child psychologist, Malcolm Crowe (Bruce Willis), dedicated himself, by trying to cure a 9 year old boy, Cole Sear (Haley Joel Osment) from being traumatic by the spirits of the dead. Without spoiling the movie, too much, after watching this film the first time through without spoilers, it is almost impossible to watch it again without seeing obvious foreshadowing, during the second watch. Still, this movie has a lot of rewatch value. I love how the movie has a Hitchcockism/Kubrickism feel to it, as there was a lot of carefully devised storytelling, going on here with the visuals without using too much dialogue. Some great examples are, how the color red was prominent whenever the worlds of the living and the dead came together, follow by visible cold breathing and shivers. Wonderful use of foreshadowing. Added to the tension that is already brought by the wonderful make up effects, sound mixing and haunting soundtrack by composer, James Newton Howard. Another brilliant example of visuals using as foreshadowing, is how everybody's clothes seem heavy wore, their normal hair seem a bit grey/white, and how they barely interact with their surroundings. I like how the filmmaker were very careful, not to spoil the clues of the true state of any of the characters, too much. They were even worry that Cole's iconic, and highly quoted, revealed at the hospital might have spoil the movie for everybody. Lucky for them, most of the audience still, didn't see the twist coming. Another magnificent thing, Shyamalan does well is using reflecting surfaces such as glasses, mirrors, windows, and other reflecting surfaces for a slew of dramatic and thematic reasons. You really get to see, good examples of that, whenever, Malcolm is looking at his depressed wife, Anna (Olivia Williams). Nevertheless, perhaps the best shot in the film, at least for me, was the extreme close-up of the bright silver door knob in the 3rd act with a distorted image of Cole. It was both scary and clear transparent to a positive change. It's great to see, a horror movie, that doesn't end with a downer. Another great use by the director, was the idea of using long take to establish important character relations. We see this, compositional strategy, during the first official meeting between Cole and Malcolm. Not only, does it build a special bond between the two leads, but it gives the impression that Cole's mother, Lynn (Toni Collette) and Malcolm were perhaps are at the end of a conversation about him. Almost tricking the audience. Nevertheless, if they did talk, the dialogue would had been cheesy. As much, as I love, everybody acting, particular Osment. Some of the lines, they were given to say, were a bit silly. A good example of this, was any of the scenes with Lynn and Cole. Seeing them, argue and later, embrace in the car about a Bumble-bee Pen felt a little odd and humorous. It wasn't as intimacy as it should be for me. Still, Toni Collette has said that she was so moved by the emotional resonance of the story while filming, she did not even realize it was a horror film until after its release. Anyway, I think the scenes with Malcolm and Anna, had a more emotional impact on me, than any of the scenes with the Sears interacting with each other. Overall: While, the dialogue writing isn't the best and can be highly spoof by later films. Not even, the awful director cameo by M. Night can hurt this movie. Regardless of what you know, think of M. Night Shyamalan's work since this film. His first horror movie is often viewed as one of the best, and I have to agree. It's worth checking out.",The Sixth Sense

I give this movie 2 out 10. I never thought ghost stories could be boring till I saw this movie. Do not see this movie. It has good actors. And it was a waste of there time. Do not waste your time. And do not waste your money. Do not see this awful movie. It very boring. If you want to get scared see The Exorcist. Or see The Exorcist II. Do not see this movie. If you like ghost stories that are boring and all about having a twist ending then you might like this movie. And if you got scared of the movie. Do not see Ghoulies. That is not a very scary movie.

66,zkonedog,The Way Cinema Is Supposed To Work,10,4 March 2017,"Is there such a thing as a ""perfect movie""? If that concept does indeed exist, than ""The Sixth Sense"" comes about as close as possibly to taking that prize. It contains everything one could ask for in a film.For a basic plot summary, ""The Sixth Sense"" tells the story of young Cole Sear (Haley Joel Osment), who is prone to visions of dead ghosts and as such is not fitting in very well at school or at home. With the help of a very unique child psychologist named Malcolm Crowe (Bruce Willis), however, Cole is finally able to face his fears and begin to move on with his life.Since it is easier to come at this review from this angle, about the only people who WON'T enjoy this movie are those who only like the mindless actions of explosions, car chases, and flexing muscles. Not to disparage those films or their audiences, but if that is the only kind of fare that gets you revved up in the theater, then this one might not be for you.For everyone else, though, ""Sixth Sense"" is almost a clinic in how to make a movie that will keep the audience engaging in nearly every way possible. It is the kind of film that one cannot say too much about or risk major spoilers, but suffice it to say that it is filled with mystery, layer upon layer of plots, terrific acting, suspense, and a jaw-dropping finale that will have you rebooting the whole experience again very soon! Though perhaps not by a humongous margin (as ""Signs"" is excellent in its own right), ""Sixth Sense"" is the hallmark film from director M. Night Shyamalan, as it is the perfect showcase for the type of movies he enjoyed making.Overall, this film is easily in my Top Ten Films of All-Time mental list, and perhaps even encroaching on the Top Five. It is an absolute masterpiece in every sense of the word. If for some reason you haven't seen it, it may just fundamentally change the way you view cinema forever.",The Sixth Sense
67,Floated2,Supernatural tale with some Intensity,8,27 January 2017,"After many years, The Sixth Sense remains the film which gave M. Night Shyamalan his high praise and is considered by many to be his best film. The film bills itself as a psychological thriller, but it's really more of a supernatural adventure picture that will make you ponder and think about every little detail of your own life once after watching the film. Bruce Willis stars as a child psychologist trying to heal a young boy (Haley Joel Osment). The boy's affliction, he's always scared. And he has good reason to be.After several close paying attention to detail, though this synopsis is quite brief, more said would mean fewer surprises. And this is one film sure to surprise you. Rather, let's turn our attention to the horror factor. This film is not a horror film in the least, as there are no slashing and no scary pop-up scenes. Instead, it's the relationship between the psychologist and the boy that aptly carries the picture, that and the subjects of the child's ""sixth sense.""For one time viewers to watch this film as of 2017, it may feel as scary to those who have watched the film in its 1999 release date. Overall, the Sixth Sense plays great mind tricks but as a horror film, it is not. More so a mystery thriller with occasional jump scares (though are very brief)",The Sixth Sense

Directed by M. Night Shyamalan, with the participation of Bruce Willis (Dr. Crowe) and Haley Joel Osment (Cole).It is one of thrillers most successful nineties, covering topics that always consider interesting and which are recurring in films of this genre. However, Shyamalan's approach is innovative and different, because the main character is an absolutely skeptical individual. The film contains some scenes which eventually became famous, even scoring Haley Osment career. But one of the most interesting points of this movie is the ending, a surprising twist that makes the movie less predictable, as well as being one of the trademarks of this director.

69,TheMovieDiorama,The Sixth Sense exploits the helpless afterlife for an extrasensory psychological family drama.,7,6 April 2020,"""I see dead people"", confesses a young and vulnerable Cole. The iconic line of dialogue that surrounds itself with metaphysical delusions, connecting the supernatural with reality. He continues, ""they don't know they're dead"". Ghostly apparitions haunting the streets of Philadelphia, endlessly searching for resolution, realignment and reconciliation. Seemingly, no other soul has this additional sense. Only Cole, an unsociable fragile child whose physical harm and emotion distress fractures the familial bond with his exhausted single mother. Unable to confide in her, he befriends a determined child psychologist, Malcolm. Yearning to rectify the failure from his previous patient whom committed suicide right before his glazed eyes, Malcolm urges Cole to find a purpose for his cursed blessing and enable wandering spirits to achieve absolution. Psychologically mending his fear and the splinted relationship with his mother in the process.Shyamalan's legendary 90s supernatural thriller is often classified as a horror. Such a description diminishes the psychological exploration at the heart of this family drama, shifting the audience's perception entirely. 'The Sixth Sense', unequivocally, is an accessible insight into loss and deterioration. Loss of life. Deteriorating relationships. Weakened mentalities. A thriller that intelligently exploits esotericism as a plot device to strengthen its characters, almost reaching the adolescent depths of a coming-of-age tale.Arguably, the central narrative and focus is pinpointed on Cole and Lynn's fatigued bond, personally the highlight of the feature. The rapidly growing intensity as Cole's hauntings increase in severity, alluding to connotations of child abuse, propels both characters to better each other. Accompanied by two outstanding performances from Osment and Collette, whom essentially carry the entire story on their shoulders. Both actors enhance their characterised perspective of the situation, Cole with his frightening ability and Lynn who cannot comprehend her own son's vivid imagination. The exquisitely staged arguments and reluctant embraces become more tense, until their final scene together which just happens to be Shyamalan's most magnificently directed sequence ever. No score. No sound effects. Just a mother and her son understanding each other in a car, providing that much required context for familial strength. Sensational.Shyamalan surprisingly matches that quality throughout, with several one take sequences and innovative reflection shots to showcase his capabilities to the rest of Hollywood. These technical merits help entice viewers into the unknown, where Shyamalan then inserts his trademark plot twist.Yes, the plot twist of all twists. One of the most discussed, imitated and influential endings in cinematic history. The conclusive five minutes that would catapult Shyamalan's career into the stratosphere. Despite this being my first viewing, unfortunately Internet culture and general word-of-mouth revealed its twisted nature, undoubtedly lessening its impact. Regardless, the problem 'The Sixth Sense' withholds, is continuity errors. Without revealing the surprise (despite all of you knowing it by now...), certain conditions indicate when a ghost is within the radius of Cole, such as the temperature lowering to freezing capabilities. This condition is completely disregarded for the character the plot twist concerns, as is the absence of blood from the frontal wound. Shyamalan does his best to masquerade these obvious indicators to strengthen the shocking conclusion. Yet, instead of pushing me to exclaim ""oh wow!"", it made me mutter ""hang on, wait a minute..."". These subtle manipulations may seem irrelevant to the overall story, however undeniably places a thinly woven veil of deception over the viewer's eyes by disregarding its own rules.Due to the upkeep of this twist, the secondary narrative involving Malcolm and the reconciliation with his wife suffered from minimal onscreen chemistry. Willis and Williams were perfectly fine in the feature, yet their purposefully distant characters failed to provide any emotional surge and proved the primary plot as the more investable story. Oh, and only one jump scare was counted, so not bad at all!It's incredibly simple to understand why 'The Sixth Sense' was popular and successful amongst audiences. Its Hollywood thrills and ominous chills supplied plenty of atmosphere amidst Shyamalan's progressive screenplay. And despite the continuity errors and occasional artificial emotionality, it's one of those rare features that provides two completely different viewing experiences.

74,insomniac_rod,Watch the movie OBJECTIVELY and you may be shocked.,10,15 November 2004,"Make aside the Hollywood tones that have hurt the genre in the past, ""The Sixth Sense"" deserves a chance. The movie is not overrated, it has been viewed incorrectly. Most people watch it only for the hype it created but if you watch it as a HORROR movie you will get the director's message.ACTING. A surprisingly good performance by Bruce Willis. He's performance is very solid that you actually believe him. His contribution to the genre won't be forgotten, believe me. Hailey Joel Osment steals the show and gives probably the second best performance by a child actor in a horror movie (Linda Blair is still the best). The boy can make the audience feel his fears. Toni Collete also gives a touching performance. Solid performances this time.DIRECTION. M. Night Shyamalan's direction is stylish, classy, and creepy. The man knew how to create a scary atmosphere with dark settings and situations when not expected. Creative shots and camera angles support the good direction. The correct use of lightning and darkness is wonderful. This is a ""ghostly"" direction. Great job.F/X, SCORE, CINEMATOGRAPHY. -The f/x are pretty good. The dead people look scary. Shyamalan perfectly knew how a big part of the audience visualizes dead people. -Great score. -The cinematography is very Hollywood. It's perfect but very stylish for a horror movie. The ""Hollywood"" look doesn't helps the ""Sixth Sense"" in being 100% scary. Still it's pretty good.*SPOILERS* ""The Sixth Sense"" has made great contributions to the genre. Positive and negative contributions. First, it brought back the ""ghost"" sub-genre and in the best way possible. The story is solid and very well crafted. The events are connected perfectly and that's the main reason that the ending is ""that"" shocking. Many people say that this movie isn't scary, that the audience can guess the ending at the first half of the movie, that the plot twists do not impress, blah, blah. You know there's a lot of people like that...I bet that 99% of these people, if they watched the movie OBJECTIVELY; were actually shocked by the movie's ending and goings. The so called experts in the genre (most of them are obsessed with the 70's horror movies) can't accept the movie's originality and success. I'm not a big fan of these kind of movies but I accept it's an original horror movie with a great ending. The bad thing about the movie is that it served as model for many horror movies that try to create a shocking ending but fail miserably and disturb the audience. The ending in this movie is carefully planned, it connects all the situations perfectly with the scare factor. Unlike other movies that abruptly come up with a ""shocking"" ending that angers the audience (a la ""The Village"").The truth is that the movie is very original and offers something that no other horror movie had before (or at least it wasn't very popular and in the reach of the fans of the genre). The movie is not only about horror or scares; there's drama (a mother worried about her son), a message of respect to the phenomenons that science can't explain, and a message of life (the whole Bruce Willis situation with his wife). The movie is by no means scarier than the brilliant ""Exorcist"" but it's a movie that commands the new generation of horror movies. It's the reference to the late 90's horror and that's something that will forever mark the genre. It was about time for evolution.8.5/10 One of the best horror movies that catches the attention of the viewer since minute 1. Not many big budget horror movies can accomplish something like that. And it's harder to find them in this new century that seems to be making a a lot of damage to the genre.",The Sixth Sense

76,Anonymous_Maxine,The meaning of supernatural thriller is completely re-written by M. Night Shyamalan with the stunningly encompassing Sixth Sense.,10,9 September 2000,"M. Night Shyamalan returns to directing for his second effort after the disappointing Wide Awake, which he directed for release in 1998. His second film, The Sixth Sense, was a staggering success that rocketed Shyamalan to the very top of the filmmaking world. Bruce Willis plays Malcolm Crowe, a child psychologist who takes on the excessively challenging task of helping young Cole Sear (played with amazing skill by Haley Joel Osment), a boy who is cursed with the ability to see dead people. Complicating the plot is the fact that Malcolm once had a young boy as a patient with the same problem, and he was unable to help him, and he is now afraid that the same thing will happen with Cole. Every individual scene in The Sixth Sense is saturated with cinematic trickery, giving even the liveliest settings, a birthday party for example, a strikingly eerie feel. Because of that, even though the film is not non-stop relentless thrills and scares, it never lets the audience relax, which is one of the main things that make it such a good movie. Besides that, not only does the film avoid excessive gore and tasteless violence, it also provides the perfect premise for presenting the small amount of gore that it does contain. Cole is able to see people who are dead, and naturally he sees them as they look when they died. This provides for some seriously scary moments, such as when he is using the bathroom in the middle of the night and the woman walks by the doorway. Very simple, but coupled with the startling sound effects at that moment, this is one of the scariest scenes seen in movies in recent years.The Sixth Sense had a incredibly imaginative and original story, and it was presented with great skill. It has a certain quality that very few movies of this type have. Most movies try to keep the audience guessing (Wild Things), but in The Sixth Sense, the audience doesn't even know that something is amiss. Before the breathtaking plot twist, the ending is not even considered as a possibility. However, once the ending is realized, a number of questions begin to arise. (spoiler) How could Malcolm have lived for so long as a dead person without noticing anything strange? Wouldn't it seem strange to him that no one was able to see him since that one night when he got shot by his former patient? He couldn't possibly interact with anyone in the world of the living. And even if he could, why didn't his fiancee acknowledge him at the restaurant? I mean, assuming that he doesn't know he's dead. Questions like this are usually inevitable with a movie like The Sixth Sense, and I think that they could have been answered if the film would have gone into how it's possible for these people not to know that they are dead, even though the back of their head is blown out, or half of the skin on their face has been burned off. Do they just perceive everything as being normal? I don't know, but either way, despite trivial shortcomings like this, The Sixth Sense is a groundbreaking supernatural thriller, and you see something new in it every time you watch it. That's a rare quality that not many movies have. Don't miss this one.",The Sixth Sense
77,billcr12,A Good Mystery,8,6 July 2012,"The incredible hype surrounding M. Night Shyamalan as the next Alfred Hitchcock is a bit premature in retrospect. He has turned out to be another Orson Welles(Citizen Kane) instead. I wasn't crazy about Welle's so called masterpiece, and although I was entertained by The Sixth Sense, it is nowhere near my favorite films of all time. Bruce Willis is a psychologist who is shot in the stomach by a former, disgruntled patient. The guy then shoots himself. Months later, Dr. Crowe(Willis) treats a new patient, Cole, who has similar problems to the man who shot him. Cole tells him that he sees dead people. Through a series of events, the doctor is convinced that the kid does have a unique ability, and he tells him to use it to help others.

The tale is of a popular, but egotistic doctor (Bruce Willis) who sincerely believes in his award winning psychotherapeutic abilities and looks forward to a prosperous career with the mentally ill. But failing to secure a proper treatment for a suicidal patient, the doctor finds himself with yet another troubled, but far more mysterious boy (Halley Joel Osment) who possesses the power to communicate with the afterlife. Together they discover their own fears and a need for mutual understanding and trust. The film is a frightful combination of sights, sounds and illusionary symbols which creates terror and suspense with each new scene. The Director, like other famous movie artists, makes a cameo appearance and it up to the viewer to locate him during the unfolding drama.

79,freemantle_uk,'I see dead people',8,24 August 2010,"The Sixth Sense was the film that sky-rocketed M. Night Shyamalan's career and well, he hasn't been able to escape it since. Before hand he had made 2 films; Praying with Anger which it was rumoured that Shyamalan tried to suppress it's existence like Stanley Kubrick did with Fear and Desire; and Wide Awake, a family comedy that was a commercial flop. He also helped write Stuart Little before his big break came with The Sixth Sense, at the young age of 29.Dr. Malcolm Crowe (Bruce Willis) is a successful and rewarded child psychologist, but suffers guilt about a former patient Vincent Grey (Donnie Wahlberg) who breaks into his house. The next year Crowe wants to do right when he works with a 9-year-old boy Cole Sear (Haley Joel Osment) who suffers from the same symptoms. Both have major problems, Crowe is distance to his wife Anna (Olivia Williams) whilst Cole's mother Lynn (Toni Collette) does not know how to deal with her son who is anxious, isolated and considered a freak by other school children. But Cole's biggest problem is that he can see ghost who have suffer some of the most horrific injuries and harm the small boy, making him life of fear. Both psychologist and patient needs to face up to their demons.Shyamalan show he was once a writer/director of great skill and both a great supernatural thriller and a horror film. Shyamalan makes a dark tone and lit film with brilliant camera work: Shyamalan loves using single take shots with the camera either following people or moving around the room to give the film an unbroken, organic feel. It's a skill other great like Stanley Kubrick, Martin Scorsese, Darren Aronofsky and Alfonso Cuaron, so it is of course good enough Shyamalan. Shyamalan also blends together the supernatural element of ghosts with how people from the real world would deal with it, from a scared young boy and how to it damages his psychology, to school children who see him as a freak, to a psychologist who does not believe him. There are also real world issues involving crumbling marriages, bullying and a mother-son relationship. Shyamalan also delivers on effective on horror, from the psychological fear from a character we can care about to subtle scares involving ghosts running in the background. With Shyamalan's camera work and tone The Sixth Sense is better then most horror films.There is a great cast and they work with a terrific script. There are characters you can sink your teeth into. Willis shows he is more then an action star but also a serious actor and gave a good performance. Osment showed that at the time he was one of the best child actors around for his time. He gave a sincere, believable performance as a scared child and was deserving of an Oscar nod. But he was a weird kid. The actresses of the film were also good, both being very real in their performances.The Sixth Sense has an excellent, well thought out script with great ideas about people, family and the dark afterlife. This is clearly Shyamalan's best film and his career has been going downfall ever since. Unbreakable and Signs are still good films but he hasn't made a good film since.",The Sixth Sense

82,MaxBorg89,"A clever, gore-free horror thriller",9,16 June 2008,"Though many believe it to be true, The Sixth Sense is not M. Night Shyamalan's directorial debut (in fact, it's his third movie), but that myth holds up well because no one knew about him before this film. Not his proper first, then, but the first significant one, and deservedly so.Influenced by TV shows like Tales of the Unexpected and The Twilight Zone, Shyamalan crafts a slow-burning, low-key thriller that grabs the viewer right from the beginning: psychologist Malcolm Crowe (Bruce Willis) is enjoying an evening at home with his wife when he's suddenly attacked by a former patient (Donnie Wahlberg). Months after this shocking prologue, Malcolm's marriage is in jeopardy and he needs some kind of redemption for what he believes to be a professional failure. He finds that redemption in the shape of Cole Sear (Haley Joel Osment), a young boy with a terrifying psychic gift, best described by the kid himself: ""I see dead people!"".That line has been aped countless times since the movie's release, as has the now legendary twist ending, which has become a Shyamalan trademark. But knowing about the twist, or guessing what it is at an early stage of the viewing, is beside the point: it isn't the ending itself that matters, but the build-up. Consider other famous ""twist"" movies, like The Crying Game, Psycho, The Usual Suspects or Fight Club: the revelations at the end or halfway through those features are brilliant, no doubt, but if the overall film is bad it will diminish the epilogue's impact, no matter how smart the latter is.As such, when watching The Sixth Sense, the attention shouldn't go to the climax, but to everything that precedes it: how Shyamalan creates tension with very few camera movements, most of the creeps coming from James Newton Howard's score; how the story evolves slowly and naturally, enabling us to care for the characters and their inner struggles; how the subdued Willis and the creepy Osment constitute one of cinema's best on-screen duos, with able support from Wahlberg, Toni Collette and others (Mischa Barton's cameo is one of the scariest things of the '90s).The trick is in the smaller details, and that's what makes The Sixth Sense an immensely satisfying experience. Instead of gore and monsters, Shyamalan uses psychology and subtle chills to construct a memorably unsettling atmosphere, adding emotion on top. And, of course, the unsurpassed ending.",The Sixth Sense

84,estebangonzalez10,One of my all time favorite films,10,10 June 2015,"""I see dead people. Walking around like regular people. They don't see each other. They only see what they want to see. They don't know they're dead.""When asked what my favorite films are, M. Night Shyamalan's psychological thriller The Sixth Sense tops the list for me every time. I know he hasn't been on a role lately, but that doesn't stop me from having high expectations for any of his upcoming projects because I was deeply influenced by this film. Even his following movies, Unbreakable and Signs, rank among my favorites, and I went as far as defending his work in The Happening (which is a guilty pleasure of mine). His latest films have disappointed me, but I still admire his storytelling and the way he builds suspense in his films (he's heavily influenced by another favorite director of mine: Alfred Hitchcock). I'm looking forward to the release of his new TV series, Wayward Pines, which seems like a return to form for this talented director. But I'm even more excited about his upcoming film, The Visit, which will be released in September. I was 18 when this film came out and I had just passed my final High School exam so I decided to treat myself to the movies that night to celebrate. Up to this point I was simply a casual viewer of movies and enjoyed pretty much everything I saw. I had no idea about film criticism, and when I got to the theater I decided on The Sixth Sense simply because it starred Bruce Willis. I didn't know anything else about the film and was surprised it wasn't another action vehicle from Willis. The film had a very slow and creepy opening, but I was sucked in by the story and the building atmosphere. I was enjoying the strong chemistry between Willis and Haley Joel Osment as the pair were trying to figure out what was causing these freaky visions. There were several surprisingly scary scenes that made me jump out of my seat a couple of times. The score was deeply effective as well. I was hooked from the very opening scene, but I was not at all prepared for the surprising and revealing twist at the end that left me completely blown away and speechless in the theater as the credits began rolling. I was in love with The Sixth Sense and from that moment on I have not stopped praising it. I can't believe all the signs that Shyamalan leaves behind for the audience while he is telling the story, and we still couldn't see the twist coming. He practically has Osment spell it out in his famous scene with Willis. It was a movie I had to rewatch simply because of that twist, and the second viewing allowed me to appreciate the film even more by catching up on all the symbolisms and clues that the director left behind. In my opinion it is the best twist ever because you never feel cheated by it. I credit this movie for getting me interested in film as an art form, although the transition didn't happen from one moment to the next. The performances from Willis, Olivia Williams, and Toni Collette are all great, but Osment stood out, and it remains one of the best child performances I've seen from a Hollywood film.",The Sixth Sense

This is a well-told story about a boy  who `sees dead people', and is counseled by the Bruce Willis's character in an attempt to do better than he had done before with a similar child.  The best things about this movie are the pacing and the way the director moves us through the story and the performance by Haley Joel Osment as the boy.  Willis does his usual good  job, but Haley is superb. I won't give away the ending because I shouldn't, but in a way I'm kind of tired of surprise ending that throw the whole story out of sync and this is really my only real gripe about the movie.

It really kept me on the edge of my seat. I thought that Bruce Willis and Haley Joel Osment gave smashing performances as a disheartened child psychologist and a frightened little boy. If you ask me, the most memorable quote of this film is, ""I see dead people!"" THE SIXTH SENSE has it all. Mainly, it has suspense. However, in my opinion, this film was put together flawlessly. When the spirits showed up, that was my favorite part. It was my favorite part for many reasons. I'd like to close by saying, ""Parents, if you have young children, do not subject them to this film. They will get scared.""",The Sixth Sense
90,rooprect,"Even if someone spoiled the ending for you, it's still worth seeing",8,1 September 2014,"There are over 2000 IMDb reviews for ""The Sixth Sense"" so I don't think I can add anything that hasn't already been said. But in case someone has already spoiled the ending for you (like some dumbbutt did for me and the entire office back in 1999, causing me to avoid this movie for 15 years), never fear... it's still VERY MUCH worth watching.The cool twist is, of course, the main punch of this film. But it's the kind of film you have to watch twice. Once for the story and once for the poetry. So to all my fellow film lovers who happen to have friends & coworkers with big mouths, this film is still a real treat on a poetic & artistic level.M. Night Shyamalan is one of the few directors who deserves the hype and popularity he gets, at least for this film (I haven't seen any of his others but soon will). Everything is meticulously planned, every camera movement, every shadow, every color and every editing cut, almost to the point of obsessive mania. In the DVD extras he and his crew explain why they did everything the way they did; for example they do a lot of long takes because their philosophy was that rapid cuts tend to disrupt the viewer's thought process. So instead of showing a dialogue between two people in a volley of closeup cuts, the scene is done with 1 camera filming them from the side, slowly, almost hypnotically moving between both of them as it gets closer over the course of perhaps 2 minutes.I could go on for ages about such scenes, but you probably get the point. If you enjoy the classic directors known for their careful & deliberate approach to filmmaking, directors like Orson Welles (""Citizen Kane""), Otto Preminger (""The Man with the Golden Arm""), Kurosawa (""Seven Samurai"") or even the younger crop of great directors like Steven Soderbergh (""Traffic"") and Alfonso Cuarón (""Children of Men""), you definitely have to check out this movie and other works of Shyamalan.",The Sixth Sense

It is a really great drama with horror elements. But story doesn't make much sense. Firstly the plot twist was so predictable, the scene in the restaurant was so obvious that I can't imagine not being spoiled the twist by watching it. So, obviosuly all questions are: How didn't Bruce Willis notice he is dead before, like his wife never responded to him, nobody exept for boy ever talked to him. Also who hired him to check the boy in the first place, he was dead for quite some time.

94,slokes,Some Twists And Stuff,9,8 February 2007,"""The Sixth Sense"" is the first horror film I know of that also works as a tear-jerker. A ""creepy weepy,"" you might even call it; the darnedest thing about that combination being how well it plays here.Child psychiatrist Dr. Malcolm Crowe (Bruce Willis) is trying to recover his professional equilibrium after one of his most traumatic cases came to a fatal end. Enter Cole Sear (Haley Joel Osment), a young boy who struggles with his peers, is called a ""freak,"" and draws horrible images until he is called into a meeting about it. Now he just draws pictures of rainbows, not because his heart's in it, but because ""they don't have meetings about rainbows."" Underneath the surface, it's anything but rainbows for poor Cole.""The Sixth Sense"" has become a prisoner of its popularity the same way ""Titanic"" and ""Jerry Maguire"" have, marked for ridicule by those who think themselves better than the hoi polloi who made it such a hit. Even people who haven't seen ""Sixth Sense"" know its catchphrases and storyline, and with that familiarity comes contempt, especially as its director, M. Night Shyamalan, has struggled in recent years to repeat his success. In such an atmosphere, it's easy to overlook that the one thing that makes ""Sixth Sense"" so popular is that it's so incredibly good.The art of storytelling is at the heart of the film, the way it quietly unfolds at its own pace, pulling you in with eerie moments and occasional shocks to a place that gets deeper as you get closer. Cole explains at one point to Dr. Crowe that the trick to a good story is that it have ""some twists and stuff."" People who downgrade ""The Sixth Sense"" do so on the basis of the twists, which was what got the film so talked about in the first place. But it's the other ""stuff"" that makes ""Sixth Sense"" so lasting and compelling for its fans.Take it from me: I watched ""Sixth Sense"" for the first time just over a year ago. By then its much ballyhooed ""secret"" was out of the bag for me, just as it probably is for you even if you haven't yet seen this film. The film took me for a ride anyway, because of Shyamalan's soft-yet-penetrating eye; incredible acting led by Osment, Willis, and Toni Collette as Cole's mom; and its sentimental-yet-spooky atmosphere.Every scene is shot with a certain style that makes it compelling not just as horror but as a slice of life, and this constant balance makes the film such a marvel. Even as it slips out of everyday reality into the utterly fantastic, it does so in a way you never notice your feet leaving the ground. Moments of fright are alleviated with humor and warmth.Something else needs to be said of ""Sixth Sense,"" that despite its horror theme it's a positive, inspirational film, one that on its own terms gives ""Passion Of The Christ"" a run for its money in terms of connecting to the deepest feelings of many of its viewers.Yes, Shyamalan does gild the lily too much at times, tying up things that don't need tying up, and you can feel your heartstrings being tugged at a little too much at points. There may be a couple of minor plot holes visible on a second viewing. But still, at the very least the end result is one terrific piece of entertainment, and probably very much more.",The Sixth Sense

Either way, I guess you'll see it to find out what all the fuss is about.Haley Joel Osment is fantastic as the little boy whose sixth sense haunts him and singles him out as a freak. Willis, in his best role since ""Pulp Ficton"", is ideal as the troubled psychologist Dr. Malcolm Crowe, who tries to help young Cole and exorcise his own demons at the same time. In support is Olivia Williams, strong as Crowe's distant wife, and the amazingly talented Toni Collette; who does a marvellous job as Cole's distraught mom - even her subtle accent is precise.Much more could be added; suffice to say all credit to Mr. Shyamalan's finely tuned screenplay and his astute direction.

96,ferbs54,For The Benefit Of The Korowai And The Munduruku,8,4 March 2009,"Regarding the famous twist ending of M. Night Shyamalan's ""The Sixth Sense"" (1999), I will try to be coy here for the benefit of those who have just come out of a decadelong coma, and for those Korowai tribesmen of New Guinea and the Munduruku dwellers on the Amazon who may be unaware of it, but who may be reading this posting on their BlackBerrys (and in today's modern world, who knows?!?). For all first-timers (like me) who see the film fully aware of the picture's startling denouement, the question must be ""Can one still enjoy it with such a movie-spoiling foreknowledge?"" Well, as anyone who has ever seen ""The Sixth Sense"" more than once knows (and I can't imagine anyone seeing this film for the first time who would NOT want to watch it again immediately!), the answer is a resounding ""yes."" In it, Bruce Willis plays Malcolm Crowe, a child psychologist in Philly who attempts to help 9-year-old Cole Sear. Cole's problem, as he famously puts it, is that he sees ""dead people."" Anyway, the always likable Willis gives a nicely restrained performance here and, as ""DVD Delirium"" puts it, ""manages to keep his trademark smirk hidden."" And young Haley Joel Osment is superb as the troubled Cole, effectively communicating, with his whispered delivery, the fear that is his daily bread. The film is a quiet and understated affair, building suspense and scares through a gradual accretion of detail. It has been expertly lensed by master cinematographer Tak Fujimoto, and Shyamalan's direction is quite ingenious in the way it skips around the edges of the film's big twist while still playing the game fairly. By that famous ending, young Cole seems set to beat Jennifer Love to the punch as a ""ghost whisperer,"" while Malcolm comes to see himself for what he truly is. It's some brilliant stuff, and I for one wouldn't even mind a belated, latter-day sequel....",The Sixth Sense

This is great. The beginning starts off with complete darkness and no music and gives you goosebumps. You are immmediately pulled into great music(It's really good and catchy, and also very sad and dreary). It starts off with Bruce Willis(Malcom Crowe) and his wife (Olivia Williams) celebrating over Malcom being a good psychiatrist. A former patient is in their bathroom and shoot Malcom and then shoots himself. It goes to a year later and Malcom is miserable and meets a boy(Osment as Cole Spears) that has a horrible secret of talking to the dead. It has some scary moments and is groundbreaking. when it is at a slow part, it has scary music to make you interested. Just a great film that is very sad.

After gradually gaining his trust, Cole tells Malcolm his terrible secret; he sees ghosts all around him. But Cole also knows something Malcolm doesn't One of the most beautifully crafted and thought-provoking American movies in recent times, this is an unforgettably spooky thriller with a final twist of such deliciously clever proportions it rivals Les Diaboliques, Psycho and The Usual Suspects. What makes it so terrific for me though is Shyamalan's quiet, concentrated style; his film is the opposite of something like The Omen - it's slow, subtle, intimate, but highly focused and intense. A lesser horror movie director uses loud noises and screaming performances; Shyamalan doesn't need to. His story, characters and grasp of film grammar are so strong that pulling the focus down into long, loosely composed shots results in a much richer picture. Scenes like the one where Cole's mother loses her temper with him over the pendant are typical of this - one simple shot of a little kitchen, where what's going on emotionally carries a tremendous dramatic wallop. If only all directors as young as this guy understood how to do this. Similarly, the casting of Willis is a real masterstroke - an action actor known for barnstorming pyrotechnics reigned in here to a slight, slow, careful performance which is arguably the best in his career. Equally good is the amazingly mature Osmont (who was eleven), at once convincing us of his fantastic predicament but also grasping the tone of the story perfectly. The other crucial element here is James Newton Howard's tingling score, which slides around the wintry Philadephia streets, creeps up behind us when we're not looking and creates an almost tangible sense of fear and danger. Horror movie music is the hardest to write and the most effective when done well, and this is a classic case of how to do it right; Shyamalan has wisely secured Howard's services on all his subsequent films. This was a deservedly big hit on release, probably because it effectively combines horror, thriller and drama elements, and appeals to fans of all. In essence however it's just a great story, four fascinating characters, great photography (by Tak Fujimoto), scary music, and enchanting viewing. Trivia - the director appears in his customary small role as the doctor who talks to Cole's mother at the hospital.",The Sixth Sense
101,rbverhoef,Good,9,7 November 2003,"'The Sixth Sense' is a good movie but it depends too much on its ending. So much has said about it that the surprise there was less surprising. In my opinion a lot of people think about the surprise exactly as it will turn out, something that would not have happened if it was unknown that the movie had such a special ending. Of course I will not reveal it and I have to admit it is a great ending for a movie.There are some scary or exciting moments and the story develops in a pretty good way, but it plays a little slow. Some people will even say it is boring in some parts and I can understand that opinion. Other things make up for this. Bruce Willis, Toni Collette and especially the young Haley Joel Osment give some very fine performances, there is a creepy atmosphere throughout the movie and the direction from M.

102,truemythmedia,My First 'Discovered' Director,9,11 June 2019,"Obviously, there is no way for me to be objective about a film that was a part of my awakening as a cinephile, but it wasn't just a subjective emotion that made this film attractive to a young audience member like myself.The acting in the film is top notch. Haley Joel Osment and Toni Collette (Hereditary) both received best performance nominations at the Academy awards and both deserved them. Even Bruce Willis, in a very reserved role, pondering and silently observing, does a remarkably good job bringing a sense of the character's reality to the screen.Although the cast is small and upon re-watching, the film feels anemic at times, it is only when you know the story and are watching for it that you sense that we aren't seeing reality all of the time. I place the credit for that feat on the actors for creating expressions of these characters that would not allow you to think of them as anything except real people who were captivatingly interesting.The Storytelling is, of course, unique, or it was. Today, people may make jokes about the 'Shyamalan Twist' but at the time, it was a shock to end the film with a scene that made you rethink everything that had happened in the whole movie. To set everything into the story so carefully and precisely that people didn't see it coming was a feat, but to do it in such a way that you watch it a second time and think 'How did I not know? It hardly feels like he's trying to hide it,' is simply mind blowing to me.",The Sixth Sense

105,davidmvining,Much more than its twist,10,12 October 2020,"I have a thing against twists for the sake of twists. There's a certain desire in creatives to surprise their audiences, to give them the unexpected, and the plot twist is an easy tool to use in such circumstances. The key to a good twist is that it needs to not only recast the movie that came before it so that the audience has to re-evaluate what they've just seen, but it also needs to be naturally built into the story itself. That leads to a compulsion to hide clues that otherwise shouldn't be hidden, or to even outright lie (like in High Tension). The Sixth Sense is a film with a twist that very easily meets the parameters of a good twist because of a couple of major reasons.So, Dr. Malcolm Crowe is celebrating with his wife after having won an award for his tireless work in child psychology that, according to him, he achieved after having sacrificed time in his marriage. The evening is interrupted when a nearly forgotten patient shows up as an adult and shoots Malcolm before blowing his own brains out. Skipping ahead a year and Malcolm watches a new patient, Cole Sear, cautiously approaching him and getting to know him and gaining the boy's trust.The first half or so of the film is told almost exclusively from Malcolm's point of view. He observes Cole and tries to understand the child's emotional issues through his psychological lens, and that's how we see it as the audience. He's a weird, introverted kid with odd little behaviors like talking to toy soldiers in Latin in a church. He has scratches on his arm. He can't interact with other kids. It seems like an early version of schizophrenia.And then the movie gives its first twist (which was never really a twist for the audience since the reveal was in every bit of marketing) that Cole can see dead people. They're everywhere, all the time, and they plague his daily life. It's here that the movie really moves into Cole's perspective, splitting the rest of the run time between the two main characters, and we finally see what Cole sees. Horrific sights that won't leave him alone. He has no safe places except the church and a little shrine under red blankets in his room populated with stolen statues of saints.The first half of the film is a build up of character, showing us both Cole and Malcolm in great detail. The second half uses that solid base and throws the film fully into supernatural thriller territory as we get deeper into the mind of Cole as we watch him deal with the dead that surround him, but we also see Malcolm working towards his own healing, making up for his failing with the patient from the beginning of the film by helping Cole find his own ability to work with his curse.That very strong base in character is what makes the final twist work even after multiple viewings. Perhaps some of the tricks used by the film to imply a certain reality that is not true become a bit more obvious for the viewer, who's supposed to be tricked in those moments. However they still work for the characters themselves. The movie intelligently uses the tools of cinema to place characters in situations without any real explanation, implying interactions that never actually happen, and act like it's cutting out the beginnings of scenes, a common modern cinematic practice.Can you remember when Bruce Willis gave meaningful performances? It's been about twenty years, but it did happen, and his performance as Dr. Malcolm Crowe shows that the man really did have acting talent at one time. Haley Joel Osment got all of the acting attention at the time, even getting nominated for an Oscar with this performance, and he is really remarkable. The quivers of his lips as he tries to explain things sells a character in abject fear of what he's saying. I think, however, the real unsung hero of The Sixth Sense is Toni Collette as Cole's mother, Lynn. She's a working mother with questionable tastes in fashion, and she's near the end of her rope. Her husband left her, her son seems crazy, and she's barely surviving financially. When Cole finally reveals his secret to her with details he received from Lynn's deceased mother, her breakdown is restrained and affecting all at once.M. Night Shyamalan had made two films before this, his breakout, and just about no one has seen either. His first two don't reflect the later obsessions, as far as I know (I'll watch them eventually), but The Sixth Sense shows all of his strengths and even some of his weaknesses, though they don't feel like weaknesses without the context of his later films. The twists are well built and feel like intelligent approaches to characters. The characters have very definitive quirks. The quiet of the first half is done to help focus the audience and build a sense of unease. The scares of the second half are really reliant on atmosphere because outside of that the sights aren't actually that scary, but in context they are quite effective. With some of Shyamalan's later issues, it's amazing to see how thin of an edge's knife The Sixth Sense dances on. One step too far in several different areas, and the whole exercise could have come crashing down.As it stands, though, The Sixth Sense is in almost perfect balance. A psychological and supernatural thriller with strong character work, intelligent cinematic touches, and wonderful performances.",The Sixth Sense
106,Spleen,About the `surprise' ...,8,26 March 2000,"... I'm afraid I got it almost immediately - that is to say, about a third of the way through.  I mean, Shyamalan drops us a pretty broad hint.  I wonder if he even intended to keep the secret hidden.  I have a suspicion...  I think that Shyamalan's intention was to reveal the secret at precisely the moment I worked it out, possibly by dropping an even broader hint.  But then someone at some preliminary screening failed to get the hint, and Shyamalan thought: `Well, if it's THAT easy to keep people in the dark ...'I'm reminded of `Vertigo', where Hitchcock does something similar: he makes his revelation less than half way through, as soon as he decently can (to the audience, of course; not to the central character).  It must be said that this makes `Vertigo' a better, tenser film.  An explicit revelation halfway through would have likewise made `The Sixth Sense' a better, tenser film; so I'm GLAD I worked things out early on - a friend of mine who didn't found the story a little humdrum, before the conclusion.I don't know that I would have had THAT reaction: even given Shyamalan's miscalculation, this is a beautifully told tale, supported by three perfectly judged performances (Bruce Willis, Haley Joel Osment, who proves that it IS possible for an adult story to have a likeable child as a central character, and Toni Collette - but I'm always ready to rave about her, wherever she appears).  The criticism that the ghosts intrude on what could have been a good domestic drama is entirely misguided.  This is a story ABOUT ghosts intruding.  I found it refreshing to see a fantasy that takes its fantastic premise seriously, without using it as an excuse to cheapen the drama.The sober photography helps a good deal, without drawing attention to itself.  A pity that one of the shots was so obviously swiped from `Poltergeist'.  Not that I minded - this is a much better film than `Poltergeist', anyway.",The Sixth Sense
107,aimless-46,A Classic,10,28 April 2008,"""The Sixth Sense"" (1999) is generally regarded as a ghost story and that is what it seems to be during the first viewing. There is also an obvious subtext about the nature of our fears as well as themes concerning courage and communication; elements often incorporated into the genre. Most viewers will be conscious of this stuff during the first viewing but will mostly be focused on sorting out the story and processing the intriguing conclusion. But with subsequent viewing(s) the fear factor diminishes and you become aware that this is not a ghost story so much as it is a film about grief; particularly the grief than comes from regret. With this realization comes the awareness that the real power of the film comes from a viewer's subconscious connection with this underlying theme. The object of the film is far more than just giving the audience a scare although it does a first-class job of doing just that. It can also alter your perception of the process of both living and dying. The spirits that seek out young Cole Sear (Haley Joel Osment) do so because there is something they regret doing or not doing during their lives; something that will ease the grief of their passing (for both them and their loved ones). You have Krya's little sister asking Cole if Krya will come back and Cole answering ""not anymore"", after he has helped Krya. And then you have the grieving Malcolm Crowe (Bruce Willis) and his grieving wife Anna (Olivia Williams): ""Once upon a time there was this person named Malcolm. He worked with children. He loved it. He loved it more than anything else. And then one night, he found out that he made a mistake with one of them. He couldn't help that one. And he can't stop thinking about it, he can't forget. Ever since then, things have been different. He's not the same person that he used to be. And his wife doesn't like the person that he's become. They barely speak anymore, they're like strangers. And then one day Malcolm meets this wonderful little boy, a really cool little boy. Reminds him a lot of the other one. And Malcolm decides to try and help this new boy. 'Cause he feels that if he can help this new boy, it would be like helping that other one too.""The climatic scene in the car between Cole and his mother (Toni Collette) ranks up with cinema's all-time best.Then again, what do I know?

109,framptonhollis,"Good Job, Shyamalan!",7,22 September 2015,"M. Night Shyamalan gets a lot of hate for making a lot of horrible films. And, I must admit, a lot of his films look pretty horrible to me, but I haven't seen them yet, and this film is pretty great!Although flawed, ""The Sixth Sense"" manages to be full of some genuinely powerful moments, and a very smart script. Seriously, it is amazing how they were able to pull of the twist ending and STILL have the whole film make a lot of sense. But, it isn't a film just about horror and twist endings, it is also a very good drama film, and I'm surprised a film this bleak and emotional has actually gotten tons of attention from the general public.However, as I mentioned earlier, the film is flawed. One of the biggest flaws is the delivery. Now, the acting in this film is very well-done, but it'd be even better if not every character spoke...so...slowly...and...whispered...every...line. Also, I DID unintentionally laugh at some sequences, but those scenes are very few, although they were kind of odd.Overall, SEE IT!",The Sixth Sense
110,breakdownthatfilm-blogspot-com,"Doesn't feel like the genre its in, yet works either way,...mostly",7,5 September 2014,"After Die Hard (1988) had permanently made actor Bruce Willis a go to action star, he could couldn't get himself out of it. He did manage to snag a few roles that were out of the action genre but none of them really stuck. At least, not until he decided to take part in this little project. There's also something to say about this films director, M. Night Shyamalan. It may not be his first directorial or writing job, but he certainly shows the kind of potential he had from the beginning. Of course, for many viewers now a days he's missing his mark to the point of no return. However, that is a discussion for another time. Ghost stories are not a new thing; they've been told several different ways. However, something about this particular story does make it quite different from the rest.Psychologist Malcolm Crowe (Bruce Willis), is given a case where a child, Cole Sear (Haley Joel Osment) is considered an outcast among his single mother and classmates for being strange for his own reasons. Along with this is Crowe's own subplot dealing with him trying to reconnect with his distant wife. Among the rest of the cast are other good actors which all pitch solid performances. Not one actor here gives a performance that isn't believable. In fact, for a horror film, it had several significant emotional moments along the way that helped define the its characters and gave them depth. Of these actors, Bruce Willis gave his most realistic showing that is not seen all too often. Frequently, Willis is playing sharp, hot-headed, wise-cracking characters. Here, he's the exact opposite - cautious, soft spoken and well-mannered. It's a nice change in character.And of course with this inventive writing comes the respective errors. One big error is the continuity. The laws of how ghosts work are not kept clear to what their limitations are. An example of this would be how ghosts can touch certain physical objects and not others. Certain rules like these are difficult to follow, especially when it comes to certain plot points. When it came to the horror elements of this movie, it was effective in some areas, while others not so much. What did look well done were the practical effects. This helped create some disturbing images. Unfortunately, what didn't assist in making these images even creepier was the lighting and camera work. Tak Fujimoto, the cinematographer for Silence of the Lambs (1991) also worked for this project and his selection of lighting doesn't assist any of the jump scare moments in any fashion. If the whole scare shot is in total bright light from beginning to end, how is that going to be scary?Musically related, James Newton Howard's score did its job accordingly. For the horror elements there were screeching strings and sudden percussion for the scares. This is typical but also doable. For the scenes with the more creep out factor, Howard used piano frequently that only relied on a number of keys to give that uneasy tone. Piano was also used for the more emotional scenes and they were probably the most effective due to the execution and writing behind the composition. It certainly did not have a memorable theme but its overall listening experience can be done solo without watching the movie. It is a decent movie with some apparent problems, but it still entertains.Continuity flaws and authentic scares are not its strong points, but its creepy imagery, music and realistic practical effects help recover that loss. Along with that is Bruce Willis' most likable human performance to date with an interesting story and other believable showings from other actors.",The Sixth Sense

Today I did.I thought it was going to be a really scary movie, not just some drama mixed with a few suspenseful scenes. The actors do their jobs, but the plot isn't interesting and takes too long to develop something.I was gonna rate this movie really low until the twist in the end was revealed.

It currently ranks #3 for M. Night's films. I love this movie because it's a really good ghost story and has a thought-provoking plot.Yeah, this film was famous so I already knew the ending before it even happened but that didn't distract me from watching the movie. Throughout the movie is a masterpiece.The acting by Bruce Willis, Haley Joel Osment, and Toni Collette were all fantastic and some like Olivia Williams and Donnie Wahlberg were all great, too.If you want an intelligent ghost movie with some scares and twists and turns, this is the movie for you.

115,TedStixonAKAMaximumMadness,"""The Sixth Sense""- An incredible, frightening and even heartfelt thriller. One of the finest horror films of the 90's. Perhaps even of all time.",10,15 November 2016,"At the time of its release, M. Night Shyamalan's tense and arresting thriller ""The Sixth Sense"" was something of a cultural phenomena. A revelation in the world of horror, and one of those few films that emerges every so often to remind us of just how invaluable and under-appreciate this genre is. And of the great heights it is capable of in the hands of great storytellers and master filmmakers. While Shyamalan's career has gone through its highs and lows in the ensuing years, one fact has remained constant in the near-twenty years that have passed since this 1999 release: No matter what, ""The Sixth Sense"" is still looked upon with nothing but admiration and adoration from critics and filmgoers alike, being held in the highest regards. Some even consider it a modern classic, set to go down among the other greats like Carpenter's ""The Thing"" or Wise's ""The Haunting."" And I am very much in agreement with this. It's a beautiful and meticulously crafted experience that not only delivers the thrills and chills like any good ghost story should... but it also delivers plenty of heart and very human drama that keeps you wholly invested.Bruce Willis stars as Child Psychologist Malcolm Crowe, a man haunted by a home invasion one year prior in which a troubled former patient shot him and then committed suicide in front of he and his wife. With a growing rift in his marriage due to the trauma, Crowe seeks redemption by helping a young boy with similar emotional problems to his deceased patient- Cole Sear, as portrayed brilliantly by Haley Joel Osment. However, Crowe doesn't realize the severity of young Cole's plight, and soon comes to learn a startling truth... Cole can see the ghosts of people with unfinished business. Malcolm realizes he must help Cole to try and control this unique gift... this terrible curse... and to try and figure out what the spirits haunting young Cole want.Shyamalan crafts his tale and directs the film with a certain sensitivity and tact that works wonders for conveying the themes and scares alike. His script is always intense but with just enough levity to allow the audience to catch their breath between the more frightening of scenes, and he expertly handles his characters with a deliberation that I admired. Every single character present has their purpose in the story, and all are handled exceptionally well. Especially our two leads, who both go through very well thought-out arcs that realistically develop and change who they are throughout the narrative. There's also a surprising among of heart present in the script that will draw you in with its identifiable moments of human drama. As much as it is about haunting spirits tormenting a young child, it's also a film about a man trying to fix his own life and marriage, and about a young boy dealing with his unique gifts while trying to maintain a connection with his troubled mother. There's some very powerful work done in terms of these sequences and they help to elevate the film as a whole.The visual direction is just wonderful. Say what you will about his later, shoddier work, but Shyamalan knows how to convey a scene with keen use of lighting, composition and movement. His recurring motifs, such as the color red or the use of lowered temperatures are really good indicators that something terrible is about to happen, and they will instantly put you on edge as an audience member, with the hair on the back of your neck standing straight up.Beyond that, the cast is just magnificent and are a key piece of the puzzle as to what makes the film such an immense achievement. Willis, often known for his gruff tough-guy roles, is given the role of a lifetime as the troubled Malcolm, and is able to stretch his acting chops in a way that many of his more recent works cannot touch. It's a film that reminds us of just how much we love Willis as an actor first and foremost, and he plays it to perfection. Osment, now known more for his work in quirky B-movies and voice- over roles, excels as one of the finest child actors I've ever seen in his defining part. He gives Cole such a sense of pathos and maturity that is far beyond his years. He also nails the scenes of a frightened child, terrified of the ghostly figures that are following him. And Toni Collette, who I adored in her incredible series ""United States of Tara"" makes for a wonderful supporting role as Cole's mother, Lynn. A troubled person trying to hold herself together for the sake of her child.In the end, ""The Sixth Sense"" excels thanks to these wonderful contributing factors, and emerges as a flawless and frightening excursion into the other side. It's scares will keep you up at night, afraid of what may be lurking in the dark around you. And it's very human and emotional drama will touch you in a way many other recent horror films simply cannot compare to. It's an undeniable modern classic, and not only is it one of the best horror releases of the 1990's... it may be one of the greatest horror films ever made.And for this reason, it easily and skillfully earns a perfect 10 out of 10.",The Sixth Sense

It was never boring and what I liked the best was the great performance of little boy Haley Joel Osment. Bruce Willis had no doubt his best role in his life. Congratulations to director M.Night Shyamalan who created a masterpiece à la Hitchcock. The difference between both directors is perhaps that Shyamalan is the master for mystery movies and Hitchcock for thrillers. The soundtrack from James N. Howard was top.

Night Shyamalan both wrote and directed this movie, and he helps provide an Ora that is extremely tense and spine chilling throughout.All in all the movie was very good in every way and would have scored 7 or 8 as a supernatural thriller, but then came the ending, well it's more of a revelation.

123,MartianOctocretr5,Unique concept and approach to old fashioned ghost story telling,7,1 August 2014,"Decided to revisit this classic. It was a brand new take on one of the more fundamental themes of the ""scary movie"" family of genres, life after death. M. Night Shyamalan adopted the always reliable Twilight Zone Gothic approach, but set up an all-time reverse twist finale that would have made Rod Serling stand up and applaud.This could be Bruce Willis's most understated and yet finest performances of his career. No laughing and destroying stuff; instead he approaches his role thoughtfully. It was a new side to him, and he carried himself well. He's a child psychiatrist, with a new patient, Haley Joe Osment, that is filled with angst and makes the claim that dead people are drawn to him like a magnet and talk to him. Osment's performance is emotional and oddly believable. His classic declaration about dead people ""don't know they're dead!"" is one of the best delivered ever.Ghost visitations are utilized perfectly and just often enough so that every one of them is executed with a dramatic impact and superior fright factor. Low lighting is used almost all the time for a dark, oppressive mood, which fits most of the time. Now the weaknesses. In retrospect, there are some serious lapses in logic through the course of the story. How could the ""twist"" have been concealed from the protagonist so long, without some character or action revealing the truth to him? The scenes that are meant to address this fail to explain it. There are some very awkwardly slow scenes in the story, and others that just aren't useful. These scenes are constructed to set up the shock value of the final reveal, but most of them are just plain dull.But overall, this is a fine work, complete with fine performances and an original concept that make for a good, scary ghost story.",The Sixth Sense
124,sme_no_densetsu,A rare 'twist' movie that holds up to repeated viewings,8,15 March 2008,"Everyone knows that this movie has one of the best 'twist' endings in recent film history. Hopefully you haven't had it spoiled for you because seeing the movie for the first time wouldn't be the same if you knew the ending beforehand. That being said, if you're revisiting the movie then I think you'll find that it holds up surprisingly well, even though the element of surprise is gone.The main reason for this is that you can now appreciate how the film was constructed in a way that concealed the twist in plain view. There are various clues throughout which take on a second meaning on repeated viewings. In my opinion there are maybe a couple of questionably 'cheap' tricks but it does all fit within the logic the 'twist'.Another thing that keeps the movie entertaining is the atmosphere. This is unquestionably Shyamalan's best directorial effort, effectively building a sense of mystery and dread, all without resorting to the over-the-top gore typical of horror films. James Newton Howard's eerie score is also an essential ingredient in building atmosphere.The acting is good all around but, for the most part, unexceptional. In my mind Toni Collette gave the best performance, one that was justly rewarded by an Oscar nomination. Haley Joel Osment also nabbed a nomination but I wasn't that impressed by his performance, though it was definitely above average for such a young actor.If you haven't seen this film already try to catch it before the 'twist' has been revealed to you either by someone else or by a cultural reference.

125,Screen_Blitz,M. Night Shyalaman's supernatural horror venture makes for a thought-provoking and spine-chilling experience,10,23 October 2015,"The Sixth Sense is not your average paranormal horror thriller, it is a thought-provoking with a strong emotional edge associated with its spine-chilling scares. The ingenious mastermind this supernatural horror-fest is M. Night Shyalaman who pours a heart and soul into the core of its chilling story. In an age where many filmmakers strive for both successful and unsuccessful attempts at scare with with drenching their films in an enormous barrage of blood and gore and jump scares, Shyalaman sheds away from these conventions by showcasing a story that spends chills down your spine, while grabbing at your heart with an emotional atmosphere many films of the genre are often not accustomed to. So here's the question, what if you had the ability to see spirits of the deceased? The answers lie within the grounded core of this supernatural thriller carried on the shoulders of young Haley Joel Osment as it follows a little boy lost in a world of unspeakable imaginations. There are rules, however, that must be established when bringing an eerie world of the dead beyond the grave to life. That's a generous method the Indian-born filmmaker applies to pulling audiences into an emotional jarring experience where paranoia is rampant and the lines between reality and fantasy are blurred. The film, set in Shyalaman's hometown in Philadelphia, follows Malcolm Crowe (played by Bruce Willis), a once-gifted child psychologist who is set up with an emotionally disturbed nine-year old boy named Cole Sears (played by Haley Joel Osment), a lonely boy living his misunderstood mother (played by Toni Collette). Upon meeting the young lad, it becomes clear that the boy needs help. But things become complicated when Malcolm discovers that Cole has a mysterious ability to communicate with the ghost of dead people.It it rare for a horror film to carry such a significant amount of intellect and heart as this film, unless you look at the age of the Stephen King-based horror entities that made a crucial impact in the genre during the 80s and 90s. M. Night Shyalaman brings his directorial talent to the table, and the beauty of his filmmaking style shines in more ways than one. For the scenes that are so supposed to be scary, the film gets scary. For the scenes that are supposed to touch your heart, the film grabs at your heart, and not in a way that feels contrived. Shyalaman keeps the story moving at a reasonable pace as it builds up on Cole's exploration of the real world clashing with the world of the deceased, while accompanying the atmosphere with twists and turns not many people will see coming. Rarely does he let any moment go wasted. At every step of the way, there is a sheer amount of suspense roaring in each scene as Cole is visited by deceased individual who pop out of nowhere and began haunting his presence. Pay attention to when the temperature drops and Cole's breath gets cold. And while the score by James Newton Howard is beautiful to listen to, it is the heartfelt performance by Haley Joel Osment that challenges our emotions. For a ten-year-old boy, this actor knows how to tap into the heart string with a performance that pounds with strong emotional magnitude, especially in a scene with his mother towards the end. Working along his side is Bruce Willis, a German-born famous for his adrenaline-fueled role as John McClane in the 'Die Hard' series, who expands upon his acting chops to deliver a performance that is simply riveting. The Sixth Sense is a thoughtful, spine-chilling supernatural thrillers that marks a landmark achievement on the horror genre thanks to the rewarding directorial efforts by M. Night Shyalaman. For the phase ""you will not many horror movies like this one"", this quote definitely applies to this cinematic bolt. The movie is not all about scares, it is also about heart and redemption",The Sixth Sense
126,bobsgrock,A lot can happen in 10 years.,9,5 August 2010,"Ironically, I have viewed The Sixth Sense for the first time exactly 11 years after it opened. I remember distinctly when it was first released and the amount of buzz and tension it caused those who saw it. Unfortunately, I was not one of them but I am certainly glad that I have gotten to it now.In many ways, this has become a film of iconic proportions. Only saying the words, ""I see dead people,"" gets a response out of most people. This film is also one of the reasons Bruce Willis is a star and the reason Haley Joel Osment is a household name. Beyond all that however, what it really comes down to is the potential shown by this film for a newcomer named M. Night Shyamalan, who might be today the most hated director in Hollywood. The reason for that is because he showed such talent and poise both in writing and directing and to see such marvelous talent go to waste on projects such as Lady in the Water, The Happening and The Last Airbender is the true disappointment.Without going into details, I must say to anyone who hasn't seen this film yet (and there are probably few), that this is filmmaking of the highest order. Shyamalan here shows impeccable timing and great ability to use editing, lighting and an incredible score by James Newton Howard to create true and genuine suspense and terror in multiple scenes. Knowing the major plot twist only because I have lived in America for the last ten years, I was still drawn into the story due to the emotional content involving Malcolm Crowe and his wife as well as the relationship between Cole and his mother. The most tantalizing scenes are when things happen to Cole and it is remarkable how Shyamalan stages and crafts each and every frame.So, ten years later we find Shyamalan with five more films under his belt with only two being well-received and the rest either panned or hated soon after. Is he still a talented filmmaker. I believe so but it is astonishing to see his descent since and one can't help but wonder what went wrong. I don't know but something did and I pray and hope that somehow, someway, Shyamalan will find his way back to the type of material and style he used to make this such a great film.",The Sixth Sense

128,baumer,A very creepy film.,9,9 August 1999,"What's going on here?  The summer of 99 has produced 2 very intensely creepy films.  First Blair Witch takes us all by storm and now the Sixth Sense does the same thing.  What we have here is a film that does all the things that a ""horror"" film should do.  It uses shadows, it has talk of the dead and the undead and it even uses other things like atmosphere and music to produce a very good scary film, and one that will have you buzzing about the ending.Young Cole can hear and see dead people and it is up to Dr. Malcolm to help him out.  The story itself is interesting and how it is carried out is even better.  But I have to say that I think this is a film that should be seen twice to figure everything out and to understand all that it is.  Because when you leave the theater you will question many aspects of the film.  You will wonder if it is legitimate in it's approach and honest and realistic with what the end of the film has wants us to believe.  But when I walked home and had a chance to examine it, I realized how truthful it is, and that makes it even more brilliant.  And in a way this film reminds me of a 1987 film called Angel Heart.  Both films concentrate on foreshadowing and they also play with our intellect.  When I first saw Angel Heart, I knew that it was good, but when I began to watch it more often on video, I realized that Angel Heart was a film that had more to it in every shot.  Every single time the camera rolled, there was always a subliminal meaning behind the ersatz one that was in front of us.  And that is what I think Sixth Sense does so well.  You wonder at first why Malcolm can't get into his basement, and then when you leave the theater and think about the film, you realize how much it all made sense.  This is a film that manipulates our psyche and plays with our ethos.  But it has a great time doing so.  I highly recommend this film, especially if you want to be frightened.  There are about five or six really good moments in the film that make your heart stop.  And on that level the film is terrific.  But as a film, not a genre piece, this is top notch and dare I say that Cole may be remembered at Oscar time.  Go see this film!",The Sixth Sense

And the dead sometimes don't know they're dead at all. This frightens him a lot, and makes his mother worry. And thinks he need serious help. While Dr. Crowe does all he can to help Cole out with his unexplainable power.I can't say I enjoyed it at all, I didn't expected it to be great or anything, since I hated the way Signs and Village were.

Least it wasn't as confusing as that ""Village"" movie which had so many flaws in it.Bruce Willis was the only actor I know in the entire movie, he was alright in this one, but he's done way better roles in other better films than this one.That and Cole is nothing compared to Danny from ""Shining"" or the ""Omen"" kid. In other words I give this film a 5 out of 10. I'll see about checking out the rest of M. Night Shyamalan, for my full opinion on the Indian Director.",The Sixth Sense
131,mattymatt4ever,Intriguing and original,7,5 September 2002,"I am not the biggest fan of ""The Sixth Sense"" and don't believe it deserved quite as much word of mouth as it received, but I can't completely discredit the film.  It is well-done and quite intriguing.  I recently bought the DVD, since it was used and I purchased it for a cheap price.  Plus, I was curious about how it would feel watching it for a second time.  I watched it in theaters and thought it was pretty good, but like many others I wanted to see it again to try to uncover clues I didn't perceive the first time around and discover certain elements that I may have overlooked.  I still don't think it's a great movie, but it was interesting watching it and keeping in mind the big plot twist at the end.  As I watched it, the twist made a lot of sense and M. Night Shamalyan didn't just sneak it in for shock value.  He obviously put a lot of thought into both creating this big surprise and making it credible.  When I accessed the ""Rules and Clues"" feature on the DVD, that confirmed my theories and exposed a few details that I didn't even notice on the second viewing. The acting is good all-around.  Bruce Willis gives, probably, his most low-key performance up-to-date.  He is both compelling and convincing, not getting in the audience's face with a showy dramatic performance.  Haley Joel Osment was the perfect choice for Cole, and I don't think the phrase, ""I see dead people,"" would be the same coming out of any other child actor's mouth.  A good child actor is hard to find, and Haley Joel is one of the few who I can actually say measures up to a good deal of adult actors.  He's not ""good for a little kid""; he's just a good actor period.  His Oscar nomination was well-deserved.  His acting is very subtle, not broad in any way.  Toni Collette also deserved her Oscar nomination.  I don't live in Philadelphia, so I can't technically judge whether or not her accent was ""on target,"" but I know for sure that she pulled off a flawless American accent. And she went the extra mile by taking on a dialect.  Just like Osment, her acting is very subtle and you sense the pain and anguish she feels as a single mother of this estranged kid without her having to continuously sob and burst into tears.  Actors should know that you don't need to cry to express sadness.  9 times out of 10, people try their best to hold back the tears--at least when they're in public or in front of other people.  Donnie Wahlberg makes a short but memorable appearance as one of Willis's former patients, and actually plays an important role in the story as you will learn. What I didn't like about ""The Sixth Sense""?  Altogether, it's slow-moving and surely could've used some editing.  And some of the dialogue is corny and stilted.  I wouldn't classify this as a ""scary movie.""  Some have deemed this as one of the scariest movies of all time.  To that I say ""Hell no.""  I think of it more as a sci-fi/mystery.  It's not always entertaining, but it's intriguing and gives your brain a lot of work. If you decide to rent or purchase the DVD, another fun feature to check out is Shamalyan's (very very) first movie--as in he was 12 years old and shot it with his own video camera.  They only show a clip from the movie and, as he said, it's awful--but it's always fun to watch famous or up-and-coming directors' work back when they were starting amateurs.  Like he says, if you watch this crappy movie, you will understand why Shamalyan doesn't do special f/x.  I gotta admire the guy.  If I were releasing one of my films on DVD (in the far future) I wouldn't show my first movie--a crappy ""X Files"" film that I shot back in junior year of high school as a project for my TV Production class.  That really takes guts. My score:  7 (out of 10)",The Sixth Sense

I know I watched it at least twice during the first couple yrs afterwards,,, but it has been a LONG time since I sat and watched it all the way through. So it was almost like seeing it for the first time again.What a movie!!!Malcolm is a child psychologist, whom after a violent incident with a former patient, begins to see a new patient, a young boy who is very troubled. Cole doesn't have any friends at school. A lot of the kids call him ""freak."" His mother wants nothing more than help her son, but he won't tell her what's going on in his mind. Malcolm deduces that Cole is withdrawn and depressed because his father left both he and his mother, but the more he talks with Cole, the more he sees that Cole is being tormented by things that are much less obvious.Haley Joel Osment or Freddie Highmore? Which boy actor was the best? They're both neck and neck imo, lol! H. J. O. Is so amazing
in this. Willis, Williams, and Collette are amazing as well,, but seeing such amazing acting coming from such a young boy is really something else. 8.5 all the way!!!If you haven't seen it already,,,GO WATCH IT!!!",The Sixth Sense
133,sharky_55,You have to add some twists and stuff.,7,10 October 2016,"The internet and young audiences have long been enamoured with this type of film that rewards repeat viewings. It's good film-making to flip the viewer onto its back and watch them question everything they have just witnessed, and what's more, twists generate discussion, which in turn generate hype. These films, in the vein of Fight Club, The Usual Suspects, The Prestige as well as Shyamalan's own The Village, all have their designated 'rewind' moments, where the bombshell twist is dropped and the realisation sinks into the characters. This is often accompanied by flashbacks that remind us visually of all the little hints that we have missed, but most find that joy in a second or even third watch. It's a bit like positive reinforcement - the viewer relishes in spotting them slyly inserted into the background or unknowingly in plain sight, and are allowed to pat themselves on the back for being so attentive. The worst of these twist movies are built from that point up - their screenplays are only written after the original idea, and bits and pieces of the world and characterisation need to be fitted around it. When re-watching these, they fail miserably because the viewer is now armed with prior knowledge that renders it illogical and unnecessary. One of the worst offenders of this type is The Usual Suspects, a cult classic because of the last few minutes where everything that had been previously established in the film is suddenly up-ended and tossed aside. Knowing this and watching the film again renders it all joyless and without meaning; the entire thing is little more than a shaggy- dog story built from the ego of Keyser Soze. Another contender is Fincher's The Game. Its tension is serviceable the first time, but a revisit only strains the suspension of disbelief, and highlights the ridiculousness and somewhat sadistic tone. Is The Sixth Sense a successful movie in spite of its twist being the worst kept secret in pop culture in the years after its premiere? Its characters at least, seem authentic, and not contraptions that only service the path towards the twist ending. Bruce Willis is cast against type; he is responsible for mending things, instead of tearing them apart, but it is exactly the type of baggage that his persona carries (the rough, hard-headed approach) which convinces us he would rather throw a brick into a window instead of talking to his wife (although this does not entirely redeem the convenience of the situation). Collette plays a role she would later perfect in About a Boy - a single mother straining against the weight and responsibility of parenthood, but Shyamalan enables an additional level of sympathy by letting her react rationally to irrational and supernatural occurrences. We can see what is causing the bruising and emotional distress, but we also understand that she has no other reasonable response, and so this justifies the tension that holds back their true communication. Haley Joel Osment's young performance is exactly as asked; a boy saddled with a burden that no ten year old should have to shoulder, and courageously trying to do what is right. Much of Cole's precocious nature is sourced from Osment himself, and that is perhaps why the acclaim for the role is a little overdone. But he is still very good, and makes the jumps from childhood to adult emotional sensibilities smoothly. The film has been called horror, which seems undeniable in the way that Shyamalan approaches Cole's visions stylistically. He uses the money shots carefully and sparingly, from a long-held horror tradition that came initially from limited budgets (this was his third directorial feature, but the budget does not reflect that). The characters might walk past ghosts hanging from nooses in the corridor ceiling, and everyone but Cole will not afford a second glance. A lone hand might grab at a little boy from under the bed - a little cliché, I must admit. And the soundtrack is familiar enough. Its aesthetic is unmistakably horror, stabbing and piercing and leaping suddenly in volume to aid the jump scares. If they are not scary enough that's because the film ultimately tries to brand itself with the sentiment of redemption instead. Maybe one day ghosts might try a more friendly tone if they want things done from the afterlife.",The Sixth Sense

135,vip_ebriega,One of the most poignantly-told ghost stories of all time.,10,22 January 2010,"My Take: Nuanced and subtly creepy, and oftentimes heartbreaking and sad. A perfect showcase of M. Night Shymalan's unique storytelling talents.Haters call M. Night Shymalan the ""one-hit wonder"" so aggressively that they seem to forget just how effective that ""one-hit"" was. His first real big hit (but not his first film), THE SIXTH SENSE is a perfect introduction to the unique and rarely seen (in Hollywood)) storytelling talents of M. Night Shymalan, something that wasn't appreciated for too long. But I doubt anyone will disagree that THE SIXTH SENSE is a triumph of storytelling; a ghost story told in a most original and subtle way and achieves to sustain our interest without much use of heavy effects. But it's actually more than just another well-crafted ghost story, It's also actually an interesting drama grounded in semi-supernatural elements. Malcolm Crowe (Bruce Willis) is a gifted psychologist; his friends and his wife (Olivia Williams) thinks his talents is a gift, but he on the other hand considers it a curse due to a failure to cure a kid in the past that since has haunted him. Meanwhile, Cole Sear (Haley Joel Osment, a career-making performance) is a quiet, problematic boy. He gets picked on by his bully classmates and his mom (Toni Collette) isn't exactly comfortable when he isn't telling her what's wrong. And you thought seeing dead people was tough! The film says ghost see only what they want to see. So that doesn't make them any less different from the living. Here, Cole sees his ability to see and communicate with folks from the other side as a curse; something he wished he never had. But when he discovers how to wrest control of it, he starts to see what it really is: A gift in disguise. This plays a very strong part with the film's still shocking ending (a gimmick Shymalan would use in his later films), but actually plays (among with other issues) throughout the films. THE SIXTH SENSE is more than just a well-crafted genre picture; Shymalan uses it as means to tell a story dealing with some personal issues.Most will remember THE SIXTH SENSE as for its shocker of an ending, a great example of a true and shocking payoff that provides the perfect closure to a perfect film. But the pleasures of THE SIXTH SENSE doesn't begin and end there. The relevant issues tackled throughout the film (more prominently, family issues like divorce, mid-life crises and rejection) is unnerving just as some of the film's ""jump-from-your-seat"" moments are subtly creepy. But among the things that truly grabbed me about THE SIXTH SENSE is it's true emotions. Haters can call Shyamalan whatever they want, but he knows a thing or two about emotions. The scene where Cole talks to his mom about how he gets frequent ""visits"" from grandma starts out creepy, but really is sad and heartfelt, and Shymalan doesn't make use of any faux emotions whatsoever; just the simplicity of the staging of the scene. Then there's the ending (which I will not reveal for the sake of the small number of people who have not seen it or don't remember it), which was intended to shock the audience. But come to look at it, I realized just how sad and heartbreaking it really is.The setup for his later films would be similar to THE SIXTH SENSE, from the nuanced slow-burn setup paid off by a shocker ending. But like THE SIXTH SENSE, Shymalan's later films have an interesting story told in a most unique way not seen in most typical Hollywood movies. There's always something to look forward to in his films. Ever since his success with THE SIXTH SENSE, we are introduced to an unqualified talented storyteller; often hated but nevertheless one of the most underrated minds in Hollywood today.Rating: ***** out of 5.",The Sixth Sense
136,aciessi,Spine-Tingling,7,14 January 2019,"""I see dead people""M. Night Shyamalan's first and most successful hour of his cinematic career was The Sixth Sense. A film that accomplishes, if nothing else, pure spookiness. Take any child, and give them supernatural abilities, and you've got a damn good recipe of freaking people out. Haley Joel Osment was an exceptionally great, mature actor for his age, which is what made this role even better. He compliments well with a quiet and calculative Bruce Willis. It's a fascinating story worthy of a Twilight Zone episode. But I don't believe that this is the best film of Shyamalan's catalogue. On more than one occasion during the span of the film, I noticed some of the dreaded trips of Shyamalan films that proved to be problematic later on in his career. I know, some of you out there love this movie, but go back and look closely. They are all still there. The ""twist"" of this film, suffice to say has been spoiled for me years ago. But even if it wasn't, I would NEVER have not seen it coming from the very beginning.

His likable character goes through typical stages of life, including self doubt, imagination and conflict, a true justification of the young mind, with an amazing shocking twist to match, in that he sees the dead, which provides twists and turns in a highly dramatic plot.The writing is exceptional, with the right amount of realism to reflect the drama of situations, and the use of seeing the dead goes a long way to build up to a stunning and gripping finale, one which will make you question the entire plot and watch it again straight away. The open ending leads to many questions and when watching it again, you may question certain aspects.The drama is pitched spectacularly well by the actors and deserves praise, particularly Toni Collette (Little Miss Sunshine) and Osment.Having the use of real life scenarios including parent and child relationships juxtaposed with fantastic ideologies such as seeing ghosts creates a world of possibilities, and Collette and Osment have some great on screen moments together, perfect realism and perfect fantasy, and one scene will have you in tears.Shyamalan's Oscar nominated direction helps achieve the right mood, being chilling and yet realistic in its own context.Not particularly jump behind the sofa scary, more physiologically scary, and plays on your mind for a while after watching, which makes a true horror classic",The Sixth Sense

141,KnightsofNi11,Shyamalan introduces himself to the world with a bang,8,2 February 2011,"In 1999 director M. Night Shyamalan introduced himself unto the world with The Sixth Sense. With this film we were introduced to Shyamalan's twisted, dark, and yet highly creative mind. We got a taste of his skilled storytelling ability wrapped in his tight artistic direction. We also discovered the man's knack for twist endings. And what a twist it was. The Sixth Sense really focuses on two characters and their relationship. One is Bruce Willis' character, Dr. Malcolm Crowe, who is a psychiatrist whose current patient is a disturbed little boy named Cole Sear, played by Haley Joel Osment. Crowe makes it his mission to help this boy, while at the same time he is trying to cope with his deteriorating personal life. It's emotional, thrilling, disturbing, and beautiful all at the same time. It's really not like anything you've ever seen before.Now sadly, I already knew about the shocking twist ending going into this film. You can't talk about movies for seventeen years without someone spilling the beans. But that didn't make the film any less enjoyable. The movie is great without the twist, but the twist and the end really adds a whole new level to the film. It changes the face of the film and when you get right down to it, it's what makes the film so unforgettable. That and the famous, ""I see dead people,"" line. However, everything else in the film's story is great. It is something so unique and haunting that it really gives this film a different feel than most horror or thriller films. The film is also paced very well in the most somber and low key way. This movie has a hypnotic quality to it. The emotional prowess of the film mixed with some very chilling moments sets it apart from anything else.One thing so remarkable about the film is the great equality in talent of the two leads, despite the age difference. Bruce Willis is as good as ever in this film. His quiet, somber attitude gives the film its mysterious feel. Eleven year old Haley Joel Osment drives the emotion of the film and puts forth an astounding performance. His character and his performance isn't a typical child actor role. His character is a very strange one with a wide range of personalities as well as maturity levels. He is undoubtedly a kid but there is much more to him than meets the eye. Toni Collette plays his mother who is another very important character and her performance doesn't quite reach the levels of Willis and Osment, but is very good nonetheless.Towards the end of the film I began feeling like it wasn't really going anywhere. I sort of began to forget the goals of the characters in the film and I felt like it was losing its footing. But as these feelings began to escalate the twist occurred and the film ended, leaving me very satisfied. I can't help but wish that there would have been a little more clear cut direction towards the end of this otherwise great film. There is also a lack of resolution in the film. It isn't something I hated, but I couldn't help but notice. The film feels like it is lacking a well rounded ending until the twist. And while the twist is remarkable and it ends the film very strong, it doesn't account for everything. The Sixth Sense got a little bit tripped up towards the end, but not enough to ruin everything else great about the film.The Sixth Sense is a very different kind of film and I was very happy with it. It is unlike anything I've ever seen. The look and feel of the film doesn't line up with the subject matter, but not in a bad way. A movie about a disturbed little boy who sees dead people could have easily been a cheesy slasher with corny lines and characters. But instead Shyamalan made it into something much more sophisticated and beautiful. This isn't a loud and action packed film. It's something much different, and much better. I was very impressed by The Sixth Sense.",The Sixth Sense

It's also beautifully written, directed and acted.
Because it is so unconventional (More Hitchcock than Spielberg), and uses cinematic elements (lighting, sound, editing) rather than special effects to provide its horror, it is not surprising THE SIXTH SENSE crept into theaters.

His film, The Sixth Sense is a spectacular movie, with special effects and especially the way it plays out. Shyamalan does such a great job concealing the secrets until the end. But those secrets are only good when it is the first time you are watching the movie. The second time around, you know what is going to happen, and the suspense suffers quite a lot from this layout.The storyline was wonderful, and this is something that could happen to people. The Sixth Sense is a spine tingling good time, that anyone will enjoy, at least the first time viewing it anyway. Bruce Willis did such a great job acting as Malcom in the film, you wouldn't suspect anything to be up. It just looks as though he an his wife are not speaking.

The premise is simple: a 2 hour film about a boy who sees dead people.  Make us sit through said film and experience Osment's unbearable acting and silly shock scenes.Then in the end, poke us in the eye and say ""Ha ha, it was all a farce. Bruce Willis was really dead all along.""  As if a thousand episodes of what Rod Serling wrote 50 years ago hasn't prepared us for that.If the film provides its twists earlier enough to have fun with them ('Fight Club') or leaves itself open for new twists ('The Wall', 'Usual Suspects') I can have some fun with it.  Instead, Shyamalan wants to be Spielberg and have everything open-and-shut but the material demands otherwise.So, Willis is dead and that's the end of it.  Case closed, he ceases to exist.

147,gregsrants,"Good job, but one of the top 20 of all time?",6,22 April 2004,"In 1999 a movie was released that was the topic of conversation around office water coolers throughout the country.  People were amazed at slow pace, but ever engrossing ghost story that culminated in an ending that no one saw coming.  The movie was M. Night Shyamalan's The Sixth Sense and its success went on to soak up over $300 million at the domestic box office and even garnish its young unknown star Haley Joel Osment a Supporting Actor nod at the 2000 Academy Awards.The thing is, that still to this day, I don't understand all the hubbub. Was it a good movie?  Yes.  But was it so revolutionary that it deserves its standing as 19th on the all-time grossing films list? Hardly.For those of you who have been living in a cave waiting for peace in the Middle East, The Sixth Sense stars Bruce Willis as Malcolm Crowe, a psychologist that we are introduced to being shot in the opening scenes. After what we expect to have been a speedy recovery, Malcolm befriends a new client, Cole Sear (Osment) who seems to have a gift/curse of being able to see and communicate with dead people.Malcolm tries to comprehend what Cole is facing and this all leads to a revelation of his own that shocked the movie world' back in 1999 and has been copied and parodied countless times since.To spend any more time on the plot would be counterproductive.  Most likely you have seen the film and on the off chance that you are coming out of a cave, well then, you might be lucky enough to be surprised at the ending without anyone telling you what to look for before it unveils itself.So let's start with the good stuff first.  Director M. Night Shyamalan did a superb job in keeping us interested in the story and the characters when everyone seems to be speaking in a monotone.  Shyamalan directed only two films before Sense (Praying with Anger and Wide Awake) so no one expected the phenomena that resulted.  The Sixth Sense was also written by Shyamalan we all know how rare it is to find a talented writer/director now of days.Also good are the performances.  Bruce Willis veers away from his macho persona he usually exudes and Osment and Toni Collette (who plays his mother) are great and were both deserving of their Oscar nods.  Hell, I would even give chops to Donnie Wahlberg who has but a small, albeit important, role at the beginning of the film.  All around, an A- grade for the actors.Then there was the scary stuff.  You know, the things that go bump.  There are a few genuine scares with rousing musical scores in tow but it is the quiet softer moments that really made the hair on the back of your neck take notice.  When Osment utters, `I see dead people' or when we see the imprint of a palm evaporate on a kitchen table, you are swept up in a world that is more spooky that scary and the movie is better off staying on this path.
There aren't many things that are wrong with The Sixth Sense and that is where I contradict myself.  I agree that The Sixth Sense was one of the better movies released in 1999.  I also believe that the premise was interesting and trend setting.  What I didn't understand was the sheer fascination from audiences around the world that put this movie into such lofty lists (80 million people had seen the movie after its release to DVD/Video in 2000).  Were we all that brain dead in '99 after Star Wars: The Phantom Menace and Toy Story 2 that this film stood out so indiscreetly? 
In researching for this review, I can honestly now answer that question with a definite, `YES'.  Evidenced earlier with The Usual Suspects and then again in 2001 with Nicole Kidman's The Others, the movie going public has proven at the box office that if you can dupe them an dupe them good, they are willing to go back and back again in hopes of trying to figure out how you pulled it off the first time.  So hats off to you Mr. Shyamalan.  Although your succeeding efforts (Unbreakable, Signs) were better films, you did set a standard with a slightly better than average film, and hey who doesn't have time to stand at the water cooler and talk about your use of the color red in the film.  Good job.www.gregsrants.com",The Sixth Sense

The ghosts themselves deserve an A-plus for the atmosphere they imbue, but realisticly, sixth sense perception is not that exclusive. Ghosts are not that invisible or that tangible. Some people do have greater sensitivity to them, but on a whole, ghosts can be seen by just about everyone whether they are psychic or not.

Night Shyamalan.No, let me take that back...Let's not blame 'Night', but the sorry excuses for writers, producers and directors who called themselves attempting to surpass the brilliance of Shyamalan's best movie so far...THE SIXTH SENSE.With a smooth effortlessness that's just about as terrifying as the movie itself, Shyamalan brings us the damn-near perfect story of Dr. Malcolm Crowe (Bruce Willis in a role that shattered everyone's prejudices about him as an actor), a child psychologist who is shot by one of his former patients (an almost unrecognizable Donnie Wahlberg), who then commits suicide. Sometime after this ordeal, feeling that he failed his late charge, Malcolm attempts to find redemption by helping out a distressed young boy named Cole Sear, (Haley Joel Osment's career-making performance). who can ""see"" dead people and communicate with them.At no time are you ever unaware of how much you care for these characters, and how extreme the situation is for them, which makes the shocks and scares twice as intense as any you could ever find in a PG-13-rated flick before, (except maybe for POLTERGEIST.) Plus there are fantastic performances all the way round by Willis and Osment, backed up by great turns by Toni Collette (who was nominated for Best Supporting Actress as Cole's tough- but-tender mom) and Olivia Williams as Malcolm's former fiancée.Even after multiple viewings, the storytelling skill that Shyamalan has is faultless, and still leaves you scratching your head as to how you could've missed the clues that lead to one of the most spellbinding, jaw-dropping endings to come along in many moons. Some people might figure it out in the first five minutes, but I will confess - Night so thoroughly pulled me into his world, that I wasn't one of them.SENSE was both a blessing and a curse to Shyamalan, since newly-won fans now expected ALL of his movies to have that tricky ""twist"" ending to stun and surprise them. Because of that, the quality of the movies that followed SENSE was inconsistent to say the least. People still debate about the merits of UNBREAKABLE and SIGNS, or even if THE VILLAGE should've been made at all.Personally, I like everything he's done since, flaws and all. But as far as his career is concerned, THE SIXTH SENSE is like his ""CITIZEN KANE,"" and considering the genre, is every bit as monumentally good as Orson Welles' towering achievement.THE SIXTH SENSE is without a doubt a ""must-have"" for your DVD library.",The Sixth Sense

151,swilliky,The greatest twist and remarkable horror film,8,18 January 2017,M. Night Shyamalan's masterpiece mystery delivers haunts and a brilliant twist that launched him into the mainstream. The story of young Cole Sear (Haley Joel Osment) and his child psychologist Dr. Malcolm Crowe (Bruce Willis) take a spooky turn as Cole's secret is revealed. The movie begins with Dr. Crowe celebrating with his wife over an award for his work with children. A former patient with continuing difficulties breaks in and shoots Crowe before killing himself.The failure of this patient sparks Crowe's interest in young Cole as they suffer from similar ailments. Cole is believed to be schizophrenic as he is often seen talking to himself and surround by other weird patterns of behavior. He also has trouble in school and appears to obtain knowledge that should otherwise be a secret. These problems result in him being isolated and having to pay a fellow student Tommy (Trevor Morgan) to be his friend.Check out more of this review and others at swilliky.com,The Sixth Sense
152,gavin-thelordofthefu-48-460297,An epic start to M. Night Shyamalan's career in filmmaking!,10,26 October 2012,"After I saw some of Shyamalan films except ""The Village"", ""The Lady in the Water"" and ""The Happening"" three films in which I have yet to see even though they got mixed to negative reviews, I looked past at his very first film that started his film career known as ""The Sixth Sense"", a tale about a child psychologist who receives an award on the same night that he is visited by a very unhappy ex-patient. After this encounter, Crowe takes on the task of curing a young boy with the same ills as the ex-patient. When it happened, the boy named Cole starts to see dead people and Crowe spends a lot of time with him while Cole's mother plans with his increasing problems and it's up to Crowe to cure him since he is his only hope.When I saw the entire thing, I was really creep-ed out by it and I realized that M. Night Shyamalan had created such a compelling film it became an epic start to his career in filmmaking history which is why I'm giving this an 100% rating. The story is well-written with a nice ending twist and has some brilliant atmospheric moments that would not only haunt you, but creep you out in the process. The music from James Newton Howard is great and fits really well for the emotional scenes in the film along with M. Night Shyamalan's solid directing which has a lot of focus with the tone of the movie. The pacing is brisk and it has some great character development especially the chemistry between Crowe and Cole. In fact, the acting is excellent. Bruce Willis did wonderful, Haley Jole Osment did such a compelling job as a frightened 10-year old, Toni Colette did fine as the boy's mother and Olivia Williams did great as Malcolm's wife.Overall, The Sixth Sense is a classic and it has been a long time since the quote ""I see dead people"" became so popular since the film's release at the late 90s. My advice to those who have not seen the movie: go watch it before Halloween starts. It is that good!",The Sixth Sense
153,Maziun,I see dead people and I see a wonderful movie,9,7 December 2013,"It's sad that the career of M. Night Shyamalan went so wrong . After the brilliant "" The Sixth sense"" he made great and underrated ""Unbreakable"" and flawed but good ""Signs"". He lost his touch with ""The village"" and every next movie he made was worse and worse. Now his name is some sort of joke and people criticize even his best movies . ""The Sixth sense"" is an object of many attacks with ""overrated"" and ""boring"" being the most popular words from the critics of this movie.This movie was inspired by episode of TV series ""Are you afraid of the dark ?"" . It's a cross between ""The Exorcist"" and ""Ordinary people"" . It explains why the movie is both really scary and heartbreaking. It relies on imagination and psychology to scare you . It's really scary despite the PG-13 rating. Actually ""SS"" is really a thriller full of many small twists and fantastical finale. Some people say that since the guessed right the finale it means the movie is bad. That's not true (Hitchcock's ""Psycho"" is a masterpiece despite rather predictable ending). It is impossible to make a twist totally unpredictable. While I agree that there is a stretch in terms of logic the finale is still incredibly clever – the movie doesn't keep any important facts in secret , it's our point of view that fools us. A movie must work on its own terms before springing a surprise. This movie certainly does.It works as a thriller , as a horror , but more importantly as a drama. You care about what happens to Cole Sear and Dr. Malcolm Crowe . You want everything to workout for Cole and his mother. There are many heartbreaking scenes in this movie – the broken window in the shop , the talk in the hospital , the talk in the car and the confession from Dr. Crowe to his wife.Bruce Willis gives an great performance against his macho image , Haley Joel Osment is extraordinary , Toni Collette is underrated for her superb performance , and the performance of Donnie Wahlberg mustn't be forgotten.The directing by Shyamalan is superb - excellent use of colors , mirrors and shadows, the lighting, eccentric camera viewpoint, psychological tension Screenplay is rich , full of great dialogue and incredibly realistic human interactions . Who could forget the famous ""I see dead people"" line.Don't listen to critics . Great art defends itself. I give it 9/10.",The Sixth Sense
154,Atreyu_II,A good movie if a little over-hyped,7,23 July 2007,"""The Sixth Sense"" is a good movie but perhaps a little overrated. I believe that those who don't like it are in minority. Part of this explains its success.The unfortunate reality is that this was the only Haley Joel Osment's successful movie. He made a reasonable number of very good movies and none of them was a success: ""Pay It Forward"", ""Edges of the Lord"" and ""A.I.: Artificial Intelligence"".Ironically at first nobody didn't expect that ""The Sixth Sense"" was going to have half of this success. This means that, if it wasn't a success, then Haley Joel Osment wouldn't have had a single successful movie.Now let's talk about the movie itself. Sometimes this is classified as a terror movie, but for me this isn't really a terror film. This is a combination of supernatural, drama, tension, suspense, thriller and instrumental (but suspenseful) music, without the use of special effects. Its simplicity works out well. This motion picture is also emotional, funny at parts and only in brief moments there is some terror.Haley Joel Osment plays a difficult role for a child, but with his incredible talent he steals the show. He was the first child actor ever nominated for Best Actor. Too bad he didn't win (not only for this, but also for his other movies I mentioned).Bruce Willis is surprisingly good in this. He is usually a very limited actor, but in this he's just as good as Haley. Plus, unlike his other films, Bruce plays a likable character here.Aside some absolutely unnecessary scenes, this movie is generally good. One of the best parts is when Cole (Haley Joel Osment) finally reveals his secret to Dr. Malcolm Crowe (Bruce Willis). That part is breathtaking, highly emotional and intense. Cole's facial expressions say all and some of the movie's best quotes can be heard in this sequence.The idea of this movie inspired the TV series ""Ghost Whisperer"" which stars Jennifer Love Hewitt.",The Sixth Sense
155,Libretio,Stately thriller will divide audiences,5,22 January 2005,"THE SIXTH SENSE Aspect ratio: 1.85:1Sound formats: Dolby Digital / DTS / SDDSWhilst recovering from a recent trauma, a child psychologist (Bruce Willis) helps a little boy (Haley Joel Osment) who claims to see ghosts.Released the same year as THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT (1999), another 'spook' movie which divided audiences and reaped dividends at the international box-office, M. Night Shyamalan's breakout feature THE SIXTH SENSE plays much better on TV than it ever did in theaters. With its slow tempo and stately visuals, the movie takes a mature approach to its supernatural subject matter, revealing Osment's ultra-creepy 'secret' in piecemeal fashion, one scare at a time. Former tough guy Willis plays a vulnerable figure whose bond with Osment provides a level of stability absent from his personal life - devastated by an incident in the film's opening sequence, Willis' wife (Olivia Williams) seems to be drifting into a relationship with a young family friend (Glenn Fitzgerald) - and while Osment is the primary focus of Shyamalan's screenplay, it's Willis who holds the material together. Some viewers may be distracted by the film's deliberate pacing, while others will be affected by the gradual accumulation of creepy details, spiked by a couple of really good jolts. The much-lauded twist ending might have been more effective had it not been mentioned in EVERY SINGLE REVIEW (including this one!), making it possible for many people to guess the 'surprise' long before Shyamalan reveals his hand. Australian actress Toni Collette is superb as Osment's harried - but deeply loving - mom, and there are cameo appearances by Shyamalan himself and an unrecognisable Donnie Wahlberg (BAND OF BROTHERS).",The Sixth Sense
156,Pedro_H,"A mini-masterpiece that delivers shocks, surprises and thrills.",8,12 October 2004,"A child physiologist (Bruce Willis) with a rocky marriage comes to visit a troubled boy (Haley Joel Osment) who claims to be seeing the dead.The problem with movies is that someone has always been there first. I was lucky with Psycho in that I didn't know anything about the film before I saw it - although I would have dearly loved to see it on a cinema screen. Here I was told there was a ""twist"" and having been warned I looked out for the clues and got them.(Not so sure I would have done if I had come in stone cold and just let it wash over me, though!) Osment - as the little eight year old boy - is a revelation. He acts like he is thirty year old dwarf rather than a child. How does he do it? When I was that age I could barely prepare a piece of toast, Osment has to carry a major motion picture by his emotions alone. Truly as good a piece of acting as I have ever seen from a pre-teen. Willis lowers his voice and tries to compete - but he is being outclassed and he knows it too!This is a throwback picture in that the threat is outside and little glimpsed. It has the best of Hitchcock and a million B's to steal from; and this includes the reverse-of-norm wide shot - rather than close in on tragedy the camera pulls back as if not to intrude. There is a car accident scene where a medium-expanding-to-long shot is used in a masterful way.There isn't a lot to write about this film beyond general platitudes about performance and moody setting. This is clever in that it never gives you too much to hang on to - no barrel chested hero about to come charging to the rescue. It wants to throw you off balance, keep you off balance, lead you to believe that it is going one way and then shots off in another.True, there is nothing really essential about this film. Nothing that is going to change your opinion on anything - not even whether there really are ghosts and people that can communicate with them.Manoj Night Shyamalam might not be Hitchcock quite yet, but at least he has learnt a few of his better tricks and has even added a few of his own.Just because it is only escapist entertainment doesn't mean that it isn't also very good. It is actually very, very good.",The Sixth Sense
157,rebeljenn,average,5,18 June 2006,"'The Sixth Sense' is a horror film about a young boy who has the power to see the ghosts of people who have passed away. The boy gets help from a psychologist and tries to learn how to fit in and know a normal life. The film succeeds in playing the horror as well as cinematography and a plot that makes the audience think. Most of the horror in the film is portrayed in a way that gets the imagination to work and plays on suspense. The plot is engaging and it also makes the audience think. However, I thought that it was predictable and knew what was happening before the end of the film. The performances are done well, and this film does have several strong points, but as a film overall, I think that it was average.",The Sixth Sense

Because with the talent of making such a movie as this, you're obviously having a huge knowledge inside movie making, though the three movies he has made later have none challenged this.We get to know Dr. Malcolm Crowe that's a child psychologist. He's trying to help Cole, a little boy that hides a terrible secret from the rest of the people he knows. His unbalanced mental side makes big problems with his mother that tries helping him out, but soon it's obvious that the only person being able to help Cole, is Malcolm...The movie shocked when it arrived, not for being extra violent or using more ""f-words"" that usual, this is just such a original, brilliant and story based around a fabulous twist. Bruce Willis stars as Malcolm Crowe in a great way, his truly fine performance of a child psychologist who's failed once and truly can't forgive himself for that - is a character that Willis does in a great way. Haley Joel Osment delivers one of the best child performances of all time, giving such a fright and sense to it all that you just got to be stunned.THE SIXTH SENSE gives you frightening scenes picked from the best of horror, and also pure humanity scenes with dialog and getting to know the characters in a absolutely wonderful way - and Shyamalan's unique way to mix together freaky horror with human drama, is without doubt one of the thing's that makes this, and all of his movies so interesting, exciting, smart and well made. This movie is his greatest achievement, because it reaches to the drama scene better than any of his other movies - but though shall be said; M. Night Shyamalan is a wonderful director that's delivered the goods on all four / UNBREAKABLE, SIGNS and THE VILLAGE.Shyamalan also does a cameo as in the rest of his movies.

Hovewer, it did pass almost 15 years since the time of filming of this film, film industry did change extraordinary over these years.Acting is excellent, by all the actors, especially by the little kid.I would not rate this film so high on the ladder of IDBM films 250.

161,esteban1747,A boy who sees the phantoms,6,17 October 2002,"The boy Haley Joel Osment starred very well this thriller. He was only 11 years old when he played the role of a boy able to see and to talk to the dead people and, obviously, to see more than any other mortal. Being able to communicate with the spirits he knew what really happened in the past. The film is very suggestive, but Bruce Willis did not put enough strength on it, his acting was normal, and far to be of the same level as Haley Joel.

I did like the ending quite a bit, and the acting was solid throughout, but in general, the film was uninteresting and rarely entertaining.

163,raymond-15,I was on the edge of my seat!,8,31 October 1999,"Some people have powers of perception beyond the normal range of the five senses.  The movie explores this strange phenomenon. Most scenes in this film are dark and shadowy with the camera moving stealthily through doorways, stairways, cellars and attics.  I was on the edge of my seat most of the time not knowing what to expect next but knowing full well that there was something threatening in the shadows.  Several times I leapt in my seat which says a lot for the development of the spooky atmosphere and fine direction.  At first the story is rather confusing because not everything is revealed in the beginning.  It's a case of mental gymnastics as we sort out the clues concerning the various characters.  Bruce Willis is great and his scenes with the young boy hold our attention as we delve into the various possibilities until finally the truth is revealed.  In the opening scenes with the psychopathic intruder we experience our first shock but there are more to follow.  The psychopath shouts too much thus blurring his speech which makes it difficult to comprehend his words.  I enjoyed the argument with the school-teacher in the room which was once a court-house and the ""locked in the attic"" scene which scared everybody including the audience.

164,Christian_Dimartino,"Overrated, but good.",8,10 August 2011,"The Sixth sense has been hailed by some as one of the greatest horror stories ever put on film. But I must disagree. I won't deny that I enjoyed the film, but to compare it to Rosemary's baby, Psycho, or The Omen... well, it just can't be done.The Sixth sense revolves around a psychiatrist(Bruce Willis) who is asked to investigate a disturbed child named Cole(Haley Joel Osment). Cole has been having some odd behavior, and the reason why is that he is haunted by ghosts.The Sixth sense, if you've never seen it, has a brilliant twist. Unfortunately, most people have probably blown it for those who haven't seen it. But at the time the twist was brilliant. Also, I loved the ending, and the overall message. And the film has got some chilling moments, and very good performances. Osment obviously steals the show, but Willis is strong too.But you can't sit there and tell me that this film was Oscar worthy. There were plenty of films in 1999 that deserved it more than this. Magnolia, Being John Malkovich, Election, all great films. You could probably sit M. Night Shamylan down in a room and watch Magnolia and he would probably say it was a ton better. And thats because it was.The Sixth sense is a good film, but its another Oscar nominee that just doesn't deserve it. Osment deserved a nomination, and Toni Collette, who was snubbed, would have deserved one too. But the rest is unnecessary. Good, but overrated.B+",The Sixth Sense

166,Movie-12,One of the years best films--with a jaw dropping final twist. ***1/2,9,22 August 1999,"THE SIXTH SENSE (1999) ***1/2Starring: Bruce Willis, Haley Joel Osment, Olivia Williams, Toni Collette and Glenn Fitzgerald Written and directed by: M. Night Shyamalan   106 minutes   Rated PG-13 (for much intense material and some related gore)By Blake French:""The Sixth Sense"" is one of the years best films. It brings together effectively and efficiently every concept of why horror films exist. So many movies these days do not live up to the promise of their genre, but ""The Sixth Sense"" does it so perfectly and convincingly  that it is almost hard to tell weather this film is based on actual events or not.
""The Sixth Sense"" tells the story of a psychiatrist named Malcolm Crowe, who, in the film's opening, is confronted by a past client who has broke into his house waving a gun over his head screaming things like ""You lied,"" ""You did not help me"" and especially mysteriously ""Do you know why you are afraid when you're along--I do."" He shoots Malcolm and kills himself.
The film then cuts to months later, where Malcolm is curious to investigate a nine year old boy, Cole Sear, who has the same rare symptoms as his patient that killed himself recently. He feels it is his duty to cure the child's illness to make up for his slacking off on the other unfortunate patient. After investigation, and some bonding between the curious Malcolm and the always terrified Cole, he discovers that the boy has a secret. One that is so personal and unbelievable Cole has never explained it to anyone, including his struggling single mother. Soon, however, Cole tells Malcolm his concealed message, ""I see dead people,"" the young boy whispers, ""they walk around like everyone else...they don't even know that they're dead,"" he explains. Naturally at first Malcolm disbelieves him, but as new evidence arrives, and issues involving his wife arise, he must choose between the one he loves or the boy he'll never forget.The story setup to ""The Sixth Sense"" is thought-out and detailed enough so that we ponder upon it and become involved. It is handled with such delicacy that even the slightest flaw would have destroyed the entire film in which its basis is held together with. Through character issues and the personal territory this film covers, we are weary about entering the character's lives; this is private area hear and it is none of our bussing what is going on inside the head of young Cole Sear. Surly some audiences will feel intimidated about learning his secret since it is so built up with a peek of high tension. The adult terror material is all in line with the film's subject matter; there is no excess violence or gore, nor is there any sub-plots that distract the story from its final message. There is some distraction in the relationship with Malcolm and his wife. But by the end, everything fits together like a perfectly pieced mind puzzle. 
The film is not without flaws, however. Though the subplots do not sidetrack the film, a few of them do not provide enough information to serve a purpose in the plot. For instance, there is a subplot where a dead girl asks Cole to deliver a secret tape involving her death to her father. It has some revealing and emotionally on target material, but we know so little about the characters involving this story that I felt a little lost. And some particular wounds found on the bodies of the individuals inflicted with the ""sixth sense"" seem significant, but are never fully explained. At times in the movie I felt like the characters were dragging on and on, and felt myself shouting inside phrases like  ""come on, get to the point.""
For the most part, however, the characters pull the plot through tedious moments, like the ones I have listed. The movie has a final twist that excels beyond any other twist revealed in any other thriller I have ever seen. More perplexing than ""Entrapment."" More jaw-dropping than ""Wild Things."" More compelling than ""Goodbye Lover."" And  more awe inspiring than ""Arlington Road."" It is disturbing but somehow completely believable. I am very tempted  to describe the content of the final five minutes to you--but I am afraid that it is up to you to figure out. This twist is so neat that it will make you want to see the movie over again, in order to see if throughout the production the film lived up to the material. This is a very tricky ending to succeed with, but ""The Sixth Sense"" does it wonderfully.Brought to you by Hollywood Pictures.",The Sixth Sense
167,virek213,"For me, the last great horror film of the 20th century",10,10 August 2001,"Just for my money, the 1999 thriller THE SIXTH SENSE was the last really great horror movie of the 20th century--forget even the much-debated BLAIR WITCH PROJECT.What makes THE SIXTH SENSE so good is writer/director M. Night Shayamalan's decision to take this story in a manner which is totally the antithesis of today's horror films--i.e., no extraneous blood and guts or nudity--and build a spooky atmosphere.  The connection between the psychologist (Bruce Willis) and the young boy (Haley Joel Osment) who sees visions of dead people is one of the more honest adult-to-child connections I've ever seen outside of a Steven Spielberg film.  And no matter what anyone else says, the first time I saw this film, I did not see the twist ending coming, nor did a lot of other people either their first time around.  That coda is perhaps the best sting-in-the-tail ending since the original PLANET OF THE APES; and somehow, I have the feeling that Rod Serling, no slouch with sting-in-the-tail endings he (see ""The Twilight Zone"" and APES), would have been proud of Shayamalan for it.Elements of CARRIE, THE SHINING, and POLTERGEIST, three great horror films all, are present in THE SIXTH SENSE--and yet, this doesn't feel too terribly derivative.  I'd put this movie very close to the aforementioned three movies in the horror film pantheon because of its deeply penetrating story and its psychological scares, which were all honestly earned.  In summary, THE SIXTH SENSE is a winner.",The Sixth Sense
168,FlickJunkie-2,Clever story with too many holes (SPOILER WARNING),7,13 April 2000,"THIS COMMENT CONTAINS SPOILERS INCLUDING SPECIFIC REFERENCES THAT REVEAL THE ENDING.  IT IS HIGHLY RECOMMENDED YOU SEE THE FILM BEFORE READING THIS COMMENT.It seems most people fall into one of two camps on this film.  They either love it or hate it (it would seem that more love it).  My sentiments lie with neither camp.  This is a fascinating and clever story that is well filmed but poorly crafted.  Plot holes abound and Director/Writer M. Night Shyamalan has to fudge all over the place to keep the surprise ending a surprise.  In my comments here, I have commented many times on the dangers of writers directing their own work.  In almost every case, the director lacks the necessary objectivity to identify and excise plot flaws.  In this case they were glaring.Many questions come to mind.  Why was Cole (Haley Joel Osment) afraid of every ghost but Malcolm (Bruce Willis)?  Why did every ghost appear in a form that showed how they died except Malcolm?  They were all bloody and disfigured; why not Malcolm?  Where was the bullet hole in his shirt and the blood?  I watched the movie a second time and there were a number of scenes where he had no jacket.  He always wore the same shirt, but there was no bullet hole or blood in any scene.Clearly the biggest question is why it was never cold when Malcolm was in the room except in the very last scene with his wife (Olivia Williams).  He was in scenes with Cole's mother (Toni Collette), a restaurant full of people, a theater full of parents, a doctor, and on and on and yet in no scene did anyone seem remotely chilly, no less seeing their breath.So, I have a fundamental problem calling this a great motion picture. However, it was very well filmed from a technical standpoint and produced some excellent suspense throughout that kept the viewer engaged.The acting was fair to excellent.  Toni Collette was mediocre at best as Cole's mother.  She overacted in almost every scene and her chemistry wasn't very good with the boy until the last scene when he told her what her mother said.  Likewise, Olivia Williams didn't bowl me over as Malcolm's wife.Bruce Willis gave a good performance, but he is out of his element playing the sensitive and self doubting type.  He always comes across as a bit whiny when he tries to play nice guy parts.  His forte is playing the tough, strong courageous type and he would best serve his career by staying with those types of parts.Finally, there is young Haley Joel Osment as Cole.  He gave an excellent performance and was the linchpin that held the whole film together.  He was very versatile in his portrayal of various emotions.  He handled fear, playfulness, affection and anger with equal aplomb.  His physiognomy was right for the part as well, as he looked very nerdy and self conscious, exactly what was needed for the part.I rated this film a 7/10.  It was entertaining and it had real potential, but it had too many flaws to realize it.",The Sixth Sense

THe thing that manly clicked about this movie was the smoothness at which the director/writer Mr. Shyamalan tells his story in just about 2 hours, which is well paced yet not too fast, unlike some movies that are very well made, but extended too much even after you feel that the story should have got over.I was utterly shocked during the end of this movie when I watched it the first time as I never thought of such a thing as most of the Bollywood movies are not thriller and very few of them have a mastermind of a writer like Shyamalan to have such a mind- boggling ending. That's probably one of the reason that he was presented the Padma Shree or Padma Bhushan award in India. I haven't seen his other films except for the Village which too was good but after this movie, I feel that he has rightfully been handed this award, unlike some people in India who expressed their displeasure when he was given this award. The reason why they felt it was unfair was because they had not seen this magnificent masterpiece.I was glad to know that it was a small budget film and did not contain exorbitant furniture or other accessories just to advertise the products or even a huge haunted mansion that would have made this a typical horror flick. This movie haunted me from within, than scaring me from outside or making me sick by showing people cutting other peoples' flesh etc. It was a wonderful psychological thriller with no fancy items to show how expensive the movie is. This movie had some of the most memorable scenes in cinematic history, like the sick girl's story and the iconic climax. It also had one of the best performances given by the actors. I would especially like to mention the little kid who acted so well that I was completely in amazement that he did this at the age of eleven. Bruce Willis too has done a commendable job and I thought that he would be worthy enough to get at least an Oscar nomination, which he didn't. The kid's mother too has done a very good job, especially in the emotional sequences but I felt that her make up was overdone and it made her look like an evil character.I think I'll sum it up by saying that this is one of the best thrillers I have watched. I'll give it a nine out of 10.",The Sixth Sense
171,movieguy1021,The Sixth Sense: 10/10,10,12 January 2003,"The second highest grossing movie of 1999, the 14th highest grossing movie of all time, and six Oscar nominations are pretty high achievements. And to whom do they belong? M. Night Shyamalan's The Sixth Sense.The Sixth Sense begins with simple enough opening credits, and then we see Dr. Malcolm Crowe (Bruce Willis) with his wife Anna (Olivia Williams) after Malcolm had won a prestigious award for child psychiatry. However, they hear rustling, and a former patient, Vincent Grey (Donnie Wahlberg), comes in and accuses him of not curing himself. Vincent then shoots Malcolm and himself.Six or eight months later, Malcolm finds a new patient, Cole Sear (Haley Joel Osment). He has problems at home, and so does Malcolm. It seems that Malcolm has put so much time into his work he can't spend any more time with Anna. However, as Malcolm's sessions with Cole become more productive and we find out why Cole is so upset-`I see dead people.' So Malcolm has to figure out why they attack Cole while sorting out problems at home with Anna.There is not one thing I would change about this movie. The acting is top-notch, the chills are supreme and genuine, and I found myself loving this movie.Osment was, for lack of a better word, screwed at the Oscars. He deserved his Best Supporting Actor Oscar more than Michael Caine (though he also was excellent in The Cider House Rules). Osment displayed solid emotions and really did everything his role required him to do. If Tatum O'Neal can win an Oscar at a young age, so could Osment. Willis didn't say one `yippie-kay-yay' and portrayed his role earnestly and with lots of heart. Williams and Toni Collette (who plays Cole's mother) also did outstanding jobs, but perhaps the most standout performance (next to Osment) was Wahlberg. His part was tiny, but important, and he worked hard for it, losing thirty pounds and displaying true fear, just like Osment.Rather than going for the ultra-gore, Shyamalan went for perfect creeps. With chilling music that gets you at the bone, he uniquely displayed torments to the characters and to us. Although I have seen the movies many times, I was still spooked. I feel glad that he didn't have to go to the lowest common denominator and show blood and brain matter everywhere (during a suicide, he was nice enough to keep it off screen). This is a movie that, if you rent on a Saturday night, you'll be up till dawn.Shyamalan (who also wrote) decided to put in strong dramatic elements. Willis slowly losing his wife was played with great tenderness and not mockery or cruelness. Its ginger display of human life taking a turn for the worse really stood out. That is good movie making when you can combine three things to make a standout movie: acting, thrills, and drama.I actually wanted The Sixth Sense to go on for a lot longer. I wanted to see more of the plight of Malcolm and Cole; I was transfixed. And the ending twist still was somewhat of a shock, even though I know what it was. I couldn't see it even if it stared me in the face, which it did. Shyamalan put in symbolism, which becomes obvious once you see it the second time. Evidence for the twist is so obvious when you are watching it for a repeated time, you'll wonder how you missed it. As I said before: that's great moviemaking.My rating: 10/10Rated PG-13 for intense thematic material and violent images.",The Sixth Sense
172,Peach-2,Great Twist.,8,19 October 1999,"Every now and then a film comes along and really surprises you with its power. The Sixth Sense is such a film. I followed this film very carefully and still didn't see the ending that was heading my way. My jaw literally dropped to the ground and I had to wipe my chin of all the sticky cola product syrup. Bruce Willis is very subtle in the film and the young boy is very sweet. The credit really goes to the director, he sets up atmosphere and mood and does a very nice job. I really liked the cinematography and the production design as well. Do yourself a favor and get up off your butt and go see this film.",The Sixth Sense
173,khatcher-2,"Drama / Thriller / Horror / Mystery: yes, all that, but without all those silly FX",7,3 March 2003,"I nearly did not watch this one as I see no future in Bruce Willis categorized as one of those he-men in so-called action films: Seagal, Schwarzenegger, van Damme, Lundgren, Willis and the ilk are patently for underdeveloped fourteen-year-olds. Fortunately several things caught my eye on IMDb and It has been years since I last saw a film which might vaguely be categorized horror thriller which so held my attention, indeed so many years that I cannot even recall its title. Evidently Bruce Willis did not do this film for the pay-cheque, as he put all his heart and soul into it, such that he was not just simply bearable but very acceptable indeed. I hope he will do a few more like this film and leave the bravura stuff to the chimpanzees cavorting about the place with nothing to show or tell apart from biceps and fly-sized brains. Good work here, which obviously made or broke the film.But it is Haley Joel Osment who towers over him: an extraordinary performance from this eleven-year-old (when making the film). He has certainly come a long way since his minor rôle in `Forrest Gump', and judging by his performance in `The Sixth Sense' he has a long way yet still to go.  I would have like to see more of Mischa Barton in this film, but the story would not have handled two big parts from tender-aged actors. After her astounding rôle in `Lawn Dogs' (1997) (qv) together with an incredible Sam Rockwell, I had expected - hoped for - something greater than her brief appearances here. However, this is only a small gripe, taking what the picture is worth as a whole.During this film I uttered to my wife: but this is Oscar stuff. So I hopped up to see IMDb, and discovered that indeed the young Osment got a nomination for his rôle in this film. I am not at all surprised. Full marks, then, to Mr. Manoj Night Shyamalan for so wonderfully piecing together the parts and getting some really absorbing scenes during his story. One scene has the young boy lying in bed and Bruce Willis at his side: I assure you sparks, flew between the two actors  not just simply `good chemistry'.Of films of this genre it is definitely one of the very very few I would like to see again.",The Sixth Sense

176,OriginalMovieBuff21,Interesting and twisturning,9,18 September 2004,"The Sixth Sense in many ways was excellent. The actors were great, Bruce Wills on behalf is good in mostly in all of his films and Haley Joel Osment, at that time was in the process of a new actor and he did great. Most kids in movies are little punks that I can't stand and are just flat out terrible at acting but Haley put up a strong performance and that's why, now he's a successful and famous actor (mostly because of this film.) The story was very interesting about a kid who sees dead people and comes to a man to seek help and they both become friends as he is trying to let the fears out of him. In the beginning of the film, I was quite confused of what was going on until the very end I was quite surprised. The ending had one of the best twists I have ever seen in a film yet. It keeps you at the edge of your chair and your like, "" Oh my god, that is so weird. All this time, throughout this movie I was wondering what was going on and now I learned. Wow, that's quite amazing."" That is what you will be thinking. The film was extremely interesting and detailing. There will be many parts in the movie when you can't watch and will have major goosebumps but that's the fun in thriller and horrors, shouldn't be? Good film and very enjoyable to watch and listen to.Hedeen's outlook: 9/10",The Sixth Sense
177,Beejerman,STANDING OVATION! - (10 stars out of 10),10,11 February 2019,"The stage curtains open ...It's hard to believe that ""The Sixth Sense"" celebrates its 20th anniversary this year. I remember thinking to myself when I first saw it 20 years ago that it was an instant classic. And now today, it still is. I don't know what else I could possibly say that hasn't already been said about his wonderful movie after all this time and after all the reviews. Since it is indeed a well known classic film, there aren't too many who still don't know what its twist, surprise ending is. However, being as such, I wouldn't want to ruin anything for that one person out there who hasn't seen it by giving it away in just a few paragraphs.What I will say is this. There are few films like it - and few that can or will shell shock you like ""The Sixth Sense"" does. Haley Joel Osment was a find and perfectly cast as the troubled little boy who ""can see dead people"". For this movie to work, his perfomance had to be convincing. Well, not only was it convincing, it became a landmark performance that people still talk about today. The only other child actor that wowed me as much as Osment did in this one, was Kirsten Dunst in ""Interview With The Vampire"". In my personal opinion, those two performances are the single best by child actors in the history of movie making.Bruce Willis also scores here. And, of course, it all came from the mind of M. Night Shyamalan - who forever made it on to the map of special directors with this movie. I have seen it numerous times - it is very re-watchable and just as enjoyable as the first viewing. Maybe the initial surprise and shock isn't there, but I love it all the same.I highly recommend this movie. It is perfectly made. One for the ages. If for some reason, you have not yet seen this movie, and you do not know the surprise waiting for you, do not read anything else about it. Put on the popcorn, turn the lights down low and curl up on your couch - and enjoy one of the best movies to ever be shown.",The Sixth Sense

179,ronakkotian,One of the biggest surprises of 1999,8,12 June 2021,"WARNING: *SPOILERS*At this point, M. Night Shyamalan is known for his notoriously bad films but there was a point where he did make great films and it all started with The Sixth Sense.The Sixth Sense follows child psychiatrist Malcolm Crowe as he tries to help a young boy named Cole Sear who may be harbouring a dark secret.One of the biggest surprises of 1999 was The Sixth Sense. For a film to be written and directed by someone who not many people knew of, it's astounding how much of an impact M. Night Shyamalan had on people and films in general. It's a film that's become engraved into our culture with countless parodies of some of the most famous scenes in the film itself. Shyamalan really showcased his talent as a filmmaker with The Sixth Sense and made a name for himself. It's sad how his career declined immensely a few years later.The Sixth Sense works in many ways and Shyamalan did a great job bringing this story to life. This film is mainly known for its twist ending where we find out Malcolm is actually dead. On a first watch, this twist seemingly comes out of nowhere and is shocking when it takes place. However, on a rewatch, there are so many clever clues Shyamalan hides throughout that build to this climactic twist. When we see Malcolm and Lynn sit opposite each other, we assume both were talking before Cole walks in when in reality Lynn was simply waiting for her son whilst Malcolm did the same. The dinner sequence with Malcolm and his wife is also done so well. When he sits down, the chair doesn't move and his wife doesn't give eye contact at all since she cannot see him. It's a very smart and well constructed twist that gives us many hints without drawing attention to itself whilst changing our viewing experience the second time we watch it.Shyamalan also made clever use of the colour red to show the collision between the real world and the supernatural world. Cole wears red in one scene whilst going up a red staircase towards a red balloon, the mother who kept her daughter sick wears red next to roses and Malcolm is seen constantly pulling at a red doorknob. It's incredible how much thought and detail Shyamalan added to this film.Easily one of the best parts is Haley Joel Osment. He is truly spectacular in this film as he delivers one of the best child performances I've seen. I can see why he got nominated for an Oscar. Bruce Willis is also fantastic as Malcolm. There's a great amount of subtlety in his performance and he delivers emotions really well. I've loved Toni Collette in everything I've seen her in and she is also very good here. I could feel her pain as she's unable to understand what her child's going through.The Sixth Sense is easily one of M. Night Shyamalan's best. Whilst I do think the film is a tad too slow, this is the film that will remind people how great Shyamalan can be. He proved to numerous people the skill he possesses with The Sixth Sense and I hope he regains his footing and gets back to making great films like this.",The Sixth Sense

Shyamalan delivers a story with some likable, well-drawn characters. There's some occasional good (and gruesome) shocks that keep the tension edgy and the plot builds to a startling twist ending. Shyamalan's direction is slick with lots of dark atmosphere and creepy imagery.The films stars are another strong feature.

183,departed07,"I really, really tried to like this movie.",4,19 February 2008,"But the problem was with the director's choice of inspiration.M. Night Shyamalan started with what could've been a classic in my book, until i saw the whole package and realized that it was just too familiar. It was in 1999 when I saw the movie with my father and we had gotten into the film from the shocks; Haley Joel Osment is such a talented actor that he truly deserved the Academy Award for the best supporting male role. Bruce Willis did much in this drama as the psychologist trying to help Haley Joel's character, which shows a rather different approach than him killing bad guys as John McClain.My complaint had to be the infamous ending where when i saw it in theater, I recognized immediately that Shyamlan took the idea of an episode from the Nickelodeon show ""Are you afraid of the Dark?"" called The Tale of the Dream Girl using the same premise. Yet, the director got a nomination for original screenplay that he never mentioned his so called ""Inspiration"" to anybody.Haley, don't stop acting in dramatic movies; M.

184,andrewroy-04316,The Sixth Sense set a high bar for emotionally driven thrillers with strong endings,8,24 December 2019,"While it's been spoiled to death culturally, it's because The Sixth Sense had such an impactful twist, which has been the benchmark of thrillers since. While there are a couple frustratingly unclear plot points, the broader story, editing, and ending are all excellent. Even before the ending, Shyamalan draws the viewer in by framing it as a character-based story with Malcolm trying to correct for his past mistakes and Cole trying to get through school as the odd kid out. Osment is truly excellent and the best child acting performance I've seen, and Willis is quite good as well. The tension of how Cole will overcome his ""gift"" and how Malcolm will help both Cole and his marriage keep the energy high throughout, but it is the twist that adds layers to the movie and elevates it. There are plenty of hints and allusions to Malcolm being dead, but it's subtle enough in most of the social scenes to be not given away. I realized the twist about halfway through but was still fascinated to see how Cole's gift would be explained - why is he the only one who can see ghosts? I was really disappointed that was totally ignored. I also think it would've been much more plausible to say that the ghosts don't actually interact with the material world, as the suspension of disbelief that ghosts move things around all the time but nobody ever notices is a little tough. I think the idea of having ghosts live a dreamlike existence where they see what they want to see and are only there as long as they need to solve what was left undone in their life was brilliant and is why the twist adds so much depth to Malcolm's character. The hanging people didn't make much sense in this explanation - they don't see what they want to see and they don't have anything they want to solve, but outside of that the other ghosts followed that idea very well. It's fully deserving of its iconic thriller/twist status, and definitely has enough emotional investment in its characters to be more than just a twist based movie.",The Sixth Sense
185,Java_Joe,The best movie he's come up with.,8,24 June 2019,"The Sixth Sense came out of nowhere and stunned audiences worldwide. It was daring, inventive and had a twist at the end that cemented M Night Shyamalan as a true auteur. He was heralded as being the next Stephen Spielberg but it seems all this went to his head and he peaked too soon because while his next movie was well received it started a long line of increasingly bad movies. But let's only talk of this one.The movie starts with a young boy who is having trouble in his life because he can, as the movie states, ""see dead people"". Essentially he sees the ghosts of people that have passed on and they still require some kind of action to take place before they're able to leave this world. Enter Bruce Willis playing a psychiatrist who helps the boy come to terms with this ability of his and how to maybe help those that are trapped in this world.The movie is inventive. It's well done. It's shot nicely and the actors are giving their all. It's truly a great movie that surprised a lot of people when it came out. Not only due to the story but the twist at the end which a lot of people were genuinely surprised at.However, his follow up to this, ""Unbreakable"", while a decent movie in and of itself is not as good and each movie afterwards got steadily worse.

186,action-6,Surprisingly good!,9,30 January 2000,"I wanted to see this movie because Bruce Willis was in it. I was expecting an average thriller made better by one of my favorite actors. I was extremely surprised by the quality of The Sixth Sense. This has to be one of THE movies of 1999. Bruce Willis plays a psychologist who is working with children. One night he is attacked in his own home by one of his old clients, who is now a grown-up. Willis`s character is named  Malcolm Crowe, and he is determined to never fail again.  One day he is going to see a new client: a boy named Cole Sear, who is having some kind of unknown trouble. This movie is a horrorthriller, there  aren`t that many shocks in it, but it is a well directed and exciting film.

189,CinematicInceptions,Surprisingly good story and not very horror.,8,1 August 2015,"If I were to sum up this movie in one word, it would be: unexpected. The twist at the end is by its very definition unexpected, though I'd read about the ending beforehand so it didn't really surprise me. However, the movie also unexpectedly well thought out, breaking from the precedent set by other horror movies, and is surprisingly un-scary. It really isn't a horror movie at all, but rather a drama with the horror elements as a bonus. It's kind of like the more intense and high-octane scenes in Interstellar, where they aren't what makes the movie great but are just kind of an added bonus. At it's core, the movie is about two people helping each other deal with a problem that no one else knows about and about redemption. I'm sure there are a lot of dead people in real life (is that a paradox?) who wish they had another shot to make things right.The story moves at a nice pace and presents the exposition and state of affairs at the beginning of the movie well. Everything that needs to be addressed is addressed, but in a plausible manner without unrealistic expositional dialogue. There are subplots with Cole having to tell his mom about his gift and Malcolm dealing with his strained relationship with his wife, and they weave nicely into the main plot line of Malcolm helping Cole find a solution to his being a ghost seer or whatever you want to call it. His ability is kind of like the inverse of The Lovely Bones, where a dead person helps the living and in this film a living person helps the dead. I've heard that the ghost seeing plot basis is a very old concept in cinema (which is probably what people will start saying about retired hit-man movies in a few years). Whether or not that's true, I still felt like the story here was strong enough that I don't care how recycled it is.The characters are the brightest spot of the movie. They may not be the most memorable, but they are very well written, scripted, and acted. Cole isn't very relatable given his plight, but he is easy to sympathize with and comes off as pretty convincing in his description of the ghosts that he encounters. He's realistically scripted. Not too cute like a clueless little kid, but not way too intelligent like kids are in a lot of kids movies. Malcolm clearly takes pride in his work and cares about his his patients, which makes him a likable protagonist. Besides that, he clearly wants to retain a positive relationship with his wife Anna, who doesn't have much screen time but is kind of important. Cole's mom does her best to raise him alone, but seems to be under a lot of stress the whole movie, though we never quite learn why. Anna is a fairly static character, but has a lot of personality and provides a bit of an Achilles heel for Malcolm.It's impressive it's execution, but not mind-blowing. There aren't any great special effects, but the directing, lighting, and shooting are great. The script and acting, again, are top notch in a very subtle and simple way.For perspective viewers, I'll just say that you're in for a good story, quality execution, and some good characters, but nothing scary, and nothing flashy. Watch it in one sitting if you can and make sure you're in a distraction free environment because there is a lot of quiet dialogue. There's a little gore, but nothing too disturbing unless you typically get skittish over blood. I'd recommend it to pretty much anyone and hope that they keep in mind that the Sixth Sense is not a horror movie. Overall Rating: 8.4/10.",The Sixth Sense
190,jhaggardjr,Good thriller,8,30 April 2000,"I've got an unusual story to tell you about ""The Sixth Sense"". When I first saw this movie when it first came out last August, I didn't care for it that much. Then the movie continued to make tons of money at the box office. I kept asking myself ""did I see this movie the wrong way?"" I didn't find it all that scary. When I go to see a horror film, I expect some scares and shocks and this movie didn't seem to provide that. Then this past February it got 6 Oscar nominations including Best Picture. So on the basis of that, I went back to see it a second time. And you know what? It turns out that this movie is pretty good after all. The second time I saw ""The Sixth Sense"" I saw the movie as a drama instead of a horror film and on that basis it works. The one thing I do agree on (even when I saw it the first time) is the outstanding performance by eleven-year-old Haley Joel Osment as Cole Sear, the boy who ""see's dead people"". He's terrific in this film. I hope we'll see lots of him in years to come. Also terrific, Australian actress Toni Collette as Lynn, Cole's mother. I didn't even know see was from Down Under since she's playing an American. I was very happy that Osment and Collette received Oscar nominations for their performances here (I think they both should have won). Bruce Willis, who was not recognized by the Academy (unfairly), gives one of the best performances of his career as Dr. Malcolm Crowe, the child psychologist who tries to help the boy. ""The Sixth Sense"" is a well made thriller from an unknown writer-director, M. Night Shyamalan, who received Oscar nominations for Best Director and Best Original Screenplay. Too bad he had to lose both (if ""The Sixth Sense"" had been based on a novel and Shyamalan had adapted the novel to the big screen, he would have won the Oscar for Best Adapted Screenplay; the movie didn't have a chance against ""American Beauty""). ""The Sixth Sense"" is definitely one of the biggest sleeper hits ever. Good job by all.*** (out of four)",The Sixth Sense
191,SKG-2,Strange but ultimately rewarding,8,25 August 1999,"First of all, I've read a few comments about the pace of this movie being too slow.  I sort of agree with that, but I think it's refreshing to have a movie which takes its time and builds things with subtlety(although here, as I said before, I think it took a little TOO much time).  And I think it was realistic at how long it took for the boy to learn to trust the doctor and for how long it took the doctor to discover what was really going on.Having said all that, in addition to the pace, there were some times when I felt a little queasy, like I wasn't sure what exactly the movie was trying to say.  At other times, I was caught up in it, especially in the performances of Willis and Osment.  Then came the famous twist ending, and I will tell you that I was quite surprised, and it's making me turn the movie over and over again in my mind. I probably will have to see this again. Overall, while I don't think it's the best of the year, it is a good film.",The Sixth Sense
192,Al_The_Strange,"""I see dead people.""",9,10 October 2012,"When this movie came out, it garnered a huge amount of hype and acclaim, and I regarded this film as something of a masterpiece. It represented a type of quality filmmaking and storytelling that only men like Hitchcock seemed to master. It was one of the few films that initially established M. Night Shyamalan as a promising director of quality substance (a reputation that would only last for his next two films, Unbreakable and Signs; the rest of his work became arguably weaker and weaker, until reaching rock bottom with The Last Airbender).The story is pretty evenly-paced, but it is a slow-moving one. There's not a whole lot of conflict involved with this, but it's built pretty sturdily on the occasional paranormal fright scene and plenty of mystery.What really matters here is the story, and it is perfectly constructed. It's most famous for its twist ending, but it's not just an arbitrary narrative trick; in this case, the whole movie was built around that twist, so that it holds up on multiple viewings and gives new meaning every time. With quality characters that you can actually care for, and some strong themes concerning people and their gifts, the rest of the story stands strongly on its own and has plenty of insight.This film is immortalized with solid photography and editing. Acting is extremely delicate and subtle, with great nuanced performances by Bruce Willis and Haley Joel Osment. Writing shows some penchant for a little too much exposition (a standard complaint for most of Shyamalan's work, and it really only shows when compared to his later features), but is otherwise very good. This production doesn't have anything lavish, but it makes good use of its utilitarian sets, props, and costumes. Music is nice.4.5/5 (Entertainment: Pretty Good | Story: Perfect | Film: Very Good)",The Sixth Sense
193,AKS-6,Good film -- nothing more,6,7 January 2000,"I really wanted to love this film, I have waited for it to open in Sweden for so long. Unfortunately, I did not love it. I came pretty close to not even liking it, but well, in the end I did like it. Last night I saw ""Fight Club"" at the cinema, I hadn't expected very much, but I walked out of the cinema thrilled and enthusiastic and ""wowed"". I walked out, after having seen ""The Sixth Sense"", thinking about all the plot inconsistencies. I tried to overlook them and say: ""Look Anna, you're too stupid to realise that those ten or fifteen plot inconsistencies do not exist. Surely, there are a ""logic"" explanation for everything."" I failed. But as I said, I *did* like it and I was quite spooked at times, but after having seen Edward Norton and Brad Pitt and David Fincher (well, I didn't actually see *him*) in action the night before I just don't think I was ready to accept ""The Sixth Sense"" as a great movie experience. I *should* love this film, and I know that I probably would have if it wasn't for a) the boring first 45 minutes and b) the fact that I knew there was a twist. I think that if the ending had come as a *real* surprise, like ""oh-my-god-is-there-a-twist-in-this-film?!"" I would have appreciated it much more. Now I spent half of the movie looking for clues to the twist (I didn't know *what* the twist was, though).Well, the film is good and Haley Joel Osment is fantastic -- a child actor that would actually deserve a Golden Globe or an Oscar (unlike Anna Paquin). And Bruce Willis was good as well! Okay, he's not Kevin Spacey or Edward Norton, and he never will be, but he actually did a great job in this film. I'm surprised. Well, I give this film a 6 out of 10, although I thought a lot about giving it a 5. A huge disappointment -- but still a good film.",The Sixth Sense
194,Angeneer,Much more than a thriller,9,14 February 2006,"The power of the Sixth Sense lies on its critics. The rush of so many people to ascertain they had got it, shows how brilliant the script and the direction was. When the credits rolled we all felt fooled by Shyamalan, we all thought there must have been a flaw we haven't noticed. But no, the story is flawless, the hints were there and everything does make sense in the end. Basically, it's so intelligently made it's intimidating, hence the reaction. Shyamalan doesn't fool you, he simply outsmarts you. To paraphrase a quote from the movie, he makes you see only what he wants you to see. This is why you have to watch this film at least twice in order to appreciate how masterfully crafted it is.Now the acting. A movie can take pride if one of the leads throws an exceptional performance. When you have two magnificent, Oscar caliber performances, what more can you really ask from your actors. This is both Bruce Willis' and Haley Joel Osment's best role to date. And it makes the Sixth Sense the only movie after Leon that the adult/child relationship really works.Let me finish by saying that I consider a major spoiler even the title Sixth Sense. In order to truly enjoy this movie, you shouldn't know it has anything to do with supernatural. What's the fun when you know even before the first minute that this is about ghosts? Not to mention that the word twist is a spoiler by itself! Once more, I urge everyone NOT to read reviews before going to see a movie and if they have to take advice only ask if it was either ""good"" or ""bad"". That's it. Nothing else.",The Sixth Sense
195,chrisbrown6453,"First Saving Private Ryan is snubbed by the Academy, now The Sixth Sense.",9,25 August 2000,"Ah, The Sixth Sense is by far one of the best movies of 1999, in the same class with Fight Club.  I have waited a very long time for a movie like this to scare me, and the wait was well worth it. Bruce Willis is excellent as Dr. Malcolm Crowe, a distinguished child psychologist haunted by the painful memory of a disturbed young patient he was unable to help.  Willis has had some serious dramatic roles in his long career, but none this extreme. Whoever said `Never work with kids or animals' was right in this case.  As great as Willis was in The Sixth Sense, 10 year old Haley Joel Osment stole the show with his riveting performance as Cole Sear, a frightened, confused eight year old with a similar condition as the young boy Willis was ultimately unable to help; the ability to `see dead people.' M. Night Shyamalan hit the big time in only his second time behind the camera.  Never before has a director been able to portray the type of fear and surprise on camera that I felt when watching The Sixth Sense, and I know that everyone who watched it feels the same. This is one of those movies where the director challenges the audience to `figure out' the ending before it gives it away, and since it is like that, everyone will be on the edge of their seats trying to guess what will happen next.  I will admit, and I wasn't alone, I never figured it out, and even after the movie was over and for the next few days, I was periodically saying, out loud, `That's why that happened' and `Oh, now I get it.'  This is exactly the reason The Sixth Sense gets a perfect 10 stars from me.",The Sixth Sense
196,chrisbrown6453,"I'll tell you what, for the first hour and 42 minutes I could not understand what the hype was about in The Sixth Sense. But during the last 5 minutes, it completely changed my view and made me leave the the",9,21 June 2002,"Bruce Willis plays child psychologist Dr. Malcolm Crowe. He takes on a young patient named Cole Sear (another name you'd only hear in the movies, played by Haley Joel Osment). Cole has some fear that he can't communicate to the world, but it's something that hurts him both physically and mentally and it's up to Dr. Crowe to help him. Crowe needs to redeem himself because a former patient of his didn't get the help he needed, and one night broke into Crowe's apartment, and shot Crowe before turning the gun on himself. So in Crowe's mind, helping Cole is as much about helping himself, as it is helping the child. When Crowe uncovers the mystery of Cole's fear, it makes him come to a terrifying realization about himself that changes his life forever. So like I said before, for the most part, this movie was very slow moving and never seemed to get to the point. Osment's acting was spectacular for someone so young. He truly seemed afraid at every turn and you felt really sorry for him. Willis seemed to be going through the motions in this one, but I think he understood that the movie was about the kid and not about him, so he needed to be a little more reserved that normal. It's not giving away too much to say that this movie has the mother of all plot twists and when that happened, it really made the movie special. Not many times do you leave a theater actually talking about what just happened and trying to figure it all out. That's what made the movie so entertaining, and why it's been making all this money. People leave the theater not thinking about the boring part, but thinking about the ending. The screenplay itself was just ok. Some of the dialogue seemed extremely cheesy and unnecessary. And there was way too much whispering. A few people I've talked to even said the movie was confusing until the very end. For a truly great movie I think it needed to be entertaining right up until the big twist, and then have the twist take it up to a whole other level, rather than being a so-so movie that becomes good at the end.  See below.I would definitely watch The Sixth Sense over, and over, and over again.
SPOILERThe big twist of course at the end is that Dr. Crowe realizes that he is one of the dead people that Cole can see and talk to. When that hit, it absolutely stunned me. I was not ready for that to be the big plot twist I had heard about. Immediately I think everyone in the theater started to replay the entire movie to make sure it was all possible. And for the most part the screenplay was solid enough that it was possible, especially with the seemingly thrown away line of, ""dead people only see what they want to see"". It's a line that by itself didn't mean anything, but once Crowe realized he was dead, it all came rushing back. But here's my question. Did Crowe not interact with a single person in this movie? When he was at the hospital, did he not talk to one of the doctors? Did he never try and talk to Cole's mother? Wouldn't he have thought at least that people were ignoring him? There's a scene that starts off by showing Dr. Crowe and Cole's mother sitting in chairs facing each other in her living room.  In walks Cole, and Dr. Crowe starts talking to him.  What was going on prior to the scene beginning?  How did Dr, Crowe get into the home?  I know in the movie Cole said that dead people don't think they're dead, but you would think that when one of them tried to talk to a living person they'd realize something was up. Somehow I don't buy the dead people only see what they want to see line covering up the fact that Crowe didn't talk to a single person throughout the film. But otherwise the ending was a very good surprise and completely changed my opinion of the film. So go see it.",The Sixth Sense
197,bbewnylorac,"A lush, absorbing film",8,15 November 2017,"Gorgeous cinematography, rich historic Pennsylvania locations and a tight, intelligent script are what elevates this film above the ordinary horror flick. It has plenty of interesting ideas. Such as, how old buildings have a human history we may not realise, for example the boy Cole's school theatre where there was once a terrible fire, and the three colonial people he sees hanging from a rafter. Cole's kitchen is taken over at night by a battered woman who shrieks and opens all the drawers. It made me think about who used to live in my house. I like the scene where the young couple shop for antique rings - who knows who once owned them? The central affliction of the film - Cole sees dead people - has parallels with sexual abuse. Cole is frightened and disturbed and he can't tell anyone what's wrong because he thinks they won't believe him. He develops little routines, like his figurines and going into a church, to get comfort. The psychologist Malcolm (Bruce Willis) hits on the idea of Cole asking the ghosts what is wrong and offering to help them. It makes you think about angry or sad or disturbed people in the real world. Maybe if someone could get down to the root of their problem, they could get help. Cole discovers that the little girl ghost who keeps vomiting is trying to tell him she was poisoned by her mother, and that no one suspected it. I thought the film could have showed more of this - Cole helping the ghosts out. Malcolm's violent former patient, Vincent (Donnie Wahlberg) is a good reminder that sometimes people's pain is so great they can't be helped. Or maybe Vincent represents what Cole could be like in the future if he is not helped. The twist at the end is a great one. Willis is allowed to demonstrate his cerebral side, and Malcolm's scenes with his estranged wife are a poignant exploration of grief, and of a couple drifting apart.",The Sixth Sense

The Sixth Sense lives up to its claim of being rather scary.  There are moments that will make you jump, and there are moments that will make your hair stand on end.  Bruce Willis is very good as the shrink who tries to help the young boy who sees dead people.  Hayley Joel Osmet is very good in his role.  There is a certain conviction to his voice and you can see it in his eyes, that he really believes he sees dead people.  The way he relates to Willis is refreshing in movies.  Most of the time, kids are either saying something smart or acting silly, not this kid.  He's tortured, and he's scared.  The film delivers the goods and even sneaks in a great twist.  Better bring someone along with you, you might need to grab hold of them.",The Sixth Sense

You know the kind: where you are still sitting in your seat for moments, shaking your head and wondering how you couldn't see it coming.The film starts with Dr. Malcolm Crowe (Bruce Willis),a child psychologist who is celebrating with his wife Anna (Olivia Williams)on winning an award. Their celebration is cut short when Malcolm is shot by Vincent (Donnie Wahlberg, in a creepy performance), who accuses him of failing him and turning him into a freak.Sometime later, a disillusioned Malcolm meets Cole Sear (Haley Joel Osment), who seems to have some problems of his own. From one point of view, he is seen as a disturbed kid (cuts and bruises, and disturbing drawings). However, we soon discover the reason behind his behavior: He sees dead people (One of the most quoted lines in film history here!). He is terrified by what he sees (especially when the people he sees have died violent deaths)and doesn't know how to handle it. He can't even explain what is going on to his mother Lynn (Toni Collette), who is trying desperately to help him.For a while, Malcolm has his doubts. And his relationship with his wife since the shooting has gone downhill, but after listening to an old therapy tape with young Vincent, he begins to believe Cole.With his help, Cole learns how to deal with his gift and to help others. By the end of the film, Cole communicates his secret to his mother and Malcolm communicates with his wife, but when this is done, lives will be changed forever. And both scenes are so incredibly powerful: Cole's conversation with his mother brings me to tears, and you can see the weight life off him when he shares his secret to his Mother.And this is the moment when you are still sitting in the chair, shaking your head in total amazement.This is an excellent psychological horror film and all of the performances (Especially Osment)are incredible.

Night Shyamalan trait of surprise ending hits you flat in the face and you go ""OH! That's why""Sixth Sense is a movie that is so great but sadly it is not a movie for retakes, since the entire suspense is revealed in the end, the actors in the movie also performed well, especially Joel Osment and there is Bruce Willis, showing off his prowess as one of the great actors of our time. To me Sixth Sense is the best movie I have seen him in, although the Die Hard series are exceptional, this movie just stands out in your mind and heart.Sixth Sense is a psychological horror film about the perils of a young boy Cole Sear (Haley Joel Osment). Cole lives an isolated life, finding it difficult to mix with others; he sometimes sustains injuries on his body, which he gets when attacked, by the people he sees and talks to, people whom others cannot see. Cole sees and talks to dead people.A child psychologist Malcolm Crowe (Bruce Willis) with troubles of his own comes on board to try and help Cole deal with his problem, all to find revelations about his life that he was not expecting.Written and directed by M. Night Shyamalan, the movie script was first purchased by Disney before it was sold to Spyglass; Disney's president believed the movie was not going to be a hit. The movie production budget was 40 million and it was a financial success making over 600 million in the box office and the movie's tag line, ""I see dead people"" is a popular catchphrase, used by many other movies, TV and songs.Sadly though this classic was nominated for six Academy Awards, including Best Picture but won none, this doesn't take anything from this movie as it remains a classic in every way.This movie is a masterpiece introducing Shyamalan for a great writer and director, this and Signs (2002) (with Mel Gibson) stand out as my favourite of his films.

Bruce Willis proves that he can act without a dirty string vest, and he proves that there's talent in there dying to get out, with this film I think he's got his ticket out of the action hero genre.Osment, the child star, is amazing. When he whispers low you can feel how scared he is, he genuinely looks terrified during the scary section. This child is more believable than a lot of so-called A-list stars.This is another clever film, it manages to avoid stock scare tactics and over the top ""I'm over here"" signs in the story, it's a huge surprise, and I loved it.Go see this film, pray you don't catch any spoilers as I did, and go see it.

205,pfgpowell-1,"Fair enough, but not the work of genius some claim",6,7 March 2011,"I hate to be a party pooper, but I really can't see what all the fuss is about. The Sixth Sense is an entertaining film, better than some, not as good as others, but it is most certainly not the masterpiece many seem to make it out to be. (Nor, for that matter, is it as bad as many here suggest.) If anything it is an intriguing story, and not original at that - read The Third Policeman - which is realised in a somewhat perfunctory way by Shaymalan. If anything it could have been done better. When I was considering my view of the film, the word 'ponderous' occurred to me more than once, and I think that is about right. The Sixth Sense needed a more delicate touch and, well, it should have been spookier. Having said all that the young lad who portrays young Cole, the boy who can see the dead, give an outstanding performance, and for once an American director has successfully resisted the temptation to make a child more cloying than a mug of treacle. His mother also does well as a harassed single mother, and Bruce Willis shows that there is more to his ability than shooting guns and posing in sweaty T shirts. But I have to repeat: The Sixth Sense is great for a night in but not the earth-shattering Meisterwerk others claim it to be. If anything, there is any number of plot holes which become rather glaring once the film has finished and overall it doesn't quite stack up as it should. But what the hell: that would be serious is it came anyway close to being a work of genius. As it doesn't, those plot holes don't really matter.",The Sixth Sense

207,LloydBayer,Still fresh after multiple viewings,9,13 June 2020,"Writer-Director M. Night Shyamalan might be a hit or miss with his recent films, but the title that made him a household name as a master-twister was his third film The Sixth Sense. It was so good at the time, that almost every film Shyamalan wrote and directed after this film was expected to have a twist ending by default. On its own, The Sixth Sense is a well-made supernatural thriller starring Bruce Willis as a psychologist and child actor Haley Joel Osment (whose breakout role was Forrest Gump Jr) in his care. Their investigation into a series of paranormal incidents leads to a terrific revelation that no one saw coming at the time. While the scary bits may feel mediocre, the twist ending is still fresh for a film that is over two decades old. Just two years after the release of this film, writer-Director Alejandro Amenábar used this particular twist ending in the highly atmospheric horror-mystery The Others (starring Nicole Kidman) with great effect.",The Sixth Sense
208,Gafke,Very Good,8,2 June 2004,"I have to admit right up front that I had the ""twist"" ending figured out about 20 minutes into this film. That didn't stop me from enjoying it, however.Bruce Willis is a child psychologist who has recently taken young and troubled Haley Joel Osment under his wing. It seems that young Haley can ""see dead people."" As Bruce's marriage slowly dissolves and Haley suffers from cruel ridicule inflicted by his classmates, the two form a bond and try to find a way for Haley to accept his lot and somehow turn his frightening experiences with the dead into positive ones.There are more than enough frightening moments here, as Haley encounters the ghost of an angry, abused woman in his kitchen, a constantly vomiting little girl and a slave locked inside of a coal chute. There's also a great moment featuring Willis and a tape machine, when revelation strikes him with the force of a fist. All of these encounters are spooky, eerie and unsettling, but also highly satisfying, especially in the case of the poisoned child whose murder Haley solves. The film is quiet and sedate, even a little washed out, but highlighted with brilliant spots of red at climactic moments. It reminded me quite strongly of ""The Ring"" and its Japanese predecessor ""Ringu"" with its stark, cold landscapes and profound silences. I was a tad disappointed that I couldn't be surprised along with everyone else at the twist ending, which indeed was quite a nice shock, but I still very much enjoyed this innovative ghost story.",The Sixth Sense

I find it cornball when people proclaim movies as art that are all about themes and expressionism, but I'm starting to understand that feeling after my most recent Sixth Sense view. Every time I watch the movie there seems to be something new I pick up that I didn't previously notice. The story is so solid, there isn't one crack in it. To go along with such a fresh screenplay was an amazing cast that headlined Bruce Willis, which I don't think it's crazy to say that this is his best work. The Sixth Sense is more of a drama than a horror film but when the ghost scenes occurred they were terrifying and unforgiving to the viewer. On a lighter note too, it was nice to see the family dog make it through a scary flick for once.

211,dead47548,I benefited a lot from revisiting it.,9,2 April 2008,"I saw this film a few years ago and remembered a few scenes, but not the majority of it. The one big problem being that one of the things I did remember was the twist. So going through this re-watch it all seemed very, very obvious but that probably has a lot to do with the fact that I knew what it was. Either way, it's a good story; compelling and incredibly unique that I was able to enjoy a lot. I quite enjoyed Shyamalan's use of the color red (his use of colors in all of his films is quite extraordinary, really). The twist is a good one and adds a lot of depth to the characters, especially Malcolm, obviously. I really like the idea of him being around for the sole purpose of helping Cole learn to live with his sixth sense after being killed a year ago because he failed to help someone with the same gift. That's the twist that really made an impression on me and stunned me for a second; the fact that the man who murdered him was such a nutcase and killed him due to the fact that he had the same gift Cole has and Malcolm couldn't help him with it. I liked that complexity in the character a lot. Some of the scenes are very melodramatic and overdone and I really, really hated the editing (it was just too abrupt and out of place) but overall I thought it was compelling and the ambiance was very well structured. Toni Collette was pretty great also, especially in her final scene where Cole tells her about his gift; she was really heartbreaking there and had my eyes watering up. I think Shyamalan's masterpiece comes in his next feature, Unbreakable, but this is still a solid film that I'm glad I revisited.",The Sixth Sense
212,EthanBJones_03,It is certainly good; it's just a shame it was spoiled for me,7,11 August 2017,"THE SIXTH SENSE - 1999Directed by M Night ShyamalanStarring Bruce Willis & Haley Joel OsmentPlot Overview: Young Cole Sear (Haley Joel Osment) is haunted by a dark secret: he is visited by ghosts. Cole is frightened by visitations from those with unresolved problems who appear from the shadows. He is too afraid to tell anyone about his anguish, except child psychologist Dr. Malcolm Crowe (Bruce Willis). As Dr. Crowe tries to uncover the truth about Cole's supernatural abilities, the consequences for client and therapist are a jolt that awakens them both to something unfathomable.Let me start of with saying this is definitely a 'good' movie. I imagine it'd be great if only it was not spoiled for me before watching. That is not the film's fault so I can't exactly criticise it for that but I can't rate it higher than my initial reaction to the final product. I am sure I'd like the movie more without the spoiler but, as it stands, it was spoiled for me and I can't give it a 8, 9 or 10 based on a hunch on what my reaction would have been.Due to that, I will provide critique on other aspects about the film. The story for example. The actual story for the movie is pretty weak, in my opinion. Obviously, it builds to the end and I will say I love the idea of the ending. It all builds to a conclusion and I admire that. I love the hints throughout but I just can't say I was impressed by the STORY whilst knowing the end. Again, not the film's fault but I can't rate it higher based on what I think I would have thought under different circumstances. Now for things that I actually like about the film. Bruce Willis is excellent as Dr Malcolm Crowe and I love the way his character adapts over the course of the movie. Haley Joel Osment gives the most creepy, odd, perfect performance in this film. He was truly exceptional in this role and stole the show for me. Without speaking for extended periods of time, he conveys so much fear, and anxiety, and worry, and sadness with just his face, and that is impressive for an ACTOR to do, never mind just a child. Toni Collete was pretty convincing as Cole's mum.Both the cinematography and editing were really really good in this movie. Shyamalan relies on building atmosphere and anxiety instead of blatantly using jump scares to incite fear in to the viewer. Why didn't this style of horror carry over from 1999 instead of the style of 'The Blair Witch Project'? This style was so much better and relied on actual SKILLFUL FILM MAKING, not cheap scares and horrific camera work.As a whole, The Sixth Sense is a very enjoyable movie and I will probably purchase it on Blu Ray. I am confident that if I did not have the film spoiled, I would have liked it so much more than I did.

214,kdnor2011,Great movie,9,24 July 2012,"After a student film and a made for TV film, M. Night Shymalan made his first blockbuster, the Sixth Sense. It is often regarded as one of the greatest thrillers of all time, mostly for it's creepy atmosphere, dark story, and twist ending. While I would consider this to be Shymalan second best film, it doesn't quite match Signs for me personally.It can be a bit slow at parts, almost pretentious at times. Also, I wish the film had had a bit more comic relief, I know it's a dark story, but it's so depressing that I almost hate watching it at times. Not as bad as Unbreakable but a little bit more comic relief could have helped.Yes, the twist ending is great, now the twist was actually spoiled for me before I saw the film, but what's great about this movie is that you can go back and watch it and look for clues to find out the twist ending. It's downright scary at times. The acting is fantastic, Haley Joel Osment giving one of the best young child performances in the history of film. And the direction is fantastic. The use of the color red to show when a ghost is near, the great framing of shots, everything is great. And it doesn't explain everything for you, letting you figure out some stuff for yourself.The Sixth Sense is a great movie, and easily one of Shymalan's best, it doesn't rank quite as good as Signs, but it's a damn creepy film with great direction and acting.",The Sixth Sense

Once you get to realize that the kid actually sees dead people, when the fun is supposed to start - it abruptly ends. But the end is horrifying and quickly reinstates the position of this film as #2 film of the year 1999. #1 is of course The Matrix...",The Sixth Sense
216,Mike_Devine,A classic suspense thriller that has stood the test of time,8,7 November 2021,"After 20+ years, M. Night Shyamalan's suspense thriller and ghostly drama still stands the test of time.The creepy duo of Bruce Willis and Haley Joel Osment is what makes 'Sense' work, alongside some innovative (at the time) cinematography and the easter eggs that Shyamalan has become known for (e.g., the ""red thread"" that is symbolism throughout the film). The six Oscar nominations that 'Sense' was able to earn speak volumes about how the film was received when it was released, including the best supporting actress nom that Toni Collette received, Philly accent notwithstanding.While there are only a few scenes that hold up as being frightening, it's not a strike against 'Sense,' as that's not the objective of the story. Instead, the film focuses on themes like letting go and forgiveness. Even though the infamous twist that's reveleared at the end is no longer shocking given how it's been immortalized in pop culture over the past two decades, it's still an important moment in cinematic history.Maybe Shyamalan peaked early in his career with 'The Sixth Sense,' but that doesn't take anything away from the film.",The Sixth Sense

218,Mort-31,I like that - but ...,6,30 October 2000,"It is very difficult to write a good review about ""The Sixth Sense"" without letting out the ending. To those who haven't seen the film yet: The whole film would be meaningless with any other ending. It was made only because of the ending. Every single scene, every shot exists for no other reason than to give a hint or to prepare the very last scene. The consequence of this is that the film seems very artificial to me; it couldn't be more constructed. Shyamalan shows us exactly as many scenes as possible. Other scenes we expect we do not see because they would tell us too much about the solution.I admit I'm fond of these stories where at the end you sit there with an open mouth, speechless and then you think about the film again and again and you find answers to thousands of questions you didn't ask. My favourite film is ""The Shawshank Redemption"" because it has the most brilliant point since ""The Planet of the Apes"". But there they didn't need any talking dead people to tell a gripping story.I mean, this was a nice little movie with an interesting atmosphere, some exceptional actors (I don't mean Willis, I mean Osment and Collette) and a little bit of black humour.

The story focuses on Cole Sear (an incredible performance by a young Haley Joel Osmont) a boy who is inflicted with constantly seeing paranormal activity. Malcolm Crowe (one of Bruce Willis' best performances) is a child psychologist who takes it upon himself to help Cole and further understand how to help him. It's a really beautifully made mystery thriller; it is wonderfully acted, seriously spooky and intelligently crafted story telling. Although you may very well know the infamous twist ending by now, it's still essential viewing and it requires multiple viewings to find extra details as a lot of the best films do! Toni Colette is fantastic as Cole's mother Lynn; a scene towards the end shared between her and Cole is one of the most beautifully paced and emotional scenes you're likely to see. She portrays the role of the mother of a troubled child extremely well; from the angry to the sick from worry and all the feelings in between. Osmont is just stunning in this; during the suspenseful scenes he is literally shaking from fear and you can't help but feel his pain and want him to feel better. Willis is brilliant; one of those sensitive roles that we have since seen in films like Moonrise Kingdom and Shyamalan's project after this one....

224,Sanpaco13,An amazingly deep story and a must see,10,22 May 2009,"I saw this movie originally in the theater when I was 17 or 16 back in the summer of 1999. I remember being scared by the ghosts and dead people and that's about it. I even went to see it a couple of times including one night when I went to see it at the Drive-In with a friend and didn't get home until about 1:30 am. As I entered the house that night I couldn't help but hear Cole's voice in my head saying ""I see dead people"" and I ran to my room trying to keep myself from screaming out in terror. I remember that this was the first movie with a major plot twist in it that I remember really striking me as noteworthy. I'm sure I had seen others before but this one was kind of a hype for a little while. ""Did you see 6th Sense? How about that twist? Wasn't that crazy!"" Despite that, I remember that I didn't really understand it completely. I guess you could say that I was kind of immature both in life experience to be able to draw the conclusions I was supposed to about the characters and I was also inexperienced in the art of following a movie plot beyond the complexity of good guy has conflict, adventure, solve conflict, the end. So as a 16 year old I enjoyed having the pee my pants scares and that is why I liked this movie.After that I didn't really watch the movie again. I saw it a few times in the theaters and a couple times through the next year or so on DVD. Recently however, I bought a copy and its been sitting on my shelf waiting to be watched. Tonight I finally got around to popping it in and giving it another go. I can't believe how much there is to this movie that I never quite understood before. OK yeah Bruce Willis is a ghost and the kid can see dead people. But there's so much more than that. You have a little kid who can see dead people but who is terrified of them and is also terrified of telling anyone about his secret for fear of being called a freak and taken to the funny farm. He is conflicted by these two fears for most of the movie. You have his mother who loves her son so much and does all she can to try and help him but just doesn't know what he needs. And then you have a child psychiatrist who, due to a failure to help a similar child before, has been killed and doesn't know he is a ghost. There is drama, suspense, and yes even some terror along the way as Dr. Crowe tries to help Cole find out how to deal with his problem. Cole is able to learn how to speak to the dead people and help them to take care of the unfinished business that is keeping them from resting in peace. The scene where he gives the father the video tape of the mother killing poisoning their daughter isn't actually important as far as any of the details of that particular instance rather it is important in that Cole is helping the dead person connect with the living. This draws an interesting parallel when we find out that Dr. Crowe is a ghost too. This ghost was killed by a former patient who could also see dead people and whom Dr. Crowe failed to help. Since then, he has not felt confident as a child psychiatrist anymore. Then he finds a new case like that of the boy that shot him. It is pretty much identical. And his unfinished business is both to help this boy where he failed before, and then the boy's job is to help him with his unfinished business by helping him figure out how to communicate with his wife. I don't know what that is called, kind of like a paradox or a catch-22. Character A is supposed to help character B but the only way for A to help B is by letting B help A. Kind of like the chicken and the egg. Paradigm? Anyway, with things starting to change for Dr. Crowe, he goes home and begins to speak to his wife as she is asleep. This is when he realizes that he is dead due to the fact that she is holding his wedding ring. He remembers being shot, he remembers dying, he begins to see things that he didn't see before such as the bookcase blocking the door that he has been trying to open. And now that he sees he is dead he is able to tell his wife what he needs to and move on.I don't know about you but to me that is a great story. There are wonderful tidbits in the details of the story as well such as the scene with Cole and his mom in the car when he tells her about seeing his grandmother. That scene almost had me in tears this time around. The acting and the writing were wonderful all around in this movie. The story has so much more to offer than I ever knew it did.",The Sixth Sense
225,jayjaycee,Shyamalan's touching masterpiece,9,10 April 2020,"""The Sixth Sense"" is a 1999 mystery horror drama directed by M. Night Shyamalan starring Bruce Willis and Hayley Joel Osment. In the wake of having watched ""The Others"" yesterday, I thought I'd stay in the genre and rewatch another chilling classic I consider as an example of excellent writing. Whilst I already knew about the shocking plot twist in the end upon the first time watch (thanks a lot, Doctor Cox!), I was curious about how detailedly MNS constructed his twist in terms of continuity. And man, this film is a sheer balancing act of narration as it's constantly on the brink of giving away its true nature. This is without a doubt the best movie by Shyamalan and he shows his brilliance in everything he handles. He knows to capture the quintessential melancholic nature of his magnificently perceived and superbly enacted feature oh too well. The story he has constructed with this is definitely the best one in his whole filmography. Not only does he wrap up his film properly without letting it become a mess (thank God!), before it gets there it delivers an ingenious range of genres and combines them into something unique. In the beginning, he establishes extremely well elaborated characters the audience sympathize with immediately and puts them into ... a family drama? Absolutely! It's nothing else in the first place. Dr. Crowe deals with marital difficulties all the while trying to follow his job as a child psychologist who wants to help a heavily mentally troubled boy with his problems. Doesn't really sound like a horror film, doesn't it? The best about this plot is how it only slowly introduces the horror into this already convincing drama. Before you actually have the time to realize it, it pulled off a clean genre shift in front of your eyes. I think the shift is done right after Cole speaks his famous ""I see dead people"" quote, as it then continues to narrate the story from his exact point of view. Then you're going to understand the director's true intentions. It's only creepy to a certain degree and solely mildly scary to let you experience Cole's perspective and how he gradually begins to accept his significant role. Speaking of which, the film lives from its child actor performance and gives him most of the responsibility to make this film a hit. Willis might have shown his most versatile performance and Collette is without a doubt gorgeous as always, but no one shines as bright as Hayley Joel Osment. He steals the show from everyone and is the main reason the film developed such a scary atmosphere. The way he hesitantly begins to face his fears is not only impressive, I also thought of it as metaphor. In a supernatural manner it stands for the stages of dealing with mental illness, especially anxiety states and shows how he step by step begins to cope with his disorder. In the end, he didn't only developed perfectly, the audience has also learned something from him and that's unexpectedly great. Oh, before I forget, let's not forget about the phenomenal plot twist in the end. It's such a powerful scene of letting go that didn't really make me cry, but hit me right in the emotionality. The film doesn't really make me feel depressed, it more a positive kind of sadness and melancholy that works its way through the story. Cole went from helpless to helper and taught everyone in this film something about themselves. What else am I supposed to feel? It's heartbreakingly heartwarming, least to say. All in all, this flick is a mystery drama par excellence that sensitively guides the viewer through a well done mix of mystery drama and horror and poses as a parable for facing one's fears, dealing with mental illness and even tackles loss and grief. It's near perfection and MNS's best. Oh, before I forget: Another thing I also wanted to point out is how Cole is designed. Not only do I think that he has some sort of The Shining, to me it also feels like an Shyamalanian origin story of a hero that could easily play in the same universe as the Glass trilogy. I mean, it's not impossible and it took sixteen years for ""Unbreakable"" to get a sequel. I mean, why not?",The Sixth Sense

The plot thickens at a time when you don't expect it and the ending will leave you breathless! Olivia Williams and Toni Collette are very good in their roles as well.

228,zeekwunlau,Helping others is fulfilling yourself,8,8 May 2020,"I thought it was a horror movie, and the result was a splendid and warm-hearted film. The reversal of the ending was unpredictable, but it was really wonderful. When I saw the ending, I burst into tears.Malcolm is a child psychologist. One day, he and his wife celebrated the social achievements they had just achieved. Then he met a patient who was ten years ago and asked him why he gave up treatment. Then he shot the doctor in the abdomen. Afterwards, the gunman himself killed himself with ammunition.A year later, Dr. Malcolm met Cole, a young patient with similar symptoms. Lonely and indifferent, it is always considered a freak by others. With the loss of the young patient in mind, the doctor decided to work hard to help the boy and make up for his inner regrets.At first boy Cole resisted uncooperative, but slowly the interaction between the two increased. Cole realized that the doctor really wanted to help him, and finally opened his heart, telling him that he had a secret and could see the dead anytime, anywhere. ghost.At first, Malcolm thought that this was a fantasy caused by mental illness, and felt that he could not give Cole professional treatment. Later, he had thought of giving up on Cole's treatment because his wife was more and more alienated from him, but recalled to the patient He treated the tape, and realized that Cole said it seemed true. So firmly continue to accompany and help Cole. And recommended Cole to help those ghosts. As Cole did, he also gained new confidence and calmness.The ending is not here spoiler, it is really exquisite design. Immediately recalled the ending of ""Passenger"" starring Anne Hathaway.I have a lot of thoughts about watching movies.
To believe in children, you should not question them just because their perspective is different from that of adults.
To believe in love, you think that the other party is alienated, but you have forgotten your giving.
Choose bravery, even if the other party makes you uncomfortable, you must listen hard, give it the best kindness, and ultimately gain your own inner peace and strength.
To choose goodness and help others is to fulfill yourself.",The Sixth Sense

With this magnificent movie, the concept of psiychological terror is reinvented, through the eyes of the amazing Haley Joel Osment, which drives the movie forward.

230,mnpollio,Solid if underwhelming work,6,9 August 2010,"The Sixth Sense is a solid supernatural melodrama, whose reputation as something far better may leave new viewers underwhelmed and pondering its accolades. Known as the film that made M. Night Shyamalan a force to be reckoned with in Hollywood (a reason to be annoyed with it right there), the film is well written but follows a relatively unsurprising path up until its ""shocking"" twist climax which apparently had rather dull-witted viewers who had never before seen a film inventing superlatives to describe it. The story focuses on a young boy (Haley Joel Osment) with the ability to ""see dead people"" as the film's notorious tagline informs us and the relationship that develops between his stoic psychologist Bruce Willis and himself. There are a number of things to like about the film. It is atmospheric, solidly constructed and features a truly amazing central turn by young Osment, who is both believable and sympathetic as the beleaguered young boy. Toni Collette is also memorable as the boy's concerned mother. There are a few jolts here and there, but the film somehow never manages to be truly terrifying - largely because sharp-eyed viewers will intuit early on that the specters mean the boy no harm. On the downside, the film would be benefited from a better leading man. Even fans of Willis must admit that his cinema acting can be divided into two classes: smarmy or lifeless. The more serious the drama, the more lifeless Willis becomes. His chemistry with Osment is often as chilly as the temperature drop that precedes a ghost. In fact, the very tenor of his performance helps give away the much heralded surprise climax. One cannot discuss this film without touching on the climax - which is really the aspect that pushed this film over-the-top, but it is hard to explain why since many viewers will figure it out within the first 20 minutes and will not be the least blown away by the final revelation. The fact that the revelation really has no bearing on the plot itself or the personal outcome of the young boy's future is bad enough, but even worse is the fact that Willis' detached demeanor robs it of much in the way of emotional punch either. A good, but not a great film from a director known more now for his missteps than his classics.",The Sixth Sense

234,Silverzero,Quiet power lurks amidst the subtly fear-invoking atmosphere.,7,18 April 2003,"PLOT SPOILERM. Night Shyamalan makes a brilliant directorial debut in this chiller-drama focusing on the Sixth Sense of the title. Not only does it bring about the required scares, but also it equally backs this up with some brilliant acting from all concerned. The film has that haunting, suspenseful atmosphere, as you really don't know what will happen next. But the one problem that has occurred in Shyamalan's film so far is the limited re-watchable factor. While at first it appears to be unpredictable and suspenseful, second time round you will notice the long gap between scares and the film loses it's intended atmosphere.
But the quality of the acting will never wear thin. Bruce Willis defies his critics and proves that he can act, giving a humane performance as Dr. Malcolm Crowe. Though lacking in experience, Haley Joel Osment is brilliant as the disturbed, depressed kid, and deserved the Oscar which he didn't win. Olivia Williams and Toni Colette make good support in their respective roles. `The Sixth Sense' is most famous for its HUGE twist in the end. In some ways it was good and a smart way to conclude the film, but then again it doesn't make logical sense and is unintentionally funny. I mean, Bruce Willis' character was dead for nearly a year and he hadn't noticed. What a dunce!
But in retrospect, `The Sixth Sense' is a haunting, subtle and brilliant piece of work that will live long in the memory. 7.9/10.",The Sixth Sense

I have great respect for the voting process done by IMDb. The movie is 22 on the 250 list, so I had to see it. Actually I am going to get the tape. The makers of the movie kept giving away clues but people don't get them. It is an outstanding movie. I highly recommend it. This is definitely a ten. Clever!  If you are like me and don't like gory movies, this movie is not gory. There is absolutely nothing scary about it. It is just the best!

237,Jacques98,Only spectacular if you're not a horror buff who's seen old ghost movies.,1,1 November 2008,"I'm not the biggest Shyamalan fan by any means. Of his entire body of work, only The Village and Unbreakable really stand out when originality is concerned, and they're really the only two of his movies that I've enjoyed. The major problem with The Sixth Sense is, who would have guessed, unoriginality. There is nothingminus the plot twist, I guessthat makes this stand apart from the thousands of other kid-seeing-ghosts movies that came out before it. If you've consider yourself a horror fan, and one that has seen a good selection of ghost movies, you know everything that happens here. And I mean everything.However, there is some good. Mainly being that The Sixth Sense was one of the few groundbreaking American horror filmsand yes, it is drama/horror, not a thrillerthat brought some weight to the genre. While the majority of horror films in the '90s just focused on cheesy scares, Shyamalan focused on fine detailed, believable, high-quality scares that made the genre cinematic and not just laughable. With that said, The Sixth Sense, like most horror movies, just isn't very scary. A lot like the original Saw was a thriller set in a horror universe, The Sixth Sense is a drama set in a horror universe.That brings out a lot of problems, however. For one, The Sixth Sense follows the same cliché formula a lot of Stephen King novels do: heavy doses of drama, with short bursts of horror scattered throughout. That just makes the already deeply unoriginal movie feel even worse because it makes it very boring. The attention to detail I mentioned above as a complement is also a major complaint.Shyamalan's directing/writing skills are both probably both at their best here on a technical level (if you ignore the unoriginality). There wasn't a single shot in the movie that wasn't effectively done, and the plot is laid out well. The plot twist ending brought the plot twist ending into the mainstream, and it's very well done, but still a little cliché. The plot twist has been used in a lot of urban legends before, as well, if I remember right, on The Twilight Zone a few times.So, in the end, it just left me with mixed feelings. On one hand I want to praise the movie for being so well done, but on the other hand I want to trash it for the lack of anything that sets it overall apart from every other ghost story out there. Everything was so predictable.Let this be a lesson to all of you who say a movie can be a good movie even if it's unoriginal: you're wrong. Without originality, you're just left with no mystery, and just left feeling: ""Eh, whatever. Didn't I see that before somewhere?"" And that last thought is exactly my final opinion on the insanely overrated The Sixth Sense. But at least it wasn't as godawful as The Happening, right? 1/10",The Sixth Sense
238,luke-a-mcgowan,Storytelling done right and child acting at its best,8,3 September 2015,"The thing about movies with major twists is that the film needs to stand up once you know the end. The Usual Suspects is an engrossing and complex crime story with a great screenplay and acting. The Empire Strikes back is a soaring space opera with iconic dialogue and memorable characters. Seven is a sprawling bore that's so dark it's almost pitch black. And The Sixth Sense is still a surprisingly touching, often horrifying and incredibly clever film. Picking apart Shyamalan's incredibly detailed screenplay for all the little clues about the big twist is so much fun.The best thing that The Sixth Sense could ever have done was make Vincent and Cole similar cases. A massive misdirect for all who might have otherwise seen it coming, Shyamalan presents you with a doctor who failed one patient and seeks to make it up with his second, to the extent that he's grown distant from everyone. Just that alone makes me respect Shyamalan's storytelling ability. Beautifully shot and directed sequences, with the editing team knowing just when to cut away, are almost gleeful in feeding you hints buried under a seemingly legitimate and normal conduct. Shyamalan's use of the colour red shows beyond a filmmaking passion – it's attention to detail in a story he had to see done right. Shyamalan also has key focus for directing horror – sudden blasts of jolting music and dramatic reveals of ghosts and their life-claiming injuries are just horror done right. I was just as terrified as Cole. But Shyamalan also has a flair for directing some of the most tender scenes in the film – a funeral where Cole reveals the deceased girl's cause of death to her grieving father, and the aforementioned scenes between Cole and his mother could have been directed by Sam Mendes or Frank Darabont, they were so gentle.Haley Joel Osment has just soared to one of my all time favourite child performances. The Sixth Sense has only confirmed to me that 1999 was a brilliant year for supporting actor performances – Michael Clarke Duncan in The Green Mile, Tom Cruise in Magnolia – but Osment rightfully stood out as one of the year's best. I never doubted for one second that this strange child was one who has been tortured day in and day out by the souls of the dead. His tearful scenes against his disbelieving mother (an equally good Toni Collette) are utterly heartbreaking, as is his quirky behaviour leading up to a horrific incident where he is shut in a crawlspace. As audience members, we wish we could just leap into the TV and protect Cole from all the problems – and Collette does an exceptional job of the protective mother. Bruce Willis anchors the film adequately, but this film is all about Osment.There are times where the film gets a bit schmaltzy, such as a ""happily ever after"" scene where Osment is now popular, the lead in the school play and the bully is relegated to ""village idiot."" I also found a scene where Cole screams ""stuttering Stanley"" at his teacher to be a relatively silly way to end what was a powerful scene. The final sequence with Willis and his realisation, whilst powerful in the twist department, felt a little too like Ghost to be effective. However, I cannot give The Sixth Sense less than an excellent review, because Osment's acting and Shyamalan's storytelling can earn four stars just between them.",The Sixth Sense
239,nicolechan916,Brilliantly made and acted with a thriller element.,9,9 November 2014,"I watched this before when I was younger and could still remember some of the scenes that had ingrained itself in my brain. My memory of this film was that it was horrifying, but after watching it again, it wasn't as scary as I'd remembered. But M. Night Shyamalan definitely did a good job in keeping the thriller feel of the movie throughout.This film is just so brilliantly made and considering that it was made before the turn of the century, the visual effects were pretty good too. Every scene is so carefully executed with utmost precision that I had actually forgotten the crucial element of the story when I was watching this.The acting is also magnificent. I had just watched Pulp Fiction prior to watching this (and I'm sorry but I do not get what Pulp Fiction is about and probably won't even review it) that I was somewhat taken aback at the change in Willis' character. Willis really got into his character here and you can really see the drastic difference between the characters he usually plays. Haley Joel Osment, is just my favourite child actor ever. The other movie he was in; Pay It Forward, is another favourite of mine and I don't know how the learned to act when he was so young but his face just makes the audience empathize with him. Toni Collette who plays Cole's mother is also a vivid character in this. She plays the conflict of loving her child and at the same time being frightened of him, perfectly. Her expressions were very readable.The music in thisI don't think I noticed all that much. But what made this film all the more scary and which horror films have become experts at, are the sound effects. Whenever something is about to happen, the sound build-up matches the rising tension and then the brief sound explosions further enforces the impact when something appears. I think I probably got more frightened by the sound effects than the visual input itself.Overall, this film is a masterpiece, however the ending was a bit abrupt for me. I did not fully understand what the closure was.Read more movie reviews at: championagels.wordpress.com",The Sixth Sense

To be honest, I was expecting it to have more scary and thrilling moments, but that's probably because I watched it without knowing much of the plot or seeing a trailer beforehand.

243,tburke85,The Sixth Sense An Effective Thriller With A Good Twist Ending,8,22 June 2009,"The Sixth Sense is an effective thriller with a good twist ending from director M Night Shyamalan whose admirable in making this movie which was his first back in 1999. His other films that followed haven't even been on par with this one but thats okay. The cast are good in their roles including Bruce Willis, Toni Collette, Olivia Williams, and especially Haley Joel Osment as the boy who can see dead people. The rest of the cast are okay in their limited screen time. Its best to see this without knowing too much about the film because that will ruin some of the surprises including a revelation about one of the main characters. This film does have a little suspense and creepy moments but there could have been more of them. This film felt a bit like a drama with thriller and supernatural elements which wasn't a bad thing. The music by James Newton Howard seems to sync very well with the tone of the film and what was happening on the screen. The creepy moments usually involving a dead person being seen are well executed and paced. This is a movie you'll want to see twice so you can pick up on things you didn't notice before the first time around. The pacing was a little slow at times but the rest of the movie made up for its few flaws. Overall The Sixth Sense is a solid thriller with some suspense, creepy moments, drama, a little humor, and exceptional performances by the cast who make this movie worth the time to watch.",The Sixth Sense

245,The_Core,"Sharp, Haunting Thriller",9,21 September 1999,"""The Sixth Sense"" was a sharp, haunting thriller that was almost painful to watch.  The main thing that distracted me from this movie was a constant feeling of pity for the main character in the story, a little boy.  Not only was the kid living in constant terror, but nobody believed him, and it looked like he would be locked up in a mental ward.  Focusing on the constant pain the boy was in was to me a major distraction, causing me to lose track of a lot of subtle details I otherwise would have noticed.  I didn't find the movie terribly entertaining.  However, like most others, I was *COMPLETELY* blindsided by the surprise ending - I didn't see it coming at all, and when it comes it's a real shock.  The audience in the theater I saw the movie in let out a loud, collective gasp of exhaustion and fascination when the end credits started to roll, as if they had been holding their breath for two hours.  This is a movie I would like to see again, now that I know how it ends.  9/10.",The Sixth Sense

248,Aly200,Terrifying and Tragic,8,1 August 2012,"This tragic tale of spirits and psychology weaves together in an overall decent film starring 'Die Hard' star Bruce Willis in the role of child psychologist Malcolm Crowe who is shot by a psychotic ex-patient. He recovers soon after and heads back to work on a case involving a little boy who ""sees dead people"" (the boy is played by a young Haley Joel Osment). As the terror increases, Dr. Crowe soon realizes that nothing in his world is as it seems. The director manages to incorporate several terrifying twists such as the film's dramatic climax when Willis' character discovers the truth. However much of the film is cliché with the spirits that pop up to terrify Osment's character and his mother throughout the film. The truly fabulous moments in the film are the opening and closing scenes of the film where the viewer gets the background and the tragic conclusion of this story. In all, it's a decent terror ride for audience members at least 12 and up.",The Sixth Sense
249,Jerique,I see...a great movie.,9,10 January 2009,"The film starts off with Malcolm Crowe (Bruce Willis) celebrating his achievement with his wife, Anna (Olivia Williams, who looks an awful lot like Liv Tyler in this picture). When they venture upstairs, they are met by a man who has broken into their home in the hopes that his former doctor will finally help him. Malcolm realizes too late that the man is Vincent Grey (Donnie Wahlberg) when Grey pulls out a gun and shoots Malcolm in the torso.The film flashes forward to show that Malcolm is trying to rectify his mistake with Vincent by helping Cole Sear (Haley Joel Osment). Cole initially doesn't want help from Crowe, but reluctantly allows him to help. After Malcolm learns that Cole can see ghosts, Malcolm figures out that Cole needs to help them. Malcolm is clearly having issues with Anna, she seems to ignore Malcolm at every turn.When Cole helps a girl (Mischa Barton) tell her father that her mother killed her, Cole gains the courage to tell his mom of his gift - his curse. The confession brings them closer together and Malcolm realizes that he's done what he set out to do and doesn't need to stick around anymore.Written and directed by M. Night Shyamalan, it's the first big blockbuster in a large list for him that ends up being one of the greatest films of all time. The choice of Haley and Bruce to star was an excellent choice and I can think of no two actors to replace them, even if there could be a remake in the future. Psychologically, the film gets under your skin and visually it chills you to the bone. I remember the first time I saw the movie, I was freaked out for days after viewing it.The visual and special effects are phenomenal and the thrills that the movie gives you are not in the same league as to what the scares and the chilling twist gives you. You'll watch it again after the first time just because it's that entertaining.In the first and second viewing, it's a totally different film each time, so it's a wonderfully crafted masterpiece which will be remembered for a long, long time.",The Sixth Sense
250,Gubby-Allen,Did my video chop the last 10 minutes off?,2,12 November 2000,"Spoilers ThroughoutI was in shock at the end of this film. But, because of how ridiculously it ended and more so because most of the questions hadn't been answered, and indeed still haven't. Up until 10 minutes from the end it was pretty good. 10 minutes later it had degenerated into a complete farce.Where do we start?Are you telling me someone can go 9 months or so without realising they're dead and not a single person speaking to, or even acknowledging him in that time? What has he been doing for food in that time? I guessed this outcome right at the start but then dismissed immediately after as it wouldn't have worked.Nobody I speak to seems to know for certain whether the child knew Bruce Willis was a ghost. If he did, then why was he not scared of him? What made Bruce so special? and did he not see the patch of blood on his mack? and how come only he can change his clothes and not appear in the state he died in?
And how come Bruce is able to lob a lump of rock at a shop window or play a tape recording yet all the other ghosts need to attract this kid to do anything. Why could the girl at the funeral not have just put her video tape somewhere where the dad would've seen it?Ghosts also go nowhere near churches and I thought maybe there might have been a link as to why either Bruce or the kid were particularly special or gifted, despite constant refererences to his past. If you look closely enough, his Wife does acknowledge him at their anniversary, so does the kids mum when he walks in their house.It does not suprise me The ""Great Unwashed"" of Britain and America consider this an amazing and clever ending. Anyone who has watched an Agatha Christie film would be use to it. Anyone who has watched 'Jonathan Creek' would get endings twice as brilliant and complex as this every week, where everything is resolved.",The Sixth Sense
251,MovieGuy109,"Moody, atmospheric thriller with great storytelling",9,5 November 2011,The Sixth Sense is by far the best movie M. Night Shyamalan has ever made. Osment's chilling performance is great because it never fully convinces us of the character's moral values. His performance is so cold but so heartwarming. Director Shyamalan fills the film with a moody atmosphere and keeps us pondering about what is going to happen next as the plot twists unfold step by step. It never loses interest even when it starts asking us to be sentimental about the supernatural. A very good film full of powerful plot twists and strong performances alongside great filmmaking. Osment's breakthrough performance makes this his greatest hour.,The Sixth Sense
252,ivanmessimilos,Perfect movie,10,21 April 2020,"Bruce Willis interprets the lead, uncharacteristic of him as playing a child psychiatrist and I think he did a great job, ie I believed he was a psychiatrist, not a sweaty bloody character who would just break the drug chain after numerous explosions and loud shootings, hence the role he specializes. He wants to help the boy Cole, who has his secrets and inner demons, as he reminds him of one past patient he failed to help.
If Willis did a great job, what about young Haley Joel Osment? Little was devastated in his role, which even earned him an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor. To this day, this role remains one of the best, if not the best, children's role on the big screen. Osment already auditioned for the role because he was wearing a tie and when the director asked him if he had read his role, he said that he had read it three times and that was the whole scenario. He was so ready. We can clearly see the seriousness of his character through dialogues with Willis, but also with his mother, played (supremely) by Tony Collette. Such mature acting is not easy to find with many older actors, let alone with (then) nine-year-old Osment.I was impressed by the way this movie was directed, every detail is important, there is no long or unnecessary scene because everything has its meaning. If there was a question or confusion, in the end everything was explained, everything is connected. I also see the quality in that when we first watch it, we have it and when we watch it again, we get a different perspective because the movie contains one of the biggest and most unpredictable twists, and yet that didn't stop me from enjoying the movie again. What is even more impressive is that the film continually casts clues as to what it really is, but your eyes and brain do not allow you to see or understand it. And when that moment comes when the light comes on in your head, you'll be surprised you couldn't see something that was constantly on your eyes.
The use of colors was not in vain, especially the red that appears in prominent and important scenes, but I couldn't see it at first glance.
I don't want to give out anything about the store, even though I know the vast majority of people have watched this movie, but I still don't want to ruin anyone's first impression of such a great movie.
We can only watch movies for the first time once. As stupid as it may sound to anyone, really.This is a movie where every scene is perfect, every dialogue is error-free, the camera is masterful, and the ending is touching, nothing can be taken away from it or anything to add. I don't like to say it often so it doesn't lose value, but I just have to: The movie is perfect!",The Sixth Sense
253,lib-4,Sometimes love transcends all,10,14 August 1999,This is one of the most remarkable movies I've ever seen. Osmet deserves an award for the way in which he plays Cole a boy who can see dead people.  The writing is excellent- building up to the surprising climax. I liked that Bruce Willis was low-keyed enough to let Cole be the focus of the movie.  The plotting was thoughtful and slow build up draws you into the boy's terrible gift- but a rare gift it is.

254,Shiva-11,A subdued thriller with a pleasant surprise,9,2 August 1999,"Sixth Sense: What if you could interact with ghosts? This is the ""gift"" that 8-year-old Cole (Haley Joel Osmont) must deal with every waking moment, never knowing what disfigured spectre will cross his path next.  His teachers think he's dysfunctional, his classmates call him a freak and his mother doesn't know what to make of him.   Enter Dr. Malcolm Crowe (Bruce Willis), eminent child psychologist (Bruce Willis) who sees Cole as a chance to redeem himself for perceived past failures.   First let me state that the advertising for this movie is somewhat misleading as this isn't a horror movie in the classic sense.  Given the premise it may sound strange to say that, but the bulk of the movie is spent trying to make us understand Cole's situation rather than trying to scare us every thirty seconds.  That said, there are some very good scares.Osmont does an excellent job as the troubled Cole, showing maturity beyond his years -  he conveys the terror of his situation without being melodramatic (if only he'd been available for Phantom Menace).  Expect to see a lot more of him in the future.  It was also nice to see Willis given a chance to display his acting talents for a change, rather than just blowing things up (not that I don't enjoy that as well).  Maybe this will finally give Willis some well deserved credibility and more challenging  roles in the future.Finally, although this movie does not exactly keep up a blistering pace, it had one of the best surprises I've seen since ""No Way Out"".Enjoy.",The Sixth Sense
255,fjhuerta-2,What a child actor!,8,6 August 2000,"The Sixth Sense is a very good movie in itself (and yes, the ending is really something, with a twist I only saw that year in Fight Club... great). But the real credit goes to Haley Joel Osment, or ""Cole"". This child can really act. I watched the movie on home video (because I was pretty scared of watching it in a movie theater), and all the time I could only think about his acting; he looked wise beyond his age, more like a seasoned actor than an 11 year old kid. I think he has a great future ahead of him.
As a strange coincidence, I watched ""The Exorcist"" 1 day before this film, and reached a conclusion: while Linda Blair was the star of the film (with Max von Sydow, of course), I couldn't stand Chris MacNeil at all. This limited my enjoyment of the movie, since her character appeared too often. Her overacting should not be excused. I couldn't find this flaw in ""The Sixth Sense"", where Bruce Willis acted great.This film stands out from the rest because it makes you spend the entire time trying to figure out the ending, and by the time you think you know what will happen, you get a rather chilling surprise. What a masterpiece.",The Sixth Sense

Scary yes, but there is much more to this film than having your hair stand on end. We feel a little boys fear as he must deal with the fact that he sees, and is tormented by the dead. Malcolm Crowe, played well by Bruce Willis, considers it a quest to help the boy. Toni Collette co-stars as Lynn Sear, the boys mother but it's Haley Joel Osment who steals this movie playing Cole Sear, a boy with a ""sixth sense.""

259,krational66,It's redemption and release.,8,11 May 2020,"This is by no means a ghost film or thriller in the ordinary sense, as the film critics said: from the beginning of the thriller pattern to turn again and again, the middle of the ghost-haunted and then suddenly turned down into a warm family film, and the last five minutes of the climax to reveal the mystery play, really unexpected. Even moviegoers of many ghost films have to admit that this is the most intriguing.If your eyes saw the world differently from everyone else's, would you feel stressed? The answer, of course, is yes. A lot of people will bear heavy pressure just because you are not the so-called ""normal"" expected by the family and society, you will not be understood and accepted. The film's protagonist, cole, is faced with such an inherent dilemma. The 8-year-old can see ghosts that are invisible to ordinary people, but no one believes him, including his beloved mother. What I remember most is cole sitting at the kitchen table and his mother asking him why he was moving the counters and drawers. Cole denied it (it was actually his grandmother's ghost) and then her mother snapped and ordered him to leave. At this point in the eyes of cole and also rest, but stubbornly endure, the child should have fear, injustice and helpless... Are very real, let a person not only feel: this child suffered how much should not bear the pain! It was this scene that made me remember the young actor harry Jo osment, who was praised as ""the most famous child star"". His performance is even better than that of many adults.Bruce Willis's performance in the film is also surprising, the old actor known as ""die hard"" tough guy, this time as the psychologist melcon looks calm and steady, but the heart is surging. He approached cole with a sense of redemption, a sense of guilt for the patients he had failed to care for and the wife he had left behind. He tried to free him, to help him face his fears, to speak to the souls who had come to him... 'perhaps they need your help! Yes, this is the film has been hiding in the deepest foreshadowing. Not only melcon himself, but all the audience did not realize that this was the ultimate redemption of melcon through cole -- who made who? Who was saved by whom? When you see the end, everything suddenly understood, everything has long been in the director's foreshadowing, really clever. It is also the core of the film that transcends other ghost films. He wears the cloak of a ghost, but what he talks about is the communication between people all the time. Although there is a chill, remember the warmth.Every soul that yearns to be saved, alive or dead, including cole, cole's mother, and melcon, gets the answer they want. Some discover the truth through others, and some discover it by themselves. After all, all the conflicts in the world can be resolved through love. When cole's mother heard the words her son told her grandmother to bring her ""everyday"", she shed a few tears and finally released the knot that had been in her heart for so many years.Salvation is one of the important Christian teachings, that is, the way of Christ to save the world. In Hebrew, a word with a similar meaning is ""release."" In my opinion, the film deserves praise for its understanding of redemption, ""if you don't believe me, how can you help me?"" Put aside existing prejudice and stubborn, try to understand others, perhaps, is to save yourself!Even if you've already seen the movie or already know the ending, don't give up on watching it again. He will tell you that the world we see may not be the whole story. What you have always believed is not always true. Right and wrong, normal and heresy, are always relative.",The Sixth Sense
260,NJMoon,The Grateful Dead,8,22 August 1999,"I won't be giving away anything to say that popularity of ""The Sixth Sense"" relies largely upon it's twist ending.  Don't try to figure out what that twist might be while watching the film - you'll be wrong.  While I can't site specifics of this plot twist, I can reveal that the film makers manage to cover themselves neatly in the larger sense, but where the twist falls apart is in the details.  If ""A"" plus ""B"" equals ""C"" for the bulk of the film, it must also be true when the twist is revealed.  Most folks, however, won't bother with the math and will be happy being told that ""A"" plus ""B"" equals ""whatever we tell you.""  Those who have seen the movie will know what I mean.Otherwise, the film is moodily shot and well-acted.  Arty mood and surreal atmosphere help the film patch plot holes and are more understandable at film's end.  Scene stealer of the year goes to the tot playing Cole ""Ghost"" Seer.  Willis is fine as the Doc and Toni Colette (now with deluxe bee-stung lips!) ably subdues her Aussie accent to be a Philly single mom.

Thanks to an extremely clever and manipulative plot and a spectacularly successful twist ending, most people ended up going back to see 'The Sixth Sense' a second time, just to pick up all the 'clues' they missed the first time, and which are indeed there for anyone to see. The thing is, hardly anyone does. The movie was M. Night Shyamalan's breakthrough success, grossing over $600 million worldwide (all those second and third viewings helped big-time) and one wonders if it wasn't at least partially a fluke. With the exception of 'Signs,' none of his other films has been a success, either critically or at the box office. The approach that worked so well in 'Sixth Sense' does not appear to be readily transferable to other material. But 'Sixth Sense' is a certifiable masterpiece of horror and suspense. It benefits greatly from young Haley Joel Osment's totally believable performance as Cole Sear, the nine-year-old boy who ""sees dead people."" The state of anxiety and fear he lives in is transmitted to the audience beyond the point of feeling sympathy for him; we actually come to feel the emotions he feels. No one except Cole can see the dead, but Shyamalan does not resort to trickery or suggestion in this regard: the deceased are right out in the open for the audience to see. One might think this would be the film's fatal flaw. It is certainly audacious. At one point in 'Sixth Sense,' when Dr. Crowe asks Cole if there are any dead persons present, the boy says there are, and sure enough, in the background are three gruesomely made-up figures hanging from the rafters. Similarly, later on, when a cyclist is killed in an accident and Cole and his mother are stuck in traffic as a result, the dead cyclist is shown standing right outside their car, peering in the passenger window. Cole's expression seems to be one of ""here we go again,"" and is almost grimly humorous. But it all works and somehow proves to be very frightening. This straightforward approach to things that are usually only hinted at or seen in fleeting glimpses (one might contrast this with the first 'Alien' film, where the creature is never fully seen till the very end) turns out to be quite refreshing and most effective. Bruce Willis underplays his character, which is essential for the ending to work. Throughout the film, we are led to believe that his marriage is at the end of its rope, and that his wife's refusal to speak to him or even acknowledge him is simply a manifestation of that fact. All of this is masterfully played out and when at the climax, we learn his wife has never answered him because he hasn't been there, it comes as a complete shock. If AFI ever does a list of '100 Greatest Surprise Endings,' 'The Sixth Sense' will surely top the list.",The Sixth Sense
264,jacksflicks,"Good Story, Great Performance, Flawed Film",8,14 August 1999,"First, the bad.  Some rather glaring lapses of logic for the sake of dramatic effect:  (1) When you are scared at night, you turn lights on. Screenwriter/director Shyamalan isn't skilled enough to evoke suspense without resorting to trite devices like leaving lights off, or the ""Alien"" gimmick of uncovering horrors that logic says best be left alone; (2) when your son is locked in a dark closet by two bullies, you usually say something to the bullies, you don't just walk off with your babe in your arms; (3) the first reaction of a shrink to his patient's visions isn't ""I don't see anything"" - in the real world, the response is ""What do you see?"" (4) slow pacing, again for the sake of suspense, succeeds only in making the film drag in places. Now, the good.  Bruce Willis is really quite good in a quiet, sensitive role, although some of this ""sensitivity"" comes across as obtuseness.Better:  the story is a wonderful ""What if"".  What if we could help those who have died with unresolved issues?  Unfortunately, some plot elements introduced here are left - literally - hanging, such as those poor souls on the gibbet in the schoolhouse.  And, yes, a great twist ending.Best:  Haley Joel Osment.  This kid is one of the best young actors I've ever seen.  The way he handles a very difficult role - intelligent, sensitive, tormented, haunted.  I was watching for a lapse of character (waiting for lines, hamminess); it didn't happen once.  Reminded me of Cagney:  always ""on"".Better than ""Ghost"".  I gave it an ""8"".",The Sixth Sense
265,galensaysyes,Not good (POSSIBLE SPOILER),4,10 April 2000,"As I watched this I became increasingly exasperated by its failure to go anywhere, indeed by the impossibility of its going anywhere because of the plot gimmick it saddled itself with. The gimmick is clumsily concealed, requires cheating throughout (some of which the film tries to excuse by making up its own ""rules"" as it goes), and was a bad idea from the outset, making the story ultimately silly. The construction of the script is deformed accordingly. And it isn't a skillful script: much of the dialogue is awkward, many of the characters' lines and actions are unprepared for and are never followed up on, and almost any moment that works superficially seems false and unfelt, and is usually contradicted by something else later on. Fortunately, the direction is better than the writing. I recall at least three good moments, all due to performances of supporting players. But the leading actors are all miscast--even the kid--and the visuals are a catalog of borrowings from other, better ghost movies. More fundamentally, this film goes against a central rule of fantasy: fantasy says openly that what is not so is so, and if the reader or viewer rejects it, so much the worse for him. It doesn't try to con its audience, to put something over on them. And I should say that that is even more true of sentimental fantasy. If it has to trick people into accepting it by impersonating a horror film (and inserting twenty minutes of one into itself so it can be sold that way), it shows scant confidence in the genre it has chosen, matching its scant skill in manipulating the conventions of that genre. Ghost didn't need to pretend to be The Shining. I like ghost stories and sentimental fantasies; this is an uncomprehending and, in my view, insincere example of both.",The Sixth Sense
266,heisenberg12,More Dramatic and Emotional Than Its Reputation,8,18 July 2021,"It's notorious for a certain moment, but it's the moments like where the video tape of Mischa Barton's mom in the movie is discovered and when Osmett confronts Toni Collette about the fight with her mom before the dance recital that produce splendid and unforgettable memories and emotional drama.The movie is incredibly well-acted by everyone involved, and it's still astonishing how Shayamalan, who has been on a long slump of disappointing movies, was able to pull this gem out of his magic hat at the very dawn of his career since it is still by far his best film to date.It's a classic and holds up due to all of the great acting, directing, and poignant moments from start to finish. Personally, my favorite part is when Willis' wife asks him why she left him and drops the ring on the ground. As it lands and rolls toward him, it's breathtaking and magical filmmaking. In fact the whole scene is.8.5/10.",The Sixth Sense
267,coop-16,Far more than a horror film,10,3 March 2000,"There are two kinds of great genre film. The first is the sort that exemplifies the conventions of the genre, while respecting the genre's limits. The second kind of genre film uses the rhetoric and archetypes of the genre to film to point beyond the limits of genre, to attain the level of the symbolic, the ethical and the spiritual.Thus , in the film Noir genre,Kiss Me Deadly is a brilliant example of the first kind of good genre film, while Touch of Evil is a brilliant example of the second. The greatness of The Sixth Sense-and I firmly believe that it is one of the handful of films from last year that can be classified as truly great-lies precisely in how it transcends its genre.The Sixth Sense resonates with Hawthornesque tonalities. It echoes Melville, Poe and Henry James ( I refer to James' great ghost stories, not his often tedious ""novels of manners"").The critics who saw only only a creepy, dull story with a twist at the end missed entirely the films extraordinary religious symbolism. The Bruce Willis Character is a soul in limbo, waiting to be saved. The instrument of salvation? A frightened, yet preternaturally gifted, child.Not a single performance in the film hit a false note..this is an extraordinary film about parents and children, about husbands and wives, and about life and death. The score, the cinematography, and the script were uniformly excellent. I i especially liked the filmmakers' brilliant use of the Philadelphia locale, and the way in which the cities dark history was alluded to. In short, a wonderful film and an exhilarating religious experience-SUPERB",The Sixth Sense
268,Thats_some_scary_stuff_Reviews,A daily comment from Midget Emma: The Sixth Sense (1999),8,23 February 2008,A creepy little spook movie to watch on a Saturday night. The Sixth Sense will remain a classic for a very long time if not forever. 10 star performances and a little twist at the end makes a good movie.I don't like movies that keep me up at night. This didn't but it had me turning around a lot hoping for a spirit not to be standing behind me. This is one of those movies that will scare the hell out of some and will not even make some jump. It depends on what sort of person you are. If pale ghosts with slit wrists walking past doors scare you then you may not want to see this movie.The twist was good. I didn't see that coming. But some will see it coming a mile away. It was ruined for some by 50 first dates.WARNING: DO NOT WATCH 50 FIRST DATES BEFORE WATCHING THIS. IT GIVES THE ENDING AWAY.Check out my 50 First Dates comment: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0343660/usercomments-enterLuckily i had seen The Sixth Sense before i saw 50 first dates.Now the acting. It is extremely rare to find a great performance from a kid. But Haley Joel Osment gave me the greatest performance i have ever seen from a child. He is disturbing and a cursed kid. Bruce Willis plays a very different role then the hero John McClane. But he was still good. But the one who stole the show was Toni Collette. She was just so natural and great. She played Haley Joel's mum. She was just excellent.You might be thinking why has she said it is so good and then gave it an 8/10. Well i am not a fan of this movies at all. But on its own it is a great movie. Make your own decision. I recommend it.8/10,The Sixth Sense

To state this movie as a masterpiece is stating the obvious, but The Sixth Sense is so much more than mastery. It's a carefully perfected and orchestrated phenomenon of a film that will touch every nerve in your body and will shake you to the very core.M. Night Shyamalan, the work and brains of this unique film has created a film that is bound to live in our memories for ever.Verdict: A powerful and spine-nerching horror thriller that should rightly take it's place among the greatest films.",The Sixth Sense
270,PCC0921,If the first time doesn't go well try it again.,8,12 October 2020,"I know this is a modern classic, but it is not my favorite M. Night movie. In fact, I wasn't crazy about the Sixth Sense the first time I saw it and this second time; at least, I could pay attention to other details. It contains all the M. Night staples. Nice pull-backs on the camera during the ""One Step Questions"" scene between Willis and Osment. It takes place in 1999, but has a cool gothic late 70s/early 80s feel to it. The acting of Osment is freaky and helps to enhance the suspense and freakiness felt throughout the film.A test of a good movie such as this, in which the pay-off comes when you see it the first time, is watching it the second time to see how you were deceived the first time. The film has a way to accomplish its goals even after the first viewing. That's what makes it worthy of at least a B. I say that, because, unfortunately, the movie has a really gnawing, slow boil. It's such a slow pace that it is tough to sit still during the film. While I am saying to myself, ""Oh, that's how that works"" and ""I missed that the first time"", I have to struggle to stay awake. The film's slow pace can be draining so much that I forgot the whole film took place in Philadelphia. M.Night at least kept me at a B.8.2 (B MyGrade) = 8 IMDB",The Sixth Sense
271,buzznzipp1995,And all nine lives...Willis delivers again,9,25 October 2007,"By far this is my favorite Haley Joel Osment role that I have seen him play. M.Night is sensational directing this onion-skin of a thriller story, but who doesn't realize that? The bedroom scene with the doctor and his wife was what a shocking good thriller is made of. Donny Wahlberg is a terrifying short detour in this right-made enthraller that packs a whopping cast that has authentic developed personalities with an eerie undertone. Bruce again shows that he is the right choice for a major story that captivates from the start to the end. You feel for Malcom Crow, as he seems to be searching for truth and help for this young boy. The mother has a real appeal in that (Toni Colette is superb)the actress is a well crossed role player that seems like there is just no-acting there. She is on it. All the while, there are scenes that are not 'shot' impatiently. I think that so much of Hollywood is cutting, cutting, cutting to make the scheduled time box that the formula fits into. The visual chemistry woven is done almost with a cinematic respect for the classic film noir, they are held in the length that makes them perfect grippers, you see what's happening and it gives enough 'pause' then makes you feel the chill across the back of your neck. When the story captives and the performances are cut to fit as right as this is, you know that not all movies are even. Not by a long shot. Bruce Willis has a definite old world quality of acting, in a new world format. This movie unfolds with precision in story telling and character development with the good Doctor and the boy and then when it goes to the end, it twists and you are left feeling that cold chill once again. I only had one question that I would like to ask 'M' about the plot. Other than this, I am well pleased with ""The Sixth Sense"".For what a superb thriller should be, this one is a top pick. It's 'incredible' the success that The Sixth Sense has had, it is no wonder to me and millions of fans, and in that, Willis with his contract and profit agreement took away with him One Hundred Million Dollars. Some might say that he isn't one hundred million good. Some might say, the Razzies gave him three awards for worst actor just the year before, I say, none of that 'banter' will change a wit about Bruce in this film. Recommended for M.Night Shyamalan and Willis fans, even if you aren't it really makes no difference in the end you will know why. (*****)",The Sixth Sense
272,karl_consiglio,I see dead people,8,4 November 2006,"One of the most frightening scenes in this film which people rarely seem to mention is at the beginning when that guy with no clothes on jumps into the house of our child psychologist, the speech he makes before he hits the trigger sent a shiver up my spine immediately. Its a cold scene that shatters the warm atmosphere they are in before he appears. Our child Psychologist becomes obsessed with helping one of his patients, a terrified young boy who sees dead people, the two leads are magnificent, a good script even if you guess the downbeat ending, at the time I did not because these kind of twists were still just about becoming in vogue. Actually when I saw this film I loved it because it had a new recipe to horror movies, it struck new chords inside which is not always easy. The parts I found very creepy is that our camera inside the house plays the eyes of the dead, which I found very threatening.",The Sixth Sense
273,ThomasColquith,Terrible,1,20 July 2021,"I finally watched ""The Sixth Sense"" after all these years and wow is it terrible. I could tell right away that this film was not to my liking and a bore but I stuck with it and watched it all so I could fairly assess it. It was dismal and dreary the whole way, with very little good dialog or action, no likable characters, and shaky camera work. I couldn't wait for it to be over; I watched the clock the whole way. So, 1/10 for failing to do the most basic thing that a movie should do -- to entertain. My recommendation: pass on this one, don't believe the hype. (And I thought ""Unbreakable"" and ""Village"" were ok to fair.)",The Sixth Sense
274,haterofcrap,Very good film,10,10 September 2010,"This was a very good film. In fact, this is the only good film made by M. Night Shyamalan. All his other movies were terrible, but this one was pretty good.The performances were all pretty good: I usually hate the movies with Bruce Willis (Specially ""Die Hard"", that movie was awful) but here he made a good role, and also he plays an interesting character. I really liked this film. It was quite scary: In fact, I would say that is one of the scariest films ever made, even more than ridiculous films as ""Cannibal Holocaust"" or ""Hostel"", that were no scary at all, just disgusting. ""The Sixth Sense"" is a perfect horror film. I recommend this film to anyone, it is very good and deserves all the hype that it receives.",The Sixth Sense

Also he never had a conversation with his wife where she really spoke to him. An unusual movie for Bruce Willis, because he was in this movie i was unsure whether i wanted to see this or not, luckily i did and his performance didn't disappoint me, in my opinion, definitely one of his greatest movies. Also for a Kid actor Haley Joel Osment's acting was superb, he was incredibly mature throughout the movie, despite him being so young. It is not really made clear whether Cole knew Malcolm was dead or not, Malcolm was the only ghost Cole wasn't scared of and the only one who could help him.

277,ryan_kuhn,"""Do you know why you're afraid when you're alone?""",8,13 February 2005,"We all know the ending by now, so I won't pretend no one knows how it ends. A suspenseful return back into the world of ghost stories carries The Sixth Sense, the first major film success by M. Night Shyamalan. The film revolves around a child, Cole Sear, who is socially awkward mainly because he can see ghosts and struggles with that each day, played by Haley Joel Osment in an Oscar Award nominated role. Bruce Willis plays Malcome Crowe, a child case worker who invests all of his time into Cole. As he investigates what is happening, he finds that he has come across a case similar to Cole's in the past, but is no nearer to figuring out how to help him. The human drama of a case worker trying to figure out what is wrong with his patient keeps the movie going, allowing Shyamalan to drop the clues throughout the movie about the ending. I have to admit I was blown away by the ending, but looking back, I should have known better, and many audiences were able to figure it all out. Some say that if you look at the movie logically, it does not hold water, but that is not the point. The movie is not about logic, but rather the experience as a viewer, watching what the director gives us, as we only see what he wants us to see. The Sixth Sense also boasts a strong soundtrack and looks good, setting a mood that gets the audience in the right frame of mind to be spooked, though it's not a horror movie. Suspenseful, smart, and well directed, The Sixth Sense is an achievement not to be underestimated.",The Sixth Sense
278,MF210,Very Good Thriller,9,29 September 2003,"My Rating: ***1/2 out of ****. The Sixth Sense was undeniably one of the best films of 1999. Director-Writer M. Night Shyamalan claims he is a fan of Hitchcock and it definitely shows. I am not saying The Sixth Sense is a rip off of a Hitchcock film but its definitely Hitchcock-like. If Hitchcock saw this movie I am sure he would be very impressed. The genius of The Sixth Sense is definitely in its script. The dialogue is well-written, but most importantly its very well structured. The Structure is relatively simple but it hides the twist at the end while revealing some clues along the way. None of the clues gave away the ending for me. The twist is simple yet very effective. I was blown away at the end of the film. Shyamalan has written a very, very good screenplay. The Script is probably the main strength of the film, but the acting is also quite good. Bruce Willis is surprisingly good in a restrained performance as a psychiatrist. Haley Joel Osment is excellent as the disturbed boy, Cole. Toni Collette is very good as Cole's mother. Shyamalan is fine in a small cameo. The movie is also atmospheric and chilling. So many memorable scenes, but one scene looked very awkward to me. Its a scene between Bruce Willis Character (Malcolm Crowe) and Cole that seemed a bit too sentimental to me. Other than that, Sixth Sense is a very good thriller.",The Sixth Sense
279,Gunn,A Director is Born and a Star is Born!,9,19 April 2009,"Do not read this if you have not seen this movie. Unfortunately someone asked me a question about Sixth Sense before I had seen it and I missed out on the experience that this Masterpiece delivers to its viewers. I'll never know if I might've ""had a clue."" This film was brilliantly conceived and pieced together by M. Night Shyamalan. It was perfectly cast and Haley Joel Osment became a star through his work in this film. Bruce Willis was never better and Donnie Wahlberg was magnificent in a brief, but key role. Toni Collette and Olivia Williams and the rest of the cast all make it work so well. Being the creator of the Great Character Actors Web Page, I very much appreciate supporting actors who rarely get the credit they deserve. Finally, I see M. Night Shyamalan as the ""new"" Hitchcockian director. Although some of his more recent efforts have not been well received, I think he has a lot more surprises and ""treasures"" in store for us. Hitchcock had his ""Marnie"", ""Topaz"" and ""Torn Curtain"" yet he gave us ""Psycho"", ""North by Northwest"" and ""Frenzy"" just to name a few!",The Sixth Sense
280,Meredith-7,"Fairly intense, excellent idea",8,16 April 2000,"I had waited a while to see this film, I had heard heaps about it - mostly that there was a real twist at the end.  So when I watched it a few days ago, I looked for the twist from the start.  Lets just say that if you are looking for it- its fairly easy to find- there are clues everywhere!  This took a way the shock value that other viewers may have had when the surprise ending came about.  The twist is good, and if I had not been looking for it- I probably would not have found it, or picked up on the clues.  I didn't think it was as scary as what people said.  In fact I thought as it more as a psychological drama.  Bruce Willis was particularly good in his role, and I feel it is a shame that he was overlooked in the best actor category for the various film awards.  This is a very good film, it is well written, directed acted, although not scary as such it does give you the chills in a couple of places.  Well worth seeing, and watching again.",The Sixth Sense
281,patrick_dunne,The Sixth Sense isn't just scary: It's an un-predictable and smart drama that will surprise you,8,26 January 2006,"Famous horror-movie director, M. Night Shylaman made his career (Or made his name known amongst fans) with ""The Sixth Sense."" Child psychologist Dr. Malcolm Crowe has just received an award, praising his abilities and skills in the psychological department. However, the joy is soon halted when a naked man (Well, he does have underwear.) breaks into the Crowe residence. This man claims to be a former patient of Malcolm's, and knows the roots of primitive human fear. This scene is very touching- or, shall I say: powerful? The reason for the power in this scene is because it makes us connect with the insane person inside all of us; the person who feels ashamed or angry; the guy in this scene (Vincent) is the crazy person within us.After that scene, Dr. Crowe feels ashamed and guilty about what he brought onto the patient. So, he tries to redeem himself when another patient visits him: a young boy named Cole.At this point, the film seems to be more or less dramatic and thrilling than the beginning. We learn about Cole, who doesn't seem to be the most normal child around. He's bullied by kids at school. He has scratches all over him. His mom doesn't trust him. Plus, he has one big secret and one very famous line: ""I see dead people."" We learn about Cole, and start to wonder about him before we sympathize for him. When his relationship with Dr. Crowe becomes tight, the film begins to become more and more dramatic and thrilling.To paraphrase another IMDb user, The Sixth Sense doesn't just give us scary stuff, but it shows what fear is. It makes the characters think about fear. Just listen to Vincent's speech at the beginning.I'm not sure if this is totally true, but I can tell you what is true: The Sixth Sense takes oh so many twists in the story. It seems un-predictable. I have frustration trying to guess the ending, because I didn't even know if Cole was seeing things or not. If he was, what was going to happen next? Of course, the biggest twist is at the end. It's probably the most famous thing in the movie. I mean, it isn't like one of those movies where they say ""He was the murderer!"" The film hides the twist, but it introduced it to us at the beginning! The film doesn't hide the possibility of it; it just doesn't expect the audience to guess it. I guess it's hard to explain without adding spoilers, so I will just say: See the film.But, don't see the film purely for the ending. See it for the acting, the suspense, the story and the pure quality of the film. See it because it's a good movie.I shall end with that.9/10 Good: Very suspenseful and dramatic with good acting. It's also close to un-predictable for me.Bad: I can't think of anything for now. It seemed kind of slow moving.Feel free to send me a Private Message regarding this comment.",The Sixth Sense
282,andy-227,"A fine, important piece of filmmaking.",9,28 August 1999,"From the trailers and the posters advertised in the newspapers, my first reaction was, great. Another dumpy special effects bonanza with CGI ghosts, no plot, and bad acting.  Just what we need.  The critics rave reviews got me interested(they should advertise the movie).  I went to see it, and was, to say the least, delighted with what I saw.  I was deeply touched by it. It's not some scary monster movie with corny acting and CGI ghosts like the remake of ""The Haunting"".  In fact, there isn't a single special effect in ""The Sixth Sense"".  Not one.  It doesn't need effects,  because it's about facing the most frightening point of our lives, death.  I walked out of the theater feeling the same way as I did when I came out of Roberto Benigni's ""Life is Beautiful"", and that was very happy.  This is the first film about death that made me feel good, and ready to accept death at the time I may face it.  ""Ghost"" is the wrong film to watch, because it made me scared of death.  ""The Seventh Seal"" was about using the time you have left to live, so that didn't have a real positive impact on me either.  ""The Sixth Sense"" did, and I was really happy about it.  Despite it's 1 or 2 Hollywood cliches, ""The Sixth Sense"" is an important film for our lives because it teaches us to face death, to accept it, and to not be afraid.  There were times in the movie when I thought to myself, why are the spirits the boy sees splattered with gore, blood, and muck?  Is this supposed to scare us? Are blood and gore Hollywood's only idea of death?  No.  It's simply the way the spirits died.  The tagline says, ""Not every gift is a blessing"".  I disagree.  I thought that the boy WAS blessed with a gift, yet he was frightened by it and he did not understand it.  I think the advertising campaign needs to rethink their methods of advertising ""The Sixth Sense"", because they make it look like a stupid special effects fest, which it is not.  I would remove some of the cliches here and there, and I still think ""The Blair Witch Project"" is the best film of the year.  Still, I liked this film very much.  I was deeply moved and touched by it.  I think it's important that people see this film.  It might change their lives!",The Sixth Sense

At least the kid got nominated even though he didn't win. Willis is Malcolm Crowe, a gifted child psychologist who is shot in his bedroom by a deranged former patient. A few years later he encounters a young kid named Cole, who is experiencing similar symptoms and appears to be harboring a well kept secret that he doesn't wish to share with anyone. But Crowe keeps pushing to discover what is troubling the boy as his marriage gets worse and worse. What could it be? The answer is as frightening as it is uncontrollable.

But I think even more of a little known classic film,Roman Polanski's ""Repulsion"".  In it Catherine Deneuve plays a woman who is repulsed by men.  She spends a good thirty to forty minutes in virtual silence drifting into insanity, so that by the time things begin to go bump in the night the viewer is jumping out of their seat. Those who criticize the slowness of this films exposition don't seem to realize how important it is to provide the latter thrills.  But almost every reviewer agrees that the ending is terrific.  I gave this film an eight overall, but I will say that even though I've rated a lot of films with 9's and even 10's over the last few years, it is the only film of late that I truly plan to enjoy a second time.

Even after seeing the movie, I tried very hard to remember if there had been any mistakes or clues that gave an insight into the memorable denouement, but the continuity and attention to detail was 1st class .  All the supporting cast were excellent, and I would have to rate this film as one of the best of the year -  BUT, if you have not seen it, DO NOT let anyone tell you the ending.",The Sixth Sense

Doing the math.... 7.69.The acting was brilliant as everyone has said. The kid was remarkable - the best kid performance I can ever remember (casting deserves a lot of credit though, his face is perfect for the required looks). The story is interesting and unique.There are a few scares, but mostly just an interesting and tense movie..... until the end.The surprise at the end immediately forces you to rethink the whole movie scene by scene to see if the logic holds up. Overall, it does. Though there are obvious impossibilities along the way, they are easily dismissed (retrospectively) by simply accepting the fact that in the spirit world, not everything operates ""normally"". So, given that premise, the brilliant ending is both shocking and powerful.So, why not a higher score? I'm not a fan of horror pictures.

289,allyjack,"Surprisingly coherent, effective movie",8,16 August 1999,"The ending was a real surprise to me anyway, and to my mind involves far less cheating than many final twists of this type; even thematically, it's fairly consistent with the movie's surprisingly consistent tone of troubled concentration. The performances all contribute ably to this atmosphere of quivering melancholy; certainly the dialogue is heavy-handed at times, and although the contrast of the kid's visions and Willis'	 personal pain is valid in thematic terms and broadly successful as melodrama, it also lends itself to a lot of portentous soul-searching and wallowing (which admittedly looks better when you think back on the thing with the hindsight of knowing where it's going). The movie marshals its shock effects wisely and for maximum impact, and in the post-funeral scene among others achieves an almost Blair Witch-like sense of unbearable apprehension, imminent trauma and desire to run out of the theater. Still, its commercial calculations make it ultimately less interesting than that film.",The Sixth Sense

291,Mike-DD,"Kid Wonder, Great Movie",10,20 August 2000,"Haley Joel Osment is truly a boy wonder. His acting really made you feel scared, on top of all the scary visual scenes. I've only known a few kids that young who can pull off a movie role that required a class of acting not many adults can achieve, and to do it so well. Kudos, kid. You'll go far.Bruce Willis wasn't really the actor I had in mind for his role as a psychiatrist. I thought someone like Harrison Ford might be better. Nevertheless, Willis did put in a commendable performance, and because the movie was so riveting you hardly noticed his woodenness sometimes.Although this movie does not have spooks jumping out at you for shock effects, it still manages to put a kind of fear in you that cannot be described. The ghosts weren't really scary, but the setting for them to appear and the music that accompanied it, (and of course Osment's acting) made them something not feared in the normal sense, but feared cos no one wants to experience it at all. Then ending is superb, and I just hope no one spoils it for you cos it's just brilliant.",The Sixth Sense

Barely anything to consider it horror. Only thing going for it is the actors. The rest is not that good.

So yes, gore is the way to true horror happiness. No I don't do the things I watch on the big screen. Its just better to watch something interesting, than to watch something you will fall asleep in.Luckily this has Bruce Willis in it to keep you interesting, but if he wasn't in it, then I probably say it was really bad, and only give it a 1 on the vote. 5 is for Bruce Willis.

294,Torgo_Approves,"The ""Usual Supects"" syndrome strikes back!",8,27 October 2006,"(r#92)I will start out by saying that at no point did I not enjoy this ghost story from M. Night Shyalaman, who gets everything right in ""Sense"" that he got wrong in ""Village"". It is a very solid thriller, very original in terms of plot, slow-paced but never boring, and it has at least one scene which really freaked me out. The acting is brilliant, Bruce Willis is Bruce as usual, his raspy voice perfect for his troubled character, even though some will find it hard to buy John McClane as a child psychiatrist. Haley Joel Osment continues to prove why he's one of the best child actors working today, putting wide-eyed Dakota Fanning and that mugging kid from ""The Omen 666"" (or whatever it's called) to shame. His performance is great, neither over-the-top nor underacted, and unlike most of his kind, he's not annoying, thank god. Toni Colette is also very good as the depressed mother, although she was even better in ""About a Boy"" as a deranged hippie. So overall, an intriguing and often tense film and probably one of the best of a very strong movie year.But is it really that good? Is it one of the 250 best movies ever made? I enjoyed it so much I'm willing to agree. Although, if you-know-who wasn't you-know-what, there is no way that this flick would be in the top 150. It seems that according to IMDb's questionable rating system, every movie with an ending you can't see coming deserves a 10. Case in point: This movie in the top 250, The Usual Suspects, of all movies, in the top 20, the trashy exploitation flick Saw with a score of 7.6, already being hailed as a masterpiece.Is a twist ending all the average movie buff craves? Well, 'Manos' the Hands of Fate has a twist ending, I don't see that one on the top 250. Think before you vote, people. Not every movie that goes out with a bang is brilliant. For anyone who has been unlucky enough to discover who *thatdude* really is, The Sixth Sense will be a disappointment. For me, it definitely was. But it's such an enjoyable disappointment I'm willing to give this an 8/10.PS. What the hell happened, Schyalaman? You went from memorability to mediocrity so fast. You could've really been one of the all time greats, but you screwed it up. Well, at least you provided David Zucker with material with your borefest ""The Village"".",The Sixth Sense
295,danielll_rs,Excellent! (10/10),9,22 October 1999,"""The Sixth Sense"" is for sure one of the five best films of 1999.The story about the eight year-old boy who sees dead people impressed me very much, specially for the end- I'm going to talk about this after.Playing Cole Sear, Haley Joel Osment gives the best performance by a young actor I've ever seen, and I think he deserves at least an Oscar nomination. Bruce Willis really surprised me as Macolm Crowe, the psychologist who helps Cole. Before watching this film I hated him, but now I realize that he's not a bad actor. The only problem is that he works in very bad films, as ""Armageddon"" and ""Mercury Rising"". I think he should try more experiences like this in ""The Sixth Sense"".The screenplay is just amazing. The solution for everything is just in front of you, but surely you won't find it out the first time you see it. It is one of the most impressing ends I've seen. More than ""Wild Things"" and ""L.A. Confidential"".The only problem I see is that ""The Sixth Sense"" was classified as a horror movie, but in fact it is a very intense drama, with some supernatural elements.I am proud that this film is still on the Top Ten list.So forget ""The Blair Witch Project"" or ""The Haunting"". This is not a scary horror movie, but I'm sure you won't be disappointed anyway.No doubt it is a 10 out of 10!Warn: Pay attention in the beginning and, after the end, try to remember everything that came up to the solution.",The Sixth Sense

The film was nothing that I had expected. Bruce Willis & the kid (Don't know his name) who played Cole did a sensational job at their roles besides everyone else.Besides there being an excellent plot and suspenseful effects in Cole's Sixth Sense Vision, everything was good. I could say there was nothing wrong this film.I couldn't get the ending at all but when somebody told me what really happened, i was stoked as. But i ain't giving anything away...All in all, hands down, The Sixth Sense plays with the mind and as we watch the film as the minutes tick away, we start to think and think about what's happening here...

Cheap trick.  There were a couple of well-executed startles, which are always fun, and the drizzly autumnal atmosphere was just right.  Bruce Willis is his usual smirky self.  The little boy is very good.  The ""surprise"" was figured out in the following order, according to the people involved: my 15-year-old-son (the movie maven in the family), right after the opening sequence; myself, about 15 minutes in; my wife, a couple of scenes before the truth comes out at the end; my 13-year-old daughter, when we explained it to her on the way out to the car.",The Sixth Sense

I thought that his character a bit one-dimensional, though. I'm not sure whether the acting or character development is to blame.The movie is pretty good on the whole, but the amount of inexcusable gaping plot holes is ridiculous... such as: How did he go one whole year without speaking to anyone or being acknowledged by anyone (except the little boy), and not figure out that something is wrong? He lives with his wife, and... for a whole year, they manage to co-exist in the same household -- without interacting? Not believable.So Bruce Willis is a ghost, so why can't he see other ghosts? The boy knows that his ""therapist"" is a ghost, but he doesn't tell him, and he's not afraid of him the way he is of all the other ghosts.How did he get assigned to treat that kid? Who'd hire a ghost? How did he collect his salary? How did he interact with the kid's Mom, and whom did he pass his assessments to? How did a ghost manage to use audio tapes and a PC? We see that he writes and prints out reports. How is that possible for a ghost to do? Basically, there are MANY a plot hole here...But! It doesn't alter the fact that the movie is entertaining and enjoyable. The kid's acting was impeccable. I have never seen such outstanding performance by a child actor (or even a professional adult actor). I was very impressed.I think the movie deserves the high rating. Definitely far superior to the lousy ""Paranormal Activity"" franchise. The latter is just a lame joke compared to this one.",The Sixth Sense

301,merrywood,A rose growing out of the garbage heap.,9,23 August 1999,"THE SIXTH SENSE is one of the few films to explore the true multidimensional nature of humanity in a bright, recondite way.  It does so thoughtfully and with intelligence at every level of the film craft.   Most choices are superb with the possible exception of lighting, perhaps one or two f-stops too far down, in scenes that even on the big screen are difficult to discern.  It is clear why this option was taken but my choice would have been for a subtler approach.  However, the story's theme is classic in that it shows the superior choice of love over fear in dealing with the unknown.
	That said, the critical factors here are all present: Excellent screenplay, direction and cast.  The denouement is stunning and pulls the entire realization together in a most satisfying and refreshing way.  Accolades for writer-director, M.

I literally tried to find a flaw with the movie and I'm usually very picky with these things, but I just couldn't find anything wrong with the Sixth Sense. It's a beautifully shot, surprisingly expertly directed movie that is a blend of horror, mystery and suspense. I remember the first time I saw the Sixth Sense, I was terrified. I still find it very scary and even though I know exactly how everything is gonna play out, it's still very suspenseful. The acting is terrific by pretty much everyone, but I have to give a special mention to Harley Joel Osmont, giving what is probably the greatest performance ever by a child actor. Much like another one of my favorite movies that came out in 1999, Fight Club, the Sixth Sense is simply a movie you never see the same after the first viewing. Is this a positive? Absolutely. The Sixth Sense is one of my favorite movies of all time.

Its one of the rarest films by M. Night Shyamalan thats actually good. Not to be offensive, but most of his movies suck. But this one was quite decent, a masterpiece at best.Bruce Willis is a child psychologist named Malcolm Crowe who helps out a disturbed child, (Haley Joel Osment) who has visions of dead people. By doing this, his wife becomes depressed over his absence, (or at least thats what he thinks) which causes him to decide between helping the kid, or his wife.The story itself is excellent, opening with a bone chilling scene. Not to mention a surprising ending that will leave you haunted for days. The acting performances are phenomenal, mostly Osment, who received an Oscar nomination. Also includes Toni Collete, Olivia Williams, and a cameo of Shyamalan as a doctor. The music by James Newton Howard gave me goosebumps for the whole movie. One of his best scores ever in my opinion. Unlike Ghost, which is a little similar, this one doesn't have crappy effects thrown in it, but rather suspenseful situations based on sense, given this movie's title.This film couldn't have been any better.

Dr Malcolm Crowe (Bruce Willis) intends to help him in order to redeem himself from a bad past experience. But as Dr. Crowe deepens into the interior of Cole, he will uncover his most profound and frightening secret.At the moment it starts, Shyamalan jolts with an uncanny music, formed by the precise scratching of superb violins. All throughout the movie the music will be vibrating, exhilarating, electrifying and yet oddly repulsive and leaving a sense of dismay and creepiness. Counting on lofty performances, emotional and groundbreaking by Halley Joel Osment, Toni Collete and star Bruce Willis, Shyamalan will clear it's field to proceed with his cunning game of manipulating the fear of the viewer. He will show you simple things, he will input the terror on ordinary stuff and common and daily elements: he will terrorize you with the using of a tape- recorder to hear whispers, he will play smartly with the shadows, mirrors, claustrophobic spaces to gasp the audience, and the use of an eerie wind always blowing to give the sense of distance and cold. He will give you a little space to start, then the fear will start erupting inside your mind.The photography by Tak Fujimoto is intense and subtle, never approaching with direct focus but with transversal, lateral imposing lens and toying softly with the use of reflections, rolling cameras and visuals in odd places that give the film superb aesthetics. Overall, the technical aspects contribute on leaving on the viewer a feeling of dread and restlessness, awkwardness.Shyamalan is genius at creating this suspense, avoiding blood and imposing a sly fear. That is why he became so popular.He also delivers a lot of psychological substance, a lot of profound lines of thinking. Joel's Osment relationship with his father is portrayed with great touches, like the glasses with no crystals and the watch not working he received from him. The Indian Director also exposes his viewings on explaining a story within his sublime script. At one point Malcolm tries to tell Cole a story: -You never told a story before right? You have to add some twists and stuff.Well prepare, because it is highly auto-referential. The script also brings forth bewitching descriptions of fear ""like falling down inside but you are standing still"". And then prepare for the twist. It will shake you to the ground and burn all of your movie principles. It is the Twist, what made the movie genius and so iconic.""Sixth Sense"" is a cinematic bulwark, standing on an eternal and sublime direction. Its ending is emotional, and touching.

311,Panterken,I see dead people...walking around like regular people.,10,21 June 2007,"The Sixth Sense is M. Night Shyamalan first big budget and best film. It's a film that heavily relies on the creating and maintaining of a certain atmosphere. It has a psychological tension that's only broken in a few scenes( Magic trick scene ao.). A little comical relief( although there are only 2 such scenes) is very welcome to not make the story too heavy (so everyone can enjoy it). Films tend to get boring if the story is too linear.The Sixth Sense has a surprise ending ( many films will use this in the following years) but it's not all about the ending ( in contrary to certain other films that I will not name to avoid spoiling). The story on itself is very interesting but the ending is the cherry on the pie. Many who saw it the first time were in disbelief: is this right...? After re-watching it several times...yes it is. The plot is almost watertight. I suppose if you want to you can always find tiny little mistakes but I haven't found any big ones. The Sixth Sense is unbelievably well cast: Bruce Willis delivers his 2nd best performance( 12 Monkeys is his best), debutant Haley Joel Osment is excellent( his performance in A.I is also excellent, other movies of his were mostly disappointing performances), Toni Colette delivers the first in a long series of Oscar-worthy performances (also see The Night Listener, The Hours, Little Miss Sunshine ao. ) and the performance of Donnie Wahlberg musn't be forgotten even though he only gets 3 minutes of screen time. Olivia Williams may be the only lesser performance in the lead cast but she still does an OK job. We can see several Shyamalan's trademarks for the first time: He uses very natural colors( brown, white, gray, beige, green) in the interiors and clothing. Another trademark for his work is the fragmentary use of a rich red color to break with the dull colors in the background. He doesn't overuse the red so it preserves its power. We can also see Shyamalan's excellent use of colors in The Village ( even more then in the sixth sense): red stands for evil,misfortune and fear while yellow stands for weakness. The Village is M. Night's third best film in my opinion (Unbreakable is the one that closest approaches TSS brilliance). It's also unbelievably well-acted, the story is strong, the settings are beautiful...definitely worth watching ( if hope you have seen it but if you haven't...you know what to do). It's a bit under-appreciated on IMDb but don't let that fool you.I'm no direction expert but I found it to be brilliant. The brilliance lies in the details; the excellent use of mirrors and shadows, the lighting, eccentric camera viewpoints,...it's a delight for a filmenthousiast( like yours truly) to watch. You can feel Shyamalan is both writer and director; he knows exactly what to do with the material and which camera shot would be best for which scene.What makes The Sixth Sense into a brilliant film( what distinguishes it from other great films)? It's hard to explain but it's a magical film to watch. Certainly one of my personal favorite films. 10/10 for this flawless piece of brilliance !!",The Sixth Sense

The plot twist is one of the biggest USP of this movie and if you are watching this movie in 2020 and didn't get the plot twist till end then it will definitely blow your mind however if you anticipate it already during the movie then you should praise that how well it is crafted and how it would've blow'ed the audience mind in 1999.",The Sixth Sense

A surprisingly superb performance by Bruce Willis(""Pulp Fiction"", ""The Last Boy Scout"") as Dr. Malcolm Crowe, the child psychologist who tries desperately to cownnect with a reclusive, ostracized young boy, equally well-played by newcowmer Haley Joel Osmet.  I say surprisingly superb in regards to Willis, who for once shows a level of depth and refinement previously not allowed him by the cardboard characters of his bone-headed, fx-ladened action movies (""Armageddon"", ""Die Hard"").  ""The Sixth Sense"", like the earlier ""Blair Witch Project"", has become an instant horror classic, thanks largely to the wonderfully written script of Shyalaman, a heretofore largely unknown talent from the outscirts of Philly. His story eschews gory, cliched action-horror, and goes for the intellectual side of the supernatural.  Well-done, genuinely frightening, and lots of fun, the MooCow says grab some popcorn & check out this ghastly goody!  :",The Sixth Sense

320,macpet49-1,The Spoiler is Willis!,4,20 August 2015,"Megamiscasting! Hollywood bankers do it again--go for the then box office draw in spite of his/her ability (in this case none). Bruce Willis is on top of a list of people who bluffed themselves by some sheer quirk of luck into the cinema back in the glory days of bad films (80s/90s). If this film had been made in Britain or Europe with actors who can act, it would have been wonderful. Brucie is a 'deez' 'dem' 'doze' guy. He's always in an action film no matter what he does. He can barely read the script. The young boy in the story and his mother are great, but Willis' presence knocks them down every time. He turns what could be a nice scary thriller into comic book stuff. He's especially awful during his scenes where he has to show some emotion. One can only think of the line about early Hepburn, ""Let's go see Katharine Hepburn act the gamut from A to B."" Willis is more like 'A to A minus'. He's terrible when he talks. Imagine Stallone playing a psychiatrist and you get the picture.",The Sixth Sense
321,jamiecostelo58,"Eerie, creepy and superb",9,16 December 2006,"Upon first watch of The Sixth Sense, I was hooked and shocked at the same time. I expected a complete horror story, mixed with the usual gore and stomach-churning scenes we ordinarily witness in other movies with a similar theme. The Sixth Sense is anything but. It details the emotional aspects of love and devotion, as well as having to cope with being an outsider.The purpose of The Sixth Sense is to captivate us into looking and evaluating our own lives, on how we treat ourselves, our husbands and wives and our parents and friends. It details these points to graphic effect.Young Haley Joel Osment is terrific as Cole, the young boy who sees 'dead people', and portrays his emotions and his mind to an easily captivating audience. Also wonderful to see Bruce Willis turn away from his usual 'action man' sequence to allow us into the equally troubled mind of Dr. Malcolm Crowe.A divine and heartwarming film combining elements of horror and suspense has made The Sixth Sense an engaging film that is simply unforgettable. It's another firm favourite of mine.",The Sixth Sense
322,elcopy,Finally something making sense.,10,14 August 1999,"I'll remember the summer movies of 1999 for two movies extremelyover-marketed, which could've never live up to their expectations and hype(Star Wars Episode One, and The Blair Witch Project) and two films which quietly delivered what these two films should have, and didn't: The Matrix and thisone.The 6th sense is a masterpiece. Is a movie that will stay with you way long after you see it. Not an horror movie, but a really scary movie. The atmosphere isamazing, even after the movie ends, when the credits roll, you feel chills in your spine. Fear of the unknown is the main reason this movie is so scary. Just imagine you could really see dead people: A curse rather than a gift. Nowimagine you're a kid. Just the idea is...well, scary. The so praised twist at the end is just an improvement to an already wonderful piece of work.
Bruce Willis seemed to be on Valium during the whole thing, but hisperformance is his best since 12 Monkeys. Makes you wonder how a guy whopicked these scripts, including Pulp Fiction, also does stuff like Armageddon. A breath of fresh air in one of the stupidest summers in film history.

This one you go holy smokes this is a whole norther tier. I can't even begin to stress how good it is! While I am not a horror fan, this one is probably the first that I have liked. This is more than your run of the mill horror flick. No. This film combines horror, drama, thriller and a touch of romance. All very well put together in a way that I didn't even fathom was possible.The best part of the film is probably its storyline. Just when you think you know what is going to happen, they pull you yet closer drawing you in with plot twists and character development. What really takes the cake for me though, was the clever use of emotions. I felt like I was on a roller-coaster of emotions, feeling the spectrum, from terror to gut wrenching sadness, anger, pity and that bittersweet feeling in your heart. The clever use of cinematography, with the skilled acting really was just the cherry on top.I won't delve on the details as for all the movies you can watch, this is one you really want to go in blind. All I'll say is this: you'll be in for a blissful surpriseP. S. Truth be told, I was hesitant to watch this film at first for the name of the film really does not do it justice. But alas, due to its stellar ratings I gave in, and I have not regretted it since. Also for those who enjoyed this film, go check out Ghost(1996). Its similar, but with a focus on the romance, which to me made it a 1000x better than this films' focus on horror.",The Sixth Sense

What kind of a kid could go into the mind of a distressed little kid and really go to convince that he truly is afraid? his senses and language usage was incredible to witness. he couldnt have done it alone. bruce willis would have intimidated me, but they share a bond that isnt broken once. if you saw the film, you understand why all this happens for a reason. you never really saw the twist that comes to it, but man it is so worth it! oh and if you saw this in the theater, extra credit points awarded to you... and is it just me, or (**SPOILER**) in the theater, did the air go on as you saw the dead people??

A lotta flash and not much substance. And, I am sorry, but Halley Joel Osment is not the rebirth of Shirley Temple.  I don't see much talent differential between him and Macauley Culkin at this age.

Good performance by Haley and pretty good by Willis and Collette but other than that the movie isn't that good. Alright the three dead bodies in Haley's house were pretty cool. The twist ending, before i saw it all I heard about was this big twist ending and while watching it I thought well isn't this obvious. When he's sitting with toni collette she doesn't even look at him like he is not there, in the restaurant his wife just looks around, and once you add up all these things you realize hey he must be.............. watch it and see.

In spite of this I watched the film trying my hardest not to think about what I'd heard (i.e. trying to figure out how it was going to work out every two minutes or so) and still it was an awesome, staggering surprise at the end. Perhaps shrewder people would have found it a little trite from this viewpoint, but I had been expecting a simple horror movie, lots of running about screaming being chased by evil monsters type thing. What you get in the end, though it does provide plenty of jump-out-of-your-seat and shudder-with-fear moments, was a profound, touching, moving story about love and loss, which left me, hardened cynical old movie buff, beaming like a crazy thing at having seen such a great film, and my wife in floods of tears. A truly wonderful film, all the better for its lack of razzmatazz, the downbeat, restrained feel running through the grey-faced performances of all its excellent stars, the use of colours, the music, every aspect perfect through and through. Maybe on reflection there are a few niggling points, maybe they should have built more on how the boy sorts out his problem with the dead people and his relationship with his mother, but as an overall cinematic experience it's very, very impressive.",The Sixth Sense

And how come he found the kid, anyway? AND in the same neighbourhood!It's a well directed film, but I always find holes in this kind of film. Sorry to be picky, but I have to suspend so much credibility that there's no point in the plot by the end.I never liked the Osment child, but I have to admit that his performance is good in this. The film has redeeming qualities, but the basic premise is too flawed. The only bit I liked was the dead girl's video for her father. That was quite touching.Someone's comment says he watched this film 27 times (has to be a bloke).

He talks with a psychologist played by Bruce Willis. The psychologist tries to figure out what kind of problems the kid has, but then it turns out that the kid sees dead people.The movie isn't scary like everyone says, but it is very intriguing movie as you see what the kid sees, you see why he's so horrified, and you see how he handles his fears. The ending is probably what the film is known for(don't worry, I won't go anywhere near spoiling it for you). You would probably never guess it, but unfortunately, some jerk spoiled it for me. Hopefully no one ever does the same to you.This is a very intriguing movie, and is also very original. In some ways, I think that M. Night Shyamalan was inspired by the creepy movie Pet Sematary.

It went so very slow at first, but it got better as it went a long, and I was afraid that I was going to be disappointed, thinking, ""Why did I even chose to go see this movie in the first place?""Yet later on, my mind changed, and I thought, ""It was so worth it to see this!""  And it was, it really was!  I just got home from seeing this movie, and I am absolutely impressed and totally speechless by the brilliance this film has offered it's millions of viewers and the twisted, but creative imagination surrounding the film!I give lots of praise to Bruce Willis (Malcolm Crowe), Haley Joel Osment (Cole Sear, Toni Collette (Lynn Sear - Cole's mum), and the rest of the cast and crew who made this movie possible.  Yet most of the praise has to go to it's brilliant director and writer, M. Night Shyamalan.  I don't know what made him come up with such a creative and brilliant film such as ""The Sixth Sense"", but whatever it was, it earned him success and cheers everywhere around the world!If you haven't seen this movie, you MUST see it, especially if you love movies.  I never wanted to see this movie at all, because I thought it was boring sounding.  What made me go was the excellent reviews that the movie critics gave this film, and I thought that I should witness it myself.  I'm really pleased that I did!

333,Don-102,A Back-to-Basics Spook Film That Proves You CAN Scare Without Computers...,9,11 August 1999,"THE SIXTH SENSE is a refreshing and absorbing ghost story that is much more than meets the eye.  It is great to see a major Hollywood release go back to old school fright methods.  Do not expect to see thrill-a-minute, falsely produced chills.  This is a truly original piece of atmospheric filmmaking that earns the viewer's responses, which include frequent oohs and aahs and an occasional scream.Writer-Director M. Night Shyamalan, a Philly native, presents a plodding build-up to one of the best payoffs I have seen in a thriller in the past few years.  Seeing the film, I knew the young boy (played incredibly by Haley Joel Osment) has a ""gift"" and sees certain people walking around no one else can see.  Shyamalan seems to have taken a page out of Spielberg's JAWS, where the shark is never fully seen until crucial climactic scenes, and applied it to the boy's problem.  It is most definitely a problem if you are interacting with people who supposedly no longer walk the earth.  You may be unsure as to what he really is seeing until the great frights and charms of the picture hit you.  You know when Shyamalan means for us to get it and become involved.Bruce Willis is so reserved it is scary in itself and he plays off the boy very effectively.   SIXTH SENSE takes place on some other plane of existence it seems.   That is how I felt.  Sometimes you wonder whether people are seeing the main characters, who are all, in varying ways, mixed up in this whirlwind of terrifying sights and dimensions.  It is not manipulative and the scares do not need manufacturing.  We are led through them as a good script should put an audience through.Toni Collette has picked up a good South Philadelphia accent and is simply flabbergasted as to what the hell is going on with her seemingly gifted, yet sick, young son.  Osment as ""Cole"", the boy star of the film outshines even Willis and shows he is capable of playing a character deeper than Forrest Gump Jr. (yep, that's him).  There is a lot of religious reference to afterlife which is fitting and the so-called ""twist"" is indeed a twist to remember.All involved in this surprising production should be proud of the fact that you can still keep an audience in traction with moody story-telling and visuals and NO computer-generated effects.  Compare this to the current release THE HAUNTING and realize how much better these bare bones are.Rating ***1/2",The Sixth Sense
334,Rawal_Afzal,"Good, very good!",8,27 June 2017,"I've a friend who has this habit of later on claiming about such endings of films that he guessed it beforehand when this or that particular sequence happened. I never believe him, and I think it's just some kind of an attempt in not giving up to the film beating your intelligence, your observing and sharp thinking. So I wouldn't claim that either in this film's case. My younder sister did remark at the halfway mark of the possibility of the doctor being one of the spirits. I wasn't convinced by her but it turned out, she was right after all!However, one thing that was stuck in my mind throughout and something that I saw as a genuine 'flaw' was the lack of report by the doctor to the child's parent - or whoever brought him into play. Because, as it is, the patient wasn't an adult, in which case it was incumbent upon the doctor to report the latest to an elder, especially the finding of the patient's 'supposed' schizophrenia. Turns out, it wasn't quite clearly a flaw in the film.A good, engaging film. The acting by the child artist was out of the world, just awesome!I don't quite know what to put it down to, but despite it being such a unique concept and having a climax as fabulous as it has, it didn 't quite, for me, make it to the level of 'The Shawshank Redemption' (1994) or 'Shutter Island' (2010). Possibly, possibly because as the climax approaches, the film begins to go in a lost direction, which fails in making you hold your breaths for such an ending. In the end, it wasn't as perfect despite such a brilliant ending. Certainly didn't convince me to give it 10 stars, something that I do very, very often.",The Sixth Sense

His cheesy, weak line delivery was unbearable, as the directors felt that through a quite kid in the mix, and everyone will overlook everything else. Where Stir of Echos gave your characters to root for, against, and others who you actually got concerned about, the Sixth sense gave us empty throw away people whom we really could care less if they died, lived, or anything else. Bruce Willis, who has smartly rebounded since with Sin City and Hostage, seemed that he was hell bent on making a movie bad enough to make everyone forget about the Ishtar of the 90's Armageddon. The film was badly done, from storyline (a mention of the plot holes would generally take up an entire page on the IMDb site), to a false twist ending. You want to know how the story ends.

After seeing ""Blair Witch"" one day we saw ""Sixth Sense""the next day. Folks, the wrong movie has been getting all the hype/buzz. Seeing the ads you know that a 9 year old boy sees dead people and a child psychologist is brought in to help him.Slowly you begin to discover the truth revolving around everyone.When the boy tells Willis that his secret is he sees dead people you get a bit chilled. When asked how often he replies in a very scared voice""All the time"".That turns your blood to ice.(Almost made me drop some skippy chips).Even though you see what he sees it isn't until he says that do you feel yourself going over the edge.
 I have to admit that about halfway through the movie I figured out where this was leading to. However I was only half right. Knowing this did NOT diminish the experience.It even pulled me deeper into the film.Every little nuance in the film deserved your attention.It was a kick to see the audience reaction near the end of the film.They were blown away by it. It would be hard enough to have the visions the 9 year old has even as an adult.Haley John Osment crawls into the child's skin and is utterly fantastic!You believe him.He pulls you along for the very tortured hell ride this child is on.Willis gives an outstanding understated performance as well.He's the decent man that really wants to help the child even when he has doubts about himself.

After that, though, it made perfect sense and was a fitting conclusion to a pretty good film.  In my opinion, it really wasn't as jaw-dropping, shocking, and/or haunting as other people say, but that's just my opinion.  I didn't see it coming, but I wasn't looking for it.  I still wasn't shocked, though, because it made sense, etc.As for the rest of the movie, I thought it was pretty good.  It could very easily have been done as a cheap, gory horror flick, but in the hands of the director (I forgot his name), it actually exhibits a great deal of intelligence and a nice mix of the supernatural and religion.  Yes, Haley Joel Osmont is very good in a role that requires a good deal more maturity than most kids' roles today.  He has many of the frightening moments, and they're all frightening in his hands.  But he also is effective as the frightened little boy who has a very simple desire we all can relate to: not to be called a freak.  Bruce Willis was just okay, but Toni Collette, who plays Osmont's mother, did a good job, as well.  The story as it is presented is very chilling, if not very scary.  There are quite a few frightening bumps along the way, but none that are truly nightmare-inducing. That's probably because this movie is well above the rest of its genre (Maybe not The Blair Witch Project, but I haven't seen that one.) and fits more into the drama area of movies.  Anyway, well-directed, -acted, and -written (except for some stupid parts), and I do recommend it.",The Sixth Sense
345,mitchell5954,One of Shyamalan's Best But A Tad Overrated,8,29 January 2019,"Sixth Sense is a good film, but I find it very overrated. Everyone and their mother praises this film as being not only one of M. Night Shyamalan's best films but one of the best thrillers period. On the cover it of the DVD it even says; ""The Best Thriller Ever!"" No. When I finally saw the film many years ago I was quite underwhelmed. I found it to be a decent suspense/horror film. The acting was fine. Bruce Willis does a good job in the film. However, I do not see it as the masterpiece that everyone thinks it is. I recently re-watched the film without any of those expectations, and I liked the film even more. I do think this a really good movie, and one of Shyamalan's best. However, I still don't think it's Shyamalan's peak. In my opinion, his greatest film is Unbreakable, which deserves more recognition.Bruce Willis plays a child psychologist named Dr. Malcolm Crowe. Crowe meets a Cole Sear, played by Haley Joel Osment. Cole claims to be able to see dead people wherever he goes.Another preconceived notion I had when I first viewed the film years and years ago was that I thought it was a horror film, because I had heard that so many people found the film incredibly scary. I saw the film under that notion and didn't find it scary in the least. But this not a horror film at all. It's simply a psychological thriller with supernatural elements. We don't even see any supernatural things happen until more than an hour in. At first you think it's all in the kid's mind.Bruce Willis and Haley do a fine job acting wise. I did like these two characters. I thought they were both likable and had energy, which is more than I can say for the character in Shyamalan's latest works. The story was and how the final twist is handled is some Shyamalan's best writing. I often forget how talented of s story and character writer Shyamalan could be given some of his later work.

Olivia Williams does well as Anne Crowe, Willis' depressed wife, and Toni Collette does a great job as Lynn Sear, Osment's loving mother who is very concerned for her child. I think that Bruce Willis is at his very best in this movie, and I happen to be a fan of Willis. But I think that Haley Joel Osment stole the show. He did an amazing job, expressing more combined emotions that most adult actors have to deal with.

348,CurtMan@LVCM.com,The Magician: A Master At Work,10,22 October 2004,"***POSSIBLE SPOILERS*** ""The Sixth Sense"" is the work of perfecting deception and scenarios, of mastering the art of keeping the audience at the edge of their seat for one chilling sequence and surprise after another, and it is by and large the work of an extremely talented, conscientious, and ambitious filmmaker- M. Night Shaymalan. The premise of this ingenious thriller involves the relationship of a disparaged child psychologist (Willis) and a curious, coy, prodigal young boy who is uniquely troubled, he ""sees dead people"", and is lost as to how to embrace the spirits he encounters. Yet, being the master of deception that Shaymalan synonymously is, one cannot merely accept this as a single premise, for there is much, much more beneath the surface of this curious relationship. In viewing a film such as this and defying its deceiving premise, it is important to note and consider all of the facts throughout the film, as there are so many clues pertinent to the ""stupefying conclusion"" that the ""surprise ending"" is almost pronounced by Shaymalan, and you can hardly fault him for being unfair and disloyal to the facts, for upon review, it is the oblivious viewer who has been stumped by the subtle Shaymalan. Here is a film that provides plenty of chilling suspense, enticing dialogue, and confounding mystery, and even manages to conclude on one of the most ingenious, adroit notes in film: the filmmaker is controlling all of the shots here, and the viewer is merely following his lead! Excellent direction from Shaymalan, brilliant acting by Willis and Osment, interesting and original screenplay, and overall, an ingenious cinematic effort that is more intelligent than it seems.**** out of ****",The Sixth Sense
349,Embley,Made me jump but it doesn't deserve an Oscar,6,26 March 2000,"I just watched this one again - it made me jump the second time too, and it was interesting to watch it knowing the twist at the end.  It's not bad - worth a viewing, especially if you like thrillers.  That poisoned girl scared the s**t out of me when I saw the movie the first time.  I thought this film was creepier than Blair Witch.But Bruce Willis is mediocre at best.  He is not a serious actor, he was fine in Die Hard and he should keep to that genre - this film would've been better with someone else.  Haley Joel Osment was pretty good for a kid but I cannot believe he is nominated for an Oscar.  Never mind that this film is nominated for best film.  It really shows just how BAD the Oscars are.",The Sixth Sense
350,ebert_jr,Enjoyable and thankfully scary enough.,8,13 August 1999,"The young Osment's character is extremely convincing as the isolated and withdrawn child with the ability to see the dead. Not a minute went by when I didn't marvel at his ability to really get into the character.  Bruce Willis also shows just how diversified his acting range really is.   There is no doubt in my mind after viewing this film that Bruce Willis deserves more attention as a serious dramatic actor.Despite a unfortunate degree of predictability about this movie, I definitely recommend it based on its acting (by Willis and the incredibly young and talented Osment) and story which could be compared to the films ""Ghost"" and ""Jacobs Ladder"" yet neither of these were as scary.  Unlike the recent ""Blair Witch Project"", ""The Haunting"" and some others, this film did spook me silly in several scenes.

The acting was just amazing, they may have put a Hollywood hotshot in there (Bruce Willis) however I think it's Haley Joel Osment, Donnie Wahlberg and Toni Collette who steal the movie.

Everything about this flick was outstanding, especially the plot and the twist at the end.Mr Willis is at his best in this, and the boy Cole with his 'sixth sense powers' is truly convincing. To have the ability to not only see the dead but speak with them must be terrifying for a boy his age (see what happens to the other boy Vincent)...It was scary, but not meant to be a mindless gore fest, which made a great change from the usual Scream-like antics we see in movies today. Some parts really made the skin crawl, especially the things the boy Cole says (I'll leave it to you to see the flick) and sees. It was awesomely acted, unlike some bombs that have been churned out this year!

I know his movies make you want to bite rope now, but go back and look - he's good in Sixth Sense. And it's about so much more than the twist.  Cut off the twist, and you might not know you were missing anything - up to then, his relationship with his wife has been a sub-plot.

356,byson5186,"Slow, Entertaining Thriller",8,10 September 2015,"It amazes me to think about how old this movie is. It's from 1999. This is most likely the actor Haley Joel Osment's, most memorable film. I haven't seen him in films in awhile, and if you look at recent pictures from him, you'll think about how he was a cute kid, but he hasn't aged well. That being said, I'm a little older than Haley Joel Osment and if you saw me you'd think I look young for my age. Like there are employees at work who once guessed I was 14, and then said I look 18. 14 is a little too young, I don't think I look that young. But, to people who feel old one thing is for sure and that's not all of us age the same. Some look old for their age, while some look young. You could look at names of celebrities who don't age online and celebrities from Modern Family would come up, like Sofia Vergara/Gloria, and Sarah Hyland/Haley. You'd also see names like Tom Cruise and Brad Pitt. But, if you look at celebrities who have aged badly, you'd see Haley Joel Osment's name.OK, talking about aging was off topic. But, I just wanted to leave a random message on an IMDb movie review. That's if you're feeling old, remember there's nothing you can do about your age. How old you are since when you were born. What you do with your body might age you faster or slower. But, we are not as old as we might think we are. Because, apparently not everybody ages the same.So, to get to my point this movie is a great Thriller. It was like the top film back in 1999 next to The Phantom Menace. It's been well received and well remembered. It also more than likely is the director M. Night Shyamalan's most memorable/successful film. Some of his more recent films like The Last Airbender, and After Earth haven't done well. Another film of his is coming out tomorrow, The Visit. That film looks entertaining, but looks like it will be more cheesy and like it's a modern version of Hansel And Gretel. That film like this film is also taking place in my home state and has scenes in Philadelphia. Man, I don't hear about these movies in the news being filmed locally, or see any sign of a film crew around. I wonder if I could have been an extra in one of these movies? They show a scene in The Visit at the train station in Philadelphia 30th Street Station. I've been there lots of times, but never heard of a film project over there. It's interesting to think where movies have been filmed, and how the director of both movies who grew up around Philadelphia has his movies from there.So, I've mostly been off topic. But, what makes this movie great. Well, up until a couple of years ago I hadn't seen this movie for more than a decade. I remembered it, but it wasn't a movie I cared to see. I mostly remembered the movie being dark and depressing. Like yeah, even if you haven't seen it you more than likely are familiar with the line, ""I See Dead People"" from this movie. Also, we see the character played by Haley Joel Osment sad in a lot of scenes including deleted scenes. It almost seemed like a young, lonely, isolated boy who had problems that wouldn't go away, and focusing on dead people. Also, it seemed a little like a quiet dark movie, which it is. This isn't a fast paced horror movie. But, it will definitely keep you entertained. My perceptions from this movie have changed from the last couple of times I saw it. I even last saw this movie when I was having a depressing day myself, when I normally don't have depressing days. The movie definitely helped put me in a better mood, and I was able to laugh at a couple of scenes. I got myself into the movie both times I saw it, and it's not as depressing of a movie as I remember. This movie also is a clever story. Being able to see dead people. Though, if you look the the story wasn't something M. Night Shyamalan came up with on his own. He came up with the idea from an episode of Are You Afraid Of The Dark. He already would have been an adult when that episode aired, and got his idea from a kids TV show. Though this movie won't feel like it's a kids movie even when the main character is a kid, and even if it was inspired by a kids TV show. It will also seem more serious than a TV show like Ghost Whisperer, which also involves a girl being able to see the dead.I ought to say, I won't tell you what it is, even if you haven't seen it you probably already heard of the twist. This movie is famous for a Twist At The End. Almost nobody who saw this movie for the first time and wasn't already told what it was, could figure the twist out that's revealed at the end. There are even clues leading to the twist, but they most likely won't seem apparent to anybody who doesn't already know what it is. I heard the movie coming out tomorrow, The Visit is supposed to have an ending Twist, and I'm not sure what it is?I'll give this movie an 8/10. It's not my favorite movie, but it is still an entertaining movie to watch.",The Sixth Sense

359,dalton2,"One of the best horror films of all time, and an allegory of alienation",10,28 January 2000,"Last week, when I left the theater after watching this film, I had the strange impression that I had just watched something great. Today, one week later, I'm still convinced that I was right.When the Horror genre seemed to be poured out into mediocrity with films such as Blair Witch Project or The Haunting, a new one has just appeared which with no doubt deserves one of the highest places at the all-time horror movies top list.Nowadays it's very difficult to surprise people with a horror movie, or simply to scare people. Everything seems to have been said and done yet. But The Sixth Sense really does both things, so we wonder, where is the secret of The Sixth Sense, if there is any? To find it out we can start by analyzing some of its aspects. Firstly, Bruce Willis does one of the best performances in his whole career (if not the best); Secondly Haley Joel Osment does an Oscar-deserving performance as the boy Cole; thirdly, the secondary actors are close to perfection; fourthly, the screenplay is one of the most imaginative ones we have seen since lots of years ago, with the best ending I could ever have imagined; and finally the music and the sound effects are really impressive, raising the stressing moments to the highest level.Until now, what we have seen is plenty of good points, excellence in all the film details, but not the real secret. The real secret is (and only can be) something present in every aspect of the movie and at the same time independent from each other. What I mean is the DIRECTING. I certainly could write a thousand lines about the directing of this movie, about its structure, about its developing, about the visuals, about the ideas we could extract, but the only thing I will say about it is: Stanley Kubrick is born again! Shymalan has just become a new star in the movie sky, a new director and writer to add to my all-time top ten list. In fact, when I went to see The Matrix, what I expected and didn't get was something like this, and now I'm so glad that Cinema has finally given it to me. Thank you very much, Mr. Shymalan.This film can also be viewed from another perspective: it also shows how some people are not able to see that they are emotionally dead. There's a lot of people in the USA and also in other countries who only see what they want to see, just like in the song Nowhere Man, by The Beatles. The psychiatrist was trying to cure the boy, and he didn't realize that it was *his* problem. Sigmund Freud suffered that kind of problem, and now his teachings are extended all over the USA and other countries like France and Argentina.",The Sixth Sense
360,albechri,The Sith's Sense,9,29 May 2000,"So what if you can see dead people? The interesting plot brings us towards new conception of fear of knowing too much. As we know, we usually guess about things we can't see or won't see. But IF and only if we CAN SEE them? We are forced to accept the world around us in multi dimensional.Another interesting plot is to confront our fear. The next step after accepting is dealing with it. What can we do better with this ability? How should we do it?The Sixth Sense couldn't be done without Harvey's performance. He outcaste Bruce Willis. Playing as a child with supernatural gift, he stand alone like a SITH, a character-race in Star Wars (Lord Sith, Darth Maul, etc.), with power and ability causes other to fear and stay away from them. And here, we can see he is alienated from his mother, and friends. And almost from those spirits he saw. No secrets in that.One plot we are not suppose to reveal is Bruce Willis' character. He is, yes, a psychologist with a deep trauma after some patient attempt to murder him, but here we can see another fact. We are, indeed almost always trying to ignore our fate and conditions. We do our best to cover our pain and failure, as we're trying to move along and to forget it. But unless you're dealing with your deepest pain and failure, you will be able to move forward better. And healthier.The movie is about us, dealing with ourselves, our pain and ability. It is packed with suspense and thrills and a bit of horror, but blanketed with drama and tragic reality.

Bruce Joel Rubin, a Buddhist, wrote the screenplay to ""Jacob's Ladder"" to portray the after-death bardo state, but was unable to get it produced, so he wrote a mass-market romantic-comedy version, which won him an Oscar for ""Ghost.""

The ending if you have not already found out from someone is shocking and unforgettable. The movie is also terrifying so i do not recommend this movie for the faint hearted! Haley Joel Osmont was simply excellent in this movie. It is a shame that puberty really was not good on him but his performance was impressive and convincing as the boy with 'the sixth sense.' For those wondering what the sixth sense is, well it is the ability to see dead people! Toni Collette was also very convincing as the mother who is left confused and suspicious of her son and his secret. All the other support cast are very good as well.

What I didn't expect was the unusually interesting relationship between a young child and man who are going through troubles in their respective lives. Everyone goes through problems, so it's nice to see people trying to overcome such large ones.If you're looking for a strictly horror movie, this is not the flick. I'm sure you can find haunted kids in The Shining or Insidious. The Sixth Sense goes beyond the average thriller since it deals with the supernatural and romance (which some may argue are not two entirely independent themes). I must say that I was happily surprised with this movie. It did start quite slowly but built a strong story gradually that really gets emotional. Rarely does a movie combine aspects of such contrast so effectively, but do in part to the solid acting, this movie certainly delivers a unique twist.

In my eyes, Haley leads the table of outstanding all-time performances by any young actor, followed scantly by Elijah Wood. This movie has suspense, it has frightening sequences, it has mystery and thrilling crime aspects, all of these superbly converging on Haley Joels' character. It is his very own personal ability to show emotional feelings and assign them on to the viewers that makes his performances so authentic and sensational.",The Sixth Sense
370,eamon-hennedy,"Creepy, but also deeply moving.",9,1 December 2003,"It's not very often that a tale of the supernatural is also a deeply moving emotional experience. Usually if a tale of clairvoyance, or any narrative delving into the supernatural is going to be dealt with in a way that is emotionally very moving it is going to be done on a television series, like The X Files or Buffy. Here M Night Shyamalan creates a tale that deeply cinematic, at times unnerving and creepy, but which is deeply sad to the extent it will leave you with a tear in your eye. He succeeds admirably.
Having Bruce Willis as a caring type in a film where he tries to protect a child has been done before in the shape of Mercury Rising. That film was not the biggest hit that Willis has had (even though it was quite an enjoyable film). Usually having Willis as a caring, fatherly type is akin to having Arnie or Sly in comedy movies. We just don't really want to see them in a film like that. Willis bucks the trend of doing something different by actually doing it well. Here is superb in a non action role, putting in his best performance since Pulp Fiction. A more restrained role without resorting to using guns or being chased or shouting dialog like 'yippe-ky-yay' is quite hard to believe, but here he pulls it of fantastically. In saying that he is supported by a fantastic supporting cast. Olivia Williams and Toni Collette are fantastic, but everyone is beaten to the acting stakes by Haley Joel Osmont. Never has a child actor put in a role of such maturity or brilliance. Even better, for a child actor, he doesn't try and milk the emotional parts by purposefully playing to the character. His performance is right on the tone of this downbeat and quiet little film. The scenes he shares with Willis are powerfully intense, but in that quiet little way. Likewise his scenes with Toni Collette, who nagged a best supporting actress nod and deservedly so. Anybody who doesn't have the hairs on the back of their neck standing up, but simultaneously moved to tears when Osmont's character Cole tells his mother played by Collete about her mother really should check their own pulse. This, along with the final scene of the film, demonstrate how emotional a horror film can be as when done correctly.Having had the plot twist spoiled for me, I can't say if was a surprise or not, as not having watched the film and not know what was coming cannot lead me to saying. Knowing doesn't detract from this wonderful little film that was quite simply one of the best of 1999. The twist, which should be a horrifying moment, starts of initially as that, but develops into one of the saddest moments I have ever seen in a film. It demonstrates brilliantly what this film stands for. A creepy little thriller with the capacity to move you to tears.",The Sixth Sense
371,bilahn,I'll never understand it.....,6,11 September 1999,"I am not surprised the mass market likes this very mediocre movie, but I can't understand the near universal critical acclaim a movie like this can get. I admit my own bias - I hate movies about smary kids to begin with, nor do I care for obvious sentimentality,  but trying to be objective, the problem, as usual  is the script. It simply is average--the pacing is awkward and plodding; there is a serious lack of tension and momentum. I do not consider myself to be a literary genius, but have all the critics of today never seen a movie with good writing? (Mostly pre 1990). Are we really left with movies that go ""Boo."", (accompanied by the generic rumbling sound effect). Or are they only comparing movies to the other dismal offerings we get today (well,fair enough, perhaps). This movie was quite boring, and if I hadn't been nearly asleep thru most of it, I probably could have figured out the ""surprise."" Mainly I enjoyed the Philadelphia locales.",The Sixth Sense
372,Deckard-16,An emotionally wracking ghost story.,10,5 September 1999,"The word of mouth (WOM) on this movie has been huge and I finally got around to seeing it after 4 weeks and I'm glad I did. If you have not seen it yet DO NOT KNOW THE ENDING. I won't even hint at it here except to say it is one the best in movie history. This is easily one of the best 3 films of year (among The Matrix, EdTV and Thomas Crown). I had tears running down my cheeks about 4 different times throughout this film and all because I cared about the kid. Haley Joe Osment gives the best child performance I've ever seen (even topping those given in CE3K and ET and Sleepers) as a sweet and troubled child who sees ghost. He should be a lock for a nomination for best lead actor Oscar (but then again ""Shakespeare..."" won a ""best film"" Oscar last year). Bruce Willis is wonderful as a sympathetic shrink trying to treat the kid (anybody who saw ""Nobody's Fool"" will not be surprised by his work here) and Toni Collette (who?) is just right as the kid's mom. Also Olivia Williams is very fine and very beautiful as Willis's wife. Writer-director M. Night Smyamalan trusts the intelligence of his audience by giving us a screenplay as heart-tugging as ""Titanic"" or ""Field Of Dreams"". The scares here are creepy but not shocking. He's too smart for that and they work because we really care about the people in the movie. His direction is virtually perfect. James Newton Howard's score is his best since ""Grand Canyon"" and just as memorable (I can't wait to buy it). I'd heard that it was an excellent movie, but I still wasn't prepared by how good it was. The thing that really sets it apart is that for a scary movie it is touches your heart and in that respect it reminds me of ""Ghost"" (although this is much scarier) and ""Jacob's Ladder"".",The Sixth Sense

374,Mickey-2,"""I see dead people, and some of them don't know they're dead!""",8,10 July 2002,"""The Sixth Sense"", released in 1999, and starring Bruce Willis, gives a new version of the age old mystery regarding life after death.  Does the dead person immediately leave this world, or is there a time when the spirit has a chance to stay around awhile?  This film will cause the viewer to ponder that mystery while watching the cast wrestle with that concern, and watching dead people appear, then leave the screen.Bruce Willis plays a child psychologist that takes on a case that involves a child, Haley Joel Osmond, who has a problem relating to peers and his single parent.  Willis has recently been involved in a situation that left him wounded, and this is one of his first cases since a shooting that occurred at his home.  Willis is able to establish a working child-doctor relationship with Cole, the Osmond character, but at the same time finds his own relationship with his wife chilling, even to the point of not existing. During the film, there are several scenes that involve Dr. Crowe, (Willis) with his wife, and she totally ignores him, as if he weren't even there.The film does hold the viewing public in a suspense-filled grip, with the ending being somewhat expected, but nevertheless, causing the watcher to want to see the film again to see what they missed.  A good film to have on VHS or DVD, as there are some excellent commentaries on both formats in regards to the clues that were given during the film.  This film was nominated for several academy awards, and while not an oscar winner,it was very much on the minds of the movie public during the end of the 20th century.  A good, intense mystery.",The Sixth Sense
375,WCS02,Wanna See Dead People?,8,6 August 1999,"""I see Dead People!""  Sixth Sense is well worth the ticket price.  It's a tight story and the acting is outstanding.  There are a couple of good scares, rendered more effective because I dropped my guard.  My sixth sense says such was the Writer/Director's express intention. :-)It's a ghost story yet doesn't rely on special effects and computerization to chill your bones as the Haunting tried to do.  The scares come from the sliver of possibility ""what is happening may be true.""  Well that, and the dropping your guard thing.Everyone in the cast is outstanding.  Bruce Willis is at his best since Die Hard and The Last Boy Scout.   His patient is 33 years junior to him ( played by Haley Joel Osment) is outstanding.  Truly.  I was mesmerized by his ability to get into this ""sixth sense"" possessed character.  Malcolm and Cole helping each other resolve their problems occurs with good chemistry, and is believable, despite the heights you have to take your mind to believe the story's premise. I am sooo tempted to give clues on when to grip the one you're with or arms rests a little more tightly; but alas, cannot in good conscience (or for fear of hate mail!)  And out of respect for M. Night Shyamalan for a very good script and story thesis.Summing: if you're ""only"" looking for the Chill Factor, take in Blair Witch over this one for those final 10 minutes.  The reality factor is stronger, both despite and because of the low budget factors.  But if you want to see one of the best Hollywood manufactured horror films in a long time, give Sixth Sense a chance.  I enjoyed it.",The Sixth Sense

Haley Joel Osment put on the best performance by a young actor I have ever seen, while Toni Colette and Bruce Willis were strong leading performers. And I truly love M.

378,thesouthfamily2-552-707097,"""I see dead people""",10,28 March 2014,"This movie isn't just thriller in the modern sense, but it is also a ghost story that is fresh and original, even to this day. It has long been believed that children are better than adults at seeing ghosts; in this movie, that holds true. A small boy (played by Haley Joel Osment) solemnly tells his psychologist, ""I see dead people. They want me to do things for them."" He seems to be correct. Using an ""as if"" approach to therapy, the psychologist Crowe (played by Bruce Willis) asks Cole (Osment), ""What do you think the dead people are trying to tell you?"" This is an excellent question, seldom asked in ghost stories, where the heroes are usually so egocentric they think the ghosts have gone to all the trouble of appearing simply so they can see them. Cole has some ideas. Crowe wonders whether the ideas aren't sound even if there aren't really ghosts.Bruce Willis often finds himself in fantasies, action and science fiction films. Perhaps he fits easily into them because he is so down to earth. He rarely seems ridiculous, even when everything else in the screen is absurd because he hardly ever over-acts; he usually plays his characters flat and matter of fact. And in a movie like this, is needs to be played like that because it makes the character of Crowe more believable, and the plot more engaging.Haley Joel Osment, his young co-star, is a very good actor in a film where his character possibly has more lines than anyone else. He's in most of the scenes, and he has to act in them--this isn't a role for a cute kid who can stand there and look solemn in reaction shots. There are fairly involved dialogue passages between Willis and Osment that require good timing, reactions and the ability to listen. I have to admit I was blind-sided by the ending. The solution to many of the film's puzzlements is right there in plain view, and the movie hasn't cheated, but the very boldness of the storytelling carried me right past the crucial hints and right through to the end of the film, where everything takes on an intriguing new dimension. ""The Sixth Sense"" has a kind of calm, sneaky self-confidence that allows it to take us down a strange path, intriguingly.",The Sixth Sense

I am a fan of Bruce anyway, but he was at his very best in this movie.  The kid Haley Joel Osment was almost TOO cute for this movie, but he most certainly deserved his Oscar.  He was outstanding.I was even more impressed by the movie, and that absolutely unexpected ending.  Anybody who says had any idea about the ending before the ending actually happened, is lying.

It only generates interest from the 2nd half. It also sends us a secret message on child abuse, which was ignored by most of us.

The story mostly revolves around Cole who claims to see dead people. But it is also about Dr. Malcolm who helps Cole to cope with his unusual gift. And in return, he learns something important about himself.The famous twist at the end is quite shocking but there are some clues during the movie which are intelligently concealed. The Sixth Sense is a GREAT movie and a must-watch for all audiences. It has been nominated for 6 Academy awards including the best picture, best screenplay, best director (M.

European audiences have heard about the success of this movie in the States, and have heard about there being a twist, so most of us see it expecting it to come. And if you expect it, it is really quite obvious and easy to figure out long before it happens, there are many hints (put there so that everything makes sense at the end, of course). And it's not even such an original idea, we've seen similar things in other famous movies (which I won't mention so as not to give away too much). The whole movie relies very much on this final revelation, and until it comes, it just doesn't have anything consistent to say, there is never any real feeling of menace, which surely is the worst that can happen to a horror film(I do think, though, that the performances are quite decent, especially Osment's, given the difficulty of his role. But the pace could certainly be better). So if you see it without being surprised by the ending, the whole thing doesn't seem so impressive. A bit empty really. OK, but nothing extraordinary.

389,Denver53,"*This* surprised people? Slow movie, good performances",6,24 April 2000,"Finally, I watched The Sixth Sense in April 2000 on the DVD I had purchased a week earlier. I had tried very hard to avoid any discussion of the movie (as I always do with any movie) until I had a chance to see it. The one thing I had heard (before I could change the TV channel) was that there was a ""big surprise"" at the end.Now, I am an average guy, maybe a bit above average in education. And I will try not to give away the ""surprise"" here, in case you haven't seen the movie, yet. But the ""big surprise"" was obvious to me 17 minutes into the film. It was so obvious to me by the time it was ""revealed"" that I had thought, in a scene where the boy and the doc agree that their therapy is over, that both parties *already acknowledged* the surprise in that scene and were saying goodbye. At the time, I thought, with some admiration, ""This is a pretty subtle way to make that realization occur."" So imagine my confusion when a few minutes later we get the big, dramatic scene where one of the characters *finally* does realize what's what. I was in disbelief ... ""You mean he *didn't know*?"" I wondered.I don't get it. ""The Crying Game"" had a ""big surprise"" that was obvious as soon as they showed the ""female"" character's face. And now this. Am I somehow amazingly intuitive or is everyone else slow? I mean, when you see the doc sitting in the boy's apartment across from the mother and *no one is talking* doesn't that give you a big clue? And the fact that earlier no one seemed irked at the loud conversation in the church? And once you realize that, and note similar instances as the movie progresses, isn't it obvious?Perhaps because I saw no surprise, this movie seemed very slow to me. A lot of worried looks on the kid's face as he avoid various feelings or actual encounters with dead people. And very few interactions with the dead people. To me, the best scene by far was at the wake for the little girl who died. The movie should have had 2-3 additional examples like that, instead of a lot of peeking around corners by the boy.Still, the actors did a very good job. For that reason alone I gave this movie a 5.",The Sixth Sense

Sixth Sense follows a child psychologist on a journey into the mind of a little boy who is labeled with paranoid schitzophrenic.  Bruce Willis plays Malcolm Crow, a doctor who was recently awarded a citation for his work.  It is after a frightening encounter with a patient from his past that Crow meets Cole, a paranoid little boy in desperate need of a chewable prozac.  M Night Shyamalan directs this brilliant film, slowly unraveling a secret that this boy is too frightened to face, and too unwilling to confess.  We soon learn that this child can see ghosts, and Malcolm Crow might be the only person that can help him through his frightening ordeal. 
Haley Joel Osment, who plays the role of Cole, is so brilliant that I predict he will be nominated (and perhaps should win) an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor.  Toni Collette (Muriel's Wedding) does an admirable job playing the mother who can't understand what is happening to her son.

So, in that sense, it's sort of a one-time deal. I still remember how I actually did gasp, and feel this jolt of shock go through me, when watching it at the cinema and realising the truth of the situation. And while I can never recapture that feeling when watching this film again, I do still get a lot out of it while re-watching.I love Bruce Willis's role in this film, in that it's so unlike any of his other stuff that I've seen (i.e. not action). And although now whenever I hear Haley Joel Osment's name I think of Supernatural (heh), I still think he was incredible in this movie. He put the Harry Potter kids to shame, and it's hard to believe he could be so amazing at the age he was.Amazing film.",The Sixth Sense
393,Alex_Hodgkinson,Two Films in One,8,13 April 2014,"I liked this film up until the final scene, which made me love it. I disagree with many here. I didn't see the clues or hints. I didn't see them at all. It completely came as a shock. And when I watched it again, I saw it in a completely different way. It felt like I had watched not one, but two films. Very rarely does a film this perfect come out. A film that hits everything it wants to and possibly even more. From the bright red coloured objects in high strung moments to the scene where the girl's father finds out that his wife poisoned their daughter, it simply gets everything spot on.The fear factor isn't what makes this film good. It shouldn't be compared to other horrors. It's trying to send different messages across. It has very few 'jump' scenes and moments that make you feel cold. It is supposed to make you feel for the dead and become understanding. It makes you feel how the boy, Cole Sear (Haley Joel Osment), feels throughout the movie. And, most importantly, it makes you feel for the doctor, Malcolm Crowe (Bruce Willis), in the final scene. It is a very unique, exciting film.M. Night Shyamalan both writes and directs this nigh perfect film. He makes every scene, every revelation, have the perfect feeling to it. Somehow, he makes us feel how the two main protagonists feel throughout the movie through both the writing and directing. One big problem people seem to have with 'The Sixth Sense' is Malcolm Crowe. People dislike how he could spend years with his wife and not realise that he was dead and she couldn't see him.If you pay attention, you'll see that he skips through his daily life. He misses certain parts, even days, without realising. A big example is when he can't open the basement door. He reaches for his keys in his pocket, but then he's in the cellar. He never got his keys out, he's supposed to have just appeared there without realising he hadn't opened the door. This happens at other moments in the film, if you look closely. He just appears with Cole or his wife, shifting between the two.The film really is a masterpiece. You'll probably miss many rules and clues throughout the movie, as I did, so I suggest you watch the special feature 'Rules and Clues' which is very interesting and explains things you miss or problems you think there are when there aren't. Unlike most special features, this film has interesting ones with Shyamalan and the crew, who also did a fantastic job creating the movie. I highly recommend the features nearly as much as I do the film.Overall, a very nice film made a masterpiece by the final moments. Throughout the entire thing, I felt that Malcolm was helping Cole, but it turns out they were both helping each other, Cole actually helping Malcolm more than Malcolm is Cole. A film that you watch entirely differently a second time around must be one of the greatest. This deserves to be in the Top 100 films, but I'm satisfied with its current placing. It deserves the attention and awards it has got. A true masterpiece.",The Sixth Sense

This movie worked on so many levels and I enjoyed the chemistry between Bruce Willis & Haley Joel Osment, which was phenomenal! Just putting it out there before you see it, this is a psychological horror movie, so if you're expecting a gory slasher movie, you'll be incredibly disappointed.The film revolves around a troubled young boy named Cole, who sees ghosts and is very intelligent. Bruce Willis plays his psychologist named Dr. Crowe and was faced with similar circumstances when a former patient broke into his home, earlier in the story. After making that fatal mistake, he is determined to not screw up again, by closely listening to Cole and helping him through his problems.Rather than relying on bloody violence and/or constant mutilation, which most horror movies use as their substance, ""The Sixth Sense"" keeps you hooked with its unpredictable twists and deliberate suspense that Shymalan puts on the audience.

Before this film I thought that it wasn't possible to have a horror flick with a plot.

I've always liked his movies and this one is no exception.  In fact, he's given much more dramatic room in this one.  He shows that he doesn't need fast paced action or cop roles all the time.Haley Joel Osment is the best.  I've seen several other of is movies at the time of this writing and he never ceases to amaze me.  At first, I felt sympathy for this child, then as it progressed I realized that his was the coolest role of all (you'll see).  He's been gifted with a wide range of emotional display.

411,Mcnabbbeasty,Shyamalan's Masterpiece?,8,6 September 2020,"While M. Night Shyamalan does an excellent job toying with our imagination in 'The Sixth Sense' it is not overly thought provoking or complicated in any sense. Just sit back and enjoy this thrilling ride led by one of the greatest & most convincing child acting performances ever with Haley Joel Osment and definitely one of Bruce Willis' finest performances as well. The cliche of The Sixth Sense having a predictable or obvious twist is a fallacy and illustrates the films notoriety and pioneered impression on its genre. My favorite PG-13 horror/thriller film ever, no cheap scares or stupid violence, just pure suspense.",The Sixth Sense

The film is good the ending really was the best bit it just made me really cry what he says to his girl and when he realises it and accepts it just very cute. Also the film was abit scary many parts in it did manage to give me the chills and made me look behind my shoulder a couple of times it is very intelligent in the fact that I'm sure many people along with myself also didn't click onto the ending. I'm glad I watched this film it has been out for a while and I felt I was missing out when I heard people saying 'I see dead people'. That quote is clearly associated with the film and I wanted to know what it meant so I watched it. Definitely worth a watch.",The Sixth Sense
413,Xophianic,One of the best films of 1999!,9,3 February 2000,"I am embarrassed to admit that the only reason I saw THE SIXTH SENSE when I did was because THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT was sold out. I hadn't seen BLAIR WITCH yet but I heard great reviews, and of course it was sold out when I went to see it. So my friend and I decided to see THE SIXTH SENSE instead. Not only did it turn out to be a better movie than BLAIR WITCH is, but it turned out to be one of my favorites.THE SIXTH SENSE is about an award-winning child psychologist Dr. Malcolm Crowe (Bruce Willis), who is depressed because one of his former clients committed suicide because Crowe was unable to help him. Cole Sear (Haley Joel Osment) is a child that has social problems frighteningly similar to Crowe's old client, so Crowe decides he will try to help this child in order to find redemption. Cole later reveals that this problem goes well beyond normal social problems. He claims to be able to see the ghosts of dead people, but no one else can.The acting in THE SIXTH SENSE was superb. Olivia Williams does well as Anne Crowe, Willis' depressed wife, and Toni Collette does a great job as Lynn Sear, Osment's loving mother who is very concerned for her child. I think that Bruce Willis is at his very best in this movie, and I happen to be a fan of Willis. But I think that Haley Joel Osment stole the show. He did an amazing job, expressing more combined emotions that most adult actors have to deal with. He is definitely the best child actor I've ever seen, and I am glad that Bruce Willis let him have the spotlight.The plot is very entertaining, though at times you may wonder where it is going. The ending is the best part of the movie, and it completely changes whatever you originally thought of the whole story line. I applaud the advertisers of THE SIXTH SENSE for not leaving a trace of the surprise ending in the previews of the movie (unlike DOUBLE JEOPARDY) and I certainly will not give it away in this comment. But I will say that it will completely surprise most all of you. (I think many that say that they saw it coming are probably lying.)THE SIXTH SENSE is one of my favorite movies, and I think it is surely one of the best films of 1999. I hope it wins many Oscars this year, and I recommend that you go out and buy this movie now.",The Sixth Sense
414,andyetris,Healing the Wounded Healer,10,10 September 2002,"A child psychologist, returning home after receiving an award, is confronted by a deranged patient who condemns his former caregiver before shooting him in the stomach and committing suicide.  Emotionally and physically numbed, the psychologist takes on a new patient: a child who believes he can communicate with the dead.  In addition to feelings of depression and self-doubt, the psychologist is having difficulty in communicating with his wife, who has become increasingly distant since the shooting.  Gradually the relationship he establishes with his patient draws him into a strange reality.	""Sixth Sense"" is a character study with profound concerns, on the theme of self-absorption and despair in a spiritual universe.  Somber and low-key, it is misrepresented as a suspense thriller.  Viewers should be prepared for a counterpoint to the works of Swedish filmmaker Ingmar Bergman: the fundamental conflict in the film is between alienation and awareness leading to salvation.  Anyone expecting the more familiar Hollywood treatment of ghosts and the afterlife will be disappointed: there is no series of jack-in-the-box surprises as found in ""The Shining"" or Nicole Kidman's ""The Others"".  The concerns of ""Sixth Sense"" are similar to, but significantly different from, those of Robin Williams' film ""What Dreams May Come"", without the dramatic imagery.   While the mood and pacing of ""Sixth Sense"" are deliberately oppressive, the final revelation illuminates not merely the series of clues scattered throughout the film but the predicament of the protagonist... and by implication that of the audience.	This is a well-crafted and thought-provoking film, and the acting, while restrained, is also excellent.  Ironically, many viewers have found the surprise ending to be a distraction: some people seem to have sat through the film waiting for ""the twist"".  Paying attention to the characters and the message that is developed in the story will be more rewarding.  However if you dislike Bergman-esque films this one is not for you either.",The Sixth Sense

This film has no alternative to being boring because the screenplay has to carefully keep Bruce Willis from engaging in conversation with any other adult for nearly two screen hours! This give it an oddly staid funeral parlor cache between the gripping beginning and end sequences. That said, it is artistically done, well-edited, and well-acted, despite being so drawn out.I agree with other reviewers that it would have been perfect for a 30-minute Twilight Zone episode, or longer treatment at the hand of Alfred Hitchcock.",The Sixth Sense

The Sixth Sense is clean and minimalist (in some ways indie film). Every scene feels necessary to add texture to the characters and the paranormal situation at work. There are no extraneous or over-indulgent scenes. There are some warm human moments as well as some bone-chilling scary moments (like the opening scene). The relationship between the boy (Osment) and his therapist (Willis) is a special one in film history. Both, in their unique positions in life, have a lot to offer each other.",The Sixth Sense

It's beautiful too which is a strange thing to say about a ""horror movie"".The twist at the end is very impressive but it's not what made this movie great for me, because poor acting could've ruined it.

421,ks4,Stunningly original and intelling! outstanding!,9,4 April 2004,"As close to perfection a movie can get, that's what i felt about this movie, it is almost a perfect movie in every aspect, i can't as i sit here now right after i saw the movie think of anything where there was an obvious flaw, even the smallest thing as i tried to see them in the end worked out. An amazingly thought through movie that is both engaging, intelligent, original, shocking and best of all it does not reveal its end until the very final moment, beautiful!Shyamalan have with this movie constructed something that is gribbing in so many ways, there are so many feelings all around and they are put together so damn well, not only by the script and directing itself, but the sound and the cinematography is stunning, as the music and sound gives life to the picture, an example is the first real ""horror"" scene, where the camera is handheld, it gives a fantastic realistic view to the scene and makes it come alive a lot more than it would have if it had not been for the handheld camera, and the raw and tired look of the scene. Absolutely stunning work.I am as one can read very impressed with the movie, color filters, crookedness on the camera, everything has been used to create a movie full of atmosphere, it really reaches beyond and grabs you, it's amazing, shyamalan is sheer genius with this movie.For the acting i must say Bruce Willis and Haley Joel Osmond is just amazing, this must for one be the best performance by a child actor i've ever seen, nearly without a single flaw from such a young man, even the scenes where he have to display raw feelings he does well, fantastic. All the supporting actors and actresses gives a good performance too, doing their share of lifting the movie to a top notch level.Stunning movie, it's a joy to see that movies like this can still be produced!10/10",The Sixth Sense
422,DorianWynHowells,A psychological/supernatural thriller that delivers.,9,22 January 2002,"I don't care what anyone says, this film is NOT a horror!! It's a thriller, and it lends itself more to the psychological and supernatural than anything else!Haley Joel Osment's line - ""I see dead People"" will go down in history with lines such as ""I'll be back"" and ""You talkin' to me?"". This line also sums up the film.M. Night Shyamalan's big screen debut is tense, scary, and very clever -perhaps a little bit too clever?!!With Osment, the casting couldn't have been better. With Willis, you feel he has finally found a director who knows what he is truly capable of. They both give great performance's in this film.******PLOT SPOILERS******When I first saw this film I was scared witless. I also knew there was a twist. My mates said, that I could either figure it out in the first 5 minutes, or I'd have to wait until the climax. Well, when I went in I totally forgot about the twist and settled into the film's unique pace. When the twist came........my God I was crying my eyes out!!!! It was sooo heartbreaking!!!! That one line from Olivia Williams ""Why did you leave me?"" was perfectly delivered and as Bruce's character Dr. Crowe realises the shocking truth, so do we, and we are left reeling!!!!But, when you really think about it, or watch it for a second time, you begin to see the major plot holes. So he's been dead this whole time? Does he eat? Does he do his shopping? has he not spoken to ANYONE since he's been dead? Why has he noticed his blood stained shirt NOW? there are a lot of questions one could ask that could destroy the whole film. But, I don't hold that against it, for the simple reason that the director has constructed a tight paced film, with a few genuine shocks, and no matter how weak the twist seems after we dissect it, it's still a good one, and I still cry!!! That's a sign of good acting, good manipulation, and a great score.This is a film that is intelligent and knows what it wants to be. The director is also known now for his surprise shock ending's (Unbreakable anyone). If he can keep throwing us off the scent, AND show us the truth at the same time, then that is a good sign that this director knows what he's doing.Thumbs up for 9/10Enjoy!",The Sixth Sense
423,Charles-31,Would have been better without the trailer,7,12 August 2000,"This is clearly one of the best horror films ever made.  It accomplishes good fright without a lot of gore.  However, it has some weaknesses that still bother me and clearly do not make it an Oscar contender with such great films as American Beauty and Girl Interrupted.  The first flaw is not in the film, but in the trailer.  Yes, ""I see dead people"" is an enticing line, but I would have given anything to see this movie without knowing that in advance.  It really detracted from the early suspense.  And, the big surprise ending I hear about is so obvious that I thought the surprise might be that the obvious ending didn't occur (and this would have made it a better film).  Unfortuantly, the obvious does happen and they use very heavy-handed flashbacks to make sure even the dumbest in the audience get the idea.Other than these flaws, it's an excellent film.",The Sixth Sense

(Toni Collete, Bruce Willis, and especially Haley Joel Osment). This movie actually wasn't all too scary. It was very suspenseful while I was watching it (which was late at night). The strange thing is I experienced more anticipation in this movie than any ever. As far as horror goes anyway. It really had me on the edge of my seat in some scenes, with my heart thumping. Then again, movies are a lot scarier in a quiet setting with the lights off. It also made the hairs on my arm stand up. (you can hear an explanation of why this happens in the movie). I appreciate scary movies like this a lot more than the graphic ones. They have more depth and are not built just around shocking scenes. I enjoyed The Ring, and 1408.",The Sixth Sense

I've followed Haley Joel's career since his sitcom days and even i was amazed by him in this movie. he was scared he made you forget you were watching a movie and made you live it. Shyamalan provides an excellent and gut wrenching story which shows his range when you consider his prior film was ""Wide Awake"" which was a beautiful tear jerker of a film. this movie also has it's moments. Toni Colette is absolutely amazing and Bruce Willis gives the performance of his career. you can try to find a flaw in this movie but you won't IT'S ONE OF THE BEST EVER",The Sixth Sense

Night Shyamalan's work, you might like this as well. The only thing on his resume which would recommend him to me is as the writer of ""Stuart Little"" - and even that was hardly world-class!If, on the other hand, you like the works of directors such as Steven Spielberg, Stanly Kubrick, Mimi Leder, or Joe Dante as I do, ""The Sixth Sense"" is a pretty poor waste of a couple of hours of your life.",The Sixth Sense
429,johnmschofield,I am so glad I didn't know the ending when I watched it for the first time,9,3 March 2010,I didn't have any preconceptions about this film when I watched it for the first time because I wasn't aware of anything about it at all which is remarkable in itself considering I watched it about seven years after it was released. I liked this film because it was innovative and not really that shocking but it worked for me on all sorts of levels because it was clear to me that a lot of care was taken in its production. All of those involved deserve congratulations on a job well done. The storyline was relatively easy to follow but like a lot of other people I wandered willingly up the wrong path and was pleasantly surprised by the revelation when it came. The film is about as good as the parts that make it up which means that I would give this film 9.5 out of ten but since I cannot do this I will give it a 9. When I watched it for the second time I took particular note of all of the interactions and it was then that I saw how good the film is. The central characters are strong apart from Bruce Willis who in my humble opinion didn't quite step up to the mark. I do not know enough about acting but I do know that there was something about Willis which didn't quite set well within the film. It wasn't a major flaw but the 'feel' was not always spot on. Maybe I am being overcritical here but it was my feeling. That aside it is a remarkable piece of work and I would recommend anyone watch it and fortunately it is good enough to be watched repeatedly,The Sixth Sense

You all know the story by know, and yes, there are then thousand plot holes, but it really doesn't matter when you have film-making of this standard. The direction and score go hand in hand perfectly. While the actors all give their best, most notably toni collette and haley joel osment. Osment is the films heart, with a performance easily up there as one of cinema's best. The scariest thing in the film is how the kid manages to convey his emotions so realistically. When he is scared in the movie, he genuinely looks scared, and that is no easy feat to do with a big camera pointing in your face. Bruce Willis does a good job, proving that he can actually act very well when he wants to. But he is outshone by osment, which is probably best for the movie anyway. The plot is strong, and unwinds at it's own crawling pace, but it pay's off in the end with a touching finale that makes you want to watch the whole film again.

For me, the problem with young actors is that [because by definition, they *are* young] they always seem to be acting.

The only other movie I can remember with a surprise twist was The Usual Suspects.  I had trouble following that film's twist and turns in the plot.  The Sixth Sense goes with simple-fashioned storytelling.  No big sidetracks to the story and just follow the characters from beginning to end.  It's hard to describe what I think of the film's major plot points without in effect dropping hints.  All I can say is the mood isn't so scary, although it is creepy.

He is an unusually good actor, particularly for one so young.   Bruce Willis is quite good in his role of the Child Psychologist attempting to help the ostensibly delusional and psychotic child.  The spooky effects are good, and not overdone with gore or crude bloodshed.  In fact, the movie really makes one think about the proximity of the ""spirit world""- especially on a dark night when alone.

I really think it wasn't as good as people said but it's still a cool movie. It's more of a psychological horror movie. It will scare you but it doesn't have a lot of action. I also noticed that many scenes in the trailer are not in the finished movie. All the scenes deleted looked a little actionful. Why did they leave them out? Anyway, the plot was really cool and the script was good. The acting was great. Bruce Willis was great as usual. Haley Joel Osment was a surprise. He didn't look like a good actor but he was pretty good. The plot has to deal with a child who can see dead people but they don't realize that they are dead.

445,michaelberanek275,Soft and squidgy,6,11 November 2016,"There is a certain sweetness in Bruce Willis' engagement with the young lad in this bit of old hokum that kept me adhered for most of it. There's a sensitivity around the boy that borders on sentimentality, and if there were meant be be scary bits they passed me by. If I was a kid I'd really want Bruce to be my doctor. Perfectly benign fare to pass a dull afternoon, and I think devotees of Willis will get their fill. There's less plausibility in the other characters and the screenplay seems to reflect this in the way the pair seem estranged from the rest of the world somehow. As I said, there's little real scares here and I'd call it a kind of drama fantasy than a biting thriller. Perhaps it's a bad sign but I couldn't help noticing the period fashions, the pre-internet innocence, it is particularly but quaintly dated.",The Sixth Sense
446,dexter-3,This AIN'T a horror film...,9,19 August 1999,"""The Sixth Sense"" is NOT about ghosts or the supernatural.  Yes, there seem to be ""spirits"" or something, but think:  Why are they there?  How does Cole resolve the conflict?  That's what the film is about...All the characters struggle with loneliness (even ""aloneness"") and an almost desperate need to ""finish"" something.  That's what makes the film so affecting.  Initially, I was mad that I couldn't figure out exactly what was going on, but I later realized that it was due to some trickery AND some skill on the part of the writer/director.  The film's depth was fully realized by the excellent performances of HJ Osment and Toni Collette, who is outstanding in her role as a struggling single mother.  She is marvelous at playing each of the different situations her character is challenged with, and her facial expressions ring true every time.  The final scene with Lynn and Cole in the car is very touching, as Cole has often said he doesn't want his mother to see him as a freak.  Willis is also good, as is Philadelphia.  Wahlberg is certainly convincing.  It's difficult to discuss the plot without potentially spoiling the film, so my advice would be to just see it.  It ain't ""The Blair Witch Project,"" so if that's the thrill you're seeking, you'll be disappointed.A ""9"" out of ""10.""",The Sixth Sense

448,larcher-2,An odd pastiche that oddly works.,8,6 August 1999,"An odd pastiche that oddly works.  Excluding the terrifying prologue, the movie breaks down into four sections.  The first is a taut psychological thriller.  The second is a well-made, though essentially traditional, horror story with just a bit of gore.  The third makes an odd, and inadequately explained, transformation of the horror story into a rather sentimental and somewhat new-age-ish tale of redemption.  The last is a ""surprise"" ending that should not be a surprise to anyone who has carefully noted (1) certain incongruities in part two and (2) the nature of the transformation in part three.  Even if it is deduced in advance, the ending is very well presented and largely satisfying.Despite the constant shifts in tone, the movie for the most part carries the viewer along with it.  The production is pure Hollywood, but Hollywood at its best; for example, the scary bits are announced with the same sort of camerawork and sound effects that Hitchcock polished to perfection long ago. The acting is uniformly good.  One surprise is that Bruce Willis can act. His young more-or-less co-star handles a somewhat disconcerting variety of moods and mannerisms remarkably well.  Somehow, after all this, it's hard to be scared of the woods.",The Sixth Sense
449,Buff2001,"It's not horror, it's metaphysics!",10,24 September 1999,"I am glad this movie got such high marks, but from the comments this mostly relates to the acting and the ending. This, plus the music and cinematography are outstanding but that is not what really made it with me.I never see junky horror films and that is what I thought this was until some of my metaphysical friends clued me in that it was a great movie. Metaphysics is the belief in things unseen including the entire premise of this movie.I am a licensed practitioner of metaphysics and this absolutely beautiful movie is a primer on beliefs held by many in the metaphysical community, which not coincidentally is centered in California, with Arizona and Florida following.The entire movie is a wonderful example of how the Creator ultimately weaves everything together in the right and perfect fashion.  Every piece fits like a glove in the tapestry of eternal, unending life.If you liked Powder, Phenomenon, Defending Your Life, Ghost, or any of a host of films like that, don't miss this one!While it sure is not ""horror"", Sixth Sense could be described by many as ""fantasy"".  For me, it is a picture of a very real possibility. The underlying concept of people floating around trying to work out unresolved issues before ""moving on"" may be scary to some and probably way beyond the realm of possibility for most. In any case, this movie does a superb job of painting a tapestry that most metaphysicians would quickly recognize and love.",The Sixth Sense

The ending of the movie at first doesn't seem to make sense, but then when you look back at the entire film, it makes sense all along.  Haley Joel Osment is spectacular as Cole.

What gives it the edge and my thumbs up are the fantastic performances. Osment and Toni Collette are both Oscar material. Collette plays his mother, Lynn, who is struggling to understand her child, but still loves him with all of her heart.So, fantastic performances give The Sixth Sense a 3/4.",The Sixth Sense

He carries the film), brilliant direction, and most of all, a plot!  And what a plot it is.  I was totally engrossed in the trauma that this young boy was going through.  I had no idea about the twists the film would take and if you read these critiques it's unfortunate that the fact that there is a twist ending is revealed. You're better off not trying to figure it out, but instead allow yourself to be transported into young Cole's world.  Lighting and color are used wonderfully to set the mood, often changing within a scene.  The music, which can so often ruin a good shock by being more powerful then what's on the screen instead hightened each moment perfectly.There are some truly scary moments but this is not a horror film.  It's drama with some supernatural elements, so don't be put off by a poor marketing campaign.  As with most twist endings meant to spin everything you've just seen 180 degrees, this one leaves many questions unanswered but if you believe in the world the movie draws you into, these are easily overlooked.  I was unfamiliar with M. Nigh Shyamalan,, but I will certainly be looking forward to his next turn as writer or director (hopefully both again - his singular vision was a huge asset to this film)  Don't miss this flick!",The Sixth Sense

The movie at its heart is a film that seeks to explore death and how that death affects those around us through the use of Cole. And while I was sceptical as child actors can vary substantially, I am happy to report the actor does a excellent job. In fact every one of the actors does a good job at portraying their characters. The story itself is quite good and the main twist is a welcomed surprise although a bit easy to guess once you're about 60% through the film. The only main problem is its opening which is quite slow and a bit hard to sit through. However other than that, this movie is something every film goer should watch, it has after all in my eyes stood the test of time.",The Sixth Sense

457,Doogie D,Mellow suspense film. Spoilers.,7,14 March 2000,"I hadn't seen the trailer and don't care much for Bruce Willis, so it wasn't until this last weekend (and a slew of Oscar nominations) that I plunked down matinee money to see The Sixth Sense.  I knew there was some Big Secret Twist and the tag line (""I see dead people""), but that was all I knew.Without spoiling anything, I've got to say that pretty soon into the movie I had figured out the twist, and I thought it was so obvious that I assumed there must be something more; halfway into the movie I realized, nope -- the writer director is saving this up for his big revelation.  That was a letdown.Dispensing with that, I thought this was a decent enough movie.  The character study made this probably the most mellow suspense movie I've ever seen, but that was fine.  The movie rightly lets its emphasis fall on the young boy who is far more interesting than his doctor, but this also leaves one of the holes large enough to drive a truck through: the disintegration of the doctor's marriage so quickly after being shot is presented as an incongruous ""given;"" that was my immediate tip off that there was only one explanation.  The movie also plays a little coy with its supernatural rules (""they can only see what they want"") so that the dead can move a physical object (a coin, videocassette box, a piece of jewelry) but then, maybe not (the desk barring the door).The main reasons I decided to see the movie were 1) check out Haley's performance and 2) there's just not much else out there right now.  All of the performances in the film are good, but Haley Joel Osmet and Toni Collette, as the boy's mother, have a couple of scenes together which are terrific.  Neither one gets to exhibit a great deal of range -- not their fault; it's written into their parts -- but they more than make due with what they're handed.  Osmet and Collette's final scene together in the car is absolutely fantastic, wrenching stuff.A side note: Osmet is in far too many scenes to be considered a supporting actor. Perhaps that's just my perception because I was quite interested in his character and predicament, but as I think back, he still seems to have about equal screen time with Willis.  I haven't noticed that anyone else picked up on this, though.",The Sixth Sense

That's how effective the ""seeing dead people"" scenes were. The young actor does a great job as portraying someone who sees dead people. Bruce Willis has a very unusual role where he does pretty good to portray vulnerability. The direction and editing of the film give us a view of the world from the eyes of a child who ""sees dead people"". Thomas Newman provides a very subtle yet haunting score that complements the movie very well.",The Sixth Sense
459,watto124,Insanely masterful,10,23 September 2001,"Congrats to Mr. Shyamalan for constructing a cinematic work of art. Not only is the film entertaining, it is also engrossing and extremely intelligent. You can watch the film in two different dimensions. One, which only happens once, is the first time you see the film. Everything up until the end is basically an engrossing, yet somewhat trite thriller. The SECOND time however, your transported into another world basically as if you're watching a different movie than the first. Everything makes sense. The strange way Willis and Williams interact is masterfully explained. Religiously, the film doesn't have many boundaries, either. Uncanny acting, beautiful artistic camera techniques, smart writing, and an unusual, wonderful pace make ""The Sixth Sense"" a must-see for anybody.

At the moment he meets the boy in the church, I turned to my wife and said, ""He's ____."" Honestly, I had not seen any of the promos, nor heard any of the hype, for this film. My wife picked it. So, when I got the ""punch line"" early, the next hour or so became a dreary, repetitious slog, with me dumbfounded by the inability of the rest of the audience (I spent about as much time watching them as watching the screen) to see what, I thought, was so blazingly obvious.Great idea(s) in this film, but hanging so much of it on one ""surprise"" at the end was a dumb move, in my humble opinion.

463,lethalweapon,Absolutely Incredible. An enduring classic!,9,19 January 2003,"I hate horror movies as a class. Did I say I hate them? No, no... I mean I HATE them. A barrelful of smart alecks running around with buckets of red paint. No coherent script, no decent acting, no sense of direction.... pretty much wraps it in a nutshell. There are very few exceptions. You've seen a horror movie that's good? It's not a horror flick! When I say these opinions, people always give some good movies' names, like Alien... Alien was a thriller. Not horror... Same goes for Predator, and Jaws. Debatable, maybe... but that's my opinion anyhow.The Sixth Sense is a fantastic movie. I've watched it 27 times to date, and I'll watch it again... I must say that initially I was not interested. I was not in the mood for the 'classic' and dragging story. I just kept my cousin company as we watched it together.Even in my state of partial interest, I could easily see that the direction was superb. Bruce Willis, as expected, gave a very convincing portrayal of the helpful psychologist. But I was short of appalled when he was nominated for Best Actor, and Osment for Best Supporting Actor. I protest. Haley Joel Osment played the centre character here, and Willis, legend as he is, played the supporting role. I was mesmerized by Haley Joel Osment. That kid took on the part that demanded maturity to an extreme level, and he delivered his part flawlessly. Flawlessly!It's really hard to see good child actors these days. Hey... it's really hard to see good child actors these period. And Haley proved prodigious. His performance cannot be equalled in the near future... not easily.Anyway, when the movie finished, my cousin, thoroughly impressed, said,""You weren't expecting that, were you?"" I nodded no. We talked about the movie for a while, and he left. Immediately, I saw the movie again. I have great respect for Manoj Nelliyattu Shyamalan, and for Bruce Willis. But more than that,... for Osment.

They definitely deserve Oscar nominations. For me, the movie had a few high points, especially a late, emotional scene between Cole and his mother in a car, but I felt the story could have been told better, and that the writer/director kept too much information ""secret"" for too long, in order to make the twist ending work. The ghostly visitations were scary at first- especially the initial one by the woman in the robe-- but then became kind of cheap and ""fake"" to me.

Everybody should see this movie at least once. The Sixth Sense is about a child psychologists who comes into contact with a young boy that has an extraordinary but chilling and creepy gift, he can see ghost, or as he calls them ""Dead People"". This boy is terrified beyond belief, everyday is a nightmare for him, his mother knows something is wrong but the boy will not tell her, for fear she will think him a freak and crazy. The boy lives in solitude, he has no friends and everybody thinks he is a freak. As the story progresses the child psychologists helps him realize that these ghost are not trying to harm the boy, but are trying to communicate with him in a way.M. Night Shyamalan the director of this masterpiece has given us a thriller here that we will never forget. Me and my wife watched it this past Halloween, and boy did my wife not go to sleep. This movie makes for a great Halloween and popcorn and candy movie to watch, a fantastic cast completes this story, Bruce Willis, Haley Joel Osment,and Toni Collete. Honestly, I was hoping for a sequel to be made but this is just pure masterpiece to have more made, I could imagine Cole (Haley Joel Osment) the boy who can see ghost grown up and helping ghost. But this one is good enough.Give it a watch, you will not be disappointed. I would recommend watching this on Halloween with the lights off and by someone you love or with a group of friends. But I have to warn you it does stick, so be prepared to not sleep the first few nights, I slept just fine, it was my wife who had the trouble. LoL :-) 10/10 for The Sixth Sense",The Sixth Sense
467,NpMoviez,The reason why everyone loved Shyamalan back then!!,10,15 August 2019,"Shyamalan at his very best! I said it, I don't care what people think. Many people claim Unbreakable to be his best film till date, but for me, as much as I love Unbreakable, The Sixth Sense will always remain as the best Shyamalan had to offer.Good : It's his masterpiece. Shyamalan has never been better. What does it not have? Emotions, drama, character development, storytelling, great writing + directing, all of it. Willis does a really good job. It is perhaps the first time I saw him in a role like this, one of the best examples of casting against type. The arc of the child played by Osment and that of Willis have been given full justice. Seeing them help each other overcome their problems and fears in the way they did was very good. There are some emotional moments which hit the right notes, all because we have known the characters very well. We get a happy ending for the kid, and while expecting something similar for Willis, we get the infamous twist. The first time I watched it, I was blown away. It feels kind of obvious having it watched so many times now, but man was it incredible! Bruce was dead all the time. This made me analyze some parts. Bruce died with the bullet on his abdomen, and in a scene where he is getting out of a flower shop seeing his wife with another guy, he is clutching the exact place where he was hit. And in every scene after he was shot, his interactions with his wife feel and are obviously him talking to her, but her talking to herself. For a first few views, it is unnoticeable. And, it doesn't even feel that way. Also, Willis is not interacting with physical object. What I thought of a plot hole in the first few viewings were actually genius writing and directing. And I would also like to talk about the horror aspect. It's something I call genuine horror. There are creepy stuff going on and you don't know what is actually happening. It's not a horror movie but has got the elements perfectly. And of all the emotional parts, the final moments after the twist hit perfectly. I wonder why this wasn't an Oscar worthy film.Bad : Not necessarily bad about the film. But Shyamalan was called the next Spielberg after this film. His next great film was Unbreakable, followed by Split. Split was good, but nowhere near the former two, which was leaps and bounds better than Signs and Glass. And besides these, I don't even want to name the rest of his disasters. I still think he can make real good films, but comparing most of his films, I sadly feel that he was no Spielberg but just a one hit wonder.Conclusion : It's the greatest Shyamalam film ever. Unbreakable is a close second. Those who think Shyamalan didn't have any potential must watch this. It is just that Shyamalan must have stayed this way. Also, any thriller fans out there? Watch this immediately, if you haven't watched it.Rating.Score : absolute 10/10Grade : A+",The Sixth Sense
468,Mr_Mirage,Superior film making by a superior film maker,8,26 January 2002,"Something that seems to pass unnoticed by all of our so-called Critics, is that M. Night Shyamalan makes remarkably subtle films. This is, ostensibly, a horror film. There is a very restrained sense of violence and gore, although both are present. No one seems to notice that people in all three of his films *whisper* their lines... no one shouts in this Night. (Sorry, couldn't resist.)There is always a sense of place in his films. We see a world that is not Hollywood, nor New York. This is a place he has been, and knows intimately. A rare and wonderful thing in itself. The film's pace is deliberate, a Shyamalan hallmark. He lets the story tell itself, at its own pace and in its own style. Rare and wonderful are terms that come to mind, over and again, with each of his films.",The Sixth Sense
469,Stephen-12,Effectively chilling and intelligently made,8,6 November 1999,"This is good stuff, but since there are already so many comments, I'll be brief:The direction is excellent - everyday buildings sprout monstrous gargoyles (I don't know if everyone spotted it, but there is a moment near the beginning where the skyscrapers in the background appear to have demonic, grinning faces); subdued or oblique lighting intensifies the air of menace; the shocks, few though they are, are impeccably timed.One should praise Tak Fujimoto and James Newton Howard for their excellent contributions.The performances are restrained, but not bland. Colette is at her finest, as usual. Haley Joel Osment is a revelation, one of the best child performances ever (note the bit in the church where, from the balcony, he talks to Willis with the weariness and sarcasm of a much-lived adult).THAT twist...well, it's reasonably unpredictable, but it's a shame it isn't really developed. In fact, the film seems to disappear into a blandness at the end which reminds you it was made in Hollywood - which is a shame, after so much good value along the way. And, as you think about the twist, you realise it's actually illogical. Oh, well, I'll say no more about it.Overall, the film will be compared to Blair Witch, though it doesn't resemble it much. What it's really like is a cross between The Shining (which is inferior) and The Innocents (which remains superior, because it is much more bitter and chilling). In fact, the appearance of the first ghost in Sixth Sense so closely resembles a moment in The Innocents, that I can't believe it's not been copied. Still, this is not really a criticism - this is fine, intelligent, thoughtful film-making, and how often does that come from a studio picture these days?",The Sixth Sense

I guess that people who are more into this kind of material may have a better understanding than me, but regardless of that I found this movie a bit overhyped.

The performances are all outstanding, especially Donnie Wahlberg in a very brief but pivotal role at the beginning, and HJ could teach seasoned ""celebrities"" like Tom Cruise and Richard Gere a thing or two.

We decided, however, to go see The Sixth Sense in January, shortly before her leave. It fascinated me by its fresh approach to horror, quite different from the stuff I'd seen before.Unfortunately, the strain of not being together for half a year, save for my visiting her for a month, resulted in breaking up.In July I decided to try various devices in order to cure my heart, and one of them was going to the pictures alone to see The Sixth Sense again that was still running. I thought I'd be scared happy, or something...To my chagrin, the scary scenes didn't scare me at all, as I could anticipate them. On the other hand, I realized that underneath the horror layer was a layer of sadness, of loosing someone dear to you etc. (Remember the scene where Willis tries to grasp the check, and his wife snaps it up and says: ""Happy Anniversary!"") This, and all the typical couples in love who surrounded me in the dark of the theater, forced me to make a holy wow never to go to cinema once more without female company!",The Sixth Sense
474,CyMaddux,"Solid plot with great ending, but...",8,5 July 2000,"This film contains a great combination of horror, mystery, drama, and sci-fi all conglomerated into the same film.  The premise of the story is that a young child played by Osment is able to see dead people as easy as you or I can see the living.  What do these ""dead people"" want of him??  Dr Malcolm Crowe ( played by willis) offers his help to unlock the mystery.  **** Do not read this next paragraph if you don't want to learn of the ending**** Ok, this is a great film, no doubt about that.  The ending is one of the best as well.. But I bring attention to the fact that if Crowe is suppose to be dead all along yet HE DOESN'T KNOW HE IS DEAD, why don't we see crowe trying to interact with the living?????? He is suppose to be ""alive"" yet wouldn't it seem a bit out of the ordinary if your wife never talks to you?? OR in the case of when he went to see Cole at his house, he is sitting with cole's mom--- wouldn't it seem feasible to want to strike up a discussing with the mother of a boy whom you are trying to solve his ""mental problems""???     I just find it hard to believe that a man would not try to communicate with anyone throughout the duration of the time he is examining Cole, beacause he is DEAD so therefore if he did, he would surely realize something is wrong, why would everyone ignore him? hmm     This is about the only point of the movie that keeps it from a 10 for me.  The plot is well-developed, and Willis does a good job portraying Crowe.   Osment is the real star of this movie though.  The kid puts on one heck of a performance!  You believe his pain, his fear, and want to see his problems resolved.   Also, I would have liked to see Cole help the ghosts in his house ( the wife and the kid with the bullet wound) and maybe tell the audience a little more about the backgrounds of the ghosts to add more of an eerie twist. But a solid movie nonetheless  8 out of 10 p.s. if you like this movie watch Jacob's Ladder, another psychological thriller with a litter darker theme",The Sixth Sense

477,Brad K.,Brilliant and Creepy.,9,22 August 1999,"I had heard so many positive things about The Sixth Sense that I was sure I was going to be disappointed.  To my surprise the film lived up to all of the hype I had heard.  Haley Joel Osment (Bogus, Forrest Gump) stars as a troubled young child who sees dead people and is constantly haunted by them. Bruce Willis (Pulp Fiction, Die Hard) plays the child psychologist who is trying to help him.  The film is so much more than a ghost story its a well-written and subtle approach to what would be a child's worst nightmare. Bruce Willis (an underrated actor) gives a fine subdued performance.  You won't be amazed by what you see, but his low-key approach to his character is exactly the way it should be played.  And young Haley Joel Osment delivers a superb performance on a very difficult role especially at that young age.  I might be going a bit overboard, but hopefully this performance will not be ignored when Oscar time comes around.  Also, Olivia Williams (Rushmore, The Postman) as Willis's wife and Toni Collette (Velvet Goldmine, Muriel's Wedding) as Osment's mother are both great in support.  The big surprise however is a completely unrecognizable Donnie Wahlberg (Ransom, Never 2 Big) in a powerful one-scene role.  Highly recommended film.",The Sixth Sense
478,vbz,"I'd rather watch ""The Shining"" over...",3,28 December 1999,"A surprise hit of the year, and completely undeserving attention at that. The plot of this slow-building horror-noir, heavily drawing on cult classics like the certain 1980 movie directed by the late, great Stanley Kubrick, is not without merits, courtesy of a poignant treatment of a disturbed, misunderstood child prodigy. The supernatural elements of the film, on the other hand are contrived to such extremes that they are not believable at all and lack the power to truly frighten. Bruce Willis, as the child psychologist with a tough case and an unhappy marriage, should be given proper credit for restrained, realistic acting. But neither he, nor his gifted young patient can fix the holes in the scenery, which, if properly scrutinized, will reveal inexcusable and ludicrous inconsistencies. The consistently solemn, dour tone set to painfully conventional ""gloomy suspense"" music, does not improve the picture either; and the so-called ""surprise ending"" which everyone seems to be so fascinated with, makes VERY LITTLE SENSE if given sufficient thought.",The Sixth Sense

It has been a long time since a child actor displayed such maturity in a role. Cole's innocent little face hidden behind his absent father's large-framed spectacles betrays a child coming to terms with a terrifying secret in the only way he can.You don't need to go and see this film again to realize why the end is such a surprise but you will rush out to watch it again purely because it's an almost perfect example of it's genre.It is a near perfect 8 out of 10.",The Sixth Sense

For once, Dr. Malcolm found peace and Cole was able to cope with the other ghosts but the movie left a would cut open: Vincent Gray. He shot Dr. Malcolm and killed himself but then, not only had Dr. Malcolm failed him when he was a kid, his death doesn't help on that.

It doesn't cater to the ""jump out and yell Boo! every six minutes"" theory of thriller, but it has a number of genuine shocks (and a fabulous twist toward the end). Bruce Willis is wonderful - subdued and intelligent in his best dramatic performance since IN COUNTRY. And Haley Joel Osment is simply superb as the haunted Cole. He never overreaches or overacts. He simply experiences and reveals. It's one of the best dramatic child performances I've seen in years.

In my opinion, he does the best performance I've ever seen from a young actor. The way he acts, transmitting the feelings of Cole Sear is amazing.

486,kylopod,An appropriate spoiler-free review,10,31 December 2005,"The surprise ending to ""The Sixth Sense"" has gotten so much attention that it threatens to overshadow the film. I occasionally hear people say things like the following: ""The 'twist' was so obvious that I figured it out in the first five minutes!"" Some of those people may even be telling the truth. There's no way to know. But there's a lot of condescension in such remarks, an implication that anyone who didn't figure it out must be a really dumb sucker. At least in my case I have an excuse. When I first saw this film back in early 2000, I knew nothing about it other than that it was about the relationship between a psychiatrist played by Bruce Willis and a child with some sort of psychic power. I didn't even know what that psychic power was, and an early scene led me to think it was telepathy. In short, I had no idea even what the movie's subject was until about the middle of the film, so I was completely adrift as to solving the movie's mystery.Still, to anyone who did figure the secret out quickly, I have this to say: you may be smarter than I am, but that does not make this a bad movie. Hitchcock went to great lengths to keep the ending to ""Psycho"" from leaking out. Many people who watch that film today figure the twist out (probably because it has been imitated in countless thrillers since then), but the film is still a classic that holds up well today. Surprise endings are, ultimately, just clever contrivances, extra layerings on the cake. They do not constitute the difference between a good movie and a bad movie. A movie must work on its own terms before springing a surprise.Nevertheless, there can be no denying that the twist in ""The Sixth Sense"" is particularly clever. It's no virtue if a twist is impossible to predict. It is just as important that the twist be logical as that it be surprising. Plenty of thrillers feature twists that are arbitrary, where the plot fails to provide enough hints. Even a clever thriller like ""Fight Club"" requires a bit of a stretch to accept the ending. What makes ""The Sixth Sense"" impressive is that it never cheats by suggesting that earlier scenes were imaginary. Everything we see is real, and only our assumptions fool us. If, however, you weren't fooled, all the better: just because you figure out the magician's trick does not make it a bad trick.Consider what appears to be happening in the film. Willis plays a psychiatrist who has received accolades for helping children with problems. We see a romantic evening with him and his wife at home. Then he gets into an ugly, violent confrontation with a former patient. Willis believes he has failed, and he wants to make amends by helping a new child (Haley Joel Osment) who appears to be having the same problems (and perhaps the same abilities) that his former patient once displayed. But just as he thinks he's making progress with Osment, his marriage seems to be falling apart. His wife isn't talking to him, and is beginning to see another man.However these events may be reinterpreted by what is revealed later, the movie is effective because it works on this basic level. In a key scene, Willis asks Osment what he wants most, and Osment answers, ""I don't want to be scared anymore."" It is not always clear that Osment is really facing a mortal threat. But because the movie establishes that he is undergoing a scary experience, by the time the movie reveals what it is that is frightening him, we have our emotions invested in the character, and the terror is very real to us. This is a step that most horror films neglect, the recognition that the most powerful fear may be the fear of fear itself.When I was a teenager, I assumed that all good horror films had to have an R rating. Even as an adult, I was surprised that a movie as frightening as ""The Sixth Sense"" received only a PG-13. In hindsight, however, most of my favorite horror films, whatever their rating, have relatively little violence. Like all good horror films, ""The Sixth Sense"" allows the suspense to build and does not rely on either excessive violence or cheap scares. The ending adds an additional level of intrigue, but it is not necessary to one's enjoyment during the first viewing. Still, if you have not seen the film by now and remain woefully ignorant of the surprise lurking in its plot, I urge you, before someone ruins it for you, go and watch the movie!",The Sixth Sense
487,The Terminator,A Real Bad Letdown,1,1 June 2000,"I found this Bruce Willis suspense quite a letdown as it offers no action and is host to a diabolical music score. Of course, you will say that it is not an action movie  even so, there are no memorable scenes even in the suspense category and the movies dark and moody atmosphere gave me a very negative feeling. All feedback I have heard for this film is Wow, fantastic' but it has yet to make the tiniest impact on myself, be it on the big or small screen.

The film also takes time to establish characters and motivation (how many horror films can you say that about?).  It's a solid hour before the kid confides in Willis, but by then you know (and care) about him.  Then, to top it off, there's an incredible twist at the end that makes you replay the whole film in your mind.  If you like quiet, creepy horror thrillers see this film!

490,Parks,Film of the Year (So Far),9,27 September 1999,"Cole is a very disturbed kid, prone to swearing at teachers,writing obscenities and hiding out in churches. Dr. Malcolm Crowe (Bruce Willis) is a child psychologist, tortured by guilt after the suicide of a previous patient.  His depression is threatening his relationship with his wife, but he sees in Cole a chance for redemption. But Cole's problem may not be psychological.  The boy claims to be plagued by visions of the dead... So Bruce strips down to his vest, takes out an Uzi, and BLOWS THOSE GHOSTS AWAY!!!!!     Actually, I made that up, because this isn't your typical Bruce film, but it is a very good one. Bruce does very well in it, as the shrink tormented by ghosts of his own. His performance is reminiscent of Jimmy Stewart in Vertigo and the film as a whole has a similar dreamlike feel to it.  The film covers similar ground thematically too - the corruption of the past by the present, the hold the dead have on the living.  Both Bruce and the boy are in the grip of the past and this is evoked by haunting images of Philadelphia hanging malevolently over them both. The other performances are very fine too.  The young boy conveys his terror and incomprehension very well and Toni Collette (""You're TERRIBLE Muriel!"") is convincing as the fraught mother, trying to save her son from something she can't even comprehend. The film has a washed-out, dead look to it, similar to The Exorcist and the film probes similar anxieties (the mother's impotence to protect her child from abuse).  But this is a much more compassionate film than The Exorcist and stays away from in-your-face horror, inducing instead a low-key feeling of tension and unease. It's beautifully shot, well acted, cleverly written and rather creepy. I think it must be a good film, because it's made me come over all pretentious.
Many of the previous reviewers have dwelt on the ending of this movie.  I think those who felt the film stands or falls on this one point really don't get what the movie is all about...",The Sixth Sense

497,DrewAlexanderR1,M. Night Shyamalan on the Map,8,3 July 2015,"The Sixth Sense did an excellent job of combining drama with suspense. The cinematography has slow pans and long shots which allow you to sit with each scene and take it all in. From the beginning M. Night Shymalan draws the viewer in with the stillness of the scenes, and immediately you are sucked into the world of Dr. Malcolm Crowe (Bruce Willis).Dr. Malcolm is an award winning child psychologist; however, the story focuses on his feelings about his failure to one of his patients. He sees a second chance for himself in Cole Sear (Haley Joel Osment), and is determined not to fail this time. Malcolm has self admittedly been detached from his home life and believes that he won't be back to normal until he helps Cole. Cole is a young boy who is the odd one out at school. He fears events that happen around him that no one else can see, and he is afraid to tell anyone his secret. Cole doesn't have any friends and his mother (Toni Collette) is not always able to see everything going on with him due to the responsibilities she takes on as a single mother. M. Night Shyamalan creates a wonderful film that follows the relationship between a troubled young boy and the doctor trying to help him.

498,martijn-56,The standard for the twist story genre,10,2 June 2010,"I consider this the very best twist-story I have ever seen, followed at great distance by The Others. That I am not the only one, of course, is best shown by the great spin-off, included those by the same director. And even more the fact, that none succeeded to equal, let alone surpass this movie. The movie is compelling and keeps you intrigued to the end, and the end, well, it is legendary. To me it is so brilliant, like you have seen two good movies in one. Many movies of the twist-genre, if I may call it that, do not respect the checklist for endings. And ending should wrap things up, tie up loose ends, without tearing the story we have seen so far apart (in the worst case telling the reader it was all a dream). The sixth sense does this better than any movie before or since. But before I get to that, let's start at the beginning. It started with Bruce Willis getting shot by his former patient, now a grown man still troubled by apparently non-existing phenomena. It gives the right background, since we are introduced to the main character, Bruce Willis, being a child psychologist, who has dropped the ball somewhere along the line. Or not? Was that patient mad? The rest of the story is about Bruce Willis' character seeking redemption for his failure, as he feels it, by trying to do it right next time. That chance comes with the gifted child that is showing the same problems. But before that, remember the cut? After Bruce was gunned down you see him suddenly sitting, the next fall, on a couch outside, waiting for the young boy. It struck me as lonely, and strange. Of course, in hindsight, it was all deliberately put there including the clever camera work and fall setting, as any good story should only contain things that belong there for a reason. I thought: where is the hospital, where is the wife? Why is the atmosphere so lonely, and deserted? Well we know now why, but I did not then, so this was one question, one unsolved delayed bit of information – always a good thing to keep the reader, or watcher, hooked. Also his contact with his wife: distant, short visits, monologues rather than discussions. I thought they are in a fight, but about what? The end provided the explanation: they were not in a fight, but she could not see him, and she looked sad since she was mourning about her dead husband. A very smart way of twisting a story. It is very hard to do, especially since the whole movie you have seen stays intact, even after the surprise. All you saw happened, only from a different perspective. Just when I started to think the start was too weird, I was intrigued just in time by the ghosts that came along with the little boy Bruce had as a patient. I thought it would end up like Poltergeist, the spirits entering the real world, Bruce having to sacrifice himself, redemption, end. But the real horror came from the people themselves, with of course the climax the video of the dead girl, showing she was poisoned by her stepmother. A very different approach and hard to do, but this movie succeeded in being scary without showing the obvious spooks alone, but with staying in the real world. Take 'The Others', for instance, that movie had the advantage of the claustrophobic effect you automatically get when you choose an isolated place, like the estate they were on. The Sixth Sense only had the open world, a city, as we know it, and the heroes could walk anywhere. Not easy to create a scary atmosphere, there, since the characters could just go away when things got scared, right? But they couldn't , since the ghost where all over the place, too. All the questions I had during the movie were all perfectly wrapped up in the end. I thought: why would Bruce find out now, not earlier or later, he was dead? Well, he had come full circle, he helped the boy where he could not help a boy in the past. If he would let go now, his wife could move on and she was ready, having a new boyfriend. The time was right. The boy, he came full circle too: by listening to the ghosts, he would find out he was no freak since they did exist. They were there and by listening to them he could be of use to the people that they left behind. Also his mother understood her son was just gifted and not a freak, by the somewhat over emotional scene with him telling about her dead mother showing up at some high school event, something he could obviously not have known. It is extremely hard to wrap all things up this perfect, and the reason this movie does it nevertheless, is because it showed a carefully constructed story which was possible to interpret in two ways all the time. By diverting me to the ghosts themselves, I totally forgot to bother about what was going on with Bruce Willis' character himself and his wife, and why it did not fit. It stayed in the back of my head, but the ghosts were even more dominant. Brilliant, you can only do this once. Furthermore I can add the acting is very good, and the camera-work also, especially the scene with the stepmother. So all the way to the end, the movie is surprising, intriguing and scary. It left the Poltergeist or Exorcist approach and by staying in the real world it made the ghosts even more scary, or exciting if that is the word. The end itself is the biggest surprise any movie has shown, and manages yet to leave all you saw intact, even adding a depth to the story. Perfect. A perfect story, made into a perfect movie.

499,Colonel Ted,I had... THE FEELING!,10,16 January 2000,"You know the feeling I'm talking about. The buzz deep inside you when you see a film so brilliant that no star rating, any review, anything could possibly convey how absolutely superb the film was. Well The Sixth Sense gave that feeling for the first time since I saw Death in Venice a while ago. Anyhow, the plot sees Bruce playing a child psychologist and a year after he is shot by a disgruntled patient in his home, he takes of the case of Harley Joel Osment, who has the sixth sense of the tile: the ability to see the ghosts of dead people. After Color of Night and Mercury Rising, the prospects of Willis playing a shrink AND working with a child are not good, but he is perfect for the role. Gone are is usual action man histrionics and instead he underplays the role calmly and gives a performance that is worthy an Oscar nomination at least. Child actor, Osment is superb too and mixes his role with sympathy, fear and desperation that put his performance among the child greats. ""Brat"", doesn't even come into the equation. As superb as they are, the most credit has to go to writer/director M. Night Shyamalan who skillfully handles his intelligent script and comes up with a chilling atmosphere throughout the film as well as several electrifying shocks, based on relatively simply situations. Then there's the ending and a twist so perfectly executed it with have thinking for days, unpicking in your mind all that has gone before.

But, the ending, although a great and beautiful one, is not the best thing about this movie, nor is it a good reason to see it.  For my money, the reason The Sixth Sense is so good and so respected stems from the atmosphere that it creates.  This is a quiet, meditative movie - one that draws you into its core and actually fosters that ""wow"" sensation that movies are supposed to create (most don't, if you ask me).  The acting is superb in its subtlety - not just in the case of Willis and Osment but also supporting players Williams and Collette.  Of course, Shyamalan's excellent script and direction don't hurt the movie either.If you figure out the ending early on, don't worry about it.  It's worth your time to see how the story plays out.  Also, be sure to pay close attention to the role of the color red - it has an important symbolic function.  10/10",The Sixth Sense
501,Sam_Gray,I've seen it four times now...,10,3 May 2000,"And I still love it.  I can honestly say at this point that The Sixth Sense is my favorite movie ever.  In my opinion, it's better than The Shawshank Redemption, American Beauty, Dr. Strangelove, The Usual Suspects, and every other truly great movie I've ever seen.  To use a common but appropriate cliche, The Sixth Sense is genius.And it has so little to do with the ending, which seems a common fixation in this forum.  I love the atmosphere, the low-key performance of Bruce Willis, the breathless acting of Haley Joel Osment, the brilliant usage of color and setting, and the overall quiet and meditative pace of the film.  Shyamalan seems to have a real ""less is more"" philosophy of directing, and it works to this movie's advantage again and again.  A superb movie, and still a 10/10 in my book.  Do see it, if you haven't.",The Sixth Sense

So he goes and see a child psychologist. In this he seems to be confront his fear of these ghosts and seem to live a normal live at the end. But this is not another soppy dramatic ""live all happily together"" movie. Instead this movie is full of scares and spooks, but it is not this that amazes the viewers. Instead it is the ending which completely catches people off guard. The ending is like a ""Usual Suspects"" type of ending, thinking that it is going somewhere, but instead it takes a sharp turn. This is probably a breath of fresh air for Bruce Willis, who is remembered for his action movies. But the real gem in this movie is Haley Joel Osment who plays the child who sees ghosts. Absolutely amazing!",The Sixth Sense
503,dreamingescapist,They don't have meetings about rainbows.,8,29 July 2019,"M. Night Shyamalan's 'The Sixth Sense' is one of those movies that can keep you hooked on the screen even when you have seen the film several times, and you already know the big twist. Thanks to that, you can notice some new details, and thanks to that you can see some scenes from a totally different perspective than for the first time. I watched this movie again for over ten years, and I have seen it many times so all the story with its foreshadowing and twists is very familiar. I can say, I know the film by heart. This time I found more interesting how the movie is put together. The haunting atmosphere that is created mostly by what is not shown, or said and the avoidance of the jump scares. There is always something ominous, something threatening beneath. We know it is a ghost story, yet the most unnerving is when we can't see them. And when there is an appearance by one of the deceised, we get a quiet buildup for it. When the ghost is shown it isn't there to scare the audience to jump from their seats. Although, these scenes are quite chilling. What I found fascinating in this supernatural thriller, is the characters and the very human drama between them that itself can offer as many chilling and soul touching moments as the ghost story.It might not make you cry, but it sure can turn even the toughest guy a little bit softy from the inside.",The Sixth Sense
504,grumpyass,Very Good,10,18 July 2003,"When the movie cam out in the Summer of 1999 before I had seen it one of my friends told me the ending probably assuming I had seen it.  Well while watching the movie that's all that was in my mind but I tried to put it off and I did and when it came I was still shocked cause you didn't expect it the way it happened. The 6th Sense was a great movie.  It was a little scary, but had some funny parts.  Most of all it didn't drag on but kept moving at a steady pace.  No CGI effects were used, none I noticed anyway, but it didn't need them.  This was a blockbuster hit and was an instant classic.  I love this movie yet you can't watch it to much but I'd recommend it to anyone to watch if they haven't seen it already.  ***Spoiler***  I also liked how M. Night used the color red to indicate all of what was happening with the red door handle, sweater, tent in the little boys room, etc.  It was great to connect the color red with the ghosts.

506,schmimic,M. Night Shyamalan's first movie is a brilliant psychological thriller with a fantastic twist.,10,23 April 2005,"Starring: Bruce Willis, Haley Joel Osment Director M. Night Shyamalan pretty much came out of nowhere. We weren't expecting him or what he was going to bring to us, but then, he was there. And he left a huge impact on the film industry.His first film, The Sixth Sense, which he wrote and directed, and played a small role in, is an eerie psychological thriller. It's the horror movie that isn't a horror movie. It doesn't make you jump out of your seat and crap your pants, but it leaves you with this creepy, eerie feeling.Dr. Malcolm Crowe (Willis) is a child psychologist. After winning an award for his work, he comes home one night to find that one of his old patients is waiting for him in his house. With a gun. The patient shoots Malcolm and then turns the gun on himself.Several years later Malcolm comes across an interesting case. Cole Sear (Osment) has a problem that he doesn't want to tell anybody about. Cole starts talking to Malcolm, and Malcolm slowly learns more about Cole. He discovers that he has cuts on his arms, that he kleptos from churches, that he speaks Latin. He wears his father's old glasses and watch. Malcolm decides very quickly that Cole is a very interesting, very bright, but very disturbed child.Eventually, after Cole feels that he can trust Malcolm, he tells Malcolm his secret. He sees dead people. People who walk among us, not even knowing that they are dead. Nobody else can see them, but he can.The movie has several very creepy moments when dead people with pieces of their head missing, or massive cuts, or vomiting, appear to Cole and try to talk to him. Cole cannot figure out why they come to him, and they scare him to death.Malcolm eventually helps Cole realize that he is the only that can help these people. Cole learns how to conquer his fear and talk to the dead people and to help them with their issues.Osment does a superb job of acting in this film, especially considering his age. Willis also does a fine job, but the spotlight is always on Haley.Bottom Line: 4 out of 4 (own this movie)",The Sixth Sense
507,davesawesomeinbox,Good movie if you know nothing about it when you watch it,7,2 January 2020,"It is a nice thriller of which was an original concept. There have been so many shows and movies and even memes based off of this that watching the movie now, it might be impossible to not know what is going to happen. However back then when it came out, it blew a lot of peoples minds as it was the original that started this idea that has been repeated a lot by now.I recommend watching a movie called Odd Thomas right after this one, because it feels like a light comedic unofficial sequel.Also to note is that the acting was incredible here. You might not find a better test of Bruce Willis's skills than this. In this movie he reminded audiences that he wasn't just a good action hero comedian.",The Sixth Sense

509,gurghi-2,Mine Is Tingling,7,7 September 1999,"Even apart from its ""surprise"" (just to brag, I wasn't fooled) -it's still a good little thriller- very aware of its (structural) limitations and mostly content to be what it is.  Studio films are rarely this efficient or focused.  And Osment is terrific, though it annoyed me to realize that, even without direction, he would have made a much, much better Anakin Skywalker (he was even the right age!!).The smaller moments, though, are what make the movie worthwhile for me- the school play (light years from any of the like scenes in the abysmal ""Simon Birch"", for example), the couple in the jewelry store, the events at the wake.  Shyamalan does a good job of showing people relate in _pictures_ (true, a necessity afforded by the plot); it's so much easier, but not nearly so powerful, to let words do all the work. Great decision to shoot in old Philadelphia, too. (Side note: ""Wide Awake"" was also a religious-themed film, albeit in a much different way, and I've read that as a child Shyamalan attended a Catholic school at his parents insistence, even though they were/are practicing Hindus.  As his career takes shape, I'll be curious to see how his background is reflected in his films.)It strikes me that the film has benefitted from its relative lack of publicity- one actually had to go looking for information to find out anything.  The less you know, the more the movie'll hit you.  This is a rare instance in which the studio's inability to recognize what they had actually increased the film's impact, not to mention its box-office receipts.That said, it's really just an overlong episode of ""The X-Files"" with the 'heart' of ""Touched By An Angel""; theologically dubious and ultimately sentimental.  Is it any surprise that it's become such a success?",The Sixth Sense
510,gregory-23577,Bar None,10,18 October 2021,One of the best horror/suspense films of the last 30 years bar none. Those who don't like it or find fault with it for whatever reason don't know what's good and they take themselves (and their opinions) far too seriously. Tune them out. What a pity that M. Knight Shamalama's (or whatever his name is) career went downhill in the years since. There was so much potential there.,The Sixth Sense
511,sside2075,great,9,16 August 2002,The Sixth Sense is one of the greatest movies I have ever seen in my entire life. This film is absolutely magnificent. The story is great. The acting is great especially by the 11-year old Haley Joel Osment and also by Bruce Willis in a rare non-action movie role. The direction in this movie is also great. Not a single second of screen time is wasted. Everyone should see this movie. bye.,The Sixth Sense
512,Cantoris-2,"Oh, and it's a horror/thriller, too!",9,17 August 1999,"This summer cinematic season has been so dismal that I was about to swear off all further moviegoing; but when a very thoughtful and erudite friend mentioned having attended The Sixth Sense and liking it, I resolved to give it a try.Not usually going out of my way to see horror movies, I went expecting a thoughtful and erudite film, and it DELIVERED.  What is so remarkable about it is not the horror, but the tenderness and compassion permeating it.  I didn't know what to expect.  Yes, it was scary, but for me the chills were nothing compared to the tears.Haley Osmend's acting, as others have said, is so wonderful that you forget it's acting.  He is a terrified, troubled, miserable child.  But he is more. He is also intelligent, loving, and empathic.  Supposed to be the patient, sometimes, despite his horrible burdens, he becomes the therapist. 
The scene took my breath away when, after Willis has abandoned Cole with regret all around, confessing that he can't be the boy's doctor anymore because he has too many problems of his own, they meet later in the church where Cole hangs out for sanctuary, terrified of being anywhere else. His toy soldiers are lined up on the balcony rail. There is a hard edge in the boy's voice as he taunts the man who had deserted him: which of these trinkets do you want to play, or play with, today?  Then suddenly he looks more closely at Willis's manner, and his own changes to concern for him: ""Something's happened to you, hasn't it?""  Such dimensions of sensitivity save both of the characters in the story, and  propel their film beyond horror to greatness.I did not find the ending as surprising as some did, but it was very satisfying.  If the opening scene had been in a library, panning in on a newspaper and then on a story recounting the award given to the good doctor, or an article written by him, an even more intriguing level of Jamesian conundrum might have been evoked.But I still don't get the bit about the wine cellar which he could never unlock.  Anyone who understands this is invited to e-mail me with an explanation.  As the guy said in ""Back to the Future,"" my density has brought us together.Maybe a second viewing will clarify.  I'm definitely going back.It's worth seeing again.  Do not culturally deprive yourself. Go!",The Sixth Sense
513,Rod-54,Weak plot but weirdly affecting,6,9 November 1999,"I thought the plot in this film was terribly weak and Bruce Willis's acting flat.  Moreover, given the sinister overtones, his face is too cherubic and ungrizzled, seeming to smirk in serious scenes.  Before seeing this film I had been told there was a big twist at the end but I did not know what it was.  All through the film I tried to guess.  I came up with the final twist but rejected it a couple of times.  It is just too incredible.  Now that is saying a lot when the two premises on which the film is based are that some people can see and commune with ghosts while others cannot and that ghosts can move physical objects.  All that said, there is something affecting about the film.  When I left the cinema the world seemed surreal.  For some hours I felt literally uncertain about the people I saw around me and the motives for their behaviour.  A weird experience.",The Sixth Sense

It delivers some thrills and edge of the seat moments (the ending of course).  If you like mysterious dramas with twist endings, then you would love this film, otherwise than that, you might think it's a little dull. This movie has a very good story to it, but I think it could have been better.  But i DO recommend you to go see it, I thought it was pretty good.",The Sixth Sense
515,Abhinav009,Be patient and you will be rewarded,9,21 September 2019,"The sixth sense is described as the movie with probably the most effective plot-twist in the history of horror cinema. The movie begins and proceeds with a very lethargic pace, and at times gets a bit too slow. But it doesn't let that affect the tension building that goes on and succeeds to keep us engaged. Cole(Haley Joel Osment), the kid, proves a worthy selection for his role. Bruce Willis with his calm demeanour as the psychologist is equally convincing. As the story moves towards its last nine minutes and one begins to judge the story, Bruce discovers something, something that changes the entire movie until then, and beyond. That's right -the last nine minutes reward us for our patience.

I woke up the next morning with the images from ""The Sixth Sense"" still going around in my mind. This is a movie that I am definitely going to rent, so that I can watch it from a different point of view the second time, watching for foreshadowings of the ending.

517,abrown975,An absolutely brilliant masterpiece in every aspect it utilizes,9,13 August 2010,"There are only a handful of movies out there that have everything in it. Thankfully, this movie is one of them. What I mean by that is it has the horror (the absolutely creepy/terrifying type, not the crappy something-pops-out-and-startles-you junk), the sadness (Jesus, I pretty much just end up feeling sorry for every character), the happiness (and when the happiness comes, you feel so genuinely happy and warm that you could cry), and the best part- the twists (the kind that hits you like a ton of bricks, not some stupid, run-o-the-mill misleads and whatnot). But that's not all. The acting was beyond superb. Bruce Willis was spectacular as the main character, Dr. Malcolm Crowe. I honestly think an Academy Award nomination should have been given for him. But the Academy made up for that in giving, first off, Toni Collette a nomination. She had such a great performance as the distraught mother who only wanted a normal life for her son. But the real praise should go to young Haley Joel Osment, who also had an A.A. nomination, but should have won in my opinion. I will not go into depth because there is just not enough good things to say about his absolutely brilliant performance. The only thing I will say is that he had one of the most convincing and emotional performances of anyone I have ever seen, and he was only 11 at the time! However, a lot of the applause should go to M. Night. Shyamalan, whose writing and directing just goes to show that when he has the right material, he can REALLY make it work! I really hope he gets more opportunities to show off his talent, let's just hope he doesn't do anymore TV show remakes (The Last Airbender was just plain awful). This movie is such a beautiful masterpiece, and that's saying something considering it's a horror film!",The Sixth Sense
518,Jeremy-93,"Shallower than it looks, and some irritating slips, but still well worth seeing",8,17 April 2001,"My big problem with this film is the ending. No, not *that* ending (everybody knows this is a film with a twist, though I certainly mean to respect the tradition of not revealing it for the sake of first-time viewers).  It's the gooey, feelgood sentimentality of it.  What possessed Shyamalan, who's written a literate, well-paced, thoughtful and heartfelt screenplay, to tack on this gloopy, over-optimistic, neatly resolved conclusion for the young hero Cole? Very disappointing. I also think it was a bad mistake to cut the originally-shot final scene (available as an extra on DVD and at least one VHS release), which rounds out all the sequences we see on video - left feeling rather redundant in the final cut - and provides a more emotionally complex ending.  Maybe one day he'll see the error of his ways (and the studio will see an opportunity for more big bucks) and issue a revised Director's Cut restoring his superior first thoughts.Those are the reservations, which I put first because this film was praised rather beyond its real merits by a somewhat hysterical community of reviewers delighted to find signs of intelligent life in blockbuster film-making. Make no mistake, this IS an intelligent, finely-crafted, almost fully satisfying film, developing a premise that has to be one of the best ideas in modern cinema.  (There are some minor slips in consistency, however much the film makers may pretend otherwise.) Its biggest attractions are the beautiful cinematography, and Haley Joel Osment in the difficult central role; he's a real actor, a bit of a prodigy really, and gives a strikingly mature performance.  Bruce Willis rightly plays second fiddle.",The Sixth Sense

521,MovieRat-2,A true horror story,10,4 October 1999,"In a time when horror films are steriotypically seen as gratuitous displays of gore and of monsters who repeatedly mutilate ""innocent"" characters for no reason what-so-ever, The Sixth Sense decides to break the mold and return to the ""good old days"" of the horror genre.This movie doesn't use gore or overused violence to play on the audiance's fear...instead it goes back to way horror films were done in the old days. The days when  Hitchkock was the master of horror.  This movie, beside the ghost who are depicted with their death wounds, is at heart one big mind game.  This movie is very very believable...which adds to the suspense that is already present.  This movie, unlike other horror movies, doesn't treat the audiance as mindless movie goers who are only interested in violence and blood; instead, it treats you as intelligent person and often makes you think about what is going on.  The acting was superb, the music well done (although at some points it did harken to the current horror style of increase intensity of music means something is about to happen), an excelent story, and of course the best ending ever to be shone on the silver screen.  The ending comes at you out of nowhere and you find yourself with your mouth dropping to the floor.
If you see the movie don't tell anyone who hasn't see it how the movie ends. Trust me.   Hitchkock had the right idea about telling people not to tell others about the ending of Psycho but when people started to tell others...the ""magic"" so to speak died from the film.",The Sixth Sense

Night Shyamalan's films. They don't scare me at all, i've seen enough horror movies to know when the ""scary"" moments and clichés are coming, and sometimes the characters can be pretty stupid. I saw the Sixth Sense when i was only SEVEN, which was the time i was scared of a lot of stuff. When i went to bed that night, i didn't lose an inch of sleep. How it can be in the top 250, i don't know. The ""twist"" ending was no surprise, i kinda saw it coming. no person can be able to still walk around living after getting shot a million times by a psychotic person. The little boy was seriously annoying. he was always walking around like a ghost, and while it was ""scary"" for some people, to me it looked like he was drunk. some scenes aren't totally original either. while i was watching, i had this feeling in a few scenes, like ""What movie was that from?"" or ""deja vu"". and a few days later i happened to watch ""Tobe Hooper's Poltergeist"" again and realized what i was talking about. that scene where all the cabinets and drawers are opened is a huge, slap-in-the-face reference to Poltergeist. Also the scenes where the rooms get colder when the dead and unholy are near reminds me of another certain film in the Top 250 that exceeds this film by all standards.BOTTOM LINE: if you're looking for a decent ghost/supernatural being story, see Poltergeist or The Exorcist. If you like Shymalan's films, i can't say i agree with you, but whatever. that's my opinion. 1/10",The Sixth Sense

The trailer already provides the premise  (a boy who sees and communicates with the dead) but a good third to half of the movie passes before this is finally acknowledged, leaving the viewer twiddling his thumbs waiting for the story to really start.

All it has to offer are some atmospheric and sometimes disturbing images with a final twist to the story.But the film is entertaining and quite disturbing. Maybe I have too much of an imagination for my own good. I came out of the cinema thinking that I should see it again from the perspective of knowing the whole story.

I expected a lot here, and got what i expected. A great, and sometimes chilling movie. I have to admit there were times i grew a bit restless while watching. After all, the boy was seeing things that other people couldn't see. Even we as an audience couldn't see. And it's hard to sympathize with this kid if we don't understand what scares him. But we got to see it about 30 minutes into the movie. The images presented to us were sometimes scary, as the deceased people the boy claims to see are in the state they were when they died. E.g. A boy who played with his father's gun, misses the back of his head. In the end comes the surprise you wouldn't have guessed if you tried. Which just proves how involving the movie is because the obvious clues to the surprise are there in plain view throughout the movie. To the people who haven't seen the movie yet, I dare you to guess the surprise even now i've said these things.Sixth sense is a great, if somewhat overhyped movie. It's great, yes, but a classic?

531,vhilden,A single unexpected twist does not make a good film,3,12 November 1999,"The most surprising thing in the ending of this film is that it actually ended - it seemed to drag forever, never getting anywhere. Bruce Willis, after getting tired of standard issue action films, became rather irregular in choosing scripts. After the superb ""Fifth Element"", I had high hopes for the ""Sixth Sense"", but, other than the ending, there is nothing original here, it's just ""Ghost II - The Mission"".Of course, once you accept the existence of supernatural phenomena there are very few surprises left; anything is possible, since the supernatural laws seem to be very flexible. In this film there is no evident clue to strictly define it as a ""supernatural phenomena"" sort of film, so I kept wondering if there would be a natural explanation that put everything back in our physical universe, transforming it from the ""terror"" to the ""thriller"" category. No such luck. We get the same old story, so many times told. ""Some people are able to see ghosts and become scared by them at first, but ghosts are just people who died with their missions in the Earth incomplete, and they need help from living persons to finish their tasks so they can progress further to their final destiny"". Please, tell me something new, this story can become boring after a century or two.All in all, it's a linear plot, corny, absolutely humorless, full of clichés, with flat characters. Its only redeeming quality is the photography, appropriately dark, cloudy outdoors and sparsely illuminated indoors.Better see again that old Patrick Swayze and Demi Moore tape, rather than waste your time watching this crap.",The Sixth Sense
532,Walle-2,Don´t like it,4,15 February 2000,"Boring, uninteresting anda stupid ending that ruined that other things which the movie was built on. That´s how the Sixth Sense is. They tried to make it scary, but it wasn´t at all.I almost fell asleep while watching it. And its just the same thing all the time. The little kid see ghost and stuff.....so? Don´t care really.I think they did a bad job on this one. They really tried to make a big twist in the end, and they did. But it just doens´thold that´s all. But it´s not that bad it´s like a 5 pointer....",The Sixth Sense
533,Lockout_Salties,That's it?,6,20 July 2020,"The Sixth Sense is considered one of the greatest horror films ever, and quite honestly it doesn't stand the test of time. It was one of my first horror movies, so it should've had more of an impact than it did. I'm not going to pull out the ""I guessed the twist in the first five minutes"", even though I did and was quite underwhelmed by the ending. However, I came in knowing that there was some big twist at the end, so I'm not sure if I would've guessed it so quickly if I didn't. And besides, basically everyone else who doesn't care for this movie has already said that. My main problem with this film is that it is not scary... like at all. As someone who has seen real horror on their television screen (The Blair Witch Project, the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre, both Suspirias), I am thoroughly disappointed when a movie confuses ""scary"" with ""constant jumpscares"". Sorry Sixth Sense, but you can't try to frighten me with loud noises and sudden visuals and expect me to call you good. However, I do think that the acting and plot itself until the ending were very good, interesting, and engaging. It's definitely not a bad film, just a very overrated one in my personal opinion. If you're looking for a compelling supernatural drama, I would go for this. But if you want an actually scary movie, please look elsewhere.Final Score: 60/100.",The Sixth Sense
534,evandewangga97,Ghost Humanity,8,27 December 2014,"Initially, right now I'm really interested in humanity-subject. Not the kind of human race, but the human-feeling inside. I mean our conscience, or our human instinct. Yes, human as true human, not just a slave, weirdo, crazy-man, or etc. And The Sixth Sense (1999), just give another kind of human, a gifted boy as human. Yes, for such a talented boy, not everybody will accept him. The protagonist, Cole Sear, is just another ordinary child who also need to be loved, listened, and appreciated, in spite of his sixth sense. Before this, I just want to make a clear side about how I see the ghost itself. So, honestly I still believe in ghost, in other dimension of our world. The ""cinema reason"" is so that I can enjoy the horror-movie and movie like this. Yes, maybe just in the movie I believe in ghost. But, usually ghost-movie is identical with horror, and The Sixth Sense make the very opposite perspective. A ghost-cinema with humanity approach. There are two main idea of this review, humanity in people who sees ghost and in spirit itself.The basic idea is human knows to be human. So for this case, Cole really knows how other people really think of him. And how he should do to be normal-child. But, he just can't hold this ability. He sees dead-people everyday, he is afraid as a normal human. The problem is, nobody cares of him, what a pity. He just need someone who doesn't think he's nuts. Until he met a child psychologist, who on the first time doesn't believe in him. This is one of the essential human needs, the needs to be appreciated and accepted. Human can't live without this. And this movie delivers tiny message of it.The other humanity is in ghost itself. In movie, I believe in ghost like I said. So, from this movie, we learn that they are also need to be listened. However, not all people see them. And someone who can see them, such as Cole, afraid of their scary physical body. Let's say, if you look people with leprosy or other horrible disease, you will afraid of them, especially help them. This is what I get, everybody even ghost need to be listened. In real life, you can learn from people with acute health or physical problem. Of course, it takes time and great bunch of tolerance, but at the end we can see the joy of caring other people.From the core of movie, let's review the extrinsic part. So twisted and simple. The story is just nothing but superb. That's why I rated it 8 out of 10. Why not 9, because the cinematography is also simple, the setting is monotonous. But, what's good in movie, is just the original yet unique idea. This movie just make another breakthrough of how should we see ghost added by wonderful story and natural acting. Just another great cinema in 1999 epic year of movie.",The Sixth Sense
535,tinman19602003,Excellent film to add to any ghost lover's collection.,9,5 May 2006,"Shyamalan has done it again! This is top notch entertainment. For lovers of the scary and supernatural, this fits the bill. The plot builds nicely from the moment strange things start happening in Lynn Sear's kitchen to the final moment when Cole convinces his mother that he really does see ghosts. This film is destined to be a classic.Young Osment does a top notch job as Cole Sear the boy who sees dead people everywhere. He is at once frightened and confused, but bravely tries to keep his mother from knowing his real problem.In a standout performance, Willis has broken away from his portrayals of tough guys and baddies. Here he gives a sensitive, compassionate performance as the acclaimed child psychiatrist, confused by his wife's chilly behavior and the baffling case of the troubled Cole Sear whom he is treating. When he sees his wife in an apparently compromising situation he takes his anger out by destroying the shop window.Yet he genuinely loves his wife and is nearly distraught by her behavior both by her apparent lack of interest in him and her actions (locking the basement door, pulling the check away just as he reaches for it).Even Angelica Tom, who plays Kyra's disturbed and dangerous mother does a good job in her short time on the screen.Having filmed what is probably one of the greatest ghost stories ever written, Director Shyamalan appears briefly (as the doctor who treats Cole), as he does in all his films, as a tribute to his idol the late Alfred J. Hitchcock. If you are a fan of ghost movies, this is one you should not miss.I also recommend you see ALL of M. Night Shyamalan's other films. They are: Signs, Unbreakable, The Village, and Wide Awake (which is by the way a comedy, not at all like his other films and is ideal for the whole family). This effort is certainly in the same class as THE OTHERS directed by Alejandro Amenabar.",The Sixth Sense

Haley Osment is so good he's scary he's so good...he's scary...After Forest Gump somebody should get the idea this kid has a big future.  He's not cute, he's just good.

537,the-jerk,actually 3 different movies,7,5 May 2005,"""The Sixth Sense"" is a creepy, atmospheric puzzler about a child psychologist who is trying to help a depressed little boy come to grips with the fact that he sees ghosts. There's more than meets the eye, as everybody knows by now, and the first time you see it, if you don't know the surprise, it's an excellent movie.Like I said, everybody knows the secret by now, it's like the sled in ""Citizen Kane"" or the penis in ""The Crying Game"", so it doesn't even feel necessary to warn that there's a spoiler herein. Bruce Willis is dead! Now, if you were one of the people who found this out before seeing the movie, I bet it ruined it a little for you. And this is the problem with this movie; knowing the surprise spoils it a little bit, and since the surprise is nothing more than a gimmick (albeit a well-done gimmick), I think this movie relies a little bit too much on the gimmick to be considered a great movie.I didn't know the first time I saw it, by the way, and I was blown away. In 1999, it was one of the best movies of 1999. Make no mistake. It wasn't until it was released on DVD that things started to go downhill.Let me explain. I said at the top that this is actually 3 different movies, and it is; it's like a chameleon.1)You're seeing it for the first time, and you don't know how it comes out. Excellent. The surprise is terrific; I figured it out, but not until about 5 minutes before it was revealed anyway, and I know there are definitely people who didn't figure it out, even though they were trying to figure out something. The first time, you really appreciate the performances by Bruce Willis, Haley Joel Ozment, and Toni Collette. They all do outstanding jobs, and this is the one aspect of the movie that really does hold up over time. 10/10.2) You're seeing it for the second time. You know that Bruce Willis is dead, and you appreciate the work that went into concealing this fact, paying attention for some little slip-up and not finding it. But really, let's be honest; on the second viewing, and probably to an extent on any subsequent viewings, you're giving your full attention to the execution of the gimmick. And it's still good, there's a lot to appreciate here. 9/10.3) You're seeing it for the third time, and any time after that. You know that Bruce Willis is dead, and you know how artistically this was hidden throughout. So what's left? Well, the fine performances, and the creepy atmospherics, and the entertaining story. So let's not penalize the movie too much at this point, but over time, the quality definitely does wear down, because to some extent, you're still constantly thinking about that gimmick. 7/10, the rating I gave above.And really, there's a fourth aspect to all this; you're seeing it for the first time, and some dip**** spoiled it for you. Well, you may actually be in a pretty good position. You know Bruce Willis is dead, so on the one hand, you're not pulled in so much by the gimmick, and you can appreciate the other aspects that made this movie good; on the other hand, the surprise is lost on you. You see, it's a completely different movie if you knew the gimmick the first time, and you will never see it the same way as others did. That's a shame, but at least you weren't trying all along to ""figure it out"", and thus, the performances by Willis, Osment, and Collette may seem all the brighter. I can't comment on how viewers would have rated the movie in this position, because I wasn't one of them. But I think they would have liked it.So there you have it. AT LEAST 3 different movies, and at least 3 different ratings. I do give it points for being able to change so much on repeated viewings, but I have to take away some, because the power the movie has over you is influenced so much by that gimmick. It's not that it has become a bad movie over the years, but it has lost its status as a great movie.",The Sixth Sense
538,john_vance-20806,A genius denouement.,10,5 February 2017,"I'm an old man who's been a fan of horror and sci-fi movies for over 5o years. I'm pretty jaded now and none of the more recent scare-fests have impressed me. They may have a few scenes that get your attention but then they turn into a stomach churning gore-fest or throw in some plot twist that's goofy even for the genre - and that's saying a lot.I wasn't expecting anything special when I watched Sixth Sense but it immediately got and held my attention the whole way. And perhaps I'm the only person in the world who didn't see the end coming but I didn't and it made for an absolutely fabulous experience. I thought I could no longer be surprised by a horror movie but Sixth Sense let me capture a feeling I hadn't had for decades and gave me hope that it could happen again.I'm sure there are plenty of things to criticize in this film, but I certainly had no complaints. A straight-up 10 for me.",The Sixth Sense
539,Rambler,"""Is there something you want to tell me?""",10,9 August 1999,"I quote the line from the film above because that moment in the film has stuck in my mind. I first want to offer a HUGE ""Thank You!"" to M. Night Shyamalan, the director. He has succeeded in making a modern ""horror film"" without resorting to gore and CGI. This is a ghost story in league with The (original)Haunting (1963), The Uninvited, The Changeling, etc. It relies almost solely on the power of the actors to render its chills. There are still some genuine jolts--my wife practically broke my arm at one point as a mysterious figure swished by the lens. Bruce Willis is his most un-Bruce like, and he's great: soft spoken, gentle, emotional. Haley Joel Osment is the real thing--not a ""child actor"" but a warm, human, frightened little boy. And finally, a denoument that caught me off guard like a slap in the face by a hand from the grave. So don't sit here reading this drivel--go see it!!

540,bbc-2,Do NOT miss it!,10,17 January 2000,"It's amazing how can a movie with such a thin plot be so incredibly impressive. H.J. Osment is fantastic and Bruce Willis is as good as he gets. The whole atmosphere is almost tangible and, I have to admit, for the first time in my life I was tempted to cover my eyes during the movie. And the end ranks as the best ever in my book, better even than ""Shawshank Redemption"" and ""Usual Suspects"". All in all, by far the best horror movie ever and probably one of the best generally.",The Sixth Sense
541,Thaleia,Thrilling Surprise,9,8 September 1999,"What a wonderful treat to walk into a movie expecting nothing and come away seeing one of the best films of the year.  I expected little seeing as Bruce Willis was the star and although he does a fine job it is the young boy, Haley Joel Osmond, who steals this show.  He sends shivers up the back of your neck with just his eyes.  I can't say enough good things about this movie.  You just have to see it for yourself.",The Sixth Sense
542,David_Niemann,Future Classic,9,14 July 2002,"The Sixth Sense chilled me to the bone, with it's excellent performances, brilliant storytelling and wonderful directing by M. Night Shyamalan (who also wrote the screenplay). Malcom Crowe (Willis) is a child psychologist, and Cole (Osment) is Malcom's latest patient. I won't reveal anymore of the plot, as I feel less known about it the better. The film has a tremendous amount of atmosphere that oozes out of the screen, engulfing your every sense. There were at least two scenes that made me jump! And the film also has some rather funny moments, namely the video camera scene. If you never thought Bruce Willis was a very good actor, your mind will definitely be changed after seeing his excellent portrayal of Crowe. Australian born Toni Collette shines as Cole's Mother. And Haley Joel Osment brings shame to almost every other child actor in a film. He truly is a gifted actor, and I look forward to watching his career blossom. Much has been said of the films ending, and I don't dare say anything about it. Only that it is truly amazing. In the future I feel this film will be looked on as a landmark in cinematic brilliance in every aspect. 9/10",The Sixth Sense
543,cathcacr,"Good, worth watching, but overrated",5,8 March 2002,"This is a good film.  I'd recommend it to any movie fan as a worthwhile way to spend a couple hours.  Some of the scenes between Willis' character and the boy are touching.  Like everyone else I was caught off-guard by the twist ending.But does this movie deserve to be anywhere near the top 50 all-time as the voters on this site have rated it?  Nuh-uh.  As nice a thriller as this is, it's got too much of the ""Hollywood"" feel to it, and the twist-ending becomes gimmicky after a first viewing.  We already KNOW what's going to happen, so we'd better darn well find out what other merits this movie brings.  (After a first viewing, I thought it was neat but I didn't see what all the hype was about.  After a second viewing, to see what I may have missed, I still don't get it.)  And I just don't see what this movie has that is going to give it staying-power.  Will it stand out in 20 years the way that _The Shining_ still stands out today?  Don't think so.Of all the movies to get the Best Picture Oscar nomination in 1999, this is the least impressive of the bunch.  Surely there were plenty of other movies that year that will outlast this one in terms of lasting contribution to cinema.8 out of 10 for a first-time viewing, and a loss of a point for each viewing after that.",The Sixth Sense
544,Flyer78,"The best ""thinking"" movie all time.",10,16 June 2009,"I will not be reviewing The Sixth Sense. I will be reviewing M. Night Shyamalan's flawless masterpiece.First off, the acting in this movie is beyond excellent. Haley Joel Osment delivers a great performance as the character Cole, and Bruce Willis as Dr. Crowe delivers an equally good role, if not a better one. But who plays the better role is out of the question when you are talking about a movie of such quality as this. Shyamalan did such a great job with the writing of this movie and like my summary suggests, this movie really makes you think. And by the end, all of the loose ends or missing puzzle pieces come together and everything makes sense. You can watch this movie several times over and you will always pick up something you missed the last time. I have seen a few movies that had a big twist ending, and this has gotta be the 2nd best twist ending of all time- Only behind Stephen King's ""The Mist."" But when you look at the entire picture, Sixth Sense is the superior film, The Mist only had the superior ending.I suggest you drink some caffeine before watching this, because you need to watch it at night with the lights out, but you can't be sleepy, because you're going to need your thinking cap for this. But as long as you give it your attention (while still having a good time watching) you will thoroughly enjoy this film.",The Sixth Sense
545,General Urko,Great cast. Great Direction. Shame about the plot. *SPOILERS*,6,8 November 2001,"This film has a first rate cast giving first rate performances. The cinematography & style of directing is also first rate. Unfortunately the same can't be said of the script. The twist is very obvious & the film does not have anything else to say really in terms of plot. Also what I found annoying was the way the script tried to compensate for the holes in the twist. How could a man not know he is dead? Why can't he see other dead people? Well lets neatly answer that one for you!  ""They don't see each other. They only see what they want to see. They don't know they're dead."" Despite this it is worth seeing. As already mentioned the cast are all excellent & although this is his first major feature Shyamalan has already established a distinct directorial style. His next film Unbreakable is a far better movie which doesn't just rely on a gimmicky twist ending .Although it does come with a twist in the tail its plot has much more to offer.",The Sixth Sense
546,tomsters,slight of hand pick pocket instead of magic,3,31 March 2017,"big time spoiler alerts so go away if you haven't seen the movie yet. or even if you have and enjoyed it. plot holes always ruin it for me. plot holes, like bad math. very simple math. if it doesn't add up, its wrong. if the equation is long enough with more digits than able to easily keep track of, then the mistakes are more easily missed. this guy shammer the scammer is bad at math and is only good enough at slight of hand to pick your pocket and run away with your money. i love a good magic trick where i know I'm being fooled but i cant ever see how. but picking my pocket, i know you fooled me but only long enough for me to look the other way in trust you are entertaining me, not picking my pocket. Bruce dies, in the beginning, but we are not 'officially' told this until the supposedly twist ending, and then becomes a friend of a kid who sees dead people. but the red hearings we keep seeing to keep us from this twisted are misleading and in the end, i felt betrayed. the kids sees dead people, Bruce is dead. all the other dead people's wounds can be seen, not Bruce's. not until the end. misleading. all the scenes where the kid starts talking to Bruce, he is supposed to be interacting with the kid's mom or others and such. its supposed to be cool that he isn't really and we are not supposed to notice that. so in the end, we are only tricked into thinking this. but as the rest of the dead people are replaying out what was their life before they died or how they died. Bruce is on an unknown to him mission. very good idea if properly written into the movie. but what ruins it is the kid must know Bruce is dead and says nothing about it. all the rest of the dead people scare the crap out of this kid, but not dead Bruce. and then why does Bruce not realize no one else but the kid is answering him? the unknown mission is to save the second daughter from being poisoned to death by her mom. again, the kid is scared of the ghost girl first daughter while she leads him to the video she made of mom poisoning her. OK, cool, but why didn't she run away instead? but that whole bit seemed so out of place with the rest of the movie even if you did know the twist. why not have the twist realized before this part and then realize that's why Bruce is stuck haunting this kid to finish this mission. otherwise, how did Bruce and the kid really find out about Munchhausen mom? how is it not better to have a tighter better written script with the same twists?",The Sixth Sense
547,dover,Good Movie undermined by a colossally bad ending,4,9 July 2000,"It is hard for me to really comment on this film without talking about its ending (I won't). For about an hour and a half, this is a spectacular movie, well-acted, with excellent script and dialogue, and moving at a good pace. I think it's something of a cross between film noir and thriller, and it has that eerie ""Silence of the Lambs"" feel to it (though much tamer).This movie lasts one scene too long. I heard someone remark once that some movies ""are great or awful depending on the ending"". The very last scene in this film is absolutely preposterous; instead of wrapping up the story neatly, with maybe a tiny plot hole, the last two or three minutes brought to mind at least 20 or 30 gaping plot holes immediately. I have a friend who told me he could guess the film's ""secret"" thirty minutes in. Things like that usually don't surprise me, but this was so unbelievably, outrageously stupid I had no idea. I felt like screaming at the screen and demanding my hour and a half back based on that scene alone.The only reason I don't consider this movie among the worst I've ever seen is because it is quite good for awhile. Haley Joel Osment is excellent, and the only good reason to see this movie. Other than that, I can't believe this thing was as popular as it was. The ending left me feeling so cheated, I wanted to break the screen in two.",The Sixth Sense
548,MotoMike,A stunning and wonderful film,10,10 October 1999,"It has been more than six weeks since I have seen this movie. In that time I have seen five or six movies in theaters, and that many or more on video.This had far more impact on me than any of them (including American Beauty) - that's how good, unusual, and resonant it is.This is not just another horror movie, or just a horror movie with a twist. What it amounts to is a journey that the viewer doesn't know he is taking. Most horror films leave you at the end with a feeling of dread, relief, or remembered shock, but this is the first horror movie that filled me with joy at the end - and that's the most amazing thing about it. The other amazing thing is the sheer intelligence of this script throughout.
I'm not as impressed as some with Willis's acting - I thought it was serviceable and filled the bill. It was, however, great casting, because having him in there made the viewer start to expect a real ""Night of the Living Dead"" gorefest climax - Bruce against the zombies! Light the torches! - concealing the true nature of this movie until the end. But Osmont's acting - and the way he was directed - had me completely sympathizing with him; both his fright and bewilderment, and his later courage in being able to talk to the unwelcome visitor in the playhouse, were entirely convincing and moving.I will see this movie again; I don't think it's making too much of it to say that it's got enough ambiguities and layers of meanings to justify repeated viewings. I don't think that it will get the Oscar for Best Picture of the year; it may not even be nominated, and I'm not certain that it will deserve it. It's clearly not an Oscar-oriented picture, in that it doesn't have the Big Gesture, the Good Costumes, the Big Sinking Boat, the Grand Theme, the Anthony Hopkins appearance, and not a strand of classical music in sight or sound. But seeing it was one of the most moving moviegoing experiences I have had in a long time, and I hope that at least the script and Osmont get Oscars.

I will absolutely not tell anything about the ending of the film because it is something you could have known from the beginning of the film, but I had absolutely no clue.

Before I watched it for the first time, I already had great expectations, what is not good, the chances you have to be disappointed is much bigger then. But the opposite happened: I left the cinema wondering how M. Night Shyamalan could do something so perfectly arranged and also coherent. And I am not just talking about the plot, the soundtrack, the camera movements, everything seems to be in the right place.Cole is a twelve-year-old boy who would be like every children in his age if there weren't this simple fact: he can see dead people! The story is focus on Cole's little issue and how Dr. Malcolm Crowe (Bruce Willis) will find a way to help him. The movie also has beautiful background themes like: love, losing a close person, familiar relationships, human cruelty, friendship, human rational beliefs and how people always try to find reasonable explanation for everything, beyond of course the relationship between doctor and patient, how they have to be confident with each other to find out the answers.It's not a movie to make people scared like horror films, but it has the elements that can make you jump out of the chair and fell chills in your neck whiling watching it. The bad news is after this movie you might have another opinion about chills ... The same thing will happen about things we can't find anywhere... Never mind, when you see it, you'll understand what I'm talking about.The three things I admire the most about this movie, one for each time I saw it, are: the Haley Joel Osment performance  an Oscar deserved one, the techniques  how it really keeps the watchers attention, and how everything directs to the amazing surprise at the end.

This is one my all time favorite movies, and definitely my favorite ghost movies.One of my favorite aspects about this movie is the unsettling atmosphere it creates with some of these scenarios. A lot of scenes that could be boring are the exact opposite because of how much tension there is in almost every scene. It isn't really all that scary but the scenes that are scary, are more effective because of the tension produced.Another thing that was amazing about this movie, that was absent in Shyamalan's other movies, were the performances. The most notable performance of the movie being from Haley Joel Osment, who gives probably one of the best child performances ever. Child actors aren't really known for being very good, but this was an absolutely amazing performance. Bruce Willis is also very good in this as well, playing the child psychiatrist who tries to help the boy. But Haley Joel Osment is what make this movie legendary (in my opinion)And the final thing about this movie that is love is that you can almost always notice something different every time you watch it. It almost always a different experience when watch it again.So to end this off, I think The Sixth Sense is absolutely perfect suspense mystery and I feel it gets better every time I watch it.",The Sixth Sense
557,ad2020,Well crafted and popular.,8,22 November 2000,"Oooooooooooh a twist! OK, this one's kind of obvious and I figured it out at the scene M.Night Shyamalan wanted to cut, but I didn't want to believe it and the movie is too contrived for you to wanna believe it either,(the perception of Bruce Willis' character can only carry on so much before it's obvious the ending is what made the movie!) I feel sorry for the people who didn't figure it out or went into this movie with expectations (which no one should ever do.) A lot of cutting went into this one,a lot of it good, some of it malicious! But the movie deserves the praise given it. It's obvious that it's a one trick pony, but it's good one!!!! (Oh yeah, my best friend's gonna kick me in the head!)It should be throughly enjoyed since there's so much good stuff (the writing, the music, the acting, the direction and whatever else.) Today, it's seems I'm bashing editors! If you watch the DVD, look at the alternative ending and think ""Who in their right mind would trade this ending for the one given!!!!!!!!!!!"" A 8.5!",The Sixth Sense
558,jedibcb,One of my Favorite Movies of all Time,10,25 January 2021,"Bruce Willis' performance was Oscar-worthy. Shamalan's genius directing and writing made this film shine.

559,alishahmohd,A brilliant Psychological Horror film that leaves a HUGE lasting impact...,9,19 November 2013,"The Sixth sense is a psychological horror film starring Bruce Willis and Haley Joel Osment in the lead. It is a story about a married and successful award winning child psychologist who finds out that he failed one of his patients, he keeps thinking about this failure and tries to correct it and soon he meets another boy who suffers from the same problem as that failed patient and the doctor decides to help him to redeem himself. That is all I can say without spoiling the actual plot.In traditional terms, this is not a full fledged horror flick, there are several dramatic and emotional scenes in the movie, elements of the study of human behavior is also involved. It is more of a mix of drama and psychological horror. The horror scenes in the Sixth Sense rely on scary or dangerous looking ghosts and sound effects, now the sound effects do leave an impact but the creepy looking ghosts in films used to scare me when I was a kid, now that I am grown up this doesn't work anymore. That doesn't mean that the great sound effects won't make you feel the chills and some scenes will startle you or shock you for a few moments. Specially if you are watching the film alone in a dark room.The music in this film is brilliant, I already mentioned the sound effects but the music used for emotional scenes in the movie really helps build up the mood and suits the scenes perfectly. The acting is absolutely fantastic, Bruce Willis who is best known for action roles in films like the Die Hard Series, performs the role of Dr. Milcolm very well, it is not only shocking to see him fit so well in a role like this but act so well. Haley Joel Osment does a fantastic job, his facial expressions and delivery just feel so natural, its amazing how he could act so well at such a young age. Toni Colette and Olivia Williams have limited roles but they do good with all the screen time they get.The movie is deep and leaves you thinking, but it moves at a very slow pace and it may lose the attention of the audience at least in the first half . I also can't help but feel that this film heavily relies on its twist at the end to leave a major lasting impact on the audience rather than leaving that impact as a whole. The twist is excellent and surprising & it definitely adds a whole lot to the plot and the premise of the film as whole. The problem is that The film will only leave a full impact when you watch it for the second time, knowing what the twist at the end will be, only then you will be able to enjoy the Sixth Sense to its fullest and properly comprehend it.Overall Rating: 8.5/10",The Sixth Sense

561,FreeMM,A great little film,8,7 November 1999,"I liked this film a lot.  It's a slow film, with simple dialogue, but a great premise.

562,BuddyBoy1961,"But for the supernatural element, tone is similar to ""Kramer vs Kramer""",9,12 July 2000,"Here is an unexpectedly poignant and utterly unpretentious ghost story. Bruce Willis is understated but effective as a child psychologist who is compelled to redeem a past failure by counseling a troubled 8-year-old boy who eventually professes to being able to ""see dead people"". Never gimmicky or over-the-top, ""The Sixth Sense"" presents us with three very real people: Willis, the boy (Osment) and his mother (Collette), each trying to cope with a unique personal trauma. Not unlike ""The Exorcist"", the film draws us into the characters' dilemmas by devoting much of its first half to letting us empathize with the leads and share in their lives, then compelling us to experience their mounting turmoil. But unlike so many horror films of the past 20 years, ""The Sixth Sense"" unexpectedly eschews cheap shocks and gore for simple, potent drama and the painful revelations that accompany life and death. The three leads are uniformly excellent, but it is Willis who surprises; never in his career has Willis relied so predominantly on the subtlest of facial expressions to convey his emotional state, and here he accomplishes this vital feat admirably.",The Sixth Sense
563,magic_marker,"Captured the essence of the ""altered place""",9,23 August 2002,"There are certain places in this world (you know the ones I mean, for you have all seen them), that though they might appear perfectly normal in every way, are somehow... different. They may be a street near your house, or a disused park behind your office. They may only take on this difference at a certain time of day, or perhaps only you see it. But that difference, that altered state, manifests itself in, to use Cole's phrase, the prickly things on the back of your neck. These are the kinds of places in which you feel compelled to whisper, even when outdoors, and that make you feel you are not alone, even when you are. Somewhere, inside these places, you feel, other worlds must exist.For me, the greatest achievement of ""The Sixth Sense"" was not its well-constructed plot or its twist ending; both of these lose their punch on repeat viewings, but rather its masterful evocation of that sense of otherness, as if it had managed to turn the entire city of Philadelphia into an ""altered place."" In the main the man responsible for this is Tak Fujimoto, Shyamalan's cinamatographer, who shot ""The Silence of the Lambs."" His shots are both hyperrealistic and dark, mixing shade with sudden bursts of colour, creating a feeling of a world decidedly different from our own. Credit must also go to James Newton Howard, whose elegant, beautiful and creepy score was kept almost subliminal, leaving over its notes a wall of silence that ways down on the heart. ""The Sixth Sense"" is of course, Shyamalan's film, but it was those two who made it immortal.",The Sixth Sense
564,Fire God,Not Great,6,16 November 1999,"The whole movie is centered around the ""surprise ending"". From what I've seen and heard, when one is surprised by the ending, and think that it's brilliant, one generally loves the film. But if you know the ending of Sixth Sense, this movie seems to drag on, and I was pretty bored most of the time. I just wasn't very interested in the surprise, and didn't find that there was much more to this film. Good performances by Willis, Osment and others, and a few intense moments that were well directed, help to keep Sixth Sense from being as bad as it could have been. After seeing the ads, I though Osment would be real irritating, but he surprised me, and I think he will probably give us good to great performances for a long time to come. Sixth Sense is rated as one of the best movies of all time on the Internet Movie Database. I happen to believe that the public should be able to judge movies better than that.

565,Twillhead,Bruce Willis' BEST Acting Endeavor on Film . . .,8,19 September 1999,". . . and Haley Joel Osment is a wonder. If both of these actors are not nominated for Academy Awards (and BOTH in the Best Actor category) then Hollywood is indeed a screwed up town. Willis' portrayal as the tormented child psychologist Malcolm Crowe is sensitive and compassionate, a beautifully realized, complete performance. And Osment's performance as the disturbed child Cole who has ""the sixth sense"" is astonishing--in my opinion, it's the best performance by a child actor in film since Patty Duke in ""The Miracle Worker"". The wonderful relationship that evolves between Malcolm and Cole is worth the price of admission alone. Also kudos to Toni Collette as Cole's ever-loving, always supportive Mom; to Olivia Williams as Malcolm's wife (in hindsight, one realizes that Williams pulls off an incredibly difficult technical piece of acting), and Donnie Wahlberg as Vincent, the anguished, tortured young man whom Malcolm could not save. I've seen the film twice now--blown away by it the first time, enjoying how well-crafted it is on the second round. The evil-spirited side of me was also looking for some hole, SOMEWHERE, in the film when I saw it again, but if a hole exists, I can't find it. Brilliant, disturbing, evoking laughter, tears, chills, and a great deal of thought, this is great film making.",The Sixth Sense
566,Stroheim-3,The Boy Who Should've Been Anakin,8,8 August 1999,"I went into the Sixth Sense without any expectations; after all, I wasn't paying.  Well let me tell you, I thought it was great!  I liked the visual moodiness of the film; it was almost expressionistic without the noir qualities.  It was very eerie.  I didn't even feel it was supposed to be scary except for the occasional cheap scare of someone jumping out of nowhere or the music suddenly appearing with enormous intensity.  It was just that that world was somehow different than ours - visually.I thought the acting was terrific.  Bruce Willis has never been better.  For a while, I even stopped thinking that he was John McClane.  He was simply a child psychologist trying to help a troubled kid.  The kid, by the way, was fantastic.  He is possibly the best child actor/actress since Tatum O'Neil was in Paper Moon.  This kid should have been Anakin in the Phantom Menace instead of Jake ""Can't Act His Way Out Of A Paper Bag"" Lloyd; but I don't want to get into that.  This kid ran the gamut of emotions - fear, isolation, happiness, sadness, and confusion.  He is a better actor than most adults in the SAG.I was also a fan of the ending.  That truly made the movie for me.  The writer must have gone to the Cabinet of Dr. Caligari school of screenwriting.  It was (POTENTIAL SPOILER) a brilliant plot twist - the best since The Usual Suspects.When it comes down to it, the movie really knew what to do with emotions. The audience can really feel for the mother.  She loved her son, but she didn't know what was going on with him.  She didn't know what she could do for him; I'm sure a lot of parents have felt that way.  Scratch that - I'm sure a lot of people have felt that way.  Not only can we feel for the mother, but I felt bad for the kid.  Quite frankly, his gift sucks; you can really feel for him.  Every major character in the film can evoke the pity of the viewer from Bruce Willis to the father of the dead girl.  Bottom line: Terrific writing - someone knows what their doing in Hollywood.

Once again Willis finds another little boy with the same illness as the other person.

568,shevaunhodge,Very clever film,10,4 July 2018,"This film is very different and gives you a spooky ,but unusual feeling all the way through.. The film grips you the whole way through because the story is so interesting, i mean who wouldn't want to know what it would be like to see the dead? 
 The acting is superb especially by Haley Joal Osment who plays Cole Sear. Such amazing acting from someone so young. Fantastic acting, as predicted from Bruce Willis, who plays doctor Malcolm Crowe, and also from Toni collette Lynn sear. 
The story grips you and as the story unfolds, it surprises you quite few times with a lot of moments that leave in in shock. 
The most shocking part of the film is the ending and I don't know anyone that saw it coming. It is defiantly a massive twist that know one would ever guess. There are clues of in the film leading up to the twist, but they are not something most people would spot. The clues are shown in the film, and it is a moment when you say to yourself ""oh I get it now"". 
This film is still enjoyable even if you know the ending so i would watch it anyway, but obviously it is more of a shock if you do not know.",The Sixth Sense
569,Robert-132,A welcome breath of fresh air...,8,7 August 1999,"For a change, this is a ghost story that does not rely on over-drawn special effects or excessive gore.  What remains is a well-crafted script attached to a remarkable film.  This movie is genuinely frightening, in ways that I haven't seen in years.The plot is quite simple on the surface.  Bruce Willis plays a troubled psychologist who has difficulty communicating with his wife.  He takes on the case of a child who is frightened by something mysterious and who also resembles a case that went horribly wrong, resulting in a break-in and a shooting.When the little boy tells Willis that he can see dead people, the movie becomes remarkably chilling.  It is a sort of thrill ride without a hack-and-slash plot, leading up to a surprise climax that is worthy of written speculative fiction.  All of the leads perform marvellously, and are truly convincing.Perhaps the only flaw is that once the surprise twist has become known, several fairly large plot holes arise as one thinks back on the film. However, this is a remarkable enough film that they do not detract horribly from the experience.Definitely worth seeing, and worth the money for admission. 4/5.",The Sixth Sense

571,RueMorgue,"Amazing film, with a truly amazing ending.",9,8 May 2001,"To be honest, given some of the work that Bruce Willis has done in the past, I wasn't at all interested in seeing this film after watching the various trailers.  In fact, I wasn't even one of the people in line at the video store the first Tuesday it was available.  Even more surprising, I didn't see this movie until it was available on video for almost two months!  It wasn't until many friends told me I absolutely had to see it that I caved in and rented it.  Seeing this film again just last week brought back a lot of memories with the second viewing, and I felt that I should add my two cents (six cents?) into the mix here.This film has one of the best story lines of any film released in 1999. Perhaps the best thing about it is that it isn't a movie that keeps you on the edge of your seat the whole time.  It maintains a series of highs and lows, and then works up into a crescendo for the surprise ending.  You will think you have it figured out up until the last 15 minutes or so, and then what you expected to happen doesn't, and the experience becomes something else entirely.  I thought I had this film pegged... many of my friends had told me to be ready for the surprise ending... and my mouth hit the floor when it became painfully obvious what this movie was all about.Having related what I thought about the story, I'll move on to the acting and more technical aspects of this film.  First off, let me say that Bruce Willis simply shines in this movie.  As the grounding force in this film, he does an excellent job, perhaps not seen since his work in Twelve Monkeys or Pulp Fiction, in my humble opinion.  Usually known for his work in action films, he reminds us here yet again that he can be just as good in more dramatic and complex roles.The award for ""stealing the show"" in this film must go to Haley Joel Osment, who had not done much of anything notable up until being cast in this film. I'm surprised that nobody else has used the talent this little guy has to its fullest potential.  This is probably the movie that will be known as the one that made his career.  Recently he turned down the opportunity to appear in the sequel to this film, and rightfully so.  I doubt if he could repeat the performance he turned out in this film, that's how excellent his acting was the first time around.  In all, I'm sure he made the correct decision, and has chosen to go on to bigger and better things, if that's possible.  At any rate, his facial expressions and simple innocence add credibility to the story in ways you cannot imagine.  He's unable to cope with the supernatural events in his life, until being helped through them by Willis, who plays his role as a child psychologist almost to the letter.Toni Collette is superb in her role as Cole's (Osment's) mother.  I had never seen Collette in anything before this, and I was very impressed.  It always amazes me how a director/casting agent can take a cast of (almost) unknowns and put them together in a film where they click and create a movie that leaves a lasting impression on the viewer.  In a role where she plays a woman who is nothing if not extremely pained by the problems her son deals with on a daily basis, problems which he refuses to talk to her about, she does a beautiful job.  She is a very beautiful lady, and I can't wait to see her in more dramatic roles.While not generally scary, there are some slightly gory scenes, and some which create a feeling of terror deep within the pit of your stomach.  Of course, the use of the musical score within the film adds to the tension.  I felt as though I was watching something I shouldn't be at some points in the film, and I'm sure you can relate, or will be able to when you finally see it.If you haven't seen this movie, go rent it.  Make sure you watch it on a Friday or Saturday night, and late.  This will give you enough time to digest the film over the rest of the weekend, before heading back into the week on Monday.  If possible, watch it Friday night and again on Saturday night, just to pick up on what you may have missed.  After watching it once, knowing the ending will help you make note of a lot more the second time around.Watch for director M. Night Shyamalan in a cameo role as Dr. Hill, who examines Cole after his experience at the birthday party.  I must admit, I didn't see him the first time around.My rating:  10/10.",The Sixth Sense

When you re-watch it though you catch why - because there's all kinds of little cheats etc that obviously make you think that ending is impossible, but they don't hold up when you already know what the ending is.

The second thing was that M. Night Shamlyan's has a great eye for setting up shots and knows exacly when to end a scene.  The third thing was that my heart was pounding and I could barely breathe.  There are some truly unsettling, suspenseful scenes here, all centering around an amazing performance by the movie's 11-year-old star.  The movie works on so many levels -- and the last five minutes make it effectively two movies, the one that you've been watching and the one that you *weren't* watching, that slipped by under radar.  Definitely one to see twice.Not just freaky, not just suspenseful, but beautifully crafted and graced with standout performances from Osment and Willis.  The summer's only other successful horror movie, The Blair Witch Project, worked because it took place in a recognizable reality.  In essence, 6th Sense makes its own reality and gently, subtly drags the viewer into it.  There are revelations that hit with near-physical force, and there are moments of sheer masterly filmmaking as well.  Definitely worth a full-price ticket.",The Sixth Sense

The director did not pull any punches, the second time through the movie, I was flabbergasted that I had made assumptions the first time through and therefor made the same mistake as the doctor. Haley Joel Osment is fantastic and very convincing in this movie. Bruce Willis does an outstanding job also, but the show is stolen by Haley. The movie gives rise to a sequel or a fall season series.

Also notable were the use of color and temperature for thematic purposes.  Haley Joel Osment delivered an excellent breakthrough performance and was nominated for an Oscar.

This film visits the concept of spirits and the sighting and communication with spirits.  It was done in a tasteful way, and really couldn't offend anyone.

It's about ghosts and possesses a number of shocks that will levitate you from your seat but it's not a horror movie. This is a drama about a kid who can see the dead and the psychologist that tries to help him.The film opens with Bruce Willis and his wife (Olivia Williams) celebrating his achievement of winning an award for outstanding work as a child psychologist. The night is interrupted by a former patient who Willis failed to help. He attacks Willis before killing himself.A year on and Willis has a new patient named Cole played by the outstanding Haley Joel Osment. Willis sees in Osment a chance to make amends for the patient who he let down a number of years ago. From here on there are two plots both revolving about a family. The most interesting of which is that of Osment's. He keeps many secrets and refuses to tell his mother. He confides in Willis; he has got an ability to see the living dead. This ability has to be the most frightening that a child would ever have to face. The other less interesting plot concerns Willis and his wife who seem to be be growing apart.M. Night Shyamalan proves himself capable as both writer and director. He uses strange camera angles to suggest the eerie nature of Osment's dilemma. His writing is also adept; it is surely Oscar-nominated material. The opening 45 minutes are quitely effective before the film really grips you. The finale is successful in what it does.

I had heard from them about Sixth Sense and that this movie was made by a person of Indian ethnicity. I decided to watch the movie and see how it was. The movie was broad casted on a television channel, and I started watching it with my family. It is really joyful experience when you watch a movie with your family, the shrieks, the laughs etc make you more involved. And that day while watching the movie my family was all silent, they were thinking inside, they were so involved that their eyes were not blinking but were filled with all sorts of emotions. It was really like sitting in meditation.And at the end, when the twist is revealed, I was shocked to the core. I was at loss of words for few minutes and then I became very cheerful as I just saw the movie which I which so fulfilling. It was a journey into the world of brilliance. The boy acted so well that he deserved the Oscar. Bruce Willis was excellent. M.

The performances in the film were by far the best I've seen for Haley Joel Osment, truly remarkable, best child acting I've ever seen(No I will not take it back). Toni Collete was amazing as well as Bruce Willis. That car scene towards films end was so perfect and had the proper emotional tone for such an amazing scene.

The plot twist makes up, in my opinion, for the slow-paced and mediocre plot. Apart from that, you have to acknowledge Bruce Willis and and Haley's terrific performance.There are many subtle and obscure hints that, if attentive enough, one could deduce or eventually guess what is bound to happen.

593,danthemovieman,"Haley Joel Osment gives an excellent performance, and the movie scares the pants off you",10,21 February 2003,"Before I had seen ""The Sixth Sense"" all I heard was that it was about it was a kid who saw dead people. It is much more than that. It is a movie about a kid who sees dead people, but it is also a film that shows us how lonely children can be and how a divorce can effect a child's life. Haley Joel Osment plays Coal, a recent victim to his parents divorce. Coal is a very lonely child, as we see throughout the movie he has no friends and he always gets picked on. His mother (Toni Collette) is always trying to comfort him, and talk to him, but Coal does not want to be comforted.
The movie starts out with Malcolm Crowe (Bruce Willis) a child phychologist, who has recently won an award for his work in child phychology. He and his wife go up to their room after admiring the award only to find that their house has been broken in to. The person who has broken in is a depressed and miserable man who is a former patient of Crowe's. He states that he was a child of a divorced couple and that when he was a child, Malcolm was sent to help him. He is very upset with Malcolm because Malcolm did not help him at all. When Malcolm offers to help him, the patient (Donnie Wahlberg) picks up a gun on the toilet and shoots Malcolm. We then see the patient commit suicide and Malcolm's wife going over to the bed to help Malcolm.
The scene then switches over to Coal again. He is going to be the next patient of Malcolm. Coal and Malcolm get off to a very bad start. Coal clearly does not like Malcolm and does not want him to help him. Eventually Coal and Malcolm get to be friends and Coal says that he has a secret that he has not told anybody. He says he will tell Malcolm. His secret is: I see dead people. This unleashes a whole different problem for Malcolm. Before he was trying to help Coal with his parents divorce. Now he must find a way to make the dead people go away.This is a pure horror film. If you get scared very easily, this is not the right movie for you. It has occured to me that M. Night Shamayalan is the next Steven Spielberg. Along with this movie, Mr. Shamayalan also  made Signs (which is as good as this film), another horror flick that shows a stunning reality of what Earth could be like if it was being invaded by aliens. Shamayalan does an excellent job of directing ""Signs"". Shamayalan also does an excellent job with this film. His casting is right on target. Haley Joel Osment does a sensational job as Coal, and Bruce Willis, once again, gives a great performance as Malcolm Crowe. Shamaylan definetely knows how to scare and when to scare correctly, and he also knows how to direct correctly. The truth of ""The Sixth Sense"" will blow your mind.**** out of ****",The Sixth Sense
594,thepsychocritic,"Sight, smell, touch, sound, taste, ...",8,16 September 2011,"The rampant notion that horror means something that makes you pee your pants is grossly misinterpreted. Horror does not necessarily mean ghosts, possessions or exorcisms. Horror is a feeling that eats you from inside and conveys that something is extremely wrong. It doesn't need to make you jump in your seat. It is meant to last long after you are done with the movie; an unpleasant memento you carry with you. Horror exploits your worst fears. It frightens you of dark corners, unknown noises and invisible things behind your back. This is also what The Sixth Sense does.The movie begins on a rather happy note. Dr. Malcolm Crowe (Bruce Willis) is a content man. He is married to the woman he loves, is a reputed child psychologist and has won the Mayor's citation for professional excellence. The happiness doesn't last. An old patient shows up; a man the doctor had failed. He is scared, angry and troubled. Before the doctor can reason with him, the man shoots him and blows his own brains out. Next fall. The doctor is sitting on a bench, overlooking a child - his next patient. It is the second time he is handling such a case. Having failed the first time, he believes he will be forgiven for his past mistakes if he gets this one right. This is his chance at redemption.However, the kid, Cole Sear (Haley Joel Osment) steals the show. The movie is centered around him and his problem in life. Everyone has a predictable reaction, one of disbelief. His mother, the doctor, and other children - everyone is skeptical. At a tender age, with his frightening inconvenience (the trailers reveal what it is. I won't. It would be an injustice), Cole is cast alone into the horrifying world, especially so for him. Harry Osment plays this role sublimely. You can notice fear in his prepubescent feminine voice, in his movements and on his face. Osment gives one of the best child-performances I have seen. His acting is nonchalant, yet brilliant. He even outdoes Bruce Willis with his performance, something that is truly commendable.Bruce Willis looks pale in comparison to Osment. This isn't anything wrong with his acting, but it just appears feeble. He makes a good child psychologist and Cole's only companion, along with dealing his own troubled married life. But he does seem out of place at times in a non- action movie. Maybe we have grown just too accustomed to seeing him save the world as John McClane. The movie has been shot in dim light, which speaks of the gloom and melancholiness prevalent in the film. The foreboding atmosphere is one of the factors adding to the horrors of this film. The tension too has been built up really well. It grips you, engulfs you, before shocking you.Relationships have been portrayed in a beautiful manner. The mother-son relation between Cole and his mother is touching. She does her best to make Cole lead a normal life. Yet at times, she loses control, skeptical and tired of Cole's problem. Cole doesn't bother her with it. Without a father, he understands the situation they are in and the difficulties their two-member family is facing. He does not want to add to it.The relationship between Dr. Crowe and wife too plays an important role. Initially things are good, but as Dr. Crowe gets overwhelmed with his new case, they begin drifting apart, or so it seems. He tries bringing it back together but fails repeatedly. She does not talk to him, celebrates their anniversary alone and also seems to be seeing a new guy, with Dr. Crowe watching all this helplessly. Watch over this closely, for the end to be even more rewarding.However, easily the most effective relationship is that between Dr. Crowe and Cole; the former a middle-aged man, the latter just an innocent child. The contrast between them is clearly visible through a single dialogue exchange:Dr. Crowe: You are not a freak. Okay? Don't you believe anybody that tries to convince you of that. That's bullshit. You don't have to go through your life believing that. Okay? Cole: You said the 'S' word.Yet, he is Cole's only hope, the only person who even tries to understand him. Despite his troubled married life, he gives attention to Cole. And that is what is so wonderful about it. It can be best summed up in the words of Cole himself, when he says with tears in his blue eyes 'Don't fail me. Don't give up. You're the only one who can help me. I know it.'The build-up of the movie is thoroughly gripping. Though it appears to be proceeding rather slowly, it adds to the depth of the film, letting you ponder as it moves. The film seems rather hurriedly wrapped up towards the latter part. But the absolute end is sheer genius. The Sixth Sense has given birth to one of the most iconic endings ever in Hollywood. That is the cherry on the cake.",The Sixth Sense
595,Heresy,Why the hype?,5,22 May 2000,"This, to me, was nothing more than a average film with an odd ending. I had heard how great the movie was and after hearing it was nominated as best picture I figured it should be pretty good; I was disappointed. I watched the DVD (I, surprisingly, had not heard about the ending) and cannot understand the uproar and acclaim this movie has gotten. I found myself bored with the plot and the characters most of the way through and the ending, though somewhat surprising, didn't make up for an overall average film. I kept waiting for the plot to get interesting to justify all of the acclaim and it just never happened. Solid acting, average script and a surprising ending do not make a classic, this was definitely not one of the top 5 movies of '99 (how this was nominated and not Magnolia is beyond me) and certainly not in the top 20 of all time (as IMDB voting would suggest.)",The Sixth Sense

This might also be Bruce Willis best performance in his career... And of course, I can't finish this paragraph without mentioning Haley Joel Osment...

Yes sir, that final that made all of us drop our jaws and refuse to believe what we just saw.The great thing about this movie is that everything matches, because everything the kid said about the dead people are the same things that Bruce Willis does, like: He doesn't know he is dead, he sees what he wants to see (his wife...), he can't see the other dead people...

M Night Shymalan does a great job of preserving the depth and level of suspense, mystery intrigue and tension involved in the plot throughout the movie but also succeeds in giving this movie many heartwarming and beautiful moments. The script is flawless and the character development is second to none.All the actors and actresses perform their role to perfection. Hayley Joel Osment is a wonderful actor and gives his portrayal of Cole Sears a maturity in terms of depth and emotion that many actors years older than him would struggle to match. I am not usually a fan of Bruce Willis but his performance in this role is flawless and wonderfully done.

Young Haley Joel Osman is the carrying force of this film and succeeds  in receiving lots of empathy for his unhappy, fearful condition. Many scenes of this film are touching, and some scenes startling and slightly disturbing, but for the most part this film has been dumbed down to achieve maximum audience and profit. The good craftmanship of the film makers is being wasted in the director's lack of strength in his vision and edge. This is such a neat package of ""horror"" for cinematically uneducated and undemanding from a nice, compromising Spielberg school of directing. Bruce Willis is not playing a moronic action-hero, but an introverted academic in his typical boring way. Comparing this film to ""Exorcist"", ""Shining"" or ""Silence Of The Lambs"" would constitute a blasphemy towards great masters of film making like William Friedkin, Stanley Kubrick and Jonathan Demme.

613,Fiona G.,Illogic and constructed,2,9 July 2000,"Whew, with the hype that went around this movie, you got the feeling that you miss out on elemental cinematic history if you don't see it. Unfortunately, that's not true. ""The Sixth Sense"" tries hard to be a good psycho-thriller and in fact the idea behind it was good. But as the script was written, someone must have had the idea to put the real big bang in there, something no viewer can guess to happen, the totally total of all story twists there ever were. But, bad luck, the grand idea has to fit into the rest of the script, so you have to modify it and make compromises. And really, I was disappointed with the end. Not because of it, but because everything else was set up for it. I didn't guess the twist because it was so sneaky, but because it was completely implausible. To clarify that I will try hard not to give anything away, in case you didn't see ""Sixth Sense"" yet, so I will ask only one question, which you'll understand later: how do you get into someones apartment without ringing the doorbell or knocking? There are numerous more points like that but by stating them I would give away the surprise. It's too bad the whole film had to suffer just to get that in.And then there are horror scenes, not too many, but I guess the writers figured that the movie had to give some more than the general idea and the last big bang. And again, they just serve the purpose and are badly integrated: young Cole, they boy who can see ghosts, later finds out that they want him to help them. I think even a ghost can anticipate that scaring someone to death isn't a good start for getting help.Probably the best asset of the movie is Haley Joel Osment, who played ""Cole."" Marvelous what this young boy could do with his role. Bruce Willis stays a little unbelievable as a psychologist, but that could be the script as well. So far I yet have to encounter a psychologist who handles therapy that way. Well, nice idea, nice movie, but nothing overly sensational. Horror movies greatly benefit from taking part in our world and incorporating the horror into it. But then they have to stay true to rules we all are familiar with and to those they need to set up to make us bite our nails. If ""Sixth Sense"" would have mastered both, I'd be yelling ""great one!""",The Sixth Sense
614,Mulder-51,"True terror, a real horror film...",9,20 December 1999,"The sixth sense is not a movie that will try to scare you by means of visual or sound effects like in Haunting. It is a thriller masterfully directed and written by the unknown M. Night Shyamalan. And I assure you that this is not the only worthwhile feature of the film. Although all the actors, apart from Bruce Willis, are unknown they perform tremendously. In particular, Haley Joel Osment's performance as the endued with the sixth sense little boy is excellent!One future of the film that I will never forget is the unbelievably amazing end.

You care about what happens to Cole Sear, so hauntingly played by Haley Joel Osment, and you want to see Dr. Malcolm Crowe(Bruce Willis, in arguably his best performance) help him. You believe every second of Toni Collette's brilliant performance as Cole's mother, a woman pushed to her limits of worry and grief.

The Sixth Sense transcends its genre, as do most classics, and I do think that this one is going to a classic.

618,Megamovies,A perspective 19 years later,7,20 November 2018,"I'm nearly 40 yrs old and just watched The Sixth Sense for the first time. Please read my review from this context.I have long known about the film's unforgettable ending. That is the legend of this movie. Naturally, I watched it and focused on the character interactions with Bruce Willis' character to see if I could find holes in the behaviors or scenes.The anniversary dinner scene: I watched closely to see if his wife did anything that would be unnatural. Most of this scene checks out but there was a moment she looked up and straight across the table as if acknowledging Bruce was talking. She quickly looked back down. Nitpicking but hey, it's a review.The scene in the boy's house: this is kind of a giveaway that Bruce is a ghost. How in the world would the mother not introduce a first time guest to her son?Another thought I had is this: in what world does a child psychiatrist meet a boy that needs help but the two never meet in his office? Bruce is just waking around and meeting him from place to place?The acting in the film is average. Bruce Willis did fine but nothing spectacular. He was born to be John McClane in Die Hard, not so much Malcom in Sixth Sense. Haley Joel got a lot of praise at the time of the movie release as I recall. I'm sure he deserved it, but I have a hard time getting past his squeaky voice. It's an ear frequency thing.I enjoyed the film despite knowing its memorable ending beforehand. It started with appreciating the connection he and his wife had in the beginning. Then, Donnie Wahlburg gave a TREMENDOUS performance in his brief cameo. I was hooked from the start. While the movie may have slowed down a bit while we were introduced to characters and the relationship between Bruce and Haley developed, it picked up again as we were exposed to Haley's sixth sense. I though the tension in the ghost scenes were done very well, and like other reviewers have said, without the need to be gory or bloody.When we finally get to the plot twist at the end I was satisfied. I think I just appreciate a situation where a loving husband (ghost husband) looks over his sleeping wife and tells her to move on. It's okay. I thought it was a nice touch to a very good movie.",The Sixth Sense

I seen this movie along with ""American Beauty"" and I cant stop thinking about both movies, I believe I was lucky enough to see the two best movies of 1999 in one night. Bruce Willis was robed of a best actor nomination. It is truly a great movie.

621,mjg32,"chilling, sad and uplifting all in one",8,16 March 2007,"The Sixth Sense was deservedly a surprising Hollywood sensation. It is of course remembered for its amazing and shocking ending. I can tell you though, there is much more to this film than just the ending.People who say The Sixth Sense is rubbish because the ending is obvious and they figured it out are just being stupid and they don't know what they are talking about. I have watched films before knowing the ending, and have still enjoyed them as much as anyone. The ending is there for you to see throughout the film, but it is still hard to figure out - a bit like the twist in Fight Club. Even without the great ending though, this film would still be excellent. Bruce Willis has proved once again that he has many more strings to his bow than just action hero John McClane that made him famous, as he puts in a wonderful performance as a doctor haunted by his past. The script and direction by M. Night Shyamalan is also very good. Despite these two great performances though, the stand out has to be Haley Joel Osment as the disturbed young boy. He is really freaky, and he really captures how scared his character would probably be in real life.The huge twist ending does divert attention from the rest of the film, but the rest of the film should not be forgotten. If you haven't watched this yet, you will not just be sat there waiting for the ending, the whole storyline is a compelling and disturbing drama. It is a film to watch more than once, as the ending does fit in perfectly with the storyline before it. The ending of Unbreakable is about as shocking, but I don't think Shyamalan will ever make another film as good as this.",The Sixth Sense
622,Squirelly Joe,My Favorite Ghost Movie,10,27 March 2002,"Ok a word of advice to all of you. THIS IS NOT A HORROR MOVIE. There is no guts or graphic scenes of people being killed, never mind mutants and deformations of the sort. It is classified as a ""SUSPENSE"" movie, which in my  dictionary means something that is not LIKELY to happen but could and is meant to have some scary moments now and then, but keeps you on your seat and may give you nightmares. But, it is my favorite ghost movie because they took time on it and you could piece together everything that leads to the shocking end. (Maybe not shocking to some, but it sure surprised me). But anyway, it's a great movie with great acting and story telling.

There aren't too many jump out of your seat scary moments but the overall tone of this movie was dark and kinda creepy. Bruce Willis is a psychologist that works with children. The opening scene is intense when a former patient has broken into his house and i thought it was a great way to start. Haley Joel Osment is a big reason why this movie is so good. He plays a kid, Cole, who has issues (the main one being he can see dead people). His friends, or classmates rather, call him a freak. Cole has never told anyone he can see dead people. The first person he tells is his new psychologist who he believes can help him.9/10 Even if you aren't a big Bruce Willis fan, this is a really interesting movie that never slows down. Although the twist ending was very well done by Shyamalan the tone, atmosphere, casting, and acting in this movie is what really makes this a classic.",The Sixth Sense
624,nadeeshantennage,Kinda made me feel like maybe 'the others (2001)' adapted this concept of Shyamalan's mastery.,9,2 July 2018,"If you are ready and up for a supernatural horror film which would keep you at the edge of your seat all the way through the running time with boosted and unnecessarily frequent jump scares, 'The sixth sense' wouldn't serve you right.
But instead if you are looking for an intelligent adaptation of supernatural elements about the 'dead' this is a must watch for you.
The film comes to life majorly because of the incredible performance by Joel Osment as Cole sear whose fear seasoned with anguish is deeply reflected through his eyes almost everytime he's on the screen which lets us understand his psychological fear in a more personal sense.
Bruce Willis who plays Malcolm Crowe gets an incredible standing out kinda twist in the climax of his character's arch which is the turning point and the big exposing scenario of the supernatural concept which is adapted in the film.
Even in her small role as Cole's mother Toni Collette shines with a emotionally boosted performance which inflicts the pain of a conflicted and stressed out single mother to the viewers.
The film which maintains its grip by keeping viewers invested with a good momentum of a few scares and thrilling sequences climaxes with an unforgettable and an unpredictable climax which would remind many of the horror genre lovers of the 'the Others (2001)' climax.

First I must give kudos to the director. I have not seen anything he'd directed, or written prior to this, but he's proven with one movie that he's great in both fields. The direction of the film is marvelous. He creates an air to the film, it creeps you out, and may even scare you. He does this without millions of dollars in special effects, he simply does it with make-up, a great script, and great direction. The script isn't great just because it can creep you out however, nor is it the marvelous ending, instead it's the fact that the script plays the viewer like a piano. The writer/director makes us make these simple assumptions. Little things. Things so common that they don't need to be said, and then he has us slapping our forehead for making the assumption later. It's an excellent example that nothing is what it seems, and we should never assume. Truly excellent.",The Sixth Sense

629,giuliano-3,NOT one of the best 30 of all time *SPOILERS*,6,8 November 2000,"As of the time I am writing this the average rating for Sixth Sense puts it at #28 on the database. I believe anyone who gave this any higher rating than 7 must have only seen it once. This film cheats you into believing something, and at the end you are left with a revelation of sorts that keeps you thinking for hours after you've seen it. I wondered to myself for hours exactly how I had been fooled into thinking Bruce Willis' character, Dr. Crowe was really alive throughout the film. The next day I decided to see it again, and this time I realized how so many people had been fooled into this ""revelation."" There are a couple scenes that deliberatley set the tone for Dr. Crowe's daily life in between meeting w/the kid. When he is ""late"" for his anniversary dinner with his wife, we see Dr. Crowe make eye contact with her, she appears to look up at him angrily, sigh loudly and then walk out of the restaurant. In another scene when Dr. Crowe comes over to the kid's house, his mother appears to be knowingly setting up a meeting between the two. She says something to the nature of ""it's only a 30 minute session."" My point is that although this was a beautifully crafted film, just about anything involving Tak Fujimoto will be, there is a major flaw in the deliberate attempt to misguide the audience. If you have only seen this film once, watch it again for this reason, just try to pick out the times Dr. Crowe is made out to be a normal functioning person. The big ""suprise"" end will be coming from a mile away the second time. Most great films get better with continued viewing, but this one just gets stale. Overall I give it a 7.5/10.",The Sixth Sense
630,Spider-52,"Creepy, entertaining, but takes too much credit.",7,18 August 1999,"*Warning:  My comments may contain spoilers for those who haven't seen ""The Sixth Sense"" yet.If there has ever been a movie more derivative of another movie (re-makes aside) than ""The Sixth Sense"" is of ""Jacob's Ladder"" I don't know what it is.  I figured out the ""surprise"" ending approximately five minutes into the movie, as will anyone who has seen Adrian Lyne's film.  Once you know what is coming, the ending seems somewhat hastily tacked on.  This is not to say that the film is without entertainment; quite the contrary, actually.By far the best thing about the film is Haley Joel Osment.  This kid is an excellent actor, and I hope he continues to find work for himself.  He seems to be very natural, and when I got into the movie, I didn't notice that he was acting at all.I also loved the atmosphere of ""The Sixth Sense"".  It has some genuinely creepy moments with a few good jumps thrown in for good measure.  Every shot seems dark and brooding, perfectly matching the film's content.I have one major gripe, however.  Maybe I'm strange, but I find it difficult to swallow when a brilliant but unsuccessful and virtually unknown film has its formula copied and ""Hollywoodized"" into a new movie that is enormously successful, but not even close to being as good. ""The Matrix"" did it to the incredible sci-fi noir ""Dark City"", and now ""The Sixth Sense"" is doing it to the vastly superior ""Jacob's Ladder"", and to an even greater extent.  If you want to watch a horror film--and you simply *must* see a movie in the theatre--I would recommend ""The Sixth Sense"", as it is fine entertainment. Otherwise, head down to your local video store and rent the psychological horror masterpiece that is ""Jacob's Ladder"".",The Sixth Sense
631,Andrew-162,As Creative As Horrors Come,9,29 May 2000,"This movie was genuinely scary, unnerving, and disturbing. Yet the scariness of the movie certainly does not come out of mindless gore or unrealistic monsters. It comes out of sheer, basic, suspense, the likes of which I may have never seen since Psycho, more than Silence of the Lambs and Seven.Malcolm Crowe (Bruce Willis) is a nice man,a devoted husband and psychiatrist. So good is he at his work, he receives a plaque from the mayor commending him. However, his joy that night is brief, as his celebration with his wife is cut short by an unexpected blast from the past--a patient of Malcolm's that he couldn't help (Donnie Wahlberg in a short but memorable cameo). He tells Malcolm that he didn't help him, and he has still been miserable for the last 10 years because no one could pinpoint why he was so upset. He then pulls out a gun, shoots Malcolm in the gut, then blows his own brains out. Flash forward to 2 months later: Malcolm is standing near the house of young Cole Sear (Haley Joel Osment) and his mother (Toni Colette). Cole has become a patient of his, and after reviewing Cole's case, Malcolm realizes that he and the man who shot him have a lot in common, and Malcolm sort of sees this as his shot at redemption for failing his other patient. The two meet and strike an instant rapport. But Cole is depressed, and always seems to look sad. His single mother is constantly stressed, trying to juggle two jobs and be a mother and father to Cole. She can not reach Cole herself, cannot understand why he is always so frightened. Eventually after Malcolm earns the trust of Cole, Cole tells him his secret: ""I See Dead People."" Cole explains to Malcolm that he constantly sees dead people walking around, not knowing that they are dead, and not seeing each other. Only Cole can see these people. At first Malcolm tries not to believe Cole, but after listening to a tape of one of his sessions with the man who shot him, he realizes Cole is telling the truth. The two have their individual problems, though. Malcolm and his wife haven't talked in months, they are now completely estranged from one another, and she seems to have found a new beau. Cole's mother wonders why her grandmothers pendant keeps getting moved, and gets furious when Cole denies taking it. The story goes on like this, telling about how Malcolm and Cole try to help each other This intelligent film is about 3 completely heart-wrenching relationships. Malcolm's relationship with his wife, Cole's relationship with his mother, and Malcolm and Cole's relationship with each other. All three are introduced to the story at the beginning, and at the end, all three are neatly and beautifully concluded. Possibly the most moving scene of the movie is when Cole comes home from school. He asks his mom how her difficult day was. She says: ""Well, I won the lottery this morning, I quit all my jobs, I picnicked in the park, and then swam in the fountain all afternoon."" She then asks Cole how his day went at his school (where everyone views him as a freak and an outcast). He answers: ""Well, I was picked first for dodgeball, I hit a game-winning grand slam, and everyone carried me off on their shoulders."" It shows how the only escape from their two difficult, miserable lives, is each other. The two most memorable things about this movie are Haley Joel Osment, who is nothing short of a revelation as Cole and who unjustly lost the academy award for Best Supporting Actor to the simple acting of Michael Caine for The Cider House Rules, and the ending, which clearly borrows a little something from The Usual Suspects. The rest of the cast is uniformly good, especially Toni Colette as Cole's mother. Bruce Willis does an admirable job as Malcolm, a very different character than he has played in his traditional movies. The writing and direction is some of the best you will ever see. M. Night Shyamalan has loaded the Sixth Sense with symbolism, foreshadowing, and clues to the big finish. He had the bad luck as coming out the same year as American Beauty, which was only a little better written , but much better directed. The Sixth Sense was nominated for 6 oscars: Best Picture, Supporting Actor Haley Joel Osment, Supporting Actress Toni Colette, Director Shyamalan, Writer Shyamalan, and Editing.

Night Shyamalan's The Sixth Sense is mediocre at best.Revealing the twist to me under fifty minutes, Crowe (Bruce Willis) being dead throughout the movie without knowing it was alluded to many times. For one, despite encountering many, no one responded to him or even recognized his existence.Additionally, I found that the twist features some plot holes.

I heard that this is an amazing movie and maybe my expectations were a bit high cause I didn't enjoy it.It's about a boy who sees terrible visions and a child psychologist who is trying to help him. I didn't like the story. I know Shyamalan tends to have twists in his movies, but the twist in this one didn't impress me. Maybe I spoiled the viewing experience for myself since I knew to look for the twist. Maybe I should have seen this movie when it came out to enjoy it more. Much of this comes down to my personal preference. And to be honest I don't like Shyamalan's directional style. The long takes were not that good. I didn't like his framing either.The movie was okay on the acting front. I liked Haley Joel Osment's performance. Bruce Willis and the rest of the cast were okay. M. Night Shyamalan made a brief appearance, which didn't really make me hold my breath.The good thing about the movie is it's overall creepiness and sense of fear. There were couple of jump scares that made me cringe. Having too much jump scares isn't necessarily a good thing, but the movie doesn't rely on them. Sometimes this movie reminded me about Shining with the hallucinations and everything. And no surprise here: I thought Kubrick did it much better.Some things don't appeal to everyone and this movie is an example. I just couldn't make myself to like it.",The Sixth Sense

The only negative thing I can say about it is that about 3/4 of the way through it I was wondering to myself why people liked it so much. It just seemed to bog down a little. Then the ending came. It just blew me away. I now can't wait to see it again to view it in the new perspective. I truly believe that it needs to be watched at least twice. Check out this marvelous movie.

This role was difficult and also, he's a kid.  Kids aren't supposed to deliver this kind of an electrifying performance.  And even if you don't want your spine to tingle with chills, and even if you don't want to see Bruce Willis in one of his best roles ever, and even if you don't want to see it because this kind of movie doesn't turn your button, I highly recommend just going to see it for Haley Osement.  I promise you'll be glad you did.The movie itself is a wonderful journey into the supernatural, brilliantly acted, with a great story and plot twists that will make you think about it for a long time after.

Trust me, ""the twist"" is an honest to God ""twist and 1/2!""Honestly, I was reluctant to see this movie at first because I was beginning to think that maybe the reason why mainstream audiences liked this film so much is because so many movies in 1999 were either sub-par or extremely over rated. I was already duped once this year by ""The Blair Witch Project"" but a close friend of my mine reassured me that The Sixth Sense had ""one of the best endings in movie history."" Thinking that his statement was a pretty bold one, I decided to check it out for myself. VERDICT: The Sixth Sense is thus far, the best film of the 1999.When the twist came at the end, I haven't heard so many ""Oh's &  Ah's"" and even crying in a theatre in recent memory. As the credits were rolling, I was still sitting in my seat in a daze. Even an hour later, I was still pondering about it.I'm admittedly very good at guessing ""the twist"" to movies because I've seen a lot of them and I'm a student of film. However, with The Sixth Sense, I just missed guessing ""the twist"" only by a hair. You see, I had a hunch that it was like the ending of a Twilight Zone episode called <POSSIBLE SPOILER>""The Hitch-Hiker"", however, I guessed the wrong character.<END POSSIBLE SPOILER>.I could blab on like everybody else about how good the actors were in this film, but I'll spare you, because the real genius  is M. Night Shyamala (Writer, Director and played the doctor in the film). He deserves and Oscar for writing and directing one of the best screen plays in recent memory.

This movie is truly amazing, from start to finish. First off, the acting is great. Bruce Willis killed it, as someone who was a traditional action movie actor, who thought he could pull off such a dramatic role like this. And Haley Joel-Osmont, probably the best child performance of all- time. This movie is creepy, dark, depressing, and by the end peaceful and comforting. It truly hits so many emotions. The ending with was superb, maybe the greatest twist ending of all-time. It had context, it added to the story. So many twist endings just reveal something we assumed was true, but serves no difference to the plot of the movie. This ending simply makes sense, and after the reveal you feel almost idiotic for not noticing it (which shows how great the production was). You wonder why Malcolm's wife is so rude, why he is so obsessed with this case, and ""what is Cole talking about when he says they 'walk around like regular people, they don't know they're dead'."" Then WHAM! just like that, ""OMG Malcolm was a ghost the whole time"". Cole explains how they only see what they want to see, how they are here to finish business (Malcolm not saving Vincent), his wife is so rude because she doesn't even know he is there. Maybe you could argue, that if they only see what they want, why didn't he see his wedding ring on his finger....OK maybe their are some plot holes.

Nothing much seemed to happen at all.After being shot by a former patient, child psychologist Bruce Willis decides to help a child who shows the same symptoms that this patient did. At the loss of his family life, he throws himself into helping this boy who can see dead people. That's the basic premise.

Bruce: ""I don't know...""Give me a break! Come up with something original! The idea of seeing dead people is pretty interesting, and they could've done something cool with it, but instead you get 100 minutes of boring film stock and tired cliches for dialogue and plot movement.

It did, however, make me angry for not hating the film, and left me wishing that I had left in the middle of the movie so I could have been left with a feeling of utter disappointment.In a summer of movies like American Pie, Blair Witch Project, South Park, Eyes Wide Shut, and Austin Powers 2, maybe I just had too high of expectations.

Don't miss this movie. You'll regret it, I promise.",The Sixth Sense

I don't think I have ever seen Bruce Willis better and young Haley Joel Osment has an incredible future ahead, if he keeps this up. He already had Forrest Gump on his record, in which he was very good as the young Forrest.On to the movie itself: It scared the living hell out of me! I have lately been complaining that there has not been enough really good mystery/supernatural/horror movies lately. This one came along at just the right time. The suspense that is built up is phenomenal. It's all the little things that do it. Just little details -- that are hard to define. And the interplay between the characters is great. I actually lost track of time, and the fact that I was ""just"" watching a movie... I am going to see this one at least twice more.",The Sixth Sense

The big surprise ending I was expecting turned out to be no surprise at all.  Those people who rated this movie a ten should watch some other films so they can learn to rate more objectively.

654,Michiel Waaijer,Prepare yourself...,10,22 January 2000,"This movie is amazing .. Harry joel osmont gives away such a blistering performance. Without this performance it wouldn't be so great, really.
This movie is one that can be watched in 2 ways. One way is the greatest way; Without knowing the end. The other way is knowing the end. A bit like 'The usual suspects' If you see it the first time, you will be left numb after seeing the ending. It's so mindblowing. I know i can't tell you about this, so you would have to see it for yourself.. It's one of those movies you just have to see.I realise this is going to be the year of 'American Beauty' or 'The Insider'. But for me The Sixth Sense beats those movies in a blink of an eye. Just as in my opinion 'The Matrix' or 'The Blair witch project' would.
Anyway, The sixth sense is also the movie of Bruce Willis. We see here that the man can really act !! (unlike some other action hero's) He contributes to the whole atmosphere of the movie, which is awesome. And scary as hell. For me the ending of the movie (i can't stop about it) has one of the most memorable scenes in the history of movies, that's all i can say. I hope i made you just a little bit curious in what is one of the best movies of the year, one that should get the oscar for best supporting actor (Harry Joel Osmont), and one that should get a whole lot more credit that it is receiving.be prepared to be blown away...",The Sixth Sense
655,moonlightreflections,Simply put: A masterpiece.,10,2 June 2000,"I'd originally held out on viewing this film for as long as possible in order to savor the experience known as ""The Sixth Sense"" in the company of solitude.  Yet thanks to the asininity of a couple of prepubescent girls who decided it would be entertaining to spoil the film at the expense of an entire classroom of high school students, I became reluctant to attend the theater and rent the movie for a number of months.When I finally obtained a copy of the movie and inserted it into the VCR, rancor towards the aforementioned individuals returned in the blink of an eye.  Upon reading in the opening credits that James Newton Howard had composed the soundtrack, however, I allowed myself to become immersed in the film, and from then on was not once subjected to straying thoughts.In the case of ""The Sixth Sense,"" the director had a vision--and this vision came through in such an efficient manner that the final creation was not a movie, but rather, an experience: an experience which comes together on every conceivable level, from the acting to the musical score, that leads the viewer through a first-hand perspective of what each character is seeing and experiencing on an emotional level, with the revelations that force their way onto the air evoking the same reaction from the viewer as the fictional characters on the screen.It does not serve much of a purpose to elaborate on any specific aspect of this film;  as it stands, everything is as close to perfection as it can possibly be in a movie.  Perhaps the only flaw is that for first-time viewers, emotional or detached, analytical dispositions will grant an entirely different perspective on the movie and its merits as far as suspense is concerned.  But since profound cynicism is required to blatantly disregard the merits of this film, there should be something to appeal to each and every viewer.",The Sixth Sense
656,vincent.vega-2,If everyone says it's good it has to be bad. Right?...Wrong!,10,17 June 2001,"One told me the brilliant ending and I guess this was what ruined the movie for me at first sight. It was good but not as brilliant as everyone said. But I wasn't sure about my opinion on this film. It needed at least one more view. And now I recognized the craft that is behind this movie. Brilliant timing, brilliant story, brilliant acting. And it was only now that this film really scared me. And it gets more with every viewing. Ten more times and I will end up with a heart attack.This film doesn't need any gore. In fact you see only a glimpse of what Cole has to suffer his whole life, hour for hour. And believe me, it's enough. M. Night Shyamalan takes about an hour to introduce the characters to us. And he does it very effective and carefully. We learn about Cole's fears. A nine year old child, spending his whole life hiding from ghosts, not able to overcome his fear to tell anyone. We learn about Cole's mom who is tired of not knowing why her son shudders, why he is haggard at times. We learn about Dr. Crowe's troubles to create a equalization between his private- and working life after getting shot by a former patient whom he couldn't help. The reason why he wants to help Cole so badly. This takes about a third of the film. But isn't boring a minute. Who isn't touched by the way Tony Collete and Haley Joel Osmont share a scene is definitely in the wrong film and should go see any Dolph Lundgren film of his choice.It's amazing how well this film does in every aspect of filmmaking that even this is scary. Everything, the script, the cinematography, the sound, the music, the directing, the acting. It all builds a whole. A brilliant one.A classic up there with Braveheart.",The Sixth Sense

658,ObsessiveViewer,Will Go Down In Cinema History As A Brilliant Hitchcockian Classic,7,21 July 2004,"*-Catch it on TV **-Worth a Rental ***-Buy it Used/On Sale ****-Buy it New/Top Dollar *****-Worthy of a Blind BuyThe Sixth Sense was M. Night Shyamalan's first masterpiece. For the two people who have yet to see this film I will clue you in on what it is about. The Sixth Sense is a supernatural thriller about a child psychologist named Malcolm Crowe (played by Bruce Willis) who discovers that he made a mistake with a former patient named Vincent. Enter Cole Sear (Haley Joel Osment), a troubled young boy with remarkable similarities to Vincent. Malcome makes it a personal mission to help Cole so that he can feel better about his former patient. By the way, Cole's problem is that he can see dead people.
There are very few ways that this film could have been better. However, one way to make it better has nothing to do with the film itself. If the promos for the film hadn't shown Haley Joel Osment saying the famous phrase, ""I see dead people"" over and over again than the film would have been much more surprising. Image the surprise in learning that the reason that Cole is so messed up is because he is haunted by ghosts. Not that it needed to be anymore surprising. The big twist at the end has been regarded as both brilliant and ridiculous for the past five years. I am one of the many who believe it to be brilliant. After seeing it for the first time you will be blown away. The ending is not the only reason to see the film.Bruce Willis strayed away from his traditional action hero roles when he starred in this film. It was all around a different character for him and he nailed it. Willis makes Malcome Crowe come alive and conveys his emotions easily in the film. Haley Joel Osment was great as Cole Sear. I am not quite sure if he was good enough to merit a nomination for best supporting actor though. His constant whispering got slightly annoying but was necessary considering the plot.M. Night Shyamalan's screenwriting and direction in The Sixth Sense is nothing short of incredible. The pacing was slow and it added to the tension Night so brilliantly created. A lot of people find Night's style boring and difficult to watch (especially in his later films). I love the slow development of the story and characters and increased ""creepiness."" James Newton Howard was the film's composer. His music fits the film perfectly and makes it even more suspenseful. M. Night Shyamalan gave himself a name with The Sixth Sense and raised the bar for all future supernatural thrillers. The Sixth Sense is a ***** film and, I say this a lot, but if I believed in organizing a list of my favorite films than needless to say this would be pretty high up.",The Sixth Sense
659,tsheridan94,Why is this so good?,5,4 February 2010,"The answer: everything. This movie has all the elements that make great movies, classic movies. It has believable characters, phenomenal actors, great directing, and that ending. Oh man, that ending. If only M Night Shyamalan always made movies this good. While he still made some very good movies, notably Signs and the Village, he never again reached the height of The Sixth Sense.One of the things that surprised me most was how good Bruce Willis is. Granted, he was good in Die Hard, but I had pinned him as just an action movie star, not someone who can actually act well. My doubts were all dispelled by this film. And how about Haley Joel Osment? What happened to this kid? This has got to be one of the best child performances I have seen in a movie, bar none.This movie also has the creep factor, without going over the top. It is chilling, without actually being straight up horror. When young Cole utters that famous line while lying in a hospital bed, it still sends a shiver down my spine. The movie has a certain atmosphere to it that is never broken, from the opening five minutes up through the shocker at the end. This movie is exceptionally dark for a PG-13.Shyamalan's directing has a fierce relentlessness to it. Even if the rare occasions when not much is happening, there is the constant feeling that something is about to. This is the movie that showed Shyamalan was a genius. I honestly wish he would show this side more often, as opposed to the side that directed Lady in the Water or is directing Avatar: the Last Airbender. That is one movie I know I'm going to miss once it's opens.If you want a phenomenally well made creepy picture, without having the actual pants scared off you, this is the movie to watch.

If you don't like the atmosphere you don't like the film, it's as simple as that. I personally found it quite boring in places due to me not getting into the atmosphere. They took ages to say things or do things, like in the scene where the boy gives the father at the funeral the tape.The acting of course is brilliant, you can't help but love the strange boy. He seems so innocent yet all the time is seeing these horrible things that come across quite scarily when you don't understand what's going on initially. Bruce Willis is good but I feel sometimes all he does is whisper and look depressed. I suppose that is his role but he could have put a bit more presence into it.At for the plot it's great but takes a while to get going. The huge twist at the end I never saw coming because of the way they carefully interwove Willis' character into scenes. I never suspected it for one moment.

A neat twist of a psychic nature, no?  The boy finds that he himself has a mission of sorts after dealing with horrific visions of the dead.  I won't divulge anything about the mission.Willis' character, whose name eludes me at the moment, also finds that he has a mission.  His wife is growing distant, and it's up to him to get refocused on his wife instead of his career.  I mean, having someone attack you probably would provoke you into correcting a career-based mistake, don't you think?The ending is 100% pure shocking and I will say that it was excellent.But as a side note, lots of people are quick to compare this to Blair Witch. I've got to say that to do that is, to me, quite silly.  Blair Witch works on a VERY different level than The Sixth Sense.  This particular film is a tad slow, but patience is a virtue.  If you can be patient with it, you'll reap the rewards.Also great acting all around.  This gets 4.0/5.0 stars from me.",The Sixth Sense
664,Tony-114,"A 6 for ""Sixth""",6,25 March 2000,"This is a very good film, featuring an incredible performance by Osment and a strong reminder of what a fine actor Willis can be when he's got a good script. But while I certainly don't wish to jeopardize my membership by revealing the end (said by many to rival ""Usual Suspects""), it simply doesn't warrant the incredible attention it's received (including its Best Picture nomination), and, to my own surprise, undoes any strides it makes towards being a human story rather than a ghost story. For this is really a movie about how being a kid in today's world is tougher than it's ever been. This could have been a much darker, better film, but Disney clearly reigned it in from any steps into R-rating territory. (It's PG-13.) Hopefully its success will allow Shymalan freer rein on his next film: he's capable of it, as the ""Munchausen revelation"" will attest.",The Sixth Sense

He lived for a year without ANYONE ever speaking to him?  Without EVER trying to say anything to his wife besides ""are you gonna get that?""  I don't buy it.  The twist ending is implausible, no matter how you slice it.Furthermore, the romantic sub-plot is once again underdeveloped and secondary, just a filler for the erroneous twist ending.  We could've seen a little more development of the lack of their marriage (showing how he was inhumanly busy for a year, etc.)The script was recycled from ""The Shining"", a much better film as far as acting, cinematography, music, development of the characters, and most other aspects go.

669,Autlan,Wow! What a picture.,3,20 December 2009,"There were so many pleasing things to concentrate on in this film. Let me see if I can recall a few.First off, that adorable child. What a remarkable job, casting that lead. He was what - only ten or so? Remarkable. And we weren't let down by the rest of the cast either. His mother was just fantastic; I don't think I've empathised with a single mother like that before. Bruce Willis, playing the child psychiatrist, really had his work cut out acting next to her, but boy did he pull it off. He really deserved that award. Good job.But credit where credit's due, without the top notch script I doubt even this cast could have pulled it off. When seriously original works like this one get green-lit you know that some people still care about bringing depth -- that only an engaging drama/thriller can -- back to our cinemas. I missed the boat on that one, but it certainly did well in my living room.Dramas can always be measured by the dizzying heights of their joy and the plunging depths of their despair. This rolling masterpiece went so far, so fast, it brought me into a state of spatial disorientation. It will hold you on the edge of your seat until gradually you shuffle back into a comfortable position. Periodically, it will make your hair stand on end until you tug it flat in bunches, wide-eyed with anticipation. There are enough sad moments too, but I won't spoil the surprise.None of this would have been possible without the groundbreaking soundtrack: it really tied the room together. Whenever I felt the uncertainty of a solitary tear the strength of sorrowful strings would fill our eyes to bursting. Gradually the brass would begin to climb... where was I being taken, how far, did anyone know, were they coming too? A sudden, sharp parp would bring us a foot not only out of our chairs, but our skins too. LOL Now you've reached my twist ending, where I can reveal that I actually felt the complete opposite of what I've written.

Was this such a great movie, that both critics and audiences loved it so? With huge anticipation I finally got to see the film in October and although I expected something great, I didn't expect it like that!! The scripting, the plot, the directing, the acting ... is one of the best I've ever seen. I've always been fond of Bruce Willis films, the action and suspension. But this is by far his best film, his best acting, and most profitable! The star of the movie is Harvey Joel Osment, a true wonderkid, and if there ever was a justice in awards for acting, this kid should get some trophies. The script should be nominated too, plus Olivia Williams and Toni Collette. All are doing a great job and when you think about this film after you've seen... you get more and more convinced. This is arguably the best movie I've seen (besides Titanic) and I want to thank everyone involved in it for that. A true masterpiece. A true gem. A film you won't forget.

It's encouraging, because it tells us that in the midst of this banal ""bigger is better"" mentality, there are still some studios, some writers, so actors, and some directors who know better.This is a result of such a collaboration.  Its power resides not in spectral special effects and big explosions in the middle of city streets (sending cars flying into the air, no less), but instead on the requisite basics so often neglected these days:  a solid script, talented actors, a gripping score, and deft directing.

So, where should I begin?  First things first: Who here agrees with me that Haley Joel Osment should get at least an Oscar nod for his spectacular role as playing nine year old Cole Sear, the troubled child who could see ghosts?  I think several people could agree with me on that (including Entertainment Weekly, no doubt).  I also think Bruce Willis gave the performance of his career as the child psychologist trying to recuperate from a past incident with another patient he couldn't cure, and is trying to fix his mistake through Cole.  I also give M. Night Shyamalan all the credit in the world for writing AND directing this masterpiece of the movie.  Going in, I expected your average movie: not good, but not bad either.

Beyond that, the director makes some interesting efforts at being stylish, but this too was partly ruined for me by his own somewhat pretentious `Tricks and Clues' commentary at the end of the video. As for the acting, Bruce was good but much more interesting in Twelve Monkeys and Haley has been overhyped if not overrated.

You start sweating and and heart races kind of fast, and your head goes crazy and you don't know what to think. That's what I was going through when I first watched this. Well you might think my actions are a bit over dramatic, but I was only eight. The Sixth Sense is not a stupid horror film. It's smart, moves along well, and it's not going to disappoint. The acting is acceptable and the directing and the feel of the film just makes you feel like you're there with the boy, facing his fears, and feeling what's going through his innocent and limited mind. Bruce Willis is very good in it, and he's a great character, being a psychiatrist for kids. You'd never guess he was John McClane. This film is a revolution to horror scenarios. This horror film doesn't depend on images to scare you, like The Exorcist, and it doesn't fully work with you mentally like The Silence of the Lambs to scare you out, but rather it uses something different.

The beginning appears to show just another ordinary story, but that's just one of the cheating things from the movie (another one is the ending, but of course I can't reveal it). It's got all the ingredients for a perfect combination between drama, horror and thriller. I remember the fears of the boy (perfectly performed by Haley Joel Osment, who, by the way, was a few years older than his character Cole as well as the desperation of his mother, who can't understand what's happening to him (even when he tells her what happens), and just can't believe he contacts spirits (she things he's only victim of school abuse). I also remember the restless psychiatrist, trying to help the boy as well as he tries to save his marriage, but it's only at the end when he realizes what ACTUALLY happens. The great interaction between both characters, trying to help each other, is priceless. The dramatic story of Cole's grandma and his contacts with her spirit, which are only believed by his mother at the end, when he reveals a special thing. Well, just watch it.",The Sixth Sense

I turned the chroma off to watch it in black and white. I've never forgotten the poignant twist at the film's conclusion, but The Sixth Sense remained frightening and revealed itself to be far richer, emotional and satisfying than I had remembered. The quiet nuance, the performances, the directing, the photography, the timing, the editing, the looming fear and the humanity of the story took my breath away. Wow!

688,antonio-21,Most Overrated Film in the Past 25 Years!,2,8 March 2000,"****CONTAINS SPOILER****WARNING!****WARNING!***** Where to begin?  I'm not usually surprised at the bad taste of filmgoers, making such colossal hits out of Home Alone and The Lost World, however this film takes the cake.  I enjoyed the performances, particularly Toni Colette, Haley Joel Osment, and the vastly under-appreciated Bruce Willis.  However, as much as I admire some aspects of the film, the denouement is so predictable and frankly, insulting to any thinking adult, that the success of this film astounds me.  If the film had been like ""The Crying Game"" where the ""surprise"" twist is interesting, but more importantly,  a mere plot device to further the film in it's storyline, I might have had less problems with this movie.  I was shocked that anybody would have been fooled for a moment about the health of Bruce Willis' character.  If American audiences are dimwitted and unobservant not to notice the THOUSANDS of obvious hints that preceed the unveiling of the truth, then this is the film for them.  It was insulting to have to sit through the final minutes of the film, being forced to relive earlier scenes that any intelligent moviegoer should already have noticed.  The mere fact that Willis doesn't change his clothes ONCE should have tipped off everybody!Well, my comments certainly won't stop those people that make hits of such movies as this, but I must raise my voice in protest since the last year has seen such incredible  movies as Three Kings, Magnolia, Election, The Talented Mr. Ripley, Boys Don't Cry, American Beauty, Being John Malkovich, Topsy-Turvy, Eyes Wide Shut, The Straight Story, Sweet & Lowdown, All About My Mother, and underappreciated gems like The Limey and Go, and a half dozen more that will be remembered much longer than this slim piece of celluloid.",The Sixth Sense

He was no better then the child from 'Mercury rising' in fact in my opinion he was not as good as that kid.  I gave this film 8/10.",The Sixth Sense
690,yoyodinepropulsion,Overrated,4,28 October 2001,"CONTAINS SPOILER Let me start by saying the Sixth Sense is a good movie. A GOOD movie, not a great one. I'm not sure how this one got so big, I mean, yes it's got that nice twist, but it's also somewhat predictable and (SPOILER AHEAD!) comepletely ludicrous if you think about it. Think about it! seriously. This movie reminds me of Arlington Road and Reindeer Games in that the movie doesn't make sense if you sit down and rationally think about it. I mean, Bruce Willis has been dead for a year, an entire year. Don't you think he'd notice, particualrly that NO ONE talks to him, NO ONE except Osment! At one point, he says he ""barely talks"" to his wife anymore. Well, ""barely"" is different than ""none"" which would be the reality. Maybe I'm being too critical, but to me, a GREAT movie, like voters here have determined this is by putting it in the top 50 of ALL TIME, should really hold up to repeat viewings. I really have a feeling time is going to trivialize this one and reveal what it really is: a smart, but slow, effective thriller.One final note: while the Sixth Sense got way too much hype, UNBREAKABLE didn't get nearly enough. UNBREAKABLE is a far better film, although it has its flaws as well. Instead of being a solid genre piece like THE SIXTH SENSE though, it really is amazingly original.",The Sixth Sense
691,rowsdower45,"In other words, an M. Night Shyamalan film.",5,10 September 2008,"I was preparing to sing the praises of this film like I hadn't done for any film in such a long time. The first 95 minutes formed one of the most hauntingly beautiful (or beautifully haunting?) horror stories I've ever seen. Osment's performance completely blew me away, and Willis didn't stop short of earning his paycheck either. Willis' performance as a troubled psychiatrist struggling to understand and help save this fear-wracked boy was a pleasant reminder of the man's true, unsung versatility.And then the ending happened, and forgive me for somewhat glossing over the film's good points, but just thinking about how thoroughly wasted all this greatness was just has the effect of getting me angry all over again.First, I should make it clear that, having heard the ""I see dead people"" line, I knew mostly what the film was about (though perhaps this would only have delayed how obvious the ""twist"" became). So from the end of the first scene onward, I was simply proceeding, as I assumed I was meant to, with the knowledge that Dr. Crowe was dead. I kept waiting for the emotional ""reveal"" scene that would provide the impetus for the film's final act, but I never imagined that that scene would be the *ending*. I thought we would find out that (for instance) Crowe survived the shooting at the beginning, only to somehow have Cole (or Cole's absent father) cause his death later. I also want to know more about Cole. Does he ever stop seeing the ghosts? Does he grow up and get his own TV show? Does he eventually snap anyway and go on Vincent's homicidal rampage?But no. Shyamalan was too busy being flashy and trying to get talked about to wrap up his beautiful story in any meaningful way. Is this what we have become as a society? Are movies really getting this dumbed down, so that we're at a point where we won't trust anything a director doesn't smash over our head? Fine, fine, I'll get back in my seat; this was nine years ago, after all. Nobody knew that M. Night was an arrogant hack. Now that we do, I think it's high time we got over this film, and just allow M. Night's career to begin its inevitable petering out.For a film to be bad is one thing. This film is not that. For a film to make you feel angry and used, to the point that you wonder why you even bother watching movies anymore, is quite another. Then again, I suppose that's what I get for taking an M. Night Syamalan film seriously.",The Sixth Sense
692,BeckyKmovieluver,15 or PG? Not my kind of 'horror' movie,7,24 November 2005,"I have read a lot of good comments for this movie but I must admit that it was not my kind of 'horror' movie. Whilst other people seem to have gained a lot of insight into the underlying themes of this film, such as it's emotional intensity and unexpected twists, I was watching the film in the hope of being scared by it! As it turned out I was bitterly disappointed. I used to consider myself a complete woos where horror movies were concerned, but having made an effort to watch more of them recently I now find them throughly entertaining, although as yet non of them have really 'scared' me, as it were and 'Sixth Sense' was the worst of them all! That's not to say I didn't enjoy this movie to an extent. I enjoyed it for it's originality, handling of emotional issues and occasional shocks... the ending was totally unexpected. However when it came to the 'scare factor' this movie is totally lacking. My friends found it hilarious when I asked them what they thought about it one day and concluded in my opinion that this film should be a PG not a 15!!!! I understand that there are a couple of what could be described as mildly graphic moments in this movie... but seriously I have seen PG's more gory than this and U's that are a lot scarier... I mean what the heck is going on in 'Alice In Wonderland'? In conclusion this is not a movie I would recommend to any hard core 'horror' fan. If it didn't scare me when I first saw it then it wouldn't even scare a 3 month old (I used to be a total woos!!!!) I'm now looking forward to getting to grips with real horror movies such as 'The Shining', and won't be watching 'Sixth Sense' again anytime soon... I hope!!!!!",The Sixth Sense

He accepted this role and received a very satisfacting void.And the kid... his life has changed forever not only in the film, but now he´s a top Hollywood star.

In one scene the child comes through the front door just home from school. Yet, it is dark outside the front door. The child in the film has a 6th sense but totally fails to use it on Willis.

I certainly wasn't intrigued by the previews (too much whispering!), but the tremendous word of mouth convinced me to go.  I am glad I did. ""The Sixth Sense"" is easily the best film of the summer, if not the year. It surpasses ""The Blair Witch Project"" in both chills and overall effectiveness.  It has such a sublimely quiet style both visually and aurally.  The story is put together with such craft and care, and it's appreciated even more so after the final five or ten minutes.    I have no interest in detailing the plot as the previews (and other reviews) give away too much as it is.  The less you know, the better.

Please watch the original first before you give all the praise to THE SIXTH SENSE. Furthermore, I don't think Bruce Willis is convincing at all as a ""brilliant"" child psychiatrist. The only really good point about this mainstream spooker is Haley Joel Osment. He shows how good child actors, unlike all the Macaulay Culkin's of this world, COULD be.

I can't remember a film in which I have felt both the chill of true terror as well as the tears of sadness through the eyes of the protagonist.

Upon closer viewing, I can truly say that while ""The Sixth Sense"" contains some chills, it amazingly also possesses comfort - it is very life-affirming.  Apparently, writer/director M. Night Shyamalan wrote from personal experience, because you can feel the love and warm emotions bubbling just below the surface.You can feel the love and warm emotions bubbling just below the surface as the film works on many different levels, one of which is to encourage more communication among different generations.It is possible this movie will collect several Oscar nominations, depending upon the quality and competition coming from future 1999 fall/winter releases.  I am almost certain it will receive recognition for the performances of little Haley Joel Osment, Toni Collette, and Bruce Willis, along with the original screenplay, score, sound effects editing, makeup, cinematography, and film editing.  But if not, ""The Sixth Sense"" has already received its recognition at the box office, since it now ranks number two domestically behind ""Star Wars - The Phantom Menace.""

Of course, the best part of Sixth Sense is the ending, which I hope stays a secret forever. Public revealing of the ending would be worse than genocide, in my opinion. The movie is great the second time around, especially when you're with newcomers, because it's SO obvious to you and you can't believe they don't get it.

Bruce Willis was his typical very well liked self. The concept of the movie was odd, the plot was different. It does hold your interest very well and it does feel like a complete story. The acting deserves a 10, yet I am all over the place in my mind of what the story should rate, maybe because one person watching it with us didn't like it at all and said so through out the movie.

But I found I really related to Cole's constant nerves and Malcolm's intense desire to help him.

I was thrust into skepticism even during the initial shooting sequence.  Was I being too cynical or overly probing when I balked at the New Kid On The Block in the bathroom?  Who sought vengeance on Bruce Willis, the child shrink who ""failed"" him by managing to convince him that the dead people he saw walking around all the time were merely outgrowths of stress sprouting from issues surrounding his parents' divorce?  Who happened, after X years of torment by these wandering spirits, to break into Bruce Willis's house on the very night he was commended by the city for his work with children?  Commended with a plaque shiny enough to have filmed the scene prior almost entirely in its reflective surface?Maybe I was.  But after numerous scenes in which every line uttered by every character (and I use the term loosely) was so clearly meant to advance the plot (used even more loosely) that a kindly old narrator such as Burl Ives (or his claymation counterpart) might as well have been reading the whole movie off a clipboard, I found it difficult to sustain my disbelief.  Or interest, for that matter.  Yes, there were a few effective (but cheap) scares, and the ending was quite cool.  But hardly a payoff worthy of having to endure a child actor as insistently bad as any I've ever seen, a mother who seemed to be peering at cue cards over her son's shoulder, and the incomprehensible stoicism of poor Bruce Willis, way out of his (fifth) element, rolling out every stupid child psychology trick save pulling a coin from behind the kid's ear (there is a coin trick, though), all of which are inexplicably and immediately effective.  If only it were that easy to pull one over on the audience... oh, wait, it is.  That this film has received so many positive reviews is baffling.Olivia Williams is very easy on the eyes (but has nothing to work with as obligatory wife-person), and there were some lovely ironies available, notably in the mutual confession scene in the hospital after the kid has his pseudo-seizure, but the film attempts to drive home its points like a careless carpenter with a throbbing thumb.  I'm extremely weary of films that collapse when I pay too much attention to them, and likewise wary of those who suggest that in order to enjoy these films I should not pay so much attention.3 out of 10.",The Sixth Sense
719,jeanie-5,Popular but not excellent,4,3 September 1999,"I find aspects of this story well-conceived, but the film has many loose ends which could have been tied together by enhancing the screenplay and the direction.  I have a theory about the popularity of this and similar movies:  Many people want to know what happens (or what might happen) when life in the human form ends.  As a clairvoyant able to see into different dimensions of reality, I have appreciated various screen presentations of non- ordinary reality.  The essence of this story aligns with what I can see in other dimensions.  But, oh, for more masterful story telling.",The Sixth Sense

Great acting job by the kid and willis. Willis comes off very likeble. I didnt recognize Donnie wahlberg until he started crying like his brother did in boogie nights. This movie really reminded me of all those old horrror movies like the Omen and Rosemarys Baby. The plot is very slow though and the movie crawls along, but its still very good.

And I have seen little but positive comments about this movie.  Please help me to understand this.  This can't be the same movie I recently saw.  I have read other users suggestions calling for an Oscar nomination for young Cole.  If anyone in this entire cast receives an Oscar, I will know that the awards are fixed. Did anyone get the feeling that this movie is ONLY about the ending (not even an original one), and they were jerked around for an hour and a half previous just to get to the lame ending?  How this movie can be considered one of the best movies of the year by some is far beyond me.  This should have been an episode of an X-Files ripoff and not a full-length motion picture. Please don't misconstrue one or two ""shock"" gore scenes as scary OR intense. And the so-called ""amazing"" twist ending is not worth the price of admission.

So I guess it did entertain me, though not satisfyingly enough.But I wasn't scared in the parts where I presume is supposed to be scary, and I wasn't touched in the parts where I presume is supposed to be emotional.

723,Mr Dread,Best movie of the year--absolutely no doubt about it!,10,28 February 2000,"(A+) I saw The Sixth Sense during the first weekend it was out and let me make this perfectly clear: This movie is one of the greatest movies of the 90s. The Blair Witch Project, Halloween H2O and the Scream trilogy just don't compare!I came out of the theater astonished and awestruck, for I had  witnessed one of the greatest endings. And for those who say that they saw it coming, I say 'no way!' because there is absolutely no way one could predict the ending to this movie unless he or she was the unfortunate one who heard it from a friend or read a spoiler somewhere.The script was superbly written (by M. Night Shyamalan), and the cast is great. The acting was magnificent, even though you might hear otherwise now that the movie received so much praise. For some reason, people like to place negative comments about a movie that had great success; my guess is that it's because they like to be different from everybody else. This IS a great movie, believe me.There are two kinds of horror movies. This kind (dealing with the supernatural and the fear of the unknown), and the slasher kind (where a mentally ill and/or deformed in some way person or creature goes out and massacres teenagers). The first kind mentioned is my favorite type and that's why I grade The Sixth Sense so high, it's simply original and well thought out.Cole Sear is played brilliantly by Haley Joel Osment and Malcolm Crowe was also fabulously played by Bruce Willis. M. Night Shyamalan did a superb job directing and I look forward to his future films.The music score, written by James Newton Howard, delivers the appropriate mood and builds the suspense. A great score. I love the camera movements also.If you enjoyed this movie as much as I did, I would also strongly recommend you to see THE STIR OF ECHOES with Kevin Bacon, directed by Devid Coepp.",The Sixth Sense

After my first viewing of ""The Sixth Sense"" and its viewer's comments I suddenly realize indeed how many plot holes are planted in this otherwise great film. Summary: if I had not read other comments before voting and not have realized the many plot holes of this movie I would have given this movie a 8/10, but now that I have, I truly think this movie not only does not deserve the high ratings it receives. in conclusion I gave this movie a 6/10",The Sixth Sense

There were certainly some interesting subplots, but I still found this movie to be utterly pointless and essentially self-congratulatory in its ""brilliance"". On the plus side, I did think Haley Joe Osment did a fantastic job as the gifted little tyke. But aside from that, I did not find most of the acting to be particularly strong, and I apologize but a little kid's acting cannot save this movie. I just don't understand how a movie as simple as this can be considered ""great"", especially when you can't watch the movie more than once and enjoy it! However, that seems to be the norm, considering how great Se7en was considered as well (another movie that I just figured out in the first half hour.)

I had thought this is just a horror movie. However, this contains a lot about family and love. The first murder scene is very breathtaking. Actually Malcolm is dead, but the audience never doubt it because he continues his usual life. So the fact is unknown for every body except for Cole, the boy who can see ghosts. This boy is clue to all of the story. A lot of hints that Malcolm is already dead exists in the film but you cannot notice them at all because the camera-work is so great. When the boy's mother meets Malcolm, they seems to see each other although she actually does not see him. This film is enjoyable as you can get new discoveries every time you watch this. This movie brings up several issues and teaches about how family are. At first Cole's mother cannot believe his words and scolds him, but she finally believes him and is ashamed of her. Malcolm also doubt his wife's affair, but finally notices his death and his wife still loves him. The ending is very painful but great, I think.",The Sixth Sense

I wouldnt call this a Horror film, I think it is more of a thought provoking film having to do with death and the realization of it.

Good, consistent camera angles and movement that are paced just perfectly with the story.  Its a movie with just the right tint of darkness.

However, after sitting through this film (along with 1000 other people in a sold-out theater), I realize that there was one thing missing - interest.  I wish I had $1 for every person that was falling asleep around me.  This film is the poster child for boring.  Once again, they lured me in with awesome previews, took my $$, and kicked me in the ass.  This film makes you feel like you have just been violated.I DO have to say that the ending was unexpected, and the five minutes that made up the ending was decent.  It doesn't, however, make up for a horrible film.  What was Bruce Willis thinking when he read this script?  I mean, Willis isn't the best actor in Hollywood, but he should have at least had the brains to let someone else suffer through this (well, I mean someone BESIDES the people who saw it ... we suffered the most).I feel that I need to mention Haley Osment.  This child can act.  His character could not have been played any better by anyone else.  His performance stood out and he should be recognized for being a glimmer of light in such a terrible film.I implore you .... take the $5 and either rent a good film from BBuster or better yet, flush it down the toilet...because that's where it will go ANYWAY if you spend it on ""The Sixth Sense"".

734,spunky-17,An incredible film,10,21 January 2000,"First off, Haley Joel Osment (plays Cole) is one heck of an actor.  His performance rivals that of Linda Blair in ""The Exorcist"" and Henry Thomas in ""E.T."".  Osment brilliantly plays true horror and fear and I found it hard to believe that he wasn't truly haunted by unknowing ghosts.  The film is a visual masterpiece.  The use of the color bright red is so perfect and downright spooky that I can't see that cinematographer not getting an award. The story itself is great, but the final touch is the complete horror of the idea that you could be dead and not know it.  Rent, buy it, or watch it and think about it.",The Sixth Sense

Most movies today are entirely too predictable, so being totally taken unaware by the ending changed this movie from a good movie to a very good one.

737,scottnyc,A fine movie but certainly not a great one,6,17 October 1999,"Although this is a fine movie, it is one of the most overrated by audiences in recent years.  Among the film's main strengths are the stunning performance of child actor Haley Joel Osment and by the young actress who plays his mother.The script is very clever but also very, very sentimental.  This is not to say that the scene near the end of the picture when the boy connects on a new level is not moving--it is.  But the ending of the story of Willis's character is more effective as a stunt than as a source of honest emotion.I will say, though, that the scenes intended to be scary are really, really scary.  This owes largely to Osment's performance, which draws us into complete identification with the haunted child at the movie's center.  It is also a credit to the screenwriter/director, though the movie's scares are never adequately integrated with the gooey emotion at the movie's heart.I recommend THE SIXTH SENSE, but I insist that it is not the ""great"" movie that current popular sentiment suggests.",The Sixth Sense

741,szekeong123,A Ground-Breaking and enduring film,10,13 March 2005,"M. Night Shyamalan intelligently wrote the script for this film and brilliantly directed it. He carefully made the film which causes many audiences to misinterpret the storyline before being surprised by the plot-twist ending. It is not just the shocking ending that made the film. It is the solid character study and good social commentary that makes the film a timeless cinematic gem. After repeated viewings, the surprise is long gone, but it still manage to move me.Some complain that this film is not scary. I admit that the scare factor is minimal, and there is not much suspense. However, though marketed as a horror-thriller, it is not really meant to be scary. In fact, I feel that the chills are just a bonus. The key genre of this film is drama-mystery. A story which deals with the agony of a child psychologist (well played by Bruce Willis) over his marriage, a career failure, and a difficult patient which reminds him of his failure. A story of how a boy (Haley Joel Osment) having to survive emotional and physical torture, and coping with his worried single mother's (Toni Collette) suspicion over his well-being and abnormalities.After my careful observation, certain scenes are not just meant to trick audiences or drop hints for the now famous ending. Each of them mean something. However, I am not going to analyze how I interpret them to avoid spoilers. I will just say that this film deserves multiple viewings. Not just to fully comprehend it, but also to appreciate the powerful performances by Haley Joel Osment and Toni Collette.Their Oscar nominations are well-deserved. Osment portrays the emotion of Cole Sear to perfection. Not only does he bring life into his role, he also effectively controls the atmosphere of the film. It is no wonder that this film earns him international recognitions. Toni Collette, in a relatively small role, plays Lynn Sear with complexity. Her screen time is limited, but her portrayal of the character speaks a lot. The rest of the cast are also good. Bruce Willis is humorous and has great chemistry with Osment. Olivia Williams convincingly double-play her role which is very crucial to the plot twist. Greg Wood is also subtle as a father who lost his daughter.All in all, an influential masterpiece which, I strongly believe, inspired the well-crafted but inferior ""The Others"", and many other pretentious films.",The Sixth Sense

The story is basically about a little boy who can see dead people wondering around but the final climax of the film is the ending which is superb. I do not recommend this film to anybody who gets scared easily although i think its a shame that such a great film should not be seen. Bruce Willis was very good in the film acting his usual cool self but the highlight of all the acting in the film has to go to Haley Osmont who played the little boy. Very rarely do we see such fine young actors.

I don't handle it well and I'm not particularly fond of blood and gore. (I almost passed out when the doctor needed a blood sample.) It's not that I don't appreciate a good suspenseful movie, but current movie tend to be more than I can handle. But The Sixth Sense is a movie that kept the suspense and didn't have the gore. I was riveted from the moment it started. Bruce Willis was great as the doctor and the rest of the cast was outstanding as well. However, what makes the movie great were the writing and the direction. The story keeps you interested and on the edge of your seat. I don't believe in esp or ghosts, but the writing made the concepts seem realistic and believable. There are few red herrings and the surprise at the end of the movie really was a surprise. The direction of the movie probably was the strongest point. The movie is quiet with few loud, screeching moments  like many horror movies, such as Halloween or any of the many Friday the 13th flicks  which makes it even more suspenseful.

I saw it in a theatre on the big screen when it was first released and only knew that it dealt with the problems of a special young child.I watched the introductory scenes, trying, as I always do, to absorb all of the clues. In a really good movie, every single thing that is presented--whether it be visual, audio, or implied--is an important piece of the puzzle, especially in stories about mystery and/or the supernatural.Having seen all of M Night Shyamalan's other movies, I didn't expect very much. Although his ideas are usually quality, somehow the movie versions somehow always seem to fall short on the big screen. But, this particular story really delivered! A visual artist, myself, I am most often able to ""see through"" a developing story line by using the above-mentioned clues presented during the story progression. This was just about the only movie that really fooled me. It was so expertly handled that I simply ""glossed over"" the beginning sequence of events and allowed myself to become swept up by the fairly fast-paced plot and forgot to consider doubt in the general premise of the story.Excellent acting, especially by Mr. Willis and amazing young Mr. Osment, definitely contributed to the story, as did all other actors, who never once phoned in their performances but, also, did not overplay their roles either, making this unusual story seem quite plausible. The sets, costumes, and even musical score were appropriate and added a real air of authenticity. Great direction and production values also contributed to a fine overall production.Just about one second before the rest of the audience ""caught on"" to the stunning plot twist near the end of the movie, I almost jumped up out of my chair and screamed, ""I get it! He's.....! Now, it all makes perfect sense!"" After leaving the theatre, all the way to the back of the parking lot, all I could talk about to my companions was my complete surprise and how this quite remarkable movie production suckered me in at the start and kept me guessing until the final scene!Enjoy this outstanding movie in the comfort of your own home, without pausing the DVD at any point and let it take you firmly by the hand and move you through the storyline without discussion along the way.

The other impressive actor in the film was young Haley Joel Osment who was truly fantastic in a lead role at such a young age. This film goes down as one of my favourite thrillers of all time due to a fantastic plot and a fantastic cast. It is a very moving film that reduced me to tears at the end.

752,lupanminefujiko,spiritual power,10,26 July 2016,"***spoiler***You may think that all of ghost hate human, but the idea will change after watching this film. You may think that this film is the very horror movie, but you fell some strange as you watch. Firstly, a man who is psychiatrist is ignored by his wife, despite they are loving each other, and around people. Secondly, the scene which the couple is threaded by murder cut in sometimes, but you can't know the outcome. But you can solve the mysteries at last scene. Though this movie is a horror film, the ghosts don't show up frequently because this film focuses the mystery of the man and the suffering of the leading character who can see ghosts. So the performance of them is so important in this movie. And this film is so good to give us the fear without showing up ghosts. It is the scene when the leading character is eating lunch with his mother. After his mother comes back from other place, all of shelves in the kitchen open surprisingly. The phenomenon shocks us strongly and you can't forget the scene forever.",The Sixth Sense

Then they show you the real picture which was on the other side all the time. You were busy solving one side and never checked the other.

The sketch mentality pervades in the caldrons of collabrative writing. Structure gets subsumed in moments. But this film brings us back to the solid, thought-out script. It works backwards and forwards, smoothly, and as curious as a mobius strip. It's the first film in years where the script is the hero.",The Sixth Sense

758,Bond-33,A Great Movie...,10,7 August 1999,"The 6th Sense isn't a typical horror, gore, frightening ghost story.  It constantly builds until the last 5 minutes where you are shocked to find whats really going on.  There is little violence.  This kind of movie shows that you don't have to add gore, violence and sex to make a great, suprising, and very suspenseful movie.  The best movie of it's kind in years.  There are some holes (sort of, it depends on your point of view) but they are easy to forget about.  Supposedly the boom microphone drops into the picture in a scene but i was so tense on the edge of my seat i never noticed.  Go see this movie!!***** out of ***** stars",The Sixth Sense

I'm usually pretty good at figuring out movie endings before they happen, but my wife is decidedly not, so the stuff they say is too much (in my book.)  But the movie itself is wonderful.",The Sixth Sense
760,ACOD,Excellent,8,2 December 1999,"This movie was excellent, very emotional, chilling, and it holds your interest the whole way through. There are some genuinely scary moments, (I jumped watching this and didn't jump once during the dismal ""Stigmata""). Its pretty much like Maltin says, ""the film is sinuous and creepy without being manipulative."" Haley Joel Osment is astonishing, never has a child actor been so convincing since Anna Paquin in The Piano, who was around the same age when she won her academy award. Osment makes the film seem all the more real. I haven't seen Bruce Willis this good since Pulp Fiction. Toni Collete is great too, (although i could hear her australian accent creep through on occasion). Unfortunately, I was already aware of the twist at the end, (thanks to a tv presenter who decided to be incredibly irritating to my country by broadcasting the twist just to annoy everybody!) but this didnt diminish the power of the final scenes, which were both creepy, and touching. Ive already heard from people that this movie ""sux"" and it ""doesnt have enough blood"" and ""it was boring"", oh and ""End of Days looks better"". Hmmmmmmmmm, im sure a Schwarzenegger action vehicle will be better. Right. Im not sure if the film will get a best picture nomination, theres probably been better this year, but if little Osment doesnt get a nomination I will despise the academy awards!",The Sixth Sense
761,Akira-29,An emotionally riveting work disguised as a horror/thriller.,9,24 August 1999,"M. Night Shyamalan has outdone himself. The script is sensitive in its subject matter and intricate in its plotting. Outstanding direction and visually engrossing cinematography (- the mood is established from the first shot). I was so enraptured by the storytelling and pace that I didn't see where the plot was headed. Each scene has definite purpose and gives us further insight into the characters.Simply the best movie I've seen this year (1999). Haley Joel Osment deserves an Oscar nomination. This is not an easy role for a kid to play and he holds his own in every scene w/Mr. Willis. Little Haley Joel supposedly made the director cry while delivering his lines. That is powerful acting. I would rate his performance among the best by a young actor, ranking close to Leonardo Dicaprio in ""What's Eating Gilbert Grape"" and Anna Paquin in ""The Piano.""If you haven't seen this film, and I suspect there will be a few that decide not to go, I urge you to go see it even if you are averse to the ""horror genre"".

763,Robert_W,This film is no blessing...,3,30 May 2000,"I'm glad to see that a few users did find this movie completely overrated...'The Sixth Sense' was uninteresting, and though with reasonable character development, there were some basic flaws that I could not shake while watching this movie (and some later flaws that were pointed out to me that made me realize that this film was the most overrated film of 1999)...Firstly - about a year had past since the time Willis was killed, and yet, had he never attempted to talk to his wife? What logic was being used when the audience is led to believe that Willis lived with his wife for a year without talking to her? Not only this, but the fact that most likely the first night that Willis, after being killed and him returning to his house, would have realized something was wrong...this fact ruined the movie...On top of that, other major flaws were made apparent to me (by others) after watching the film - firstly that the dead people were only seen in the areas in which they were killed, raising the question of 'How did Willis manage to walk around town?'...The second major flaw is that surrounding the fact that the church was a safe-haven for Osment's character - i.e., dead people couldn't enter the church; yet Willis does it on more than one occasion...I respect Bruce Willis as an actor, but I feel obliged (as I sometimes do) to point out certain aspects of films when they receives unduly recognition - in this case, the film was cast as truly thought-provoking and intelligent...The ending was indeed different - but that in itself, in my mind at least, was not nearly enough to compensate for the stagnation that was the rest of the film (which was neither thought-provoking as a whole, intelligent, or entertaining)...I would have given this film [2/10], but since Bruce Willis was in it and did the best he could, I honor his talent...[3/10]",The Sixth Sense
764,Leo-86,Reciprocal healing,10,27 August 1999,"Bruce Willis plays  troubled child psychologist Malcom Crowe, and young Haley Joel Osment is Cole Sear, his patient, a disturbed nine-year-old who sees ghosts. Slowly Crowe gains young Cole's trust; and just as slowly Cole gains Crowe's trust. Therein lies the heart of this extraordinary film--for both individuals, when the film is over, have healed each other. And that's what the film is about--recirpocal healing. Willis gives his best performance since In Country, and young Osment is a revelation. The lad should be nominated for 1999's Best Actor. What a performance! The Sixth Sense isn't a horror film. The Sixth Sense isn't merely a ghost story. It's more: It's a terrific, riveting film, one the viewer will think about long after it's over. Final words: The wonderful twist at the end alters the film's entire meaning; and the name M. Night Shyamala should be kept in mind: He has directed and written the summer's best film.",The Sixth Sense
765,Slaw-2,wow,10,7 August 1999,"Well let me say after seeing ""The Jackel"" and ""Mercury Rising"" I was almost giving up on our old friend Bruce. He was good in ""The Siege"" but that was Mr. Washington's movie. But after seeing ""6th Sense"" let me be one of the first to say......BRUCE IS BACK, BRUCE IS BACK. As Peter Travers from Rolling Stone said, we finally get to see Bruce Willis the actor for a change. To talk about the plot/story of the film is to begin to taint it for those who have not seen it. Don't read reviews, don't listen to people talk about it, just go see it. With all the supernatural thrillers, I was the most excited for The Blair Witch Project. After seeing that terrible film I was happy to see a movie that could scare me or at least creep me out. For everyone who makes a big deal about the unseen terror well wait til you see what you can't in 6th Sense ( if that confuses you don't worry). Hopefully upcoming thrillers like ""Stigmata"" and ""End Of Days"" are as clever and well-crafted as this film was. I am happy for Bruce and most of all happy to see such a good film to come out this summer to keep this summer's trend of excellent movies (for the most part)",The Sixth Sense
766,Andy C-2,"This film is bad, very bad.",5,16 June 2001,"I don't know how on earth this film reached 32 (at time of writing) of the top ever films. I've probably seen over 200 films better than this one and the awful unbreakable. I can only assume either (I'm not a horror movie fan), that the supposebly overwhelming atmosphere of Bruce Willis talking to some messed up little boy entertained people, much like horror films or either the modern cliche of adding a big twist on to the end of film to try to make sense of the piffle before it. The latter seems particularly lame, as there is some credit due in the former. I don't see why this makes a film a good film because your bored to death with a nothing storyline for however long, just to be told something to make you feel good when you finish the film. Most of all considering the director did EXACTLY the same thing the doubly pathetic Unbreakable to churn in some money for piffle - pathethic flawed storyling, big twist at end - really shows the lack of imagination and credibility of this film.Warning: Only watch this film if your an atmospheric lover or part of large simple-minded cinema going folk - who loves the big blockbusters and not the more credible imaginative and orginal films such as Dogma (1999) and Traffic (2001) to name some good recent films.",The Sixth Sense
767,nateman-2,Better than I expected,10,7 August 1999,"I was expecting a horror movie filled with hideous dead people tormenting a young boy. It was only partly that. It really was a touching and intelligent physiological chiller that would have made Alfred Hitchcock proud. Especially the surprise ending. It caught me off guard just as much as the movie ""The Sting"" did.",The Sixth Sense
768,slam163,"Competently-made and acted, solid plot",8,13 January 2000,"While it now seems to be impossible for any film - good, bad or indifferent - to escape the hype machine that declares it the greatest movie ever made, ""The Sixth Sense"" nonetheless holds up well. It is an intelligent, well-made thriller that can be genuinely frightening and moving by turns. Bruce Willis acquits himself honorably in a demanding role that requires him to do more than grit his teeth and show his chest hair, but the most impressive performances come from Toni Colette and child actor Haley Joel Osment. Most importantly, the plot is interesting, plausible and internally consistent, and even manages to survive the much-discussed 'final twist'. The 'final twist' is an over-used device in movies currently - for every film such as ""Wild Things"" (where the whole movie is one twist after another) or ""The Usual Suspects"" (where there is only one twist, but an immensely satisfying one), there are half a dozen others where a wholly arbitrary and gratuitous twist is thrown in 'just because'. The ending of ""The Sixth Sense"" is not arbitrary or gratuitous, and you get the pleasure of mentally reviewing the movie to see if it stands up in the light of the ending. To its credit, it does.Possible spoiler: it may be interesting to compare this film with ""Jacob's Ladder"". Both films merge a sometimes bleak and usually realistic view of everyday life with genuinely disturbing glimpses of 'the other world' that do more than merely play the slime-and-gore card. And as viewers who have seen both films may notice, they have other ideas in common as well.",The Sixth Sense
769,Tyson1,One of the greatest films of the year!,8,19 December 1999,"I highly recommended this haunting thriller to my family and all my friends. It was great; most of all for three really important reasons.  First of all the ending twist is the best and most thought provoking twist in a horror film since Norman Bates was Mrs. Bates in ""Psycho""!!!  Because a film can not be judged on the ending alone, there are two other reasons why this film is the best horror film made in the 90's.  It's dramatic and caring.  I really cared for these characters even though it was total fiction; that's what really good films do best.  And I also enjoyed the terror and scary images in the film; they were very HAUNTING!  This is a great motion picture.  Only complaint; the Bruce Willis character leaves the boy too soon I think, I mean we are dealing with ghosts here; you would of thought he would of stayed with the boy longer.  Also the film is never truly climatic or absolutely enthralling.  But, all in all this stands as one of the best films of the year; it's on my top ten list!   The Sixth Sense   ***1/2(out of four)   -   7/10",The Sixth Sense
770,Carmilla-3,Surprising Gem,10,23 October 1999,"A wonderfully surprising gem of a movie.  Bruce Willis in a very different role, I enjoy his acting anyway but this was superb.  For a ""horror"" movie, very little special effects, gore or violence, but then it didn't need those as it held its own with the acting of all the cast (especially Cole).  The twist at the end makes the movie.  A must see.",The Sixth Sense
771,Gez_Medinger,"Great, spooky film.",9,1 December 1999,"Much has been made of the twist in this film. I don't know whether this says something about me or the predictability of Hollywood but from simply having some knowledge of what the film was about, I actually guessed what the twist would be before I had even seen the film. Given this hunch, it was really quite obvious as the film progressed that I was right -however even when it came at the end it was still packed with enough power that it sent a shiver through my body.Credit then to the director, who accomplishes this, and the rest of the film with consumate skill. There are a few powerful moments in this film which should rightly go down as great moments in cinema. However if I was going to draw faults, I would say it takes too long for the plot which everybody already knows (that the kid can see dead people) to unfold, and that perhaps more could have been done with it one it has.Still, great performances from both Bruce Willis and Haley Joel Osment as the kid make this as believable as it could possibly be, and you're unlikely to see a better chiller than this in the next year.Go see it.",The Sixth Sense
772,ekwillow,Now this is a classic flick,9,7 April 2000,"Just when the horror genre was flopping, a movie starring Bruce Willis called The Sixth Sense came to save the day.  With great acting, directing, and writing, this movie became a classic.  It was creepy, not scary, and had such a great story that touched you in the heart.  Now tell me a horror movie thats done that to anybody.  Bruce Willis, an underrated actor in my opinion, did a hell of a job playing the role of Dr. Malcolm Crowe who helps a boy, played also greatly by Haley Joel Osment, who sees dead people. Also great writing and directing by M. Night Shayamalan,  who is right now in the most famous director list right now.  He probably created the most shocking ending of all time in any movie.  Pretty much like Hitchcock.  Great film!",The Sixth Sense
773,Pzippity,Multilayered Masterpiece (*SPOILER*),10,7 December 2000,"Probably the best crafted movie since the great Hitchcock left the scene, though I might argue it is superior even to the master in that respect. Haley Joel gives what has to be the best performance ever by a child actor, maybe even for an actor period, and Bruce Willis is a great enough actor to get himself out of the way enough to allow the boy's brilliance to show through.  There is one aspect of this movie, however, that I have yet to see anyone comment on and which to me makes this movie an even more remarkable achievement.  In Buddhism (OK, I admit it, I'm a Buddhist, a monk even), the mind is considered to be the sixth sense, along with the usual five.  When viewed from this perspective, how Dr. Crowe creates his own reality in his mind, it becomes quite a different film experience.  Obviously many of those who have commented on or reviewed this film have no idea of what ghosts really are, i.e., minds that cannot accept the reality of their own demise and remain trapped on the physical plane until they are released (in this case by an act of restitution for perceived past failures).  And no, Dr. Crowe doesn't really interact with anyone other than the boy, not if you really pay attention.  He just appears to (red herrings).  Also I want to add that Tak Fujimoto is a marvelous cinematographer.  I've never seen a movie where I was so totally grabbed from the very first frame, the bare light bulb slowly turning on.  Ditto for the music.",The Sixth Sense
774,michaelplonsker,Truly Original,9,6 July 2001,"A truly original story, fantastic screenplay and incredible direction make this one of the best movies of all times. Bruce Willis gives the performance of his career in a role which takes him away from his action roles.

Cinema at it's best.",The Sixth Sense
775,Ubik01,Breathtaking,9,7 March 2001,"The film came in with a hype that, in the first glance, made me cautious. But, after reading some trusted critics I decided to go on despite the hype. Well, it paid off.  And something more.  It was an experience that had little to do with my previous experience - and notice that I have watched a lot of movies the last 20 years.  A brilliant script, supported by excellent performances by all the leading actors, a atmospheric, intelligent direction, great cinematography - everything was in tact. And it worked out in the best possible way. Actually it is hard to tell something new in the thriller genre.  All the subjects - ghosts, serial killers, vampires, zombies and all the other horror-concepts - have been overfilmed so much, that only a film in a decade makes it to immortality. In my humble opinion, for the nineties the place is taken.  By the sixth sense. Plus a few words about the actors:  Bruce Willis carries his difficult - esoteristic and emotional in the same time - part with the ease of a great actor.  His second great performance after ""12 monkeys"".  Even if he stands in the shadow of little H.J.Osmont, you can recognize great acting. Haley Joel Osmont is quite a change - pleasant - after all those underaged ""I know everything I look so cool I am an adult in a child's body"" so called ""movie stars"".  Congrats go to the director, who managed to take the best out of the kid. Pretty impressive was also Tony Collete as the kids mother. As a bottom line, to be honest, this film is worth every second you spend on watching it.",The Sixth Sense

Yet even with age, it is still one of the best out there, creepy, intriguing and well thought out.Watching this again last night i am still highly impressed with the casts performances, especially the boy, who perfectly portrays a child in constant fear, not really understanding why he can see these things yet knowing they are something that is truly frightening.Not only the actors performances but the sheer ingenuity of each scene, how Bruce really never actually interacts with anyone, not even by touching them or bumping into them. On top of that the fact that the boy chooses specific times to talk to Bruce and other times he does not, depending on his location and who is around.There's so many small details in the movie that are easily missed on the first watch yet make so much sense in the second, that it's easy to watch The Sixth Sense over and over, yet still miss some thing.What more can be said, The Sixth Sense is a masterpiece and will easily stand the test of time.",The Sixth Sense

Sixth Sense is about as cliche a thriller as can ever be- disturbed kid, hated by others, draws violent pictures in school and has touch with the supernatural. I really don't understand the hype on this one. Couple of quality scary images, but basically just a bunch of psycho-drama.

This movie will keep you interested to the end and awards should be given to those who anticipated the fabulous plot twist that the final ten minutes of this movie present us. Although this movie was released on what was probably the worst decade for horror movies ever, it will surely take his part in history as one of the best the world will lay their eyes on for many years. This is movie presents enormous maturity and interest and even those who are not fans of the genre will surely appreciate The Sixth Sense.

And it's not until the end of the film - after all the discussions with the boy - that he realises his wife isn't speaking to him. Mmm. Bit like the 'here it comes' ending to the Village. There's no major benefit building a whole film round the last five minutes and when the audience is lied to then it's even more unforgivable. Very few films build a case for spending 2 hours setting up the punchline - Usual Suspects springs to mind - but Sixth Sense isn't one of them. A cheap trick in a pretty dress.",The Sixth Sense

However, like all of Shyamalan's (sp?) films, it is very predictable. Personally, I saw the ending coming with about half the film still to go, and i spent the rest watching just to see if I was right. I had the same problem with the Village, but unlike the Village, The Sixth Sense was made out to be some sort of ending that will shock you. It's worth seeing, if you don't know how it ends just to see if you can figure it out.

I saw it on opening day (a few weeks ago) before there was much talk about it to spoil any surprises.  A real trick is to get people who normally don't see this kind of flick to see it.  Too many people (my wife included) think it's a standard creepy flick (""I see dead people."")  Armed with an absorbing script, three terrific performances (Toni Collette along with Willis & Osment), and sharply directed, this is one of the better films this year. Would the film industry do right by it, nominating Oscars for the Osment as Best Actor and Willis as Best Supporting Actor??? Probably not, huh!",The Sixth Sense
787,Mike-489,"A little bit obvious, a little too slow, but very very good.",9,28 May 2000,"Without a doubt this is one of Hollywood's better movies, but the hype & audience buzz surrounding the ""plot twist"" only goes to show just how poor the competition is (need I mention such titles as the laughable remake of ""The Haunting""?).First of all Syamalan directs the cast with extraordinary dexterity & skill, the actors accomplishing this task in an equal manner. Hardest of all must have been Bruce Willis' part, as sticking to the rules of the game is not always as easy as it looks, although he would have had considerable help in the way the set was laid out for him to move through.Osment is beleivable as any kid actor can be, with the vomitt inducing bucketloads of saccarrine,normal for this type of role, thankfully avoided. With Toni Collette as Osment's mother similarly avoiding easy cliches this is refreshing indeed! Olivia Williams hardly breaks surface in the plot, as the narrative mainly concerns Osment's portrayal of Cole Sear (""Sear"" can be pronounced as ""Seer"", as in someone who ""sees"", any coincidence there?) & his interaction with Willis' Malcom Crowe, but again she handles the part with expertise & this is important, as it is key to the plot development.Ah, that much talked about ""plot"". Well for me it was obvious about 30 minutes into the film & after that it dragged right up until the end. There were several scary moments, none the less, with the section about the dead child's video tape an awful & all too believable revelation. Shyamalan was also right not to jump straight in with the dead people that Osment is supposed to see, that would have been an all too easy mistake to make & if there was any pressure on him from the Hollywood ""suits"" to do so then I'm glad he resisted it. Similar lazyness has been completely avoided too, with no sex & no violence, all which would have been expected at some point, but is mercifully absent from a story line that doesn't need it.Even if you work it out, the ""plot twist"" at the end is once again done with skill & with an understated style that still managed an air of chill. I was left thinking that the same level of inteligence had been used as shown in ""The Usual Suspects"", despite the completely different subject matter (the latter, I'll admit, really DID keep me guessing to the end). For the way in which it gets the whole ensemble right, with no weakness in any area, I'd rate this film very highly. It is too slow for me, but that's a purely personal preference & probably because I was lucky (or twisted) enough to pick up on the clues. Knowing that there WAS a plot twist helped, after all. But since it doesn't put a foot wrong all the way through, that has got to be something of a rarity these days & the film has to be applauded as well worth the effort of seeing.",The Sixth Sense
788,SMM-3,About as good as horror films get,9,8 August 1999,"I concur with the majority of comments thus far: The Sixth Sense is an outstanding example of the horror genre. Like The Shining, it is genuinely creepy, but like The Dead Zone, it retains its humanity; the combination makes it so affecting.I was worried that the trailers had tipped too much, but I was wrong. While I could have done without them, in the end they did little to dilute the pleasure and power of this fine film. Even if you are not usually inclined to view horror films, or Bruce Willis films, for that matter, I highly recommend that you catch The Sixth Sense soon, in a real theater, with an audience. It is well worth your time.",The Sixth Sense
789,KCS82,Truly Amazing Film,10,29 July 2000,"This movie was fantastic in almost every way that a movie can be fantastic -- it was beautifully acted, cleverly written, and very artfully filmed. The use of the color red was especially brilliant, and the careful handling of the plot twist was magnificent.  Haley Joel Osment was robbed of an Oscar, as his performance would be considered riveting, even from a seasoned veteran actor.  The fact that he can deliver such a convincing performance at his age speaks wonders of his talent.  I highly recommend this film.",The Sixth Sense

I am a fan of hard-core action movies and offbeat action movies.  I went to see this movie with a group of friends having heard good things about it, yet not exactly delighted to be seeing it.  My goodness!  What a movie!  Although it was quite long, I was never bored.  The story was gripping and filled with suspense.  I was legitimately scared by a movie for the first time in ten years.  The ending completely caught me by surprise, which NEVER happens.  It seems to me that ""Sixth Sense"" would have something to appeal to everyone besides sane children who would undoubtedly not be able to sleep for about a week after seeing it.  If ANYONE has not seen this movie I would strongly suggest it.  FORGET Blair Witch.  10/10",The Sixth Sense

Unfortunately, knowing the ending kind of negates the rest of the film. Either way, this is a decent flick, with a surprisingly superb performance put in by young Osment (who's better than Willis!). There are some pretty creepy parts, but this movie's still at its best with Willis and Osment on screen together.All told, it's a decent (and, for Hollywood, maybe even original) idea and story that's ruined by what I thought was a very revealing beginning. You might be better off walking in 5 minutes into it....",The Sixth Sense

793,rsillima,Hitchcokian,10,4 September 1999,This is as intelligent an homage to Hitchcock as I've seen. All the performances are great -- especially the two women who have to perform in such a way as to make both the primary story and the one revealed in the sudden twist at the end believable. It's nice to see such a well made film do well at the box office.,The Sixth Sense
794,eastie,How come nobody's mentioned the Usual Suspects?,7,28 November 1999,"It just surprised me a bit. The past few years have seen a whole bundle of 'twist' movies (Wild Things, Dead Man's Curve etc) where the final reel reveals new insights into the previous ones, but although none of them are bad movies as such, they've all seemed a bit too self-conscious - twists for the sake of it, rather than in order to genuinely stun the audience. Because you know that nothing is what it seems, you spend the movie trying to guess what the twist will be. The biggest effect it can have on you, therefore, is to mildly surprise you with the way things turned out. The success of the Sixth Sense is, like the Usual Suspects, that it only turns out to have a twist right at the very end. Most people I know who saw the Usual Suspects went to see a heist movie, and thought they'd got one right until the fateful pin-up-board-coffee-cup moment. Similarly, with the Sixth Sense, you get an effective and straightforward spooky movie which suddenly catches you by surprise. The movie has done such an effective job at this that I think it has been somewhat overrated.First of all, I admit that I knew that a twist of some sort was coming (knowing that, it became quite predictable), which, by what I've said already, means that my appreciation for the movie was dulled because it couldn't completely surprise me. The flipside is that I wasn't so awed by the twist as to be blinded by the movie's faults. It's definitely a good film - maybe an '8', and the acting is superb (especially in the mother-son scene in the car), but it's nowhere near one of the all-time top 100 movies, let alone top 10. Two main points:1. Once you remove the shock-effect of the twist, it's actually a very meagre tale. As many others have pointed out, the actual resolution of the boy's problem is given far too little weight -the film is unbalanced. Far too much of it is taken up by Bruce finding out what anybody who's seen the trailor already knows, and far too little actually deals with it.2. If you argue that the twist cannot be removed from the story as a whole - that it is simply too central, then the film must be judged on how well it is integrated into what goes before. The brilliance of the Usual Suspects is that the twist and counter-twists of the ending both explain the previous events better than the previous narrative had. It all makes so much more sense. Although the Sixth Sense is pretty tight (the first encounter between Bruce and the boy makes more sense at the end, for example), there are nonetheless big gaps, like what happened in the time between the opening Donny Wahlberg bit and the ""The Next Fall"" new scene (sorry, I'm trying really hard not to give away any spoilers). I have bigger objections still, but I don't want to give it all away (a cop-out, I admit).There are loads of good points about the Sixth Sense (the acting and the elegant direction spring most immediately to mind) which elevate it to the status of a damn good movie, but if you remove the once-only shock of the twist, what you're left with is not enough to make it a classic.",The Sixth Sense
795,Bluefly,Amazing,10,2 October 1999,"The Sixth Sense is really a work of art. It's one of the most captivating and well-made movies I've ever seen. It's chilling, but it's touching, and of course the ending is brilliant. I left the theater stunned, and I don't know how anyone could find this movie boring. Apparently some people need mile-a-minute comedy or nothing...Bruce Willis is pretty darn good, but he's wallpaper compared to the powerful performance of Haley Joel Osment. Osment should have top billing, not to mention an Oscar for Best Actor. As a young person, I think it's about time a kid gets the recognition they deserve by being cast in a real role. And it's always good when a movie recognizes the supernatural as a very real part of life. So my admiration to the Sixth Sense for really delivering what a lot of movies are afraid to.",The Sixth Sense

I had seen it by accident because the people at the theater carted us before we could see House on Haunted Hill, on the way out of the theater we saw saw some friends there and we decided to see The Sixth Sense because thats what they were going to see. And boy was I glad that happened, because I was so surprised to see this movie, I didnt think it would be that good at all.
     The entire movie was very well put together, and the ending will absolutely blow you away. I doubt you'll be able to figure it out. But some parts, leading up to the end, got dull and bland at times, and a few scenes were not as good as they could have been... but don't get me wrong, there were some times that were quite freaky. But trust me, the end makes watching the whole thing worthwhile. This is a great movie, it's ending gives you a message that you will freak you out about death.

799,whiteraven-4,Dramatic intrigue with a twist.,9,24 February 2000,"From the beginning ""The Sixth Sense"" develops fascinating little crooks and twists for viewers who are on their toes.  The film rolls along in an almost dreamlike state meant to lull the audience into believing the entire story is quite normal, average and almost everyday.  Then it slaps them in the face.  As the characters begin to recognize their problems and deal with them, one might guess the story would lose its momentum.  However, this is the point where new plot details surface and old ones get a quick kick in the pants.I'd say the film is a veritable jigsaw.  The audience may not find putting it together the most pulse-pounding and energetic trip of their viewing lives.  Yet the puzzle draws them in and engages their involvement.  And it does have hair-raising moments in spite of its lack of kick-butt action.In summary:  good plot, good director, good actors, and great ending (among the ranks of ""Casablanca"").",The Sixth Sense

801,Rockford_6,Shyamalan,8,30 August 2008,"I don't really want to talk a lot about this movie because I could spoil the effect. Instead, I'll talk about this filmmaker's first movie. THE SIXTH SENSE, also by M. Night Shyamalan. I first saw it in December 1999, on a 20-hour flight from Chicago to Hong Kong. My only flight out of the USA. The film really pulled me in, which I suspect is particularly difficult on an airplane. Then, the ending. Based on the article you just read, we can say that some viewers weren't surprised. Me, I was blown the heck away and wanted to see it again. Years later I finally did. I taught movie classes, this is a film I chose, and I saw it about a dozen times, fully aware of the ending. It had a bit more going for it than that. My only complaint is with people who think Bruce Willis was the star. The star is Haley Joel Osment! I may have missed out on ""the surprise ending"" because I was watching the kid instead of the shrink. Bruce Willis could probably star in a few more movies after he died and we'd never notice. But I digress. THE VILLAGE is about a pilgrim-style village. Some place quaint, rural, close knit and low tech. Nobody from the village goes into the surrounding woods lest they encounter Those We Do Not Speak Of. The acting was flawless and the scenery most certainly created a mood. Shyamalan is a masterful writer, director and producer. But I had trouble caring about what happened to his characters. That could've been my fault. Saturday morning at 8, Jan was working, and my goal for the day was to pack for our impending move but I was too drained to begin. The neighbor had loaned us this DVD back in February, so I figured watching it and returning it to him was a good start. (The same bad attitude that I brought to THE SIXTH SENSE, right? One of these days I'm going to watch a Shyamalan movie in the right frame of mind.) ""The ending."" How would you like to be a filmmaker judged solely on ""the ending?"" In the case of THE VILLAGE, it worked for me. I thought about this film for days after seeing it. Actually, I was trying to decide what to write in this review. How about this? ""Shyamalan is a filmmaker of bold originality surviving in a commercialized medium."" That's a good thing, no matter what your opinion of each individual film is. I believe some critics are panning him, but I'm not panning this one. I'm glad I saw it. I've missed a few films between THE SIXTH SENSE and THE VILLAGE, and there will be more after THE VILLAGE. I'll watch them all.",The Sixth Sense

806,tjk_sh_826,"One of the greatest masterpiece on Top 250,AggressivelyEncouraged",9,30 January 2005,"The only regret for me is that the movie recently be appreciated,a little be later than I expected, this movie is no doubt one of the greatest masterpiece of M. Night Shyamalan.If somebody tells you that the sixth sense is a horror movie,he is definitely wrong about the subject the director want to show us.I like the tactic of this one a wee same with the Alejandro Amenábar's The Others or Opern Your Eyes which is also my favourite. M. Night Shyamalan is so special and focusing on every little piece and you are supposed to connect it step by step throughout the movie to find the director's destination.Don't get confused,when you grab the thought of the little boy Cole Sear(Haley Joel Osment),you are getting closer to the core of the movie.Additonally,the twist end is classic and be the moment you will find why this movie has been rolled into the Top 250,it's generally accepted by most our audience friends.The doctor(Willis) eventually waked up and knows where he belongs to and it's also time for leaving resulting from the inter-belief of Cole,who is always haunted by the ghost in his world.Cole is the only hope for these ghosts to appease themselves, M. Night Shyamalan reveals the two aspect of human character simultaneously,the ugliness and the beauty with the help of the successful figure of Cole.The clues in the movie are invaluable,with which you may totally understand the whole subject of this movie,the mind of M. Night Shyamalan whose conception is of a little bit audacity and breakthrough.It may not be the best film in dozens of years,however,it does hit a lot of people both mentally and physically,encourage people's normal life!!

807,aceofspades96,"Good movie, but not ingenious.",7,12 March 2015,"I had a good time watching this film. It had a good plot, and the acting was definitive. This and signs, which will come out two years after this film, are the only two shyamalan films that have impressed me. The plot summed up is that an impeccable child psychologist is gunned down by one of his old patients. A year later, the psychologist appears to have made a full recovery. He meets an emotionally unstable boy, who appears to have a few mental, and social problems. After meeting the boy, he learns that he has a secret dark gift: he is able to see dead people.The acting was great. For being only 11 years old in this film, Haley Joel Osment did a fantastic job portraying an outcast, who is terrified of his own shadow. Definitely one of the more talented child actors of this era in film. Bruce Willis did a fantastic job of playing a workaholic psychologist, who is in some marital problems. His reaction to the uncovered secret at the end of the film was almost perfect, until after he calmed down. That one scene ruined his performance for almost the entire movie.The cinematography was up to par, but up to par only. It really wasn't anything game changing, or ground breaking. These are the old cinematic tricks, and I feel that these are the only thing that Shyamalan knows. Close ups, hand helds, and gods eyes over and over again. It was done well with what he had, but it was really bland after a while. Considering most people don't watch a movie for its cinematography, I can't really take off a star for that.The writing. Okay here we go. Some of you may hate me, some of you may love me. This is 16 years after the film was released. I will say that for the time, this was a good plot twist and almost something new. Just because the famous plot twist at the end was new, doesn't mean it was good. It really was kind of expected and didn't surprise me at all. We see a lot of clichés in this movie. Single mom with two jobs, emotionally unstable social outcast with a secret gift, workaholic with marriage problems, bully who is superior in every way ends up being the outcast in the end, and so on. It's fine that he uses them in his writing, but they just don't impress anyone in the end. Oh here we go again! The elephant in the room. The ending. The plot twist at the end. He was dead all along! Gasp!* but not really. Yes it was clever for him to be dead the whole time, but he made the clues too obvious. He never talks to anyone, his wife never makes eye contact, he almost always wears the same clothes, nobody acknowledges he's even there. I mean for gods sake, the dude was shot in his kidney. You pretty much knew he was dead when Cole said he saw dead people. The twist was delivered horribly as well. The ring falls on the floor. okay? So she had his ring? Who talks in their sleep like that anyways? You're telling me that in all the time that he spent away from his wife, he didn't notice that everybody was ignoring him? Nobody heard a kid talking to air since normal people can't see ghosts? This is a very noteworthy paradox that nobody seems to address. Why didn't the boy tell him that he was dead? Surely he could see that the counselor was dead, so why didn't he tell him? Why wasn't he afraid? Why was he scared when he said he was getting a new counselor? He wasn't talking to a counselor in real life anyways. Another thing, is this seriously the only case that a child psychologist deals with? You see at the beginning, he has a folder full of cases, and this is the only one he is dealing with?Overall, I think the movie was a very creative, very fun ride from start to finish. I just see lots of plot holes. This was a great film for its time, but to me, this film is not something that I will remember forever, and it is not staple in film. For the repeated plot holes, and poor clichés, I take off 3 stars.",The Sixth Sense
808,sassonlonner,Shyamalan's Best,9,2 May 2018,"The Sixth Sense without a doubt is the best work of M. Night Shyamalan I have ever seen (I haven't seen all of his movies for a reason). The Sixth Sense is my second favorite horror movie I have ever seen, following Kubrick's The Shining. Although I do believe The Sixth Sense is the most frightening horror film I have ever seen, making me jump even after seeing it a handful of times. The movie isn't exactly a jumpscare kind of movie, but I think it has some of the most brilliant jumpscares I have ever seen. My favorite being while Cole stands in the bathroom in the middle of the night, and we see the lower body of a woman abruptly walk past the doorway when we were under the impression he was alone. Also, the scene where he hides from the young girl is terrifying, actually making me think of the young girls from The Shining. Of course, the best part of the movie indeed is the ending. The plot twist of this film is truly up there with some of the most brilliant plot twists of all time like those from Hitchcock in Vertigo and Psycho. Watching the film a second time is truly crucial for this film, because Shyamalan is so good at covering up the ending, you totally will miss every single clue you are given, despite the clues being EVERYWHERE. Malcolm never once talks to any other person the entire film other than Cole. As much as you may convince yourself he was talking with his wife, think again, because every time he approached him, she did not say a word to him. She mumbles a word or two under her breath a few times, but these words are not directed towards anyone. On top of that, Cole numerous times describes the traits he has learned about ghosts in his time seeing them, and his descriptions so perfectly describe Malcolm's character. The movie truly does bring one of the most brilliant plot twists ever, but unfortunately Shyamalan hasn't brought us much more since.",The Sixth Sense

I was also confused about so much effort being put into establishing the presence of spirits in the child's apartment, but when the plot was expanded to him 'listening' to them he instead seeks out another, entirely new character.

Every cast member is in perfect tune with the director's mission here. Bruce Willis, Toni Collette and Olivia Williams play each role beautifully, in service to Shyamalan's story. Haley Joel Osment, as the psychic child Cole, and Donnie Wahlberg, as a homicidal psychotic, deliver two of the years' most powerful performances.This is another of those films about which the less said about plot, the better.  Suffice to say there are thrills and chills but no gratuitous violence of any kind.  This may be one of the least melodramatic ""ghost"" pictures in the history of cinema.

I have a young friend 20 years old who is a university student - he lent me this film -  and he never saw ""Dr. Strangelove"" nor ""South Pacific"" among others!!!!!!A good film, a great ending but hardly one of the all-time best!!

Now I don't know that I would have chosen it for an Oscar, but when I discovered it was nominated, I got a small tingle of satisfaction that it made it.

Night Shyamalan, I'll get right to the point of my review: no, Sixth Sense is not a good movie.  It is a mass of poorly-joined, generally pointless fluff, punctuated by a hilariously-contrived and completely predictable ""twist.""  This is unfortunate, because due to the weakness of the material surrounding it, the entire production sinks or swims on the strength of that one plot twist.Ergo, A. If you figure it out before it happens, B. If somebody spoils it for you, or C. You're not surprised by anything in movies, then the film is absolutely worthless.Shyamalan does get bonus points for creating a creepy-as-hell atmosphere--but creepy atmosphere doesn't make a good movie.  The Sixth Sense lacks quality character development, decent performances (Bruce Willis is flat, as is Haley Joel Osment), and a plot that is involving, or at least coherent.  In place of these key factors is merely a series of unrelated events, each of which inevitably--and predictably--ends in a telegraphed ""boo!"" moment, complete with an atonal stab of music and a jumpy edit.  Fine for the Scream crowd, but I look for a little more intelligence in my horror movies.",The Sixth Sense
829,lilextreme,Possibly 1 of the last great original films :(,9,26 June 2019,"I am writing this review long long after this movie had been released so I will try to stick to my feelings at the time I watched it.
It definitely started a new & exciting trend in movies but it also made it more difficult for future movies to surprise(?) us as successfully.
However I really didn't enjoy this movie the first time I watched it and even watched it again to look for certain things that I may have missed. This is something I rarely do (re-watch).
It was a very good classic horror story that kept me entertained and I enjoyed watching till the end.
Almost all horror...etc.. movies nowadays have very disappointing endings,( and I use the term ""ending"" very very loosely)..
it's like they just decide to stop filming after realizing they didn't know how to conclude anything & basically wasted our time watching a story that went nowhere while spitting out the usual BS excuse "" we wanted to leave it up to you the user to decide what happens"" , which basically explains nothing.I felt like the sixth sense left me with an extremely satisfying conclusions and The overwhelming excitement to discuss it with others. If you are one of the very, very few people who has not watched or heard of this movie, then first of all ...""WoW!!!"" You're lucky if you getting to watch it for the first time without any info about it & second, if you are planning to watch this soon, I suggest you do so without really reading too much about it or letting others who've already seen it, tell you much about it.As for the film itself, I really enjoyed the story, the entire unfolding, the acting and basically everything else. It did a great job of keeping me engaged and pretty much stuck to the story without adding unnecessary scenes for nothing more then shock value or filler.
It's definitely become a cult classic and my only regret is not being able to see it for the first time again....
I feel as though this was sadly one of the last decent movies in at least the last decade or so.
it's so obviously only about money now... instead of quality storytelling.
There are many extremely talented people out there who are MORE than capeable of creating amazing films, but most likely they'll never be given the chance to express their work Because Hollywood is too crowded for ""unknown"" & unproven talent..So until them we will keep getting these generic scripts or consistent rewrites from the people with the ""big names"" that make money.

Bruce Willis was badly miscast. With so many close-ups the part needed an actor with a greater range who can convey tension subtly and convincingly and not the one dimensional comic book action hero looks with the acting ability of a turnip. Bruce Willis trying ever so hard to be restrained is like torture to watch. Even the much-hyped ending is not so difficult to predict. Too many sub-plots with the dead people cropping up here and there with little point except to try and scare the audience - a hand shooting out from under a table - is all old hat.

NO PLOT addition at all! He just HAD to stick his face in the film. He asks the mother if she beat the kid, when we all KNOW she didn't.. did he think that was a unique plot twist? Ye gods! Ok I will admit the final twist did get me. But really folks.. it's a creampuff of a twist when compared to the Usual Suspects or the japanese film, Audition (1999).

840,nitehawk-8,"Great acting, but see Blair Witch if you want a scare...",8,25 August 1999,"I recently saw this movie after many of my friends and acquaintances showered it with compliments. Keep in mind that this is after I've already seen Blair Witch, which was incredible (not to mention terrifying).
The Sixth Sense's shining star (say that 5 times fast) was Haley Joel Osment, who played a leading role as Cole Sear. This young actor is BRILLIANT. It always gets me when certain children can grasp the rules of the stage so easily. I was stunned by his incredible performance as the troubled boy, Cole Sear, who ""sees dead people"" and who is passed off as schizophrenic or delusional. He can trust no psychologist, and his paranoia has many reasons.An award-winning psychologist, however, slowly wins this boy's trust. Bruce Willis, playing Dr. Malcolm Crowe, actually surprised me in the nature of his performance. Yes, we all know Bruce Willis as the blood-and-grime-streaked action hero-- but in The Sixth Sense, he is uncharacteristically good as this very caring psychologist, who is marred by a terrible tragedy. (I cannot reveal what this is or I'd spoil an important part of the movie.)Malcolm is so dedicated to his work as a child psychologist that he begins to forget about spending time with his wife, and having a life of his own again. This may seem trite and overdone in most movies, but is a serious problem in real life and is portrayed fairly well here. Cole must convince Malcolm to help him (believing Malcolm is the only one who will be able to rid him of the ghosts) but this forces Dr. Crowe to decide between his work with Cole... or his own family.M. Night Shyamalan did well with the plot in that it hasn't been done much before, but the movie absolutely did not succeed in being scary (if that was his intent). It was so utterly obvious when something frightening was going to happen, because the music would increase in volume up until the event for somewhere around a whole minute. It wasn't even FUNNY, like in Scream. I do usually like James Newton Howard's scores; ER, The Fugitive and Flatliners are wonderful, but I guess it's not really his fault he had to do some of the things he did in Sixth Sense. This blatant, failed attempt at suspense totally brought my rating of this movie down, just because it was so overdone. There were a few tear-jerking minutes in the movie, and the ending was actually a little surprising (the ONLY suspenseful part in the movie). There's a big ""yeah, right"" factor in certain parts as well, think about it if you've seen the movie. Overall though, I'd say it was a fairly good movie, especially because of young Mr. Osment. He is destined for great things... I'd rate this movie a 7 out of 10.",The Sixth Sense
841,MyPetMongoose,***SPOILER!***,8,7 March 2000,"If you haven't seen the movie and would like to without any plot points revealed stop reading right now.  I'd also advise you to see the movie before you read any other reviews for that matter.The Sixth Sense is one of the best thrillers in recent years.  I didn't find it scary in the least, but the movie was so well made it blows most of the competition out of the water.  There are two areas in which it excels: acting and direction.  The acting is first rate.  And its not the flashing kind of Al Pacino acting that gets all the attention either--just quiet, powerful understated performances from Willis, Osment and Collette that make you believe everything you see on the screen.  Shaymalan's direction is fabulous, especially during the ""ghost scenes"" in which he has the ghosts move at the corners of the frame without focusing directly on them.  Its a nice break from the shot-for-shot slasher film clones that we're getting so much of these days.Of course, then there's the ending.  As soon as I heard that there was a suprise ending I said to myself ""Hey, Bruce Willis is going to be a ghost."" Given rules for ghosts set up in the films I knew Bruce Willis would only interact with the kid.  And as scene by scene went by I was proven right (even through some clever direction to force assumnptions upon the viewer--such as the anniversary scene).  So the ending came as no surprise to me, but even without the third act's dramatic revelation, I found myself captivated by the movie.  Definately one of 1999's best surprises.",The Sixth Sense

843,ross-41,huh.... OK,6,14 October 1999,"Truly a masterpiece of presentation and cinema mechanics,.. but lacking anything  outside of the performance of the kid.  I hate to do this, but if you compare this to Blair Witch, this is not a horror flick.  This is a ghost flick with above average production values. If you don't already know the ending, you will stand a chance at getting some ""magic"", but it is predictable if you pay attention to details.The sad part is that this movie is getting so much hype because of disasters like The Haunting, and because of the anti-hype over Blair Witch.

There is clever use of psycholological suspense, coupled with some genuinely disturbing images. The story unfolds at an unhurried pace which works well to build the necessary atmosphere for what is about to happen. The dead enter quickly, catching the audience with a sharp change of pace. Of particular note was the way that the audience is asked to identify with them. We are asked not to turn our heads away in fear but to follow them... a great technique which tends to take us deeper into our own fear! The story may be flawed, the suspension of disbelief stretched, but this is nonetheless a gem in its genre.

847,whitepe,I did not know exactly what to expect,9,21 February 2000,"When I initially entered the movie theater to watch The Sixth Sense, I did not know exactly what to expect.  I liked the genre in general, and I had heard good reviews about this film from people I knew.  However, I did not expect it to be nearly as good as it was.Several elements made this film a success: the plot, the acting, the special effects, and the filming staff.First, the plot was excellent.  It was well thought out, and I was not expecting the ending.  Usually, I find most films lately to be predictable with minimal plot and a high dependency on special effects and explosions to sell themselves.  This film was different.  It led you one way only to let you know at the very end that your perception of the situation was way off course.  The plot had enough twists and turns to keep me interested in seeing more, and I actually watched it a second time a week later just to catch everything that I had missed the first time.The acting was excellent.Haley Joel Osment puts forth an excellent, believable performance as the tormented Cole Sear who claims that he ""can see dead people.""  His performance is so real that you forget that he is acting.  He definitely is a young actor with a lot of potential, and I hope he wins the Best Supporting Actor award for this movie.Bruce Willis shows his full range of acting abilities in this film as well. He portrays a Dr. Malcolm Crowe, successful child counsellor who is troubled by the fact that he ultimately failed on one of his former patients.  He is using Cole Sear, a young boy with similar problems, as a way to (in his mind) compensate for his former failure.  Bruce Willis should have been nominated for Best Actor for this film.Toni Collette does an excellent job as Lynn Sear, Cole's mom.  She deserves to receive the Best Supporting Actress award.  She portrays a mother who is perplexed by her son's unwillingness to communicate with her and by her perceived lack of esteem in her mother's eyes.Olivia Williams also does a great job as Anna Crowe.  She believably portrays a wife who is depressed by her seemingly degenerating relationship with her husband, Dr. Malcolm Crowe.Donnie Walhberg's brief (pardon the pun!) cameo at the beginning of the film is spooky to watch as well.The special effects of the film were well done.  The film really built up suspense in various key parts.  The makeup and props for the dead people were done very well.Finally, the staff did a good job making this movie.  M. Night Shyamalan did a good job directing this film.  The music complemented its respective scenes very well.Overall, this is a good film with lots of philosophical depth.

Children have such difficulty in opening up when they believe that the kind of problem they have will make them look like a freak or may cause anxiety to their parents.Its very noble in a way and shows the purity of the heart and deep caring children have for their parents. Haley Osment is a gifted actor who has carried the role superbly. No need to say how Bruce baby did.. he was flawless as always But it must be said that EVERY single performer in this movie was flawless as well because without that, the movie would never have been so enormously intriguing & yet so moving and absorbing.One piece of advice,.. don't leave this movie for even a minute to get some popcorn.",The Sixth Sense

The little boy sees dead people in his dreams and it happens very often.  One word of advise is you should go see this movie because it's better than what you expect.,The Sixth Sense
858,phoenix_100,Delicate and restrained,9,3 January 2011,"The Sixth Sense, was, as I first thought, a ghost story, but I was wrong; the movie is centered around human morals and emotions. Throughout the movie, there are only a few scenes that could be said as 'scary', however for the most part, the audience, is skillfully directed between the dialogue and emotions from Dr. Malcolm Crow and Cole Sear. The film for the most part is delicately restrained, and at times when the film climaxes it could have turned into a blood fest, however M. Night Shyamalan skillfully restrained this. Shyamalan creates a wonderfully dark yet surreal setting to the movie, introducing the relationship and trust between Dr. Malcolm Crow and Cole Sear developing at a realistic pace.What I liked about this movie was that apart from several scenes, there were barely any scenes that were horrifying, but instead, Shyamalan focuses the film instead on the dialogue between Malcolm and Cole. The film, moves at a slow, steady pace - just enough for the audience to totally absorb what's happening, and want another scene. The movie has stellar acting by Bruce Willis (as the slightly depressed child psychiatrist) who played his role perfectly. Another stellar performance was by Haley J. Osment, as his role of Cole. His maturity for the role, and well delivered lines are a far contrast from the typical whiny/annoying kids who act now - the line between cute and funny, to whiny and annoying is now very, very small.This film, which moves at a steady pace, will be extremely rewarding to anyone who wants to wait the one hour fifty minute duration time. The main story and the ending were well written, and acted. This film highlights a beautiful haunting score, by James Newton Howard, brilliant directing and a magnificent script by Shyalaman. This movie strongly deserves a 9 out of 10.",The Sixth Sense
859,ToadofTruth,Predictable,6,21 April 2019,"I just watched it for the first time ever (2019). It's well-acted, it's not a bad film, but the ""twist"" is predictable very early on in the film. It goes exactly where you thought it would go, therefore leaving you feeling a bit disappointed at the end and kind of like, ""Is that it?"".Maybe I had to watch it in the 90s to be shocked.",The Sixth Sense
860,boclani,"Sight, sound, smell, taste, touch and see dead people",10,23 November 2016,"Watch more reviews like this at https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfNozbWd9SJYYwLK2zYn_AAThe Sixth Sense is about Malcolm (played by Bruce Willis) who is a child psychologist. He is assigned to help Cole (Haley Joel Osment), a child who can ""see dead people."" The surprise ending to ""The Sixth Sense"" has got a lot of attention and it has overshadowed the rest of the film. I'll talk about the twist, but it is only a part of what makes up the film. The twist in ""The Sixth Sense"" is particularly clever, it's not fun if a twist is impossible to predict. It is just as important that the twist makes sense. And surprising. I've seen a few movie twists and some are surprising, but don't make any sense, because the director didn't provide enough hints. It is incredible that these scenes can be seen in many different ways after the twist is revealed. The movie is effective because it works on this basic level. What makes ""The Sixth Sense"" moving is that it never cheats. Everything we see is real, and feels real, real meetings, conversations, and its our assumptions that fool us. Illusions are scattered throughout the film and that is what Shyamalan is when he directed this movie, an illusionist.Real horror is The Sixth Sense, events that could happen. Instead of excessive violence, nudity, lazy jump scares, boo, ah. The Sixth Sense looks at, separation, depression, bullying. Sad things, scary things to happen to you in real life. A scene when they attend a funeral with a disturbing video tape was frightening. Now when you hear that, you may think, some gory old woman will give us a fake jumpscare, no. No gore, no jumpscares. Movies are missing out on this in recent years, yes the jumpscare will startle you because its unexpected, but it's a scary face and / or a loud noise. This is a touching moment when a father realises a terrifying secret of why his daughter died. Because this is a non spoiler review I will just say that it is brilliantly directed and pure terrifying.You could just watch this movie if you love the craft of acting because Osment puts on one of the greatest acting performances by a child that cinema has ever seen. Malcolm, his wife and Cole's mother are all brilliant in this and believable. A scene near the end of the movie, between mother and son, finally understanding each other, it was so beautiful.Now when I think of a horror film, I think of R rating movies, jumpscares, monsters and gore. I was really surprised that a movie as upsetting as ""The Sixth Sense"" wasn't given a restricted rating.It was great watching this movie when I did, I just watched The Visit, another film of Shyamalan.I have never seen a moving picture that has had this much attention to detail. The director removed certain colours from scenes to create different effects so it made sense in the long term. This movie shows that when you make a great horror movie you will be rewarded with the money you so desperately want. It is great to see people come together and create something incredible and do their job. The ending adds more interest after the movie concluded, and I was searching up all the easter eggs straight after. But that isn't the only way you can enjoy this film. This is one of my favourite horror films. Like all good horror films, ""The Sixth Sense"" lets suspense build. I said it before and I'll say it again. It doesn't rely on excessive violence, blood and gore, or cheap jump scares. It has terrific acting, story, pace, messages, hidden messages! This is a movie that will not be taken from its rightful place as the best horror film of all time and if you were like me and pondering on the idea of see it. Go see it, anyway you can, it's a movie you need to see before you die, and before someone ruins it for you, go and watch the movie!

861,andy_krysiak,"Hugely Powerful, Mind-Boggling Thriller",10,26 April 2016,"For anyone who has no background knowledge at all surrounding this movie, it is hard to discuss The Sixth Sense without spoilers, but I'll try my best.This is by far one of my favorite films from the 1990's, if not one of my favorite films ever. Throughout the entire film, you get a very powerful feeling of suspense that simply leaves you craving for what's next. The Sixth Sense leaves you guessing one more thing after the next, and then completely turns your beliefs around and practically alters the movie's reality. It hooks you right from the start, with an opening scene that will leave you questioning what in the world just happened. But as the story unravels, things piece together and your jaw will drop multiple times.It is also difficult to talk about this film without at least mentioning the affect of its ending. The Sixth Sense has one of the most unexpected and powerful endings of any movie I've ever seen. When it pieces every detail together at its end, you may still be thinking about it 3 hours after watching it. It's movie making at its best.Before M. Night Shyamalan made crap like The Happening and The Last Airbender, he made some truly powerful films. The Sixth Sense is one of those films, and it is undoubtedly a movie experience you have to witness before you die.Rating: A+",The Sixth Sense
862,ycho-29371,I see dead people....,10,29 May 2017,"The Sixth Sense was M. Night Shyamalan's first directorial debut to the wide open of his career to an extension which has now become shameless regarding the outcome of the films that are usually involved in the genre of action and heavy blockbuster which clearly isn't the precise type of films to write and direct. Nowadays, M. Night Shyamalan's name has become a joke by ruining a famous cartoon Avatar or The Last Airbender in an attempt in making a live action which was a major failure. Addition, after 3 years he has both written and directed a film called After Earth which was a very mediocre-ish bland, dull, and especially a pointlessly boring action flick. However, retracing the films of M. Night's early years of his career it seems in a way that is completely in the opposite of the position that is held by him these days. The Sixth Sense follows a tale of a very young 9-year-old child who is extraordinarily different compared to the fellow kids around his age. When adults think of 9-year-old kids, they are exceedingly cute, and just wanna squeeze their cheeks. However, Cole (Haley Joel Osment) in this film the main protagonist is explicitly the opposite. He is unusually well educated according to the fact that he has no father at home and him only family member he has obtained is his mother named Lynn Sear (Toni Collette). Cole has an extraordinary talent in which he can communicate with ghosts, dead people and he is continually threatened by the unheated beings who he considers wants to drag him to the dread tension and harsh conditions of his life. While he may not be solely correct. In fact, he says ""I see dead people, they want me to do things for them"" which may lead to a supportive help to a young girl who has passed out from the outcome from his mother as she poisoned her all the way and this shocking event has been leaked to the father of the dead girl. Aside from the interesting and original plot, the performances are peril excellent. Especially, Cole played by Haley Joel Osment gives one of the best young child performances in cinema history. The role in this film is deeply different regarding other child roles, which requires a subtle, thoughtful, and an immense dramatical act. Haley Joel Osment is fully engaged within the character as he is phenomenal and proves himself to be the most talented child actor from his age group. He has been nominated for an Oscar which is fabulously arduous for most actors and especially the ones from his young age. He is by far the most considerable best aspect of this film that elevates it's heightened of the creation more further. Toni Collette is very realistic and relinquishes a very convincing act of the mother of the threatened son Cole. The story continues as Cole gets/seeks help from a disheartened child psychologist Malcolm Crowe (Bruce Willis). Dr. Malcolm Crowe is a sad character who is disheartened by the loss of his wife's caring and love from an incident that happened a few months in which a patient of his previous years visits his estate, and shoots Malcolm a serious one shot through his body which still remains the separation of himself and his wife. It remains a big wound striking his heart and emotions. As he takes on an assignment to help this young child, he assumes the relationship with his wife will improve. Before Bruce Willis's attempt on fetching this role, he was regarded as an action star. People in 1999 though this type of subtle, quiet and passionate role would not fit his vital character. As a result, this stereotype was broken as he committed fully to this quiet, caring, loving role as a child psychiatrist. He is marvelous and astonishingly well acted in terms of this type of role as he was famous for absurd, loud cursing characters. As a fact, he has been supportive to Shyamalan in taking this role seriously as it makes the finest performance within Bruce Willis's career of acting. The Sixth Sense is utterly and terrific in the cause of the shocking ending twist added into the film. This film is also well known and praised in terms of the extra addition of the fabulous unpredictable twist that reshapes the understanding of the film as it recalls for repetitive viewings. Personally, I definitely agree as a fact it does not exceedingly cheat its own rules that were set up, and immensely reveals it sudden and quiet making it inspirational and well thought- out. Originally, the screenplay of The Sixth Sense was sold for $ 100 million around Hollywood. Unlike other Shyamalan films, this film is doubtlessly his best work throughout his whole career and a very clever and unquestionably genius filmmaking. The Sixth Sense is one of the most inspirational and a masterpiece of our decade that is precisely original and creates subtle, shocking and peril tension that makes the audiences grip to sweat and tears. This film does have the horror elements but it is more of a light-hearted, quiet drama surrounding the two main protagonists Cole and Malcolm. Lots of meanings expressed by colors and lots of themes to discover and to be analyzed. This is an undoubtedly pure genius filmmaking and the finest work of Shyamalan. Grade: A+",The Sixth Sense
863,Immy,The Buzz Flick of 1999,10,9 September 1999,"Every year there's a movie that comes out of nowhere and wows the film community (in 1998 it was ""There's Something About Mary""). The refreshing thing about this year's sleeper smash ""The Sixth Sense"" is that all thepraise is for THE STORY. This more than anything proves that an intelligent, thought-provoking screenplay can pack 'em in just as well as car crashes, spaceships and semen jokes. I haven't been this blindsided by a plot twist since ""The Crying Game."" A second viewing creates an almost entirely different film. Superb!",The Sixth Sense
864,Charlie-67,One Of The Finest Movies I've Ever Seen!,10,20 August 1999,"The Sixth Sense was exactly the kind of movie I needed on this rainy, August evening!

866,survivor-2,what's all the brouhaha?,5,22 February 2000,"that's right why???? what is so good about this film? I can't figure it out for the life of me. Well I can. The ending is. and the little hints pointing to it during the film. And Haley Joel Osmont, he's good. But the oscar nods (apart from HJO) simply go against all belief. Best film??????? please. Best script. How obvious. people see the ending and the hints (the script was probably written with the ending in mind, so the hints are easy to place) But what they fail to see is that apart from those the script is decidedly average at best, with forced or sometimes outright bad dialogue, and hardly any excitement at all. And then there's directing. This gets a directing nod???? this kitschy oh I dunno. It just makes me mad that this average and kitschy directing gets nominated when Paul Thomas Anderson does not. And finally Toni Colette. She annoyed me the whole film. Every scene with her was like the ultimate proof of what I said before. (though that might have been her dialogues as well, butr even then, just look at Angela Bassett in Strange Days to see just how overblown and absurd dialogue can still be made great - Can you imagine 'I see the earth opening up and swallowing us all' sound believable? It did there, Toni Colette doesn't even come close)But now don't get me wrong, I don't think the sixth sense is a bad film. It's just ... average on all accounts. and if you already know how it's going to end, well it's not even worth a rental anymore :(",The Sixth Sense
867,Incubus-5,The Most Surprisingly Entertaining Movie I've Seen In Years,9,10 August 1999,"First, I am not a fan of Bruce Willis movies (Except for the first Die Hard). People may remember that when Willis did that movie they did not think he would be able to pull it off because they were so used to the character he played in Moonlighting. Well, I'm sure that by now most people will admit that he can handle an action movie with no problem. But keeping in mind that people didn't think he could do it back then, why are people surprised to now see him playing a more intelligent role (ala Moonlighting)?Willis' portrayal of ""Dr. Malcomb Crowe"" was flawless. With a depth of character rarely seen by ""action movie actors"", Willis manages to be a fully believable ""average guy"" in The Sixth Sense, giving what may be his finest performance to date. Accepting this role may surprise people as much as Mel Gibson playing Hamlet, but he plays the part with no less style or skill than Gibson used in the Shakespearian classic.Having said that, Willis does NOT put on the best performance in this movie. (Sorry Bruce) Haley Joel Osment, who plays Cole Sear, is astounding. Child Actors do not typically have the experience to play the role of someone as psychologically disturbed as Cole. Not so in this case. Haley makes you believe that he has experienced everything his character has with every tear shed and look of horror on his face. If there was ever an actor who deserved recognition in the form of an Oscar, Osment is in the running.Some critics claim the movie is slow moving, and in a way it is. At least if you can consider starting a movie with a madman breaking into the house and shooting the leading man in the gut as ""slow moving"". The Sixth Sense is not as fast paced as some movies, but in that is much of the movie's appeal. Since it is less ""in-your-face"" than your typical horror/thriller it has a much better chance to get ""in-your-mind"". And getting in your mind is what this movie is all about.In an era where horror movies are all about high budget special effects and large gnashing teeth, The Sixth Sense is very subdued. You are lulled into complacency and then brought to the edge without a moments warning, and all with a class and style that lets you know the Hitchcock style of film making is still very much alive.This movie wraps itself up neatly with a plot twist to make the writers and producers of The Game green with envy. The final scene answers questions you did not even know needed asking. You leave the theater knowing you will never be able to feel the same way about life and death.If the Blair Witch Project will make you afraid to go into the woods, The Sixth Sense will make you afraid to ever be alone.",The Sixth Sense
868,Grifter84,Don't talk!,9,7 October 1999,"Before I make any comments on the quality of this film, I must first ask, nay plead, that those of you who know the secret not tell anyone who hasn't yet seen it.  Guard your comments when talking to those in the know, because you never know who might just be passing by that you spoil it for.  I know how much it hurts, for the secrets to both 'The Crying Game' and 'The Usual Suspects' were given away to me by so-called friends.That out of the way, I must say that 'The Sixth Sense' is as almost perfect film.  Bruce Willis acts masterfully in a role that one at first might think him mis-cast for and Haley Joel Osment puts in a performance far superior to much of the adult acting I have seen in recent years.  It has been a long time since a child has been called to play such a difficult role, and I can't control my dismay that he was not cast as Anakin Skywalker in the newest Star Wars episode.  Of course, Jake Lloyd might have done just as well under the awesome skill of writer/director M. Night Shymalan.  The story is meticulously crafted, and the ending is a true mind-blower.

Always have been. He just isn't too careful with the roles he takes sometimes (Hudson Hawk, anyone?). That, plus this reminded me of that other movie he did about the autistic kid and the government codes and all that fun stuff. Well, this is most definitely NOT that movie! I could not have been more pleasantly surprised by this film. I truly enjoyed everything about it, from the slowly building chills to the Keyser Soze twist of an ending (I never saw it coming!) But I was most pleasantly surprised by the performance of Haley Osment as Cole. This kid was stunning. It is a rare thing to see such an emotionally honest performance from one so young. Two things kept going through my mind as I watched this kid: One, he deserves at least an Academy Award nomination. (yes, he was THAT good!) And two, this kid SHOULD have been Anakin in that earlier summer movie that claimed to be about a phantom. If you're looking for some special effects laden horror movie, go see the Haunting. If you're looking for a few REAL chills, great acting all around and a great story...see this movie!",The Sixth Sense

873,ech,"Intriguing and suspenseful, Sixth Sense keeps your heart beating and mind working.",9,16 August 1999,"I was thoroughly impressed with this film.  The only film I can think of that ""Sixth Sense"" can be compared to is ""The Shining"", and it comes off rather well in that comparison. Haley Osment gives what is probably one of the best child performances I have ever seen.  His character is believable and you can empathize with him quite strongly.  He does a terrific job portraying a bright child with a very traumatic gift. The film is filled with subtleties.  Unless you are fully alert while watching the film, you are bound to miss things, just as in any good mystery.  I know, I did.  It was only in retrospect that the group I was with could recall all the details we had missed at the time.Another aspect of the film is how well it hangs together.  Credit is due to Shyamalan for his excellent writing and directing (the cameo was a bit much). The film takes you into a riveting and almost surreal world.  It makes you question the world around you.  The cinematography and perspective makes the film very real.  I nearly jumped out of my seat several times during the film, and from the jerking throughout the audience, I was far from alone. An excellent and compelling film.",The Sixth Sense

I was lying flat on my back and sat up straight when it happened. If I could've seen my own face I can bet I would have never looked more bewildered than that moment. To me sixth sense was a good movie with superb acting and great direction five minutes before it ended. After those five minutes it transformed into a classic worthy of an Oscar nomination. It definitely has one of the best ends ever in the cinematic history.Bruce Willis has taken a leap from being a good actor to being a great one. His talents were utilized to hilt by the debutante director M. Night Shyamalan. Bruce has proven that there is much more in him than we saw in action flicks like Die Hard series and Last Boy Scout.  It will be unfair not to nominate him for the Oscar. There haven't been too many performances better than his, this year. But of course the revelation is Haley Joel Osment. He has given a gem of a performance so early in his career. The fear, the confusion, the lack of confidence, was portrayed in a manner that cannot be faulted. Its amazing how someone so young can firstly understand, and then deliver such a complex character. Full marks to him for giving probably the best juvenile performance ever. (Apologies to all those Home Alone lovers) And finally lets talk about M. Night Shyamalan. There could be no better way to start a career. He has made an ideal first move in what should be a long shining career. He knows his job well but most importantly one can't help feeling that this is a film made by someone who has thought, ate, slept this one for ages. It must have been really close to his heart and it shows. Lets keep our fingers crossed that he won't be a one-film wonder.",The Sixth Sense

And no one can possibly have forseen the unforgettable endingHowever, the movie is a far cry from ""Brilliant!"" or ""Masterpiece!"" status. At times very slow-moving, it centers too much on the little boy's supernatural encounters, incidents and not nearly enough on the effect it has on the people around him. The plot is not well-developed enough. It seems that Bruce Willis' character decides ""ooooh if you help them, they will go away."" He does, and they go away. Very sappy and forgettable.Haley Joel does give a good performance for someone of his age, and Willis is crucial in his supporting role.

Yet, a movie I could see again and again and enjoy more and more, having gotten over a strong initial shock. A GREAT MOVIE! See it and experience a once in a lifetime event. Then see it again without being shocked by the ending and enjoy the story content, as well as the performances---even more!",The Sixth Sense
884,TomAyles,"Gripping, edge-of-the-seat thriller.",9,26 April 2001,"This is what all horror movies should be -- thrilling and suspenseful, without the gore and scantily clad babes that generally define the genre. Bruce Willis turns in one of his finest performances as a psychologist helping a young boy who believes he can see ghosts.  If you like Hitchcock, you'll like this film.  Just thinking about it gives me chills!",The Sixth Sense
885,snlfan3300,A Fantastic Movie,10,7 May 2002,"I love this movie!  The Sixth Sense features everything that an excellent movie should feature--great acting, writing, directing, and cinematography. Actually, the cinematography was so good, that I actually didn't catch most of it until future viewings of the movie.  Haley Joel Osment and Bruce Willis were both stunning.  I was especially impressed with Haley Joel Osment, because he is so young, and so believable.The Good:  The plot is incredible.  To me, The Sixth Sense has one of the best plots.  The writer did a fine job as well as the director.  The plot is so disturbing, original, and twisted.  It's great.  Like I said before, the cinematography is among the best.  The Sixth Sense is jammed with hints and clues as how the movie will end, but most people never realize they're seeing them.  To me, that's what makes a fantastic movie.  Another thing I noticed about this film is that it had great music.  The music played a very large role in the way the overall production looked.  The music is actually what scared me the most.  This movie was good in every way.The Bad:  I seriously can not find one bad thing about this movie.  There are no holes in the plot and no bad acting.  You could really tell the director made every part of the movie as detailed as possible with no loose ends.Overall:  10/10   I cannot say enough about this movie--SEE IT!",The Sixth Sense
886,trumpman30,"A good movie, but overrated.",5,20 May 2002,"*Spoilers* I can start out by saying that I am somewhat biased to this movie because I do not like child actors.  Their characters are just never believable in my opinion.  That aside, this movie was pretty well done and had an alright story to tell, but what was the overall point to it?  What was the lasting emotion or thought on the movie?  The whole movie seems to center around Bruce Willis trying to get inside the kid and get him to accept him. Seriously, this takes up almost three fourths of the movie.  Then, at the end, it seems like the director realized that he did not have very much time left in the movie and kind of threw in that last little bit about the mother poisoning the child and rushed the big climax where Bruce Willis finds out he is dead.  It seems that the entire movie had just been put together for that one twist of an ending.  The ending is very good, but an ending cannot make up for the rest of the movie.The movie does have some genuinely scary and creepy parts but for the most part seems indecisive as to whether its a drama or a horror movie. 
There are some parts where I was left questioning, ""huh?"" after watching it a second time.  I don't remember too well but did they not skip three months between the time Willis was shot and when the actual movie begin?  What was Bruce's character doing all this time and where did he think the time had gone if he truly did not know he was dead. I did not know about red being used as symbolism until they told me about it after the movie and that is probably why they put that segment at the end. No one picked up on it because it had almost nothing to do with the plot of the movie.  It's almost like the director threw that in there so he could say, ""Hey, everyone, I'm smart, I can use subtle symbolism.""  The symbolism itself is so broad that its largely ineffective for when something red appears it just has ""something to do with dead person,"" even if a dead person had just touched it or something.There are certain saving graces about this movie.  Bruce Willis turned in a good performance and it did makeyou think in some parts, but ultimately a movie that will quickly be forgotten, maybe faster if everyone would stop making parodies of it =).  Overall, not one of my favorite horror/dramas. 5/10",The Sixth Sense
887,JMan-5,Brilliant,8,3 January 2002,"M. Night Shyamalan directs this brilliant and haunting suspense about a boy ( Haley Joel Osmont) who sees dead people that don't know they are dead. Bruce Willis plays Dr. Malcolm Crowe, the child psychologist who previously failed a patient, and saw the boy as an opportunity to redeem himself. As the suspense builds towards the amazing and brilliant ending, we realize that all is not as it seems. Shyamalan did an excellent job in getting the best out of a virtually unknown cast, with Osmont doing a truly amazing performance.Willis as well gave one of his best performances ever.

888,kirbysta,In one word: Remarkable.,10,29 January 2002,"10/10!!!!Through the double doors and past the crowds of teenagers on a Friday Night I was trembling.  I had just finished seeing `The Sixth Sense' for the first time.  This movie, this genius work of cinema, had shaken my `senses' and opened my eyes into a new world of films.Brainwashed by cheesy action and sci-fi films, I had never seen such a melancholy but in some way joyous movie such as this.  Everything was perfect.  The creepy morbid sounds of the violins in the opening credits made me feel as though some life force was creeping behind my chair.  The brilliant story line, dialogue and acting as well as cinematography and original score made this film into a masterpiece.The story line was amazing.  This little boy Cole (Haley Joel Osment), an outcast, was tormented by something bizarre and out of this world.  Only one person can help him, a child therapist Dr. Malcolm Crow (Bruce Willis). 
The dialogue and acting couldn't have been better.  My favorite scene is where Osment and Willis are playing a game so that Willis can get to know Osment better.  Willis pretends to read Osment's mind so he will step forward towards a chair.  `You've never been in any real trouble,' says Willis.  Osment takes a step back.  `We had to draw a picture, anything we wanted,' says Osment.  `I drew a man, getting hurt in the neck by another man with a screw driver.'  Willis shocked replies `did you see that on TV Cole?'  `They had a meeting, mama started crying, I don't draw like that any more,' replies Osment.  `How do you draw,' questions Willis.  `Kids playing, dogs running, rainbows.'  `They don't have meetings about rainbows,' replies Osment.  Just the fact that a kid of that age could deliver dialogue like that with such power made me realize how wonderful the acting and dialogue was in this film.  Toni Collette also gave an outstanding performance as a Philadelphia mother.  I was shocked to hear her English accent when she was at the Oscars because she was so believable as Cole's mother. 
To be frank I think this is one of the best movies ever made.  The two things that really got to me were Haley Joel Osment's acting and the original score composed by James Newton Howard.  Many people have argued that the movie relies on its ending to make it a good movie.  I was pulled into the movie from the very beginning and I would still have a strong feeling about this movie even if it didn't have such a shocking ending.I am happy that a psychological thriller was nominated for best picture at the Oscars and that Haley Joel Osment was nominated for best supporting actor.  Most people thought that American Beauty was a better movie but even though I liked American Beauty, I thought `The Sixth Sense' was a better movie.

890,Funbeck-95,a truly amazing film,9,12 April 2008,"The Sixth Sense is an absolute gem, it is one of those challenging films that will stick in your mind and have you thinking about it for weeks after watching it. The plot is downright genius, it's so cleverly and precisely orchestrated that the resulting twist will just leave your jaw rightfully on the floor! The twist is so shocking, I will avoid the overwhelming temptation to give it away, watching it in ignorance will ultimately have the best effect.The cast is superb, Hollywood superstar Bruce Willis gives a refreshing change of pace performance as award winning child psychologist Dr. Malcolm Crowe. Joining him is the critically acclaimed child actor Haley Joel Osment, last seen in Artificial Intelligence. The acting talents of this young boy are phenomenal, I have never seen such powerful presence, he is mature beyond his years.Haley thoroughly deserved recognition in the form of an Oscar nomination for his role as 'Cole'; a gifted young boy with the exceptional ability of having the sixth sense. Possessing this gift however only serves to create fear in the mind of a nine year old, and scepticism in everyone around him. Cole experiences terrifying, unwanted visits from the spiritual world, which inevitably leads to his social isolation. Dr. Crowe recognises Coles behaviour, and remembers many years back when he had a patient with the same symptoms. This patient however left a painful impact on his conscience, as he was unable to help. Dr. Crowe then seeks to redeem himself by doing everything in his power to help troubled Cole.As Cole is alone in seeing and hearing these suffering spirits, it is also he who must help them rest. To do this Cole must confront his nightmare. It is only with Dr. Crowe's suggestion to listen to them, he makes the discovery that they are not there to haunt him, but instead only want his assistance in their unfinished business.With the riveting intensity you'll find thoroughly chilling and utterly forgettable, The Sixth Sense is a must see movie.The 2 disc collectors edition has wonderful special features, including exclusive interviews with the cast and writer/director.",The Sixth Sense

The final two scenes are simply the greatest scenes in movie history and im not exaggerating.The one with osment and his mother is simply heart whelming and well acted by both set of actors.

The acting is absolutely outstanding, especially young Osment. I don't ever recall seeing such a fine performance from a child actor.Bruce Willis is brilliant in this role, such a difference from those we're used to seeing him in, and Toni Collette gives a very powerful portrayal of the bewildered mother.This is such a haunting film, please excuse the pun! But that is the word for it, as it stays in your mind for long after. Even when you know the ending, the whole story is so well crafted and beautifully told, you can enjoy it all over and over.I don't think M.

Wow, Bruce Willis was dead the whole time, who would have thunk it.Shyamanalangianamam locked himself in a corner with the plot. Here he had a dead guy walking around who could only be seen by one little boy, but it had to look like he was talking with other people. So, we get Willis being ignored by his wife at a restaurant. Any other husband would have started to get suspicious when his wife also didn't acknowledge his existence when he got home that night or woke up the next morning...Then there's the scene where it appears that Willis was talking with the kid's mom. Only he can't...because he's dead.Every scene in this movie in which Willis appears to be interacting with another human is a cheat. I mean, come on, how stupid do you have to be to realize that the only person who acknowledges your existence is a kid who sees dead people!! It's bad enough that we're supposed to be shocked by the realization that Willis has been dead this whole time. But it's simply ludicrous for Willis himself to be shocked. Although, I do believe that Bruce Willis could be shocked in real life. After all, he's far too stupid and narcissistic to admit that any reality other than his own--Bush is a better President than Clinton, the Iraq war is going well, etc,--actually exists.If you think this movie is deserving of being listed as one of the 250 best movies of all time, do yourself a favor and take another look. Only this time pay attention to how the director cheats his audience.",The Sixth Sense
894,Shannon38,Ghost Story,9,1 September 2008,"M. Night Shymalan's 'The Sixth Sense' is one of his two best movies. The skill by which the development and resolution of this bizarre and chilling classic make it a modern landmark. Just by this movie alone, Night established himself as Hitchcock's successor. To describe anything more than a bare-bones rendering of the plot would be irresponsible, but here it goes... Malcolm Crow (Bruce Willis) celebrates with his wife a recent award achieved helping counsel disturbed children. Soon he meets up with the weaknesses of his past and must suffer the consequences. For the rest of the movie he has to make it all up with a new client, Cole (Haley Joel Osment) and balance his desire to make his wife his main priority. The juggle isn't easy, and he falters, but is honest, in both attempts to make up mistakes for his past. The causality of another dimension presented is disturbing, yet fascinating. The tension of the story is counterbalanced with a heart that makes more than one plot accessible and enthralling. The performances are superb with arguably Willis' best ever. Osment, for his part, plays a prodigy as a prodigy in what has to be one of the best (if not ""the"" best) childhood performances on film. The supporting cast is remarkable as well. Perhaps critics have given 'The Sixth Sense' grudging praise, for it means to unveil the supernatural in a way that is meant to mirror the real world in an unflattering way. (Psychology is rendered at least overrated.) Shymalan is effective like few directors are with a film that is edited for every second to wrap around the other expertly.

899,MoviDude,"One of the years best, if not the best.",9,28 August 1999,"I went to see the Sixth Sense with little knowledge except that it had gotten some very good word-of-mouth reactions. I hadn't even heard of it until the day it opened: I had never seen an ad or preview for it at all. Once I left the theater, my first reaction was: Wow! Writer/Director M. Night Shyamalan can be credited for a thoughtful script that deals intelligently with life and death. The performances are uniformly superb. Bruce Willis has never been regarded as much of an actor, but here he gives a nice understated performance that gives the film its weight. Toni Collette is very good as Cole's mom, frustrated over her inability to understand what her son is going through. Olivia Williams is wasted in a role that doesn't give her much to do. Donnie Wahlberg is great in his two minutes as a clinically depressed patient. Still, the film wouldn't work without the brilliant performance of little Haley Joel Osment, who gives one of the best performances of the year and perhaps one of the best child performances ever. This kid is great! He projects a great sorrow and pain in his role, and acts better than most seasoned actors. I hope that come the end of the year, he will have gotten a deserved Oscar nod.

Was this a psychological thriller?  Was this a ghost story? Was this a horror film? A scene that featured a young teen with the back of his head blown off as he turns away from the camera seemed to suggest this was a horror/ghost story type of film, but the script verged on more thoughtfullness than that. Pensive performances punctuated this schizo feeling.  The film had dangling story lines throughout - but we all admitted, the twist at the end of the movie salvaged it.  We saw a sneak preview, and the audience, too, seemed to agree with us.  Some fool brought their 7 year old child to the screening, and the kid, seemingly bored out of his mind, started tossing his hat up into the air.

After seeing it on opening weekend, I have gone to the theatre three times with the intention of seeing something else - yet everytime I have ended up seeing 6th Sense again.This is a movie of extraordinary power. It speaks to all of our human emotions and conditions: fear, uncertainty, guilt, isolation, love, hope, peace, etc...If this movie disappointed you, maybe the misleading trailer should be blamed. In my opinion, this is not a horror movie, nor is it a thriller. It's a drama with supernatural overtones. It is also the most heart wrenching love story I have ever come across.SPOILERS!!! SPOILERS!!! SPOILERS!!!!Whilst Haley Joel Osment (Cole) is absolutely magnificent, I don't agree that he played the lead, as some would suggest. Another user put it very well when she said that the movie was about one man's journey into the afterlife. It is in making this journey, that Malcolm (beautifully played by Bruce Willis) meets up with Cole, the link between the living world and the one that Malcolm now occupies. Malcolm, tormented by guilt about his failure as both a psychologist and a husband, is neither willing nor ready to let go. Ultimately, they help each other accept and understand their respective journeys. And in the process, a mother and child find each other, and a husband makes his peace with his grieving wife. ""Goodnight, Sweetheart"" is a line so filled with meaning that it will stay in my heart forever.The fact that I have seen this movie four times, obviously indicates that it was not its ending that did it for me. I got that part when I read the plotline. Rather, it's the incredible atmosphere and power of the characters' emotions that spoke to me. So if you figured out the ending and was disappointed by the rest, a second viewing may just change your mind.

910,viva-6,EITHER YOU GET IT OR YOU DON'T!,10,8 June 2000,"I posted my comments on this movie a while back, but having read some of the latest reviews, I feel compelled to add the following:
SPOILERS!!! SPOILERS!!! SPOILERS!!!
There is obviously a division here between those who loved it and those who complain about so-called plot holes or things that don't add up. (I'm EXCLUDING those users who couldn't stay awake because there were no explosions!)This film clearly operates on a metaphysical level. In my opinion, one's ability/willingness to accept this, with all its accompanying mysteries, is the key to understanding and appreciating this film. Malcolm and the other ""ghosts"" may be technically dead, but they have not yet completed their journeys into the afterlife. They are caught between the world of the living and the world of the dead. A very important aspect in this regard is Cole's crucial words to Malcolm: ""They don't know that they are dead, they only see what they want to see."" Does that mean that they think they are still alive? Not necessarily. It may simply mean that they experience their in-between-world as the real, living world. But they are not active participants in this world. They don't communicate with the living (with the exception of Cole) and they don't have the same needs as the living. Therefore the notion that Malcolm should have noticed that no-one else acknowledges his existence, as one user has suggested, is quite ridiculous. He would not have gone into a store to buy food!!! It is equally ridiculous to question the time lapse between the shooting incident and Malcolm's first meeting with Cole. What does time mean to ""ghosts""? Do they sometimes wander around aimlessly? Do they approach more than one ""gifted"" person and then move on to another if they are not helped? I don't know, and I have a suspicion you don't either.  It is also important to note that the ""ghosts"" were focused primarily on their unfinished business. They needed closure before they could move on. What was Malcolm's unfinished business? His perceived failure as a husband and therapist. So when he seeks out Cole, it is to resolve both these issues. He achieves this by helping Cole understand and accept his gift, and Cole helps him to make peace with his wife. (She believed she came second, remember?)It has also been asked why Cole isn't scared of Malcolm when he first meets him. He IS - Malcolm waits for him outside, but Cole senses his presence and starts walking faster and faster and so avoids him. But then Malcolm approaches him in the church, which is a safe sanctuary. And no, that does not necessarily mean that no other ""ghosts' ever entered the church, it only means that Cole felt safe there!! Still weary, of course, but safe. Malcolm also approached Cole differently (less threateningly) than the other ""ghosts"" did, because, I believe, part of his unfinished business had to do with Cole specifically (redemption for failing his former patient). To put it simply, he helped himself by helping Cole.As for the ""cold air breathing"" aspect: this went hand-in-hand with the intensity of the ""ghosts'"" presence. Which is why it was so pronounced when Cole was scared. That it happens at the end with Malcolm's wife, is particularly relevant. It signifies the intensity of his presence, which he reveals to her when he is ready to talk to her. He makes a connection with her and she becomes AWARE of his presence. He is then able to tell her that which he didn't tell her before he died. He can say goodbye.This, of course, is only my interpretation. But to me it makes perfect sense. And I'm glad that it does, otherwise I would have lost out on one of the most wonderful movie experiences ever!",The Sixth Sense

Where's Roald Dahl when you need him?,5,4 March 2002,"Okay, some serious spoilers, but you can't describe why this movie was bad in a ""know-what-I-mean, wink, wink"" style... Alright, not a bad movie like Armageddon (which was 'bad' in the worst meaning of the word). This film is just out of place. Nice but cliche idea, that would make a perfect 30 min. episode in the Twilight Zone. But pulling this pale story out to a full length movie? Please! The most annoying thing about this is the 8+ rating of the movie and all that hype! Best movie ever? Best plot twist ever? Oh, no! This movie was so boooring! So, Bruce Willis gets killed in the first five minutes... Why is everyone behaving so silly? Don't they know that he is dead? And that's when (about 30 minutes into the movie) you realize that you've just spoiled the movie. That should have been that awesome plot twist at the end! You silly! Since it is evident that Bruce is dead, it is rather frustrating to watch the scenes in which the director is trying to foreshadow the dark twist at the end. Banal, cliche and childish. Yawn! At least Bruce Willis is not wearing a bloody shirt this time, nice try though... I wouldn't say that this movie is bad, if only I hadn't seen some other good movies with really good and unpredictable thrilling plot twists. Yep, it can be done, if you just put a little more work in the movie instead of the commercials and adverts. If you want a good plot twist, go and watch Jacob's Ladder or Brazil or L.A. confidential!

I didn't watch it then and only rented it, because I thought, well, what if I'm actually missing something.Truth is: I probably am missing something.To me it was just plain boring.The kid played well, I thought, as for Mr. Willis. For me he works best in other, lighter movies. Music was OK, nothing overwhelming, but it did work. I liked the camera and lighting of the film.Too bad I wasted time on this. Should have known better. The next time I will just have to listen to my instincts more closely as usually they are right on the money.",The Sixth Sense

In fact, I find his roles before this film one-dimensional: many explosions, uncounted bullets flying around and an ever-winning, untouchable hero .... boring. However, this time I´ve been surprised. He did a great job, it´s just, the kid was even better. I´d say, you love this film or hate it; it´s hard to stay unimpressed (in good or in bad). The finale is not entirely predictable, so it leaves you taste of something unfinished, and yet .... Plot is depressing, but the end...... fabulous. I´d like to see more such roles from Bruce Willis. He´s got the stuff to become a first class character actor; if he lets action aside. From my point of view, highest recommendations. It´s even better the second time!",The Sixth Sense

I can see that it was well made and that Bruce Willis played a different kind of role, sort of a caring, sensitive persona.i kept waiting for the movie to get better and since i have friends who all have big mouths and told me the ending, maybe that was why I did not enjoy it as much. Nonetheless, I found it boring and drawn out. ""I see dead people"" was probably a giveaway, but still it lacked excitement and substance.Maybe it is me and I am just too critical, but I have often found myself not liking movies that everyone else seems to think are masterpieces.I like Bruce Willis and he has made some good movies, some bad ones. This one falls somewhere in the middle. i really tried to get into it, but maybe it was too deep for me. I am willing to see it again and maybe, even though I know the ending, I will appreciate it more.It was not a disaster though.",The Sixth Sense
922,mftuchman,"Powerful and Sweet, but a little Schmaltzy in places",7,29 September 2005,"This movie has been out for six years. Although this appears to be a story about the supernatural, it is really about our hopes that we never are completely separated from those who love, or loved us.After a traumatic evening with a man breaking into their house, our Hero's life goes into a tailspin. He cannot seem to connect with his new patient, a young boy with similar symptoms to one he could not treat. His wife is distant and uncommunicative. He often has difficulty keeping track of time. And on top of all this, the patient claims to be able to see dead people. Sure, here's an easy case to solve in a stress filled life.This often has parallels to our own lives, as those who love us come closer and farther in a gentle, undulating wave. But we are not prepared for the separation that no amount of work can undo. It is this poignancy that the movie captures so expertly. Granted, it is couched in supernatural terms, but the lessons for us mere mortals should be clear.The soundtrack is superb. James Newton Howard has made several mediocre movies quite bearable, and here he makes a good film into an excellent one. The track is truly one of the important characters in the film, and does its job by staying in the background without interference.There are some moments of startling horror. I have seen this movie many times and I still jump at places.The pacing is well done, and the characters are all developed sufficiently for you to care about them. After six years, I still recommend the Sixth Sense.",The Sixth Sense
923,DeltonP,"An Oscar for Osment! ""Sixth Sense"" is a *** 1/2 Must-See Film",9,11 September 1999,"Not only can Cole Sear ""sense"" dead spirits around him, he sees and can communicate with them.  Thanks to a solid script and clever direction by M. Night Shyamalan and an incredible performance by young Haley Joel Osment (as Cole), this is one summer thriller that should not be missed.  Sure, Bruce Willis is given top-billing in all of the film's promotional efforts, but there is no doubt who the ""star"" of this creepy and affecting film is. Osment is remarkable in the role of an elementary-aged boy with ""The Sixth Sense"".  With psychiatric help (from Willis in a role very much resembling his turn in ""The Color of Night""), Cole attempts to overcome his disturbing otherworldly visions and the fact that many of his classmates (and even his teacher) consider him a freak.  Fortunately for all, Willis keeps his pants on and Osment works magic, playing his character with as much skill and believability as someone many times his age.  Let the Oscar buzz begin!  I'm wondering, just how young was the youngest Best Actor winner!?",The Sixth Sense

926,mjukr,A Chilling Horror Tale with A Thrilling Plot,8,8 August 1999,"In an industry awash with cheesy horror flicks and unthrilling thrillers, few dare attempt combining the two genres, and even fewer succeed.  But The Sixth Sense daresand succeeds.  The film never succumbs to the pitfalls of either genre; at no point does the dialogue prove dense or the acting plastic.  Written and directed by M. Night Shyamalan (Wide Awake), The Sixth Sense is both bone-chillingly frightening and touching and maintains composure throughout.Bruce Willis plays Malcolm Crane, a confident child psychologist who has recently received a reward for his dedication to the field.  On the evening he and his wife (played by Olivia Williams, Rushmore) are celebrating the honor, a former patient (played by a well-disguised Donnie Wahlberg) of Crowe's breaks into his home.  After an emotional, catatonic outburst in which he condemns Crowe for being unable to heal his emotional pain, the patient pulls a gun.  Crowe is shot.  Without further explanation, the film moves forward to ""The Next Fall"" (as a subtitle reads).  Quickly, we realize that Crowe has changed.  Distraught over the failure to help his former patient, Crowe is eager to take on a young boy named Cole Sear, (played by Haley Joel Osment) who exhibits similar symptoms, in hopes of reclaiming faith in his abilities.  Although Cole initially feels that Crowe is incapable of providing a solution, he eventually accepts the doctor's open hand.  As their relationship grows, Cole, who is rejected by his classmates and is even called a freak by his own teacher, gradually feels comfortable enough to reveal his secret: he sees dead people, everywhere and all the time.  Although Willis refutes the idea of otherworldly communication, he is determined to aid the boy.  Crowe's study progresses, and we see just how capable Willis is of performing serious roles.  He adeptly portrays a man torn between his urgency to repair the failures of his past and the need to restore his crumbling marriage (caused by the very dedication to his work for which he was rewarded), all with an odd, melancholic irk that fits the character completely.  The real star of the feature; however, is Haley Joel Osment, whose precocious acting is honest, centered, and convincing-qualities rarely seen or expecting from children his age. Osment truly convinced me that he was a child tortured by the ghastly apparitions of the dead and by his vicious, cold-hearted peers who issue constant torment.  Looking back on the film, I'm honestly not sure what would be worse-seeing the dead or being completely shunned by the living.  Nonetheless, Osment's skill is evinced in every petrified facial expression, in every cringe of anguish, and in every eye that wells with tear.  I'm anxious to see what the future holds for this bright star.The analogy between the struggles of Crowe (torn between his work and his personal life) and Cole (tormented by both the living and the dead) constructs the framework that supports their relationship, and is the crux of the film's story (which becomes clearer near the film's end).  Shymalan juggles both central characters along with the impressive supporting cast, and he maintains firm control of every one, even though the story falters slightly at times. But let us not forget the other strength of this film: it is creepy, and it will make you jump from the securityof your seat.  Although the gore feels excessive for a PG-13 rating and often seems present only to act as a crutch for the film's snail-like pace, it is quite effective at coercing the hair from one's neck and the warmth from one's skin.The Sixth Sense succeeds in frightening its audience.  But, more importantly, the film achieves the lofty goal of presenting a solid, thrilling story about the struggles between life and death, overshadowed by a strong message of compassion and acceptance.   If you seek a scare with a good story to support it, The Sixth Sense will provide, and the ending will truly blindside you (it's quite a surprise, and it doesn't leave any plot holes that allow arguments along the lines of ""that could have never happened if"").  And if you're anything like me, this film will haunt you for days, creeping its way back into your mind like a slow tide on a darkened beach.",The Sixth Sense
927,BloodyEd,A true gem,10,6 January 2000,"Where do I begin to sing the praises to this film?  The Sixth Sense is unlike anything I've ever seen, and by far the best film I've seen in years. Let me first say that I am no fan of horror films, and many classify this film as a horror picture.  It is not quite that.  One can get away with calling it a ""supernatural psychological thriller"" perhaps. To say that it is Horror however, is to put it in a genre generally known for its inferior product, and this film is anything but inferior. Unlike 1999's only other mentionable scare film, The Blair Witch Project, The Sixth Sense doesn't hide the terror from our sight.  We do see the ghosts that frighten Cole Sear so much.  And they are considerably scarier than the witch of the woods in Maryland.  But these frightening scenes are but one element in the overall success recipe of the film. 
Foremost I should mention Haley Joel Osment.  Only once before did a child actor really impress me.  I thought that Nick Stahl (in Man Without a Face) was outstanding.  But the depth and honesty of Haley's performance here I have yet to see the equal of.  He completely convinced me of his fear, and he invoked protective instincts in me I didn't know I had.  If there is any justice in Hollywood (yeah, right) he will AT LEAST be nominated for an Academy Award.  (If they could give it to Anna Paquin, they just might consider Haley).  In any instance, this little man has given a performance that many adult actors can rightly be very jealous of. The other performances are all outstanding too, and I'm sure now that no one could have betterred Bruce Willis in this role.Then, the direction and photography are far superior to anything I have seen in ages.  The film is dark.  Literally black sometimes.  There is hardly any sunlight anywhere, and the rooms are all pale and depressing.  This is Cole's world, and we are put right in there the entire time. Shyamalan also sneaks some very clever shots in the back door.  Look for a trace of Cole's sweat vanishing from the table, his reflection in a shiny doorknob etc. These and many more find their way into the film, and every one of them fits perfectly where they are put.  In short - there is not a single frame out of place in this film.The human elements are also strikingly detailed.  Note the parents at the school concert whip out their camcorders when they see their kids on stage. The cleverest scene of all, is between Willis and Haley.  They play a ""mind-reading"" game, and although one of them wins this battle of wills and wits, they both end up losing it in a way.These are just a few examples of the quality that this film boasts.  It is an extremely well made and unbelievably well thought out suspense film. It has been years since a film has given me physical, literal chills, and this film has done exactly that.  It managed to scare me -- something that a macho twentysomething man like me wouldn't like to admit.A final word:  firstly, if you plan on seeing this film, read as little about it as you can.  Do not talk about it with friends who have seen it, because the less you know about it the better.  Let it unfold and take you over in it's own time. And secondly, go see it in the theater if you can.  The unbearably tense music and huge dark screen add something very special to the experience.I think this film is a masterpiece in its own right, and if you can appreciate a good story with terrific acting, go watch The Sixth Sense.",The Sixth Sense
928,ColinInLa,"Good, but no cigar",6,26 August 1999,"Much like Bruce's 'Color of Night,' this one exists to serve its ending . ..and is ultimately less satisfying than the popular hype and success.

929,clara-chan,Strangely humourous at times,10,13 November 1999,"Wow, there sure are a LOT of comments for this movie! Anyway, overall I thought it was fantastic, since it was quite refreshing from regular action films, and the whole plot (to me) was quite satisfying. Most people have already said what I wanted to say, but I wanted to contribute my two cents too. ^.^ Actually, in quite a few bits, e.g. Cole busting to go to the toilet, etc, made the whole (packed) cinema laugh.The only downside to the movie was that even though I was only seeing the movie for the first time and hadn't read anything on the internet or any spoilers (not even this page yet) concerning the ending, and yet because ONE person told me there was a twist at the end of the story, halfway through I guessed what it was, and kept hoping I was wrong but I had guessed correctly! (which kinda took away most of the suspense) But still... and also after reading the other comments, isn't Haley Joel a main character, not a supporting actor? (I mean, if he got nominated for an Oscar, which I think he should too) He sure stole the show from Bruce Willis... ^_^ Anyway, the filmmakers were quite smart because now I want to see the movie again, in the point of view of KNOWING for sure the ending and trying to make sense of it during the movie...

I truly wish he and Michael Clarke Duncan of ""The Green Mile"" had been co-winners of the Oscar for supporting actor, even though no one can convince me that Haley Joel Osment was a *supporting* actor. He was the most critical element of the movie and carried it off better than many, many, many adult actors.Comments on ""The Sixth Sense"" are difficult because so much of the movie's brilliance lies in its final few minutes.

This is one of the most intelligent movies made.  Haley Joel Osment is the greatest child actor I have ever seen.  He did not get fake and was very convincing.  I did not feel that he was reading from a script to me.  This movie would have been much less without him.  While I do like Bruce Willis' over the edge action movies, I also thought that he was excellent in this movie.  The conversation between Haley Joel Osment and Bruce Willis was so real.  They were on an equal plane.The end of this movie was the greatest and most unexpected twist of all time.

Scenes are added for seemingly no reason and left unexplained.  Bruce Willis character apparently is a complete moron.  The utter lack of basic screenwriting ability of this film's author is astonishing.  This movie is not worth seeing at the cinema or renting on video.

946,dale_durnell,Destined to be a classic,9,17 August 2000,"This is one of those movies that needs to be seen more than once. In fact, after the first viewing, the movie almost compels one to see it again. And, with each screening, it gets better. The storyline is fabulous -- it is well developed, and the characters are well played. To say that there are twists and turns would be to understate the artistic qualities that make the movie such a hit.At first, the role played by Bruce Willis seems so out of character with his usual persona on screen. But, he is wonderful as Dr. Malcomb Crowe who struggles through the movie, wondering if he could have done more with those he is called to help. Toni Collette, as the mother of young Cole (played by Haley Joel Osment) was nominated for an Academy award. But, Olivia Williams' portrayal of Crowe's wife is the real award winning performance. She plays a woman torn between the work of her award winning husband, and her own life.The building relationship between Bruce Willis' character and that of Haley Joel Osment is well executed. Willis wants to help, then realizes he may not be helping, but then he stays on to help the young man confront and deal with his ""secret.""This film is on a par with the best Hitchcock classics. M. Night Shyamalan has a gift as a writer and director, and he excelled in this film. As a cinemagraphic work of art, the film is superior. The camera angles and the outstanding use of lighting should be required study for future films. The dialogue is mature, and the storyline is thought provoking. The subtle nuances in the script and props are compelling. The special effects are at times a little gruesome, if not morbid. But then, what do you expect from a film where a little boy sees dead people.For those looking to add to their home video collection, this is a ""must have.""",The Sixth Sense
947,paulmst3k,"Good movie, but a few flaws...",6,11 August 2000,"I believe that this film is very good, but not good enough to be spot #23 on the IMDB top 250 list.  First of all, the movie is a little bit overrated. (which is understandable because no other decent movies were out at the time except for Phantom Menace) Second of all, great movies get better each time you watch them.  With each viewing, Sixth Sense gets less and less exciting and turns almost to the point of boring.  The characters and their problems are not interesting enough to watch again and again.  By the third time you've seen it, the movie becomes mediocre, knowing the ending does not make this movie good. (However, it is fun to point out things you didn't notice before about...well, *you know* (I don't wish to have a spoiler in comment)) Anyway, the problems with the characters is that they are too much the same. They're not melodramatic, but both Willis and (I forget his name) ""the quiet kid"" say all their lines in the same kind of serious, low-toned voice. There is feeling behind the lines, but not enough variety of feeling.Finally, there are a few plot holes, but I don't wish to discuss them because previous commenters already have.  Cole ""the quiet kid"" did a fine acting job (compared to all the other kid actors out there, he looks like Orson Welles) it wasn't incredibly entertaining to watch his acting skills, but they were good.  I hope the poor kid isn't scarred for life by the tone of the movie, and I hope he doesn't become type-casted and turn into another MacCullay Culkin.Anyway, a good suspenful movie (not really scary) and I would strongly recommend watching the movie once, but not twice, and definately not six times.",The Sixth Sense
948,grandmalop911,I can't believe it didn't get best movie of the year.,9,27 December 2000,I think Haley Joel Osment should have gotten the award for best actor and I know I'm not alone. That was an excelent movie and excellent acting and I dont mean excellent acting for a kid I mean for anyone. I saw cyder house rules and didn't think Caine did anything above the ordinary as far as acting goes. Anyway what I'm saying is the sixth sense in my opinion was the best movie of the year and had some of the best acting of the year. At the part he was talking about the little hairs standing up on the back of your neck the little hairs on the back of my neck stood up I loved it! I gave it a 9 out of 10 i took the 1 of because as much as i like what the tried to do with the plot twist it did leave a few holes in the plot those who saw it should know what I mean by that. Wow good movie.,The Sixth Sense
949,m-fan,A great movie.,9,27 March 2001,"There is more to this movie than just the surprise ending. The acting in the movie was superb, I could really feel pity for the child and the mother. Also, there was also a subplot in the movie which also had a surprising twist that was terrific. And after I saw the movie's ending, I had to go back and re-think about all the various scenes  I had seen in the movie, and the fact that what I though was happening in those scenes was not really the case, and how the movie script and director was able to pull it off.

Well, at first I saw the edited TV version, which was creepy, but not scary. Then one day my friend came over and we wanted to watch something creepy, so we decided ""Sixth Sense"". Oh my gosh, I was so scared! We couldn't go to sleep for that night, and sometimes I will still have nightmares.Anyways, it was a good movie. It kept you on the edge of your seat and was pretty interesting too. I liked it. The story is about a man, Dr. Malcome Crowe, who wants to take control of his life. His wife isn't talking to him anymore (even though they live together) and he isn't doing to great with his job anymore (he's a child therapist.) Until one day he meets Cole, a little boy who has a huge problem: he sees dead people. So Dr. Malcome Crowe has to try to help the little boy.If you're a big scary-movie person, you should watch it.

Sorry, but if you're constantly hearing that there is this fantastic ending to the movie, you can pretty much guess what it's going to be  I mean the story is about a boy WHO SEES DEAD PEOPLE. Don't get me wrong it is really well done and even if you do figure it out, like myself (do I win a prize?), you may well forget it throughout most of the movie.Bruce Willis plays child psychologist Malcolm Crow. After being shot (So, he was shot) by a former patient who he has let down professionally, he is desperate to help a young boy, Cole (Haley Joel Osment), who shares similar symptoms and has a habit of seeing dead people (So, the boy sees dead people).The cast is strong throughout, although at times Willis has a misleading and out-of-place sinister expression.The film isn't traumatisingly scary. The scariest moments are largely thanks to the excellent chilling music score.The secret ending, as I said earlier, is very well hidden if you don't know there is one, and maybe even if you do, thanks to brilliant directing from Shyamalan. The scene at the restaurant is wonderfully done, and the crucial draw back after Malcolm being shot at the beginning is perfect.8/10",The Sixth Sense

It is so out there, yet one gets a strange feeling from the film because it seems so real. The acting is amazing. Bruce Willis has never been better. Toni Collette is at the top of her game. Haley Joel Osment was robbed at the Academy Awards, because he gave in this film the single best child performance and one of the greatest performances of all time (adult or child) in this movie. The only child performances that rival his in this movie are Osment's other performances.

956,lisaoklahoma,A thriller?,2,8 May 2009,"""The Sixth Sense"" was a huge disappointment. If it was supposed to be a thriller, it was the dreariest thriller I've ever seen. Truthfully, I had to make an effort to stay awake during the thing so I could see how it ended. Maybe I should have seen the ending coming like a lot of other people, but I didn't. I think the reason is that it didn't make sense. I'm about to ruin the ending for you if you haven't seen the movie yet, but I know you've already seen it. So this kid who is terrified of dead people, even though you'd think he'd be used to be them by now, deals with his fear by spending all his time with a supposedly brilliant dead psychologist who goes for a year without knowing he's dead even though this troubled child is the only person he communicates with. That's the whole plot.Besides the inconsistencies in the plot, there was nothing about the movie that was the least bit scary. Yes, I get that the kid could see dead people. But that's all. They weren't trying to drown him or eat him. They were just there. One's ability to be scared by this hinges on their belief that death is in and of itself scary. But if you're not really afraid of death, which I'm not because it's inevitable, then the only thing that will sicken you will be the unrealistic, mind-numbingly dull dialogue that has become a trademark of all Shyamalan films.",The Sixth Sense

I noticed everyone enjoyed the show.I particularly enjoyed the quiet performance of Bruce Willis and a gut-wrenching one from Haley Joel Osment.  I love the way director/writer/actor M. Night Shyamalan unraveled the story with a rather genuinely surprising ending.Guys, bring your girlfriend with you to see this movie -- she'll be grabbing on to your arms really tightly in some of the scary scenes.I highly recommend it.

From the surreal opening credits, fading in the smoky white letters over a black background, the aura of this film is a little spooky and subtly intense.According to our young protagonist, Cole Sear (Osment), when you get the shivers and feel the prickly things on the back of your neck, it is ""them"", the ghosts. But it is The Sixth Sense that gives you the chills at your local theater.Unlike The Blair Witch Project, which I enjoyed for the psychological aspects, The Sixth Sens genuinely had me spooked. After seeing it yesterday afternoon, last night when I woke up a few times and felt a bit of a chill, refused to open my eyes.By the way, the acting is top-notch and Haley Joel Osment blows the other 10-year-old of the summer, Jake Lloyd, out of the water.

However I was expecting another mediocre 'Mercury Rising' attempt. How much more could I have been wrong?'The Sixth Sense' is gripping for almost the entire movie. Osment really outshined Willis and Collette, yet the truly memorable bits of this movie were the scenes which literally sent chills down my spine like no other movie has done before. Shyamalan must be congratulated for showing Hollywood that a good old-fashioned story will always be better than c****y special-FX driven movies (i.e.-ID4). My only quibble concerns the fact that the great twist at the end is what stays in people's minds. Before that, the film was beginning to die off with an unsatisfactory conclusion.

Even with this flaw, the film was STILL able to deliver a knock out-have to see it again to get the full effect-experience.Makes me wonder...How could the film makers not SEE THAT MICROPHONE!It looked ready to pop Bruce Willis on the head! It's hanging close to dead center of the screen for what seems forever! One scene, Willis ACTUALLY SAYS ""I feel like I have something hanging over my mind"". Yea, the boom microphone!

While it does have a startling plot twist, the strong story and well-developed characters prevent this from becoming just another gimmick-flick.

Forget everything anyone has told you.I have heard some people complain about the pace of the film.  Well, I suppose for the MTV-addled, or those who think that this is another Bruce Willis ""blow up everything in sight"" movie, they will be unsure what to do with a film that owes more to Hitchcock's sense of timing and build-up than Jan DeBont.This film does what so few seem to and that is they give their audience credit for having a brain.  There are a million little details and many of them don't appear until after you've seen the film and are discussing it with a friend afterward.  Like the fact that the kid doesn't want his mom to worry about how the kids in school are treating him and so he bribes one of his classmates to pretend to be his friend and pays the other kid off in Pop Tarts.There are a few points I thought could have been made a little more clearly or more effectively but I didn't say this was a perfect movie, just a great one.A solid 10.",The Sixth Sense

You see every bit you didn't understand or thought was a bit far fetched the first time you watched it just slide into place.  Also, a great atmosphere is created.

Consequently, the movie which could have been much more breathtaking became unreasonably boring; indeed boring almost all the time!! While watching the movie, I became so bored that I wondered whether that was the real ""The Sixth Sense"" people were praising all the time! Moreover, I do not approve of Shyamalan's Oscar nomination for the best director; anyone else would have been a nominee due to that wonderful screenplay!
As for the acting, I liked Osment's  worth-seeing performance, which is one of the few good aspects of this movie.Also, Colliette was outstanding as Cole's mother. But that's all OK with the cast; I especially disliked Bruce Willice's performance as Malcolm Crowe. Actually, he must have played more enthusiastically since he was the leading character. Besides, his face did NOT go with the character of Malcolm Crowe. I am sure that anyone else would have played much better than him. For instance, Robin Williams would have been a perfect choice for this role!
Finally,the music was VERY poor; so poor that I had not seen any movie the music of which was poorer than this one! So ask yourself; would you have liked the movie if the end had not been so astonishing? A movie should be charming from the beginning to the end; not in the end, only!!! 4/10",The Sixth Sense
987,mopac,Only good thing was the ending,5,16 December 2000,"This movie just plods along.  The only redeeming feature is the ending. Many times I almost turned it off because I was so bored.  Perhaps knowing the ending would make rewatching more interesting to try to pick up the ""clues"" to the end result would make it worth rewatching but that's not my style.  Wish they could have made the whole movie engaging.",The Sixth Sense
988,NEWPDQ,He's behind you!!!,1,19 March 2001,"I'm sorry, but this has to stop. If the earth-shattering revelation was so well buried that you couldn't guess what was coming up then you didn't see the trailer. Or the first five minutes of the film. Giant waste of time. What were we supposed to be afraid of? All the ghosts didn't help, blessed with the calibre of make-up and costume that would disgrace a straight-to-video slasher flick. Bad, bad, bad, bad, bad.

989,hoagyfc,"If you can't guess the ""twist"" before the end ...",4,28 April 2002,"... then you probably gave this a 10. There's nothing particularly bad about this film and its watchable enough, but it lacks the ""what the hell's going on?"" factor you'll find in other contemporary films such as ""Stir of Echoes,"" though that too has a crappy ending. The kid is good though, but this film doesn't stand up to even the most basic analysis.",The Sixth Sense
990,TotenRot,A movie about love,10,9 December 2004,"The 6th sense is an intelligent movie about love, set in a slightly supernatural environment. It isn't very scary, even though you may feel your hairs rising once or twice (mileage may wary). The story is very well told, and it's worth seeing at least twice. I recommend this movie highly. 10/10.Most of you already know what this movie is about, but I'll warn anyway:*** SPOILERS ***The main story is beautifully portrayed, and the twist at the end was as good as they come. Some claim they saw it long before, I think most who didn't know there was supposed to be a twist like this, found it wonderful. I did.As the one line summary says, I think this was a movie about love. The ghost story is not very scary, although interesting. But the real theme here is love. Not the boy loves girl, girl is in danger/lost/whatever, boy and girl gets back together cheesy movie. But the mothers love for his boy. The mothers love and mourn for her mother. The doctors love for his wife, and her love and mourn for him. The fathers love for the little girl mistreated and killed by her stepmother.Love is the central team all the way throughout the movie. And it's beautifully portrayed all the way.In my opinion, this is one of the most intelligent and touching movies ever.",The Sixth Sense
991,shiny_mae1984,Amazing!,10,12 September 2018,"This was my third time watching this. It is a great movie in my opinion. After you've watched this movie once or more, watching it again, it is really interesting to see the subtle clues that point to the twist that happens later on.For example, when the husband sits next to his sleeping wife; she is holding tissues, has been crying and suddenly gets really cold. The wife seems to be angry at the main character throughout the movie, basically ""ignoring"" him.I feel like everything is done really well and it all makes sense at the end. This is the type of movie that makes you think, even months and years later. The acting from child actor Haley Joel Osment is top notch; I think he had a natural talent.",The Sixth Sense
992,uapoorvgupta21,One of the best in horror business!!,10,23 March 2013,I would say The Sixth Sense in one of the best Horror movies ever made without trying to use a lot of special effects. MNS really tries to create tension in your mind through some mind-boggling scenes that what would happen next.Bruce Willis has been shown as a child psychologist who has recently won an award and is celebrating with his wife at the beginning. He meets Haley Joel Osment who is a kid who believes he sees dead people walking and trying to communicate with him. At the end of the movie a big suspense is revealed making the viewer shocked. Watch this movie for a brilliant mix of suspense and horror.,The Sixth Sense
993,jason-godin232,One of the greatest!,10,29 October 2012,"So, the movie I just watched was ""The Sixth Sense"" Many people ask, why is M. Night Shyamalan still directing and writing movies, when everything he makes now is crap. Well the answers to this, is because of this movie. By far one of the greatest Thriller movie of all time.It's about a young boy who has the ability to see and communicate with Dead People. This little boy's name is Cole Sear, played by Haley Joel Osment, and for you gamers out there who absolutely love Kingdom Hearts, he's the same actor who does the voice of Sora. After an accident that happened to a Child Psychologist Dr. Malcolm, played by Bruce Willis, whereas one of his former patient had shot him, because Malcolm wasn't able to help him. He decides he needs to do what's right, and he find Cole, who had the same symptoms as Vincent, the boy who shot Malcolm.This movie has drama, funny moments and it's an extremely emotional movie. The acting is so good and so pure that you can't help but feel like you're right in there in the movie. The child Haley Joel Osment has so much talent in acting, that at the time he was 11 and does way better acting than most actors who had 25+ years in the trade.The story is overwhelmingly good and the development and psychology in this movie just gives you goosebumps all over the entire movie.Why M. Night Shyamalan...how did you produce something so good an pure, and throw us crap with your other projects. I'm guessing the guys at Hollywood think ""We have faith that this Shyamalan will somehow bring us gold one day.And the ending! It made me stand up and yell out ""Oh My God! This is genius!!!"" I give The Sixth Sense, a 9.5/10 Officially one of my personal Favorite movies.",The Sixth Sense
994,Felfo,"Brilliant, because is believable",10,14 August 2006,"This movie is a must. Not only cause the performances are excellent, not only cause the script and direction are great but also because it makes you believe in Ghosts. The plot takes you to the patient doctor relation between: Bruce Willis (Dr. Malcolm Crowe) & Haley Joel Osment (Cole Sear), which is beautifully done. But nothing is what is seems. Cole is not just a crazy child, with a tuft family past: he sees ghosts; and nor his mother neither his doctor can't believe him. The process that takes place till Dr. Crowe realizes that the Kid is not telling lies is masterly developed: thrill, drama and the boy's explanation of the supernatural submerge the spectator into the history forcing the catharsis. The experienced viewer can resolve the ending before it happens, only if he is analyzing instead of enjoying and even though it thrills you. The movie's success relies on a seriously developed plot that considers actual life experience and its relation with the supernatural (understand as common things that can happen to anyone). This key factor is the reason why scary movies are great or just ridiculous entertainment, is what separates The Sixth Sense & The exorcist from Freddy and Jason for example.",The Sixth Sense
995,angelsim,The definition of 'Re-watch Value',10,3 November 2019,"Straight to the point - this movie is definitely Shyamalan's magnum opus so far - it has everything that you need in a thriller - drama, suspense, emotional relation to all of the main characters, greatly written, amazingly produced - for me this is, no doubt, the movie of the decade (and I have stood behind those words for many years now).
I re-watched it again yesterday and it felt even more touching.
The character of the mother is presented in such a real and relatable way that hardly needs any description: she is a woman that takes care of her kid no matter what whilst taking the role of the father at the same time (presented in the way she calls to the parents of her boy's bullies and firmly telling them to keep them away from her son); nothing in her life really goes her way as she has to juggle between two jobs to take care of her small family and the constant school and social problems of her child; her character is presented in a very memorable way by a very expression-able actress, even coining some catchphrases like: ""look at my face..."" when she is about to say something really comforting - when you hear that you know that you can count on her to do everything that she can for you.
What distinguishes this movie from any generic one is the fact that every character that appears plays an actual role in it and goes through changes - even the teacher is presented in a real-life (psychologically correct) way - while in high school he was made fun of by his peers so he is quick to anger when Cole brings this to light. Near the end he is shown as an adult that has gotten through his anger phase in the past, now relates to the kid and is trying to help him by giving him the role as King Arthur in the play.
Bruce Willis' work needs no comment.
The boy who shot him in the beginning also played his role majestically with his delivery of lines being extremely memorable and hitting a weird and uncomfortable string that gets engraved into the memory of the viewer.
Overall - an amazing performance by the cast and great job of the director leading everything perfectly.
Knowing what you learn after the first viewing and keeping a constant eye for plot holes (which as far as I know don't even exist) during the re-watches definitely gives this movie a lot of value seeing again and again.
What amazes me is how well everything is sewn together - nothing goes well for the main characters, which you feel for, until the very end of the movie where everything seems to get better, which comes as a breath of fresh air after soooo much waiting and hoping.In my book - one of the movies that I will always recommend to people, no matter what their movie taste usually is - one can not go wrong with watching 'The Sixth Sense'.",The Sixth Sense
996,Biatchmefoot,a really good movie and worth seeing,8,14 March 2018,"The Sixth sense is a movie written and directed by M. Night Shyamalan and stars Bruce Willis as a child psychologist named Malcom and also stars Haley Joel Osment as Cole, a boy who sees dead people. The ending is one of the best twists I have seen because not only do you not expect it but it gives you a reason to watch it again and the second time you view it the way you view the movie is totally different and I gotta commend Shyamalan for that. I have not seen every single one of Bruce Willis's films but from what i have seen this is his best performence yet and Haley Joel Osment is also really good, not just for his age but in general he is fantastic. This movie also plays with your mind a bit if you don't know the twist and that is just genius writing. Overall this is a great movie that is suspenseful and clever but it isn't without its flaws however. Since Bruce Willis's character Malcolm is a ghost how does he know that Cole was at the hospital? He was not there when Cole passed out and he has no one contact with to know because no one besides Cole can see him and talk to him so that is a head scratcher to me. Despite that I highly recommend you check this movie out",The Sixth Sense
997,lazjura,It's good,7,16 July 2019,"Saw it recently. I hoped the hype would pay off. And it did only halfway. It's not bad, it's actually pretty good. But that's it. Just good. Not spectacular.
The only thing special in the movie is the child's acting. The twist wasn't mind-exploding, guessed it an hour into the movie. Nothing was really dug deep, every part of the movie was fairly shallow. But it's a fun watch. Just don't bite into the hype.",The Sixth Sense
998,Greg Miller,Wow! Incredibly subtle...,10,9 August 1999,"This movie is brilliant, even better than The Usual Suspects and The Matrix... It's one of the few movies I've watched lately and then realized it had no plot holes that I could find. I thought I found one at first, but realized it was merely a case of seeing what I expected to see rather than what was actually shown.At one point, Cole comments that the ghosts can't see each other, they only see what they want to see. The ending makes the same point TO the audience ABOUT the audience, and does it with a demonstration that cannot be argued against.The writing, direction, and acting are all great... I knew Willis could act, but I was surprised to see than Donnie Wahlberg (that's right, from the New Kids On The Block) can do some impressive acting, as well--at least in the brief appearance he makes as a former patient.There's one scene in particular where surprisingly good acting from a child combines with brilliant direction to allow you to see exactly how Cole feels having to go to the bathroom alone in the middle of the night, knowing that the dead will appear, but knowing when or how... I've never seen a movie convey emotion this way before.You really should see this--not to be scared (which you will be, suddenly and with no warning, at various points in the movie), but to be made to THINK, in the way that good science fiction makes you think.",The Sixth Sense
999,Nosajes,thrilling,9,1 August 1999,"Far better than any Bruce Willis movie that isn't directed by Gilliam or Tarantino has any right to be!!  He actually is pretty good in it too!  An ode to such great 70's thrillers as Roeg's Don't Look Now and Friedkin's The Exorcist, this film is moody, disturbing and visually fascinating.  Using all forms of symbolism, including arches, frames within frames (and sometimes frames within frames within frames), spirals, shapes, Dutch angles, cinema verite and deep reds, Tak Fujimoto proves once again why he is one of the most respected and sought after DP's in Hollywood.  Toni Colette, I love you!!!  I forgive you for Cosi!!  She shines in this film. She could have gone for the whiny over the top single mom but instead she walks that fine wire between realism and a typical Hollywood stereotype. Fantastic! If she decides to stay in Hollywood I hope she continues to find great scripts and roles she can make her own.  I have decided that Haley Joel Osment is one of those Webster people who only look 10 but are really 60 because no child should be able to emote so well!  Lucas, watch this and realize what you could have had! Jake Lloyd, watch this film 40 times and go back to acting school!  Mark Whalberg. Wow!  I didn't have a clue that it was him until I was reminded in the closing credits that he was even in it. I knew he could act before but he brings intensity to this performance that stays with you throughout the film's duration. Well done.  If I have one complaint it is that I felt the jumps and make-up effects were unnecessary. We have seen a child throw up green pee soup before, we don't need to see it again.  But it doesn't break the mood.  Proof that Hollywood can punch out eerie and smart films when they want to. {If you like this one, and even if you don't, check out Roeg's Don't Look Now!!  Maybe it will inspire you as well.  Or at least make it harder to fall asleep!}",The Sixth Sense
1000,ahaney,Outstanding script and acting,9,14 August 1999,"My god! I have never seen a child actor carry a movie the way Haley Joel Osment does with The Sixth Sense. I seriously think he deserves an Academy Award nomination for this performance. I suppose that would make him the youngest person ever nominated for a best acting Oscar, but he really deserves it. Bruce Willis also does an excellent job, and the resulting chemistry between the two actors is fantastic.M. Night Shyamalan's screenplay also deserves an Oscar nomination, and will probably get it. After reading rave reviews of this script on Comng Attractions over a year ago, I can say now that those kudos were well earned. I am also glad to see this movie doing such good business.

My mind either ignored or subconsciously justified said clues into my understanding of the Bruce Willis' character still being alive. Being raised by a German father and being confirmed into the Lutheran Church by a Finnish mother, my emotions are buried deep. I cried, hard, twice during this movie.

It's the kind of film I immediately want to see again to explore just how the characters and scenes wove together because I was so caught up in the flow as it unfolded before me.I am not a Bruce Willis fan, but he was fine.  Haley Joel Osmond was stunning.  Such a touching and real performance!

1005,Self-4,A major disappointment,7,25 July 2000,"{SPOILERS ahead}    I never felt so rotten after watching a movie in my whole life. I admit it, I did not guess the ending, but that is precisely what made the movie so awful. To elaborate, every movie has its story line, a set of rules it must abide by to stay logical and entertaining. When a movie follows these rules and still manages to deliver a surprising, dramatic show then I can call the movie great. Sixth Sense did all that only to reveal in the last minutes  that Willis was dead, an idea that crawled, perhaps, into many people's minds but was so illogical that it simply did not make sense.I am sure you know all about the plot holes. Like the fact that Willis was dumb enough not to notice that something was wrong. What, he didn't attend his own funeral? Never called anyone on the phone? Where did he get information about the boy in the first place? Never tried to talk to any living being, including his wife? How about having to go to a bathroom for crying out loud!!! Now, the script tries to nullify the hole by giving Cole this line: ""They(dead people) see what they want to see"". Is this supposed to cover everything? Willis may be dumb but his character is NOT. In the movie Ghost, Demi Moore's husband played by Patrick Swayze finds out that he is dead in the first 5 minutes after getting shot. It takes more than a year for Willis to do the same. Yeah! That makes sense...But the biggest blow is the main area of the plot - the reason why Willis wants to help the boy - putting it simply, Cole is afraid of the ghosts, the cause of his mood disorders (at least that's what Willis thinks). But Willis IS a ghost! To deny the fact(like many reviewers here do) that the boy doesn't know Willis is a ghost is outrageous. Cole isn't stupid either - he knows nobody can see Willis's character, not his mom, no one!!! Yet he is not afraid of the doctor. It follows that if he is not afraid of Willis then he shouldn't be afraid of any ghost. But this doesn't make sense.I saw the movie only once but I can also recall that Willis, outraged by the sight of his wife kissing another man does something to the store door or window. This produces a sound!!! But can a dead man interact with the real world? Nope!!! Not in every other similar situation (like when he tried to open the door to the cellar). Another nonsensical point.There are numerous other holes that people here mentioned. I am not going to mention them all. Don't get me wrong. I am not trying to deny the fact that the movies was shot beautifully. Almost everyone played his or her role to perfection. It was at times scary. However, I sincerely believe that the movie would not have been given so many rave reviews if it weren't for the shocking ending. Somehow people managed to see past its lack of logic and rationality and give it a perfect 10. Believe me... that's what the director of the movie was hoping for. In the end, Sixth Sense just doesn't play by its own rules. Too bad, it could have been a good one.",The Sixth Sense

Great acting, excellent characters (well-defined and intriguing), a hypnotic storyline, and lots of chills. I'm used to predicting endings even when they are a bit of a twist, but this one came from left field for me. I measure the success of a movie not just by the actual in-theater experience, but also about how much the film stays in my mind and keeps me talking about it after I've left the theater. The Sixth Sense had audience members immediately turn to their companions (as soon as the credits rolled) to discuss their interpretation, and I know I thought about it days later.Bruce Willis is fantastic in the role of the child psychologist, but Haley Joel Osment is the one who most surprised me. This boy has a great career ahead of him. His emotional range and sincerity is impressive, *especially* considering his youth.

This is a movie full of chills, horror, and believe it or not, warmth and hope.Haley Joel Osmont is the best child actor to hit the screen in years. His heartfelt performance is riveting, and the chemistry he achieves with Toni Collette as his mother is achingly real.  Bruce Willis finally hits his mark as a dramatic actor, wisely underplaying his role as the child psychologist with an all-consuming passion to rescue this young boy from his torment.To say anything else would be unfair; this is a film that must be seen to be believed.

I can deal with that, but he has tortured me in the past with some poor acting efforts.Well, he was good here.  Some might even say great!  I was thrilled to find that his performance was more than enough to support this wonderfully creative story.  Even more impressive was Haley Joel Osment.

The most interesting thing about this for me was that I left the film not thinking only ""What a great ghost story flick."", but also ""What a nice relationship movie!""  In fact that's what stayed with me, which is not what one usually expects from such a film. Early in the movie there appears trouble for the relationship between Bruce Willis's character and that of his wife, a thing which annoyed me, because as subplots, these things usually detract and end badly or through cliche.

After an initial rocky start the boy and man form a deep bond and Cole (Osment) finally decides to reveal his secret to Malcolm (Willis).  Nothing prepares him for the secret and nothing will prepare him for what is to come.Bruce Willis, in which may possibly be his greatest performance, gives his character a depth in which you can sympathise with, even understand what is going on in his life, in his head, as he comes to grips with the revelation of what Cole (Haley Joel Osment) exposes to him.Haley Joel Osment is incredible in this film. His character is so intense that you can feel your fingernails digging into your skin waiting for his response to the frightening life he must live.  He shows you a world, which may, or may not be there, causing your heart to jump and you to shrink back waiting for the outcome of what he sees.I admit that the movie is not for all audiences and you have to be prepared for what appears on the screen, but in saying that, the movie is not terrifying like I have read in most reviews and comments.  Maybe it depends on your constitution.  It is more thrilling than horror.The Sixth Sense' is not a Friday night amusement.

Sside from the fact I felt cheated out of a perfectly spooky twist, it was a wonderful movie. Definitly worth the 8 bucks I forked over to the cinemas (and let's not count the popcorn). One of the best and most orignal horror (would you call it horror? I love the way it can be classified under so many different genres, it always helps make the movie) movies I've seen. Cheers to little forrest gump- cursed and *still* adorable- for stealing the show. Bruce Willis emerged from his stereotypical die hard cliche and produced a wonderful look into the heart of his well written character. Compelling! 9/10",The Sixth Sense

This is the same Donnie who was in Ransom, right?.  And NKOTB!?  I thought his scene was one of the best in the movie.  I respect actors that are willing to completely change their physical appearance for a role, no matter how small the role is.  It's interesting to watch the movie a second time.  The first time, all my attention was on the kid.  The second time, though, it was on Bruce.  (How many words do you figure Bruce spoke the entire movie?  Maybe fifty?)",The Sixth Sense

Easily the best performance of Bruce Willis' career this movie just gets better and better as it goes on.I would recommend you know nothing about the story before you watch as it has a twist like no other at the end !

We didn't have a clue about the ending.  The video has a little five minute chat with the director, etc. and they tell how they do give you clues etc. throughout the film, so we watched it a second time immediately to see.  The film is brilliant.  I don't like Bruce Willis but he was great.  One ghost in particular freaked me out (the kid with his head blown off).",The Sixth Sense

I've read some bogus reviews by punks who have no taste and do not understand films in a great deal!!. So........ theres a a twist at the end and yes it was cool but there is more to it then that. The story is just amazing.Read my top 5 reasons why there is more to this film than just a twist!1/ Once thoroughly thought about, then can you fully understand the tragic of a boy who cannot escape his demons.2/ Bruce Willis. Great Acting by everyone but Bruce Out shines!(what the hell happened at the OSCARS!)3/ The director did his best to cover the master ending, totally vintage!.4/ Osment. For a little kid he does very well!.5/ When i first watched the film i thought yeah this is ok, then about 5 minutes from the end i realised that it was lagging on until the amazing show down. i talked about it for a week!. I've seen a lot of films and i have to say that this is the best thriller ever!. enjoy bav.",The Sixth Sense
1022,rlendog,Disappointing,3,12 May 2001,"Neither a terrible movie nor a great one.  Just one of the many movies that fall in the middle, despite the hype.  The supposed ""twist"" at the end is telegraphed early on, and so isn't surprising when it comes, although it is well handled when it finally arrives.  While Haley Osment and Bruce Willis are good actors, the dialogue between them is stilted, and the movie drags for a long stretch in the middle.  When the situation between them finally gets resolved, it is handled in too perfunctory a fashion given all the time spent leading up to it.  A lot of time is spent between Willis and Osment accomplishing little, then one incident is shown leading towards the resolution, and then the situation is resolved, and that's it. 4/10.",The Sixth Sense
1023,Andres-33,Probably the best psychological thriller ever!,10,17 August 2000,"I saw this movie months after it had first come out in the US, and surprisingly nobody told me the end:  I'm glad they didn't, because this has been the one movie which has kept me at the edge of my seat during the whole time.  Bruce Willis does an excellent job in acting, but my applause definitely goes to young Haley Joel Osment.I have now seen the movie about ten times, and even though I know how it is going to end, it still manages to give me goosebumps.

1025,nufffairy,More dead people would have been cool.,5,29 November 2001,"I was a bit annoyed when I saw this movie because someone told me something about this movie before I went and saw it.  Something I think the movie goer, wasn't really meant to know.  Something that they really shouldn't have told me at all.pretty much the point of the whole movie really.  So, consequentially my review is marred.So all through the movie, I'm like, `Ok, when's this going to happen?'I'm not going to mention what this thing was exactly, because I know how annoyed I was and don't want to annoy anybody else.But I definitely thought the movie needed more dead people.  Does that sound odd?  Oh well.The focus of the movie seemed to be more the Bruce Willis character than the boy, but they both helped each other out.  So it was cool.  In a way, even though Bruce (first name basis) was the focus, the boy had the most important part.  I think that made sense.I'm sure if my enjoyment wasn't slaughtered by previous patrons of the movie, I would have given this movie a MUCH higher rating.  Alas, I'll never truly know how I would have viewed it, had I been ignorant.All in all, an alright flick, but I said it before, and I'll say it again, should have been more dead people.2.5/5",The Sixth Sense

This is a near perfect film, with some truly devastating moments. Most people favour the twist ending (which is amazing), but I always loved the scene when Cole tells his mother that he's been visited by his dead Grandma. It's a potent, poignant scene that's brilliantly acted. And the revelation that Willis' character was dead all along cement this 90's thriller as a classic.",The Sixth Sense
1028,FlickJunkie,The creepiest film in many years.,10,29 July 2001,"Wow! What an ending. I don't think I've been this moved by a film's conclusion since the frighteningly shocking end of David Fincher's ""Seven."" Don't worry because I will obviously not ruin this film for anyone, but suffice it to say that the end of this film allows you to see the entire picture from an entirely different point of view the second time around, and that is simply a unique achievement. In fact, I was more than willing to see this film many more times, just so that I could see it unravel within that other realm. Another thing that stood out for me with this picture was the fact that unlike its trailer, which sells this film as a chilling thriller, this movie is actually more of a supernatural drama with plenty of tear-jerking scenes to boot. And yes, I crumbled under the emotional drainage of the film's players, especially with Toni Collette in a few choice scenes. I would rather compare it to elements of ""The Omen"" and ""Ghost,"" rather than any thrill-seekers ride, though it has it's share of creepy, terrifying moments.In fact, the film is deliberately paced very slowly, with plenty of time given to the performers to grapple with the powerful material at hand. Haley Joel Osment does an excellent job as the confused young child who is going through things that no child should ever go through, and even Bruce Willis pulls off an impressive steady performance, without a single ""yipee-kaya"" in the whole script. But once again, allow me reiterate how much the twist ending of this film allowed it to catapult onto another level. Even after the film's credits had long been done rolling, I could not help but discuss the many different parts of the plot that were altered through this amazing ending, and could not help but further my appreciation for this film. Great acting, great style, great score, an instant classic ending, and certainly worthy of being called one of my favorite films. And despite it not being an all-out thriller, believe me when I say that you will be startled in a few scenes, and certainly touched in others. Giant kudos go out to the writer/director of this film, M. Night Shyamalan, for pulling off a very impressive film presentation.By the way, if this film interests you in the least, make sure that you see it before someone ruins the ending for you, because it truly is one to digest firsthand.Rating: 10/10",The Sixth Sense

1031,AntiSpielbergForce,I see morons and imbeciles,1,30 January 2009,"Everybody's favourite ""intelligent"" horror/mystery-thriller, with everybody's favourite twist ending. You already know the story, so I'll fast-forward directly to the bashing.Shyamalan fancies himself a great artist, not content with ""only"" telling a story. Fair enough. The last positive thing I will say in this review is that he has a keen eye for cinematography, if nothing else. Unfortunately, pretty pictures and ""art shots"" are not enough to make a good director, or film, and cinematography is indeed the movie's actual preoccupation. Manoj deliberately tries to carve out visual trademarks by over-staging every scene, and this takes up a large part of the near two hours. The colour red is seen here and there, carrying ""symbolic significance"". A good director would spend his time inspiring his actors to pass for human beings, but then again, Mr. Night might not be a good director. Few characters in his pictures actually behave like real people.And acting here is non-existent. A vacuum. In Shyamalan's other movies, at least people appear to be reading from scripts. Now, Bruce Willis is one of the few remaining action stars with trace amounts of Y-chromosomes, and has charisma enough to carry a movie, but his talents for ""subtle"" drama like this are somewhat yonder. Frankly, I can't think of a less suitable actor for this kind of role (child psychologist). Sure enough, within the first five minutes we are treated to a prolonged shot of an award plaque, with Willis' wife actually spelling out for us the superlatives it contains. This is so that we'll know that Willis' character is ""brilliant"". Manoj misunderstood the concept of ""show, don't tell"", a fundamental narrative tool, which means that Willis shows us his brilliance through his actions, not by bluntly telling us ""he's brilliant!"". Low class there, but it gets even worse.The kid does nothing but whisper through the entire movie. This is his brilliant, Oscar-nominated acting? Other than that, people sit around a lot, broods a lot, whispers some more. The kid sees dead people everywhere, which gives rise to a bunch of ""scary moments"" (with loud music playing every time a closet door suddenly opens, or whatever), but without actually advancing the story. They're just there for cheesy ""Boo! I bet you didn't see THAT coming!"" effects that were old news in the '70s already. The entire middle half of the movie is superfluous and could be cut out, since it seems to have little to do with the framing device, which is Willis' character. Really, time has never moved slower than when watching this movie.As for weak horror, the kid actually states early on that the ghosts are looking for ""help"" rather than haunting or causing mischief. OK, so there is not even a threat of harm? Then what is the point of having scene after scene with ""made you jump!""-scares, when our beloved heroes are not even in danger at any one point? I'll tell you the point, the point is to water down the ""horror"" genre to be suitable for children, which ideally will broaden the revenue base. Producers didn't take long to understand this, and now this kind of diaper horror is the norm.Plot holes abound. The biggest is that Willis' dead character doesn't notice, until the very end of the movie, that nobody except the boy (who is some kind of medium) interacts with him. Willis meets with the kid in a professional context, but who made the appointment with Willis, if he was already dead? The kid himself? I don't THINK so. Later, Willis has been let into the house of the boy's mother, and the mother is actually sitting there next to him. They never interact. Yet we are to believe that Willis was let into the house and seated, and neither greeted nor was seen by the kid's mother, who was SITTING RIGHT NEXT TO HIM AT THE START OF THE SCENE. Yet another scene has dead Willis eating dinner with his wife. Apparently, they didn't speak to each other, and Willis didn't notice this? Manoj tricks the audience here, by having the wife talk to herself in such a manner that it APPEARS that she is talking to Willis.There are enough absurdities here to build a ladder to the moon, which M. Night and his fanboys have tried to justify with the cop-out notion that ""Willis only sees what he wants to see"". Neat, isn't it? Sure spares Shyamalan the effort of wrapping up the mess he created. Suffice it to say that the perhaps most telling sign of a director's incompetence is that he has to cheat his audience in order to keep the story together. Even Spielberg, the devil's handpicked lieutenant on earth, doesn't resort to this low form of audience manipulation.Personally, I find that movies that rely on gimmick twists, as opposed to honest atmosphere and ACTING, do not hold up to repeated viewings. Even if your IQ is likely to turn up on a craps roll, and you DIDN'T see the twist coming, how can you watch this hogwash over again KNOWING what will be the big surprise? The disturbing part is that millions of drugged lemmings actually DID go to see this movie a second time, to pick up all the clues that made them miss the finale the first time around. The nightman got rich, and invested his efforts in another triumphant masterpiece, ""Unbreakable"".Here's my screenplay: Bruce Willis gets shot. Dies. The end. Osment and Manoj remain unknown.Shyamalan is a disease. I've seen a number of his movies just to reassure myself, and the man is a complete criminal. I am on a crusade, and I will not rest until he is indicted for his offences against art, taste and logic.Lowest possible rating.",The Sixth Sense
1032,banjoboy,The script!!!,9,10 May 2003,"Very good movie, all in all. Bruce Willis gives a strong performance, and the script must be one of the most well written to make onto the screen in the last decade.",The Sixth Sense
1033,ckjabroni,"Great film, but definite holes in plot",6,22 October 2002,"First I would like to say that this is a great film. Secondly, I Would like to say to everyone out there who says that The Others is a Copy of this film has no concept of reality. The Others was written before this film was, so that argument can be put to rest right here. I really think this film is great, and if it didn't have the major plot holes that it does I would have given it a much higher score then I did (6/10). I have always been a fan of Bruce Willis, regardless of what is said about him I feel he is one of the better actors of the past 2 decades or so. I feel, however, that Haley Joe Osment puts in the best performance here. I don't see his career amounting to much of anything, but I think this single performance will wind up haunting him for the rest of his life because honestly, he will never grow out of it in the eyes of the audience. I feel Haley makes this film creepy, and keeps the suspense stirring throughout. I can see why Toni Collette got no nods for her performance here. Besides the scene towards the end in the car with Haley, I feel she does a below par job in this film. ***CONTAINS SPOILERS*** Ok this is where I feel the film lost a lot of luster. There were some pretty big plot holes. Everyone who hasn't seen it yet don't read on until the end of spoilers. How can malcolm not realize he is dead until the end of the film? Where does he sleep at night? I mean doesn't he realize that his wife isn't talking to, or even looking at him at all? I know they say in the film that the dead only see what they want to, but how does he explain this to himself? The other thing that really turned me off at the end was when cole had told Malcolm earlier in the film that the room becomes very cold when an ill-tempered or mean spirit enters the room. Well then why was malcolms wife freezing in the last scene when he was the only spirit in the room? He certainly didn't seem that angry to me. ***END OF SPOILERS*** Those spoilers are the reason the film goes from an 8 or 9, to a 6. There are some great scenes in this movie, and the concept is exceptional, I just wish they had tied up those loose ends. I also question the message of this film. It definitely comes off as a suspense/love story. I think anyone who likes this film will love The Others. Some people will disagree, but only because their attention span is limited. The plot to that film has zero holes in it, and is just as creepy and suspensful as this film. Overall this film is still definitely worth your time, and should be checked out!",The Sixth Sense

I was, therefore, a bit skeptical about The Sixth Sense... but the movie paid off. Very few horror films have made me feel like this one... and even fewer ever made me think like this one. That feeling when you watch a movie, and with every scene you become more eager to know what will come next is priceless, and you experience it on this film constantly. If there is anything at all bad to say about M. Night Shyamalan's masterpiece, it's that he only made one movie on this level. All of his other works are much inferior, but ""The Sixth Sense"" belongs on the top of horror film ranks, among Kubrick's ""The Shining"", ""Hitchcock's Psycho"" and ""Silence of the Lambs""",The Sixth Sense
1036,TheSloppy,A new side to horror,8,16 August 2012,"The Sixth SenseThe Sixth Sense is a film that is a 'must-watch' Bruce Willis plays his role as a psychologist excellent and aims to help a child that conquers a sixth sense. The film is based in Philadelphia in the 90's and is a mysterious horror film who Dr Malcolm Crowe (Bruce Willis) tries to communicate to Cole who is a young boy who experiences a sixth sense that is differentiating him from normal people causing him to worry his mother. The film has a sensational plot to it as it keeps you hanging off your seat and wanting to find out what will happen next. This movie keeps the audience thinking about not only what will happen next but why the things happened leaving it up to the audience to put the puzzle of the mystery together. It gives an interaction between the audience and the plot keeping the viewer thinking. I believe this is a great movie, with a variety of jaw-dropping moments throughout the movie leaving the audience in a world quite different from their own. In this horror the audience can relate to the characters as it gives a relationship to help interact with the movie and feel what is actually going on. There are also some thrilling scenes in 'The Sixth Sense' is quite frightening with some supernatural creatures that are terrifying to see, but still enough to keep watching the movie. The young boy, Cole, is considered a freak throughout the film and plays the characters role very well making the audience believe he is a freak as well. Cole is the person who experiences the 'Sixth Sense' and this is why Dr Malcolm appears to help him with his issue but Cole denies help. For the rest of the film supernatural experiences happen to the world they both live in and it all becomes a mystery.I enjoyed this movie, and believe it is an excellent movie for ages 13 years and older. This is a PG 13+ movie and but may be quite complex and misleading so some thought needs to go into what is being watched.",The Sixth Sense

But the child actor in this film was incredibly mature and feasible. The writing for this movie is some of the best, and M. Night Shyamalan really showcased his storytelling abilities with this one. The twist comes out of nowhere and hits you like a train, but in a good way.This is the first movie in a long while that I wish I could unwatch for the express purpose of experiencing the magic again.Now if only M.

1045,Saavedra,Not the usual blind praise,9,9 October 1999,"First of all, let me say that I really enjoyed this movie.  It was a great way to pass a couple of hours with friends.  I just didn't find it, the ending especially, to be the great mystery that many people did.  A friend and I figured out the final plot twist 15 minutes into the movie.  As the action continued, we found a great deal of evidence to support our theory. And at the end, we were proven correct.  In reality, I wish that I had been as surprised as most people were.  It would have made a good movie experience all the more better.  It was rather amusing to look at the faces and hear the conversations of those around us as the movie was letting out. The disbelief and shock that was evident did help compensate for the fact that we weren't equally as surprised.  This is not to take anything away from the performance of Haley Joel Osment.  He's a very gifted young actor, and his portrayal of Cole Sear gave me serious chills.  Toni Collette as his mother was also excellent.

The ending sets new standards of excellence and makes one want to march out of the theater, buy another ticket, and immediately march back in.

We got the DVD version two weeks ago and have watched it twice again. For me, this movie gets better each time I see it.The first time I didn't know what to expect and was truly surprised and stunned. The second time, knowing what was going to happen, I was able to see it from a different perspective.After the second viewing we watched the DVD extras, including an interview with M. Night Shyamalan that addressed many questions that I've seen raised here in the IMDB comments, such as why it gets very cold in some scenes and not in others, the pointed use of the color red in certain scenes, etc. That allowed me to look at the movie a third time with yet another perspective.I was able to appreciate the performances of the actors even more the second and third time around. Haley Joel Osment and Bruce Willis were nothing short of brilliant in conveying exactly what they needed to convey. Toni Colette was marvelous (the scene in the car gets me misty-eyed every time). But Olivia Williams, as Willis' wife, had one of the toughest roles, which I didn't appreciate until I saw the movie for the second time.When I read the User Comments from people who didn't like the movie, I wonder if they could possibly have seen the same movie I saw! I would highly recommmend watching the DVD version to see Shyamalan's comments, several excellent deleted scenes and lots of other goodies.",The Sixth Sense
1050,moviebuf-11,Even better days after seeing it,10,21 September 1999,"My husband and I went to see ""The Sixth Sense"" last week after hearing terrific reviews from family and friends.Nearly a week later, I still can't get the movie off my mind. DO NOT let anyone give away too many details and ruin the movie for you. But let me just say you'll think about it for days...Fans of cheap horror flicks expecting a grisly, gruesome scare-fest will no doubt be disappointed. But those who enjoy a good psychological thriller with an unusual abundance of intelligent dialogue will be glad they saw it. This movie is really mischaracterized as a horror film, which in my book is a major disservice. No hackers, slashers or cheap camera tricks here. It's a well-acted, well-written and well-directed suspense drama that really delivers.I've been a fan of Bruce Willis since his ""Moonlighting"" days. Even the most cynical critics who pigeon-hole him as just another action star will be forced to sit up and take notice of his acting in this one. And the little boy puts in a truly poignant and subtle performance for his young age. Handled by a less-adept child actor, his character easily could have been played way over the top and the movie would have been ruined.For those of you who are hesitant to see ""The Sixth Sense"" because it's marketed as a horror movie, don't let that stop you. This is a movie that merits seeing not once, but twice.",The Sixth Sense
1051,Evalina,DON'T let anyone tell you about it - go see it!!!!!!!,10,14 August 1999,"This is the absolute best movie of the summer, barely nudging out ""The Matrix.""  I went into ""The Haunting"" hoping to be scared and and enjoy a sad, mysterious ghost story.  I got neither.  ""The Sixth Sense"" gave me both!!!  I missed one of the big ""scare"" scenes because the tension was so strong - I just couldn't watch the screen, I was so scared!  I was peeking out from behind my hands for a good portion of this film!It would be a crime to say a single word about the plot; in fact, I was rather irritated that the ads for this film show what they do.  The writing, acting, and directing are all superb.  Perhaps best of all, this story has all the backbone to really hold the film up.How can I express how GOOD this child actor is???  He has all the believability and strength of Elijah Wood (who got well-deserved top billing over Kevin Costner in ""The War"") and is perhaps even more appealing.  As for Bruce Willis, I initially snickered and hoped I could enjoy the movie ""in spite"" of him - yet he was marvelous!!!  I can't think of anyone who could replace him.There have been so many disappointing movies out there lately.  Help make this worthy film a hit!!!  Go see it right away, before anything you hear or read can give away even a sliver of detail!",The Sixth Sense
1052,lennon07,This movie saved horror for me,10,17 October 1999,"When I saw this movie, I was absolutely amazed at how scary it really was. I didn't even want to go see it to begin with, having just seen the completely unscary The Haunting and The Blair Witch Project (which was an incredible film, but not as frightening as it was made out to be). I was losing my faith in horror; it seemed as if the last movie that was even remotely scary was 1980's The Shining, and even that was overlong and only littered lightly with shocks.But The Sixth Sense scared the hell out of me.My girlfriend and I had our eyes covered quite a few times, which I do not regret because I know it saved me at least some sleep last night, and the whole theater jumped on that first quick glimpse of one of them (see the movie and you'll know the one I mean).The ending, of course, was brilliant, even if it was a bit unrealistic (I've come up with many questions that can't be answered about the film). I won't go on about the acting, because everyone else already has, but I will mention what nobody ever notices except in Lawrence of Arabia where you can't miss it: The cinimatography was amazing. Every shot was perfect - not distracting, but noticible if you're looking for it.See this movie. I'll never say I hate Bruce Willis again.",The Sixth Sense
1053,frenchge,Excellent movie about a little boy coming to terms with his gift.,8,9 June 2000,"I really liked this movie. It concentrated on many different things on so many levels. It comments on the society's stigma that all spirits are bad, as Cole once thinks in the movie. But once he comes to see that they are just ex-people who are desperate for his help, he is more comfortable with things.All and all, this is a really good movie, and quite possibly the only horror flick that is meaningful and worth seeing.",The Sixth Sense
1054,cheeze71,creepy but has plot holes.,9,10 August 1999,"I admit that this movie is very dark and creepy, the emotional elements are good and the actors are good, especially the child actor Haley Joey Osment. I just fully believe in his character. He acts naturally, not the ""trying to appear mysterious"" type.  Also, it is the type of movie that make me feel uncomfortable and keep thinking afterwards. However, there are too many plot holes. I just don't understand why some ghosts can move things and some can't, why some ghosts can't see/realize their own wounds... The atmosphere is great though. Also, ghosts that walk pass like normal are much horrible than ghosts which just look scary & dangerous. The story makes me feel depressed too.",The Sixth Sense
1055,starfaz,General,10,17 September 1999,"Excellent.  Haley Osment indeed has a ""gift"".... to act!  Bruce Willis was perfect for this role; great chemistry between the two.  Like many of the other comments, I first thought the story was taking too long to move. However, I remembered the best horror is subtle horror and subtle horror takes time to develop.  There is nothing predictable about this film.  I was rewarded.",The Sixth Sense
1056,puma-4,"Great movie, Great plot",10,12 September 1999,"The plot on this movie is great. Its a very Hitchcock type plot. Excellent suspense. Best movie I've seen at the movies for quite a while. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED! Great Date movie too, your girl will be on your arm throughout. -GG",The Sixth Sense
1057,CForeman,Outstanding!,8,5 September 1999,"Wow! What a terrific movie experience. I don't see any flaws with this film - the writing, direction and acting are awesome. Haley Joel Osment is fantastic as young Cole and is on my early list for an Oscar nomination.Films like these don't come along every day. This is up there with 'The Truman Show,' 'Goodwill Hunting' and 'Saving Private Ryan' as the top films of the past half-decade.",The Sixth Sense
1058,BobbyDee-2,Disappointing,4,26 November 1999,"I""m surprised with the other comments here. In fairness this isn't necessarily the type of movie I would usually love. But I didn't even like this. Half way through I thought it was going a little slow, and was hoping it would go somewhere. It didn't. The twist at the end is nothing more than a cheap gimmick, it doesn't take much to throw that in the script, whether you saw it coming or not. The acting is ok, but at the end of the day there's not much depth or substance to this. People don't see dead people, if they did, I could easily imagine just about any other film taking the subject further. I believe to a point it even detracts or mocks a real situation where young children develop mental illnesses.",The Sixth Sense
1059,fog-6,damn good,9,3 August 1999,"I saw ""The Sixth Sense"" for the first time last night at the world premiere right here in the City of Brotherly Love. After having read the script beforehand, and after having even seen a few of the audition tapes I was very eager to view the finished product. Now, I'm going to move all my criticisms aside and say that this was a damn good film. This film is intense, uplifting, sad, and downright chilling. I tell you I will NEVER forget the scene when the amazing Haley Joel Osment, who plays the haunted little boy, Cole, is revealing to his mother, Toni Collette, his ""secret"". The chemistry between Haley and Toni is absolutely stunning.I really think that this is the BEST movie out there right now. My hats off to the writer/director M. Night Shyamalan. He will go very far--perhaps even so far as the Oscars. You never know right? One more thing, if you are at all skeptical about seeing this film, please, just see it for the ending. You won't believe what you see.",The Sixth Sense
1060,Jonrein-2,It grows on you!,10,17 August 2000,When I first watched this movie I knew nothing about it. I didn't think I liked it until the end then as things became clear it was great. You must see this movie without knowing anything about it to get the most impact. Then you will absolutely want to see it again. You must see it a second time that is when the fun begins!,The Sixth Sense
1061,r00fus,Sense-ation,10,17 August 1999,"Although I was certain this movie would suck (the trailers made this look like a supernatural action flick), I was rather impressed to see an 8.8 rating for this film here on IMDB. So I decided to go see if the rating was valid (IMDB user reviews are usually on the mark), and I was pleasantly surprised to find out it worth that and more.THe kid actor was phenomenal, Willis was a few notches above average, the camerawork by Tak (reminiscent of se7en) was excellent, and the direction by Mr. Shayamalan was impeccable (i noticed that he also has a bit part in the movie, reminding me of Hitchcock).*important: if you haven't seen this movie, don't let anyone reveal the ending for you... (there oughtta be a law!). One of the best endings I have seen in awhile.",The Sixth Sense
1062,Patti N,No expensive special effects needed!,10,16 August 1999,"This is by far the best one of the summer. Even Bruce Willis is Oscar-nomination-worthy, as well as most of the main cast! It wasn't a really ""scary"" movie, but there were a couple of remove-the-seat-from-your-behind moments. Don't let anyone tell you the ending! The last 10 minutes take a totally unexpected twist. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who wants to challenge his or her intelligence.",The Sixth Sense
1063,JSmart,May be my favorite of the year,9,12 August 1999,"As a big Star Wars fan that is tough to handle, but I think I was more impressed by this film than anything I've seen this year.  Chilling vision of what might be.  It was able to give me a jump even when I was expecting it.  More important, it gives chills (i.e. it gets you in the back of the mind).Five stars out of four for Haley Osment.  Maybe Jake Lloyd (Anakin Skywalker) can learn something about expression and emotion.  He gave one of the best acting performance I have seen from someone of that age bracket. In fact, despite being just over 10, he could teach several older actors a thing or two.Don't want to say much because a movie based on suspense really sucks if you know what happens so I'll just end with ""A must see""",The Sixth Sense
1064,beeza,Spooky Stuff,10,4 April 2000,"Even if someone has told you what the twist is at the end, as in my case, it is still worth going to see the film, because how the story is executed is very clever and utterly brilliant. I didn't find the film scary in ""The Omen"" or ""The Changeling"" sense, which I think is the whole point. Although there are some ""jumpy"" moments (the music doesn't help), the overall impression is that we should have sympathy for those who have passed away and for some reason, cannot rest.  If you believe in that sort of thing of course.....",The Sixth Sense
1065,PEPPER-36,Best last 15 minutes since Usual Suspects,10,5 September 1999,"I'm not a big ""horror"" movie fan, so I was hesitant about seeing this movie. But with it being the No. 1 movie for 4 weeks, I had to see what all the noise was about.  After seeing it once, I have to see it again, just to see what I missed the first time.  The ending is the best since ""Usual Suspects"". I didn't see that one coming either. This movie is a must see (at least twice.)",The Sixth Sense
1066,Juliokal,Go See This Movie,10,7 August 1999,"This movie is a classic.  It starts of a little slow, but after a half an hour the theatre was enraptured.  The movie is so well acted, it can not be believed.  The final half an hour is a work of art.  PLEASE don't let anyone spoil the ending for you.  I don't give A+ liberally, but this one deserves it!",The Sixth Sense
1067,Ronny-11,Last masterpiece of the 20th century,10,10 April 2000,"This movie really shows, that today's movies don't have to be mainstream, not-innovative, pseudo-intellectual and flat-plotted. Instead it shows, that good film-making also can be achieved by stuff, producers normally would go mad about - such a movie as ""The 6th Sense"". With no big publicity at all (at least here in Germany) this film started in December last year and went straight to #1, leaving ""block busters"" as Schwarzenegger's ""End of Days"" etc. far, far behind. The story is awesome - M. Night Shyamalan did a great job and the way HOW he tells the story and brings it to the audience reminded me of the perfection of Alfred Hitchcock; even when Cole and Doctor Crowe stand in front of a door with a knob, you just see Cole being mirrored in the metallic surface, although Crowe stands right by his side. And when the plot reveals that Dr. Crowe actually died right at the beginning of the movie and you resume Cole's words of ""I see dead people..."" it makes you shivering although the movie ended - and the impact is even bigger while watching the movie a second time. Its ""silent"" horror combined with a tragic story of both Malcolm and Cole and Willis' and Osment's overwhelming acting makes this film a real masterpiece. Not honored by the Academy at all, it just shows that the movie is too good for the Oscars - it is just not mainstream, not-innovative, pseudo-intellectual and flat-plotted, and with all these points it's no real film for the Academy; normally I see Oscars in important categories as a warning that the film is bad, and once again I have been encouraged to keep this another year; last time it was this lame mainstreamer ""Titanic"" and this time we had ""American Beauty"". Poor Academy! Maybe next time. For me the winner of the Oscar for at least ""Best Film"" and ""Best Supporting Actor"" is ""The 6th Sense"" and Haley Joel Osment.",The Sixth Sense
1068,lfzi,What's the big deal? (This review may contain some spoliers),4,21 January 2000,"Reading all your enthusiastic comments about this film... Knowing that it was one of the big hits of the summer in the USA and the rest of the world... Hearing that common people and movie critics (even Maltin) loved this film...After all that my expectations about ""The Sixth Sense"" were ""knocking on heaven's door""... and it really hurts to fall from there, my friends!!""The Sixth Sense"" was, at last, showed in my country this month and I virtually ran to the theater to be one of the first to watch it. I was very careful to avoid reading too much about the plot, because I had heard that there was a ""great"" twist, and I didn't want to ruin the surprise. I've never been so disappointed.The fatal flaws:1. The trailer was too explicit: So I think that everybody already knew the Cole's secret (""I see dead people""). Then the scene where the boy tells Willis his ""secret"" (after an hour of boring round and round, without important scenes, with the good doctor trying to find out the ""secret""), is as cold as The Haunting's ""scares"". It's just uneffective and predictable, there's no surprise, actually there's no any feelings or sensations at all.2. Wwhhyy It's ssssoooo ssllooww ppaacceedd???: I would have appreciated this movie if it had been released last year because I had some problems to sleep. I would have a good time (sleeping) at the movies. There are too many unnecessary scenes and the actors seems to be speaking t-o  a  f-i-v-e  y-e-a-r-'s  o-l-d  c-h-i-l-d. Without the commercials, and X-Files episode goes by 40 minutes length. There's more substance. And ""The Sixth..."" is a 2 hour feature.
3. The twist: Movies like ""The Crying Game"", ""The Usual Suspects"" or ""Fight Club"", would have been stunning movies even if the screenwriter wouldn't have added their great twists that made them unforgettable films. Why? Well, because the rest of their stories were great. In ""The Sixth Sense"", if you're a middle-skilled watcher, you'll discover the ""famous"" twist after 10 minutes, and it will ruin your experience, because the rest of the movie does nothing else that ""almost scream-it-on-your-face"". The story isn't interesting, because you already know all that could be interesting.4. The scares / The end: Two scares, one for hour. Happy end. Think in a cross between ""The Shining"" (Great film!) and ""Good Will Hunting"" (not bad). Isn't it like Coke with Corn Flakes?
The Best scare:What happened you, Donnie Whalberg!!!!????I rate this one: 1. (It's a shame we can't vote 0) I feel guilty because Osment does a great effort, but the rest of you, voters, have put this film to close-of-the-top, and I think that It has to be placed in the right place (out of the top 100, at least).",The Sixth Sense
1069,Marl-2,A true classic...,9,9 October 1999,"Great movie, bound to be a cult-classic in years to come.  Ranks up there with The Exorcist in horror films.  Excellent performance by Bruce Willis, who will be probably nominated for some award.  A must see, but not for the faint-hearted type.",The Sixth Sense
1070,kat13,Rememberingly Haunting,9,28 August 1999,"It's been four days since I've seen this and still haven't figured out how I didn't see the ending coming and the ""hints"" WERE there. The casting was right on the money. Bruce was great and I'm sure we'll see lots more of his bright young co-star! This is story telling of Hitchcock callaber or better. A must see, must own a copy of movie!",The Sixth Sense
1071,Lanquist,Horror turns to healing. . .,9,4 September 1999,"I had only heard good things about this film before I saw it but all of them were cryptic affirmations.  Needless to say I went in ""thinking"" it was a good film.  I was not disappointed.  The cinematography was superb with it's cold autumn color palette.  The child star was truly remarkable.  Bruce Willis was refreshingly restrained.  It never ceases to amaze me when he pulls subtley off so very well.  However, the thing that impressed me most was the positive ending to the whole thing.  Instead of your usual tragi-violent or ""sequel ready"" horror film ending, you had a real healing kind of ending.  this was the most refreshing aspect of the film.  But with such a slow, methodical pacing it surprises me that it is such a hit with the action hungry American audiences.  Definately worth the watch.",The Sixth Sense
1072,mazurj,not all that,2,22 August 1999,"I would place this movie in the ""nondescript"" category. The acting was definitely very good, but I guess my blah reaction is caused by everybody else's reaction to ""that cool ending."" Come ON, people!!!! I knew nothing about this movie when I walked into the theatre (except that it was apparently a clever movie), and I was able to figure out the ending within the first half hour. It was that obvious. It seemed to me as if the screenwriters were having such a good chuckle knowing what the ending was going to be that they kept beating you over the head with little inside-joke clues. Frankly, I felt as if I were bleeding from being beaten over the head during the hospital scene and the jewelry store scene. If those two scenes had not been so incredibly overdone, then I would have been a lot more surprised at the end.",The Sixth Sense
1073,cyberpie,Worth watching,10,3 November 1999,One of the best movies that combines horror and human drama so well that it is almost seamless.The twist at the finale must count as one of the finest -- at least it had me hitting my head for not realising it earlier.Bruce Willis also establishes himself here as a actor.,The Sixth Sense
1074,Cabrito,"I see dead people, you see dead people",10,31 October 1999,"A very cleverly written movie, not unlike The Usual Suspects in that regard. It all hangs together and I had as much fun after the movie mentally recalling and validating how the staging, dialogue, and mood all fit the plot scheme.  Fine acting too, though as often happens in such cases the two protagonists should have received star billing -- Oscar supporting role prospects notwithstanding.",The Sixth Sense
1075,Mr. Loew,A fantastic experience,10,10 December 1999,"This is clearly one of the best movies of the year, along with Matrix and Fight Club. What makes it so special is the incredibly complex story, the great cast and the dark style. You can watch it over and over, you will not be able to find any weaknesses in the entire movie. The story manages to combine emotional themes with stunning fear and darkness. It will scare you like ""the exorcist"" and thrill you like ""the shawshank redemption"". It is nice to see that there is finally a young actor with REAL talent. We have had enough of those terrible grown-up-wannabes like Jake Lloyd. Osment is very realistic, and together with the rest of the cast he gives you a great performance. The dark style creates an atmosphere that keeps you nailed to the screen. It is good to finally see a horror film without teen-slashing and cheap effects.The Sixth Sense - Watch it and love it. ""10""",The Sixth Sense
1076,mvhoore,This movie really scares me.,9,11 February 2000,In my opinion this is really the best horror picture of last year. Far better than The Blair Witch. The young boy acts impressive. He looks really feared and confused. Bruce Willis is also good although awards are a bit too much for his performance.The change in the story at the end is great. I didn't realize the clues that were given although I have to watch it a second time to see if it's all correct. The whole atmosphere of the film made me think of the Exorcist a couple of times. Of course the little child but also the old house where he and his mother live and the dark interior of it. Look out for the small but important role of Donnie Wahlberg in the beginning of the film,The Sixth Sense

Not to say at least; Haley Joel Osment who played his part so brilliant that you almost think he was living this nightmare, wish showed to have a purpose. I think Osment was ripped off for an Oscar, even thou Michael Caine is a blast as usual in the Cider House Rules. Toni Colette, the Australian actress playing Osments mother also deserve attention. She lives out her role at the most intense moments. She is even a pretty lady. I first saw her in Muriel's Wedding, also an extraordinary movie.I recommend this movie to anyone, like myself who love movies.Go see it.10 out of 10",The Sixth Sense

His performance is brilliant, especially considering his age.  Bruce Willis is understated in his role as a child psychologist.  In fact, just about any actor could have played this role. Willis' name attracts people to a film they might ordinarily have ignored. In fact, the movie trailer itself might keep some people away from this film in fear that it is a horror flick.  In fact, the trailer doesn't do the movie justice.The Sixth Sense is a thriller, but more than that, it is about people and their fear.

1082,gumplord,Brilliant performance in a difficult role,9,23 March 2000,"I went to see this movie for one reason; the advertised subject matter alone would not have been enough to coax me into driving to the theatre. When I noticed that Haley Osment had a lead role (or, technically, a ""supporting"" role, but I don't buy that-- he is the lead in this one), I knew it was something to check out.  I recalled seeing him several years younger in that shortly-lived sitcom ""Thunder Alley"" with Jonathan Winters, and I remember having had the distinct impression that he had talent, and that I should keep an eye out for him in the future.  I saw this movie very early following its release, well before word had really spread about how great his performance was, so I can honestly say other peoples' opinions had no influence on my perception.  Anyway, I came out of the theatre thinking this kid was truly brilliant, in a role very difficult for most child actors to pull off even well.  I felt, and still feel, that Haley's performance-- and only his-- made this movie first class.  At the time, I thought he should get an Oscar, but I never thought he stood a chance.  I'm glad others have noticed him in this one.",The Sixth Sense

The whole time I watched this movie I was bored out of my mind. The little trick ending could not even save this terrible excuse of a movie. I highly recommend that if you are thinking of seeing this movie forget about and pick up a copy of the much more exciting and thrilling Stir of Echoes. If you have already seen Stir of Echoes then get Little Monsters because The Sixth Sense is pure torture. Bruce Willis does a god awful job and that kid hardly acts at all.

I guess that I would have enjoyed it more if I hadn´t been told or seen in the advertising some of the movie.  Personally, I wouldn´t grade it as a horror movie because even when some parts can give you goosebumps, you cannot be scared afterwards by it.

Well I have to SPOIL, you're warned :So the guy is dead. And he notices that when he sees his wife crying over his wedding ring or whatever (I can't remember exactly). And that's supposed to be very powerful. In fact we're given clues (no one ever really speks to him, but it's not very obvious so you can't guess). Well, that's just PLAIN STUPID ! How can the guy hang around for month without noticing he's dead ??? - No one speaks to him - How can he open doors ? Does he walk through walls ? - How can he eat ? If he doesn't then he should realize there's something weird, shouldn't he? etc etc etc (See slothfratelli's review, it's more complete !! ) In one word it is impossible. I really felt cheated when I saw this. So, please if you liked the end, check it twice : you've been cheated.By the way, I read some reviews where the author supposedly guessed everything and found this movie predictable. I wonder how you can predict such an illogical end. Really, I wonder.Above all, I still don't understand why such a small amount of people noticed the conclusion of this movie was awfully illogical (less than 10% if we admit IMDB reviews are statistically representative).Considering all this, the 6th sense deserves no more than 4/10.",The Sixth Sense

Nothing much happens but it keeps your attention. I know this is sounding like a Budweiser Light 'Contradictions' advert but I really felt like I hadn't really watched a full-length film just a short. This isn't a scary movie, ok I did jump once but it isn't even as scary as the Blair Witch Project (which, lets face it, wasn't that scary at all!) The film is better if you know absolutely nothing about the film not even what the kid can do so don't read the synopsis just watch it! Everyone is acting on best form, even Bruce but especially the kid, they all deserve an Oscar (well ok then maybe just a Golden Globe) And yes, the twist is as good as everyone says it is.",The Sixth Sense

The twist at the end makes the viewer think and want to watch it again to look for clues. M. Night Shyamalan's subtle way of directing is perfect for the film and holds suspense.

1095,plabelle-1,It failed to grab me but that doesn't make it a bad movie.,6,28 August 2001,"I'm one of those ""unfortunate beings"" who viewed the movie in video a year after its release when its reputation was still strong among movie goers.My philosophy is that a good movie can be enjoyed and appreciated wether it's seen on the big or the small screen.Before handing out the bad notes, I'll give it the credit it deserves for certain aspects. First, both the photography and camera work are superb. Haley Joel Osment plays very well (his talent was confirmed in the recently released ""AI""). Willis is also good but, IMO, he didn't seem to fit well in that part of a child psychologist. I'll blame it on the amount of action movies he played in.The plot is undeniably the strongest element of the movie, it is quite effective (although, I think, it would've made a deeper impact on me if I had experienced it in book form). And most of the technical aspects like lighting, editing and even the soundtrack deserve good marks.So, what's wrong with The Sixth Sense??All through the movie, I had the feeling (not sense!) that I was in a Stephen King movie. And ya know: this story of a little kid who sees ghosts that died tragically (but no one ever sees them) and his worried mother wants to help him get through this psychological problem... Doesn't it remind you of another horror movie by the late great Stanley Kubrick??Well I found that annoying. And that's not the only thing.As I wrote above, the plot may be brilliant but its ""well oiled"" logic is somewhat flawed.[WARNING: IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THE MOVIE YET, THE FOLLOWING COMMENTS MAY ACT AS SPOILERS!] Not shouting, just warning.1. If I was in a house where my husband or my wife had been murdered before my very eyes, I wouldn't stay in that place for long. I'd quickly put the house for sale, pack up my things and leave! Move on to another place, as far as possible. Wouldn't you?? So why is Anna still holed up in that house six months after Malcolm's death??(Oh yeah, it serves the interest of the story. She has to have a last minute encounter with the ghost of her husband so they can bid farewell to each other.)2. In the story where the little girl is gradually poisoned by her evil stepmother: it's amazing to see how a small child can effectively hide and position the videocam that records the evidence that will later incriminate the murderess. Everything is recorded at the right angle (the girl probably asked her mother to stand on a piece of tape on the floor while she prepared the tainted potion!!) with the prime suspect never ever suspecting anything (she also never cleaned up her daughter's bedroom or if she did, her clever daughter would already have hidden the camera under the covers!!)If you were guilty of murdering your own daughter, would you go ahead and wear a vivid red dress at her funeral while everbody dressed in darker or somber clothing?? (Ah! But the color red serves a purpose here! It's evidence, cleverly planted by Mr. Night Shyamalan himself to cue us in to important things!!) Yeah, sure. Please don't give me that crap that ""people with a guilty conscience betray themselves in such manners"".If you're ready to believe that, you're ready for anything. Including the fact that it took Crowe six months and the help of a psychic kid to realize that he was only the ghost of himself. (It took Patrick Swayze less than six minutes in Ghost, I guess Willis must be getting old and a little slow!;-)Anyway, I'll stop here. I guess the reason why I didn't enjoy this movie, as much as the majority of people, is because I was distracted and annoyed by all these details.I know some people saw the movie 5 times and even more. I saw it once and it's enough for me.Hope I didn't offend anyone.",The Sixth Sense

In total there are two secrets in the movie, the 1st one is obvious to the viewers, but the second one comes at the end and is totally surprising. Great acting and dialogs by the Doctor and the child. Time and attention given to the very details of emotions of love and fear.

Bruce Willis fits the role well, and the little kid (Osment) is great. What should be notice even more is what an extraordinary job Toni Collette did in this movie. The scene where they (Osment and Collette) are in the car and he says to his ""mother"" that he is a freak, Collette's emotional reaction is so realistic. I have the greatest respect for her talent after that. I think she deserves greater roles.Shyamalan hasn't been able to make or write a single piece of good movie making ever since, which makes me suspect he had a lot of help on Sixth Sense. Someone with real talent and skill would not just sink from great to rock bottom. I almost want to attribute the Sixth Sense to someone else.",The Sixth Sense

One of the biggest wastes of time I ever experienced, and that includes my environmental science class from high school.This movie was not only stupid and a waste of Bruce Willis' talent, but it was also insulting to the viewers intelligence.  There are holes in the plot large enough to move troops through which are covered up by silly lines and ghosts.  This movie is an over produced monstrosity which should be avoided at all costs. If this movie is hailed as a classic after I'm gone from this world, I'll be rolling in my grave.",The Sixth Sense
1102,igiskos2,First of a kind,3,28 June 2004,"This was the first Shymalan's flick and i have to say that he made a good work creating a dark environment which is essential for a thriller. I guess the end was also a bit unexpected which gave some points on the project. Thats all with the positive side of the film. I'm afraid that the negative overcomes the positive easily. When i first saw this film i thought it was OK. I gave the creator the benefit of the doupth since it was his first movie and all.This changed rapidly after watching his second movie.You see i didn't like the first one, i didn't liked it at all, but i convinced myself i didn't hate it cause i thought the director, as a first timer, having a low budget to work with he presented at least a honest effort to the public. Later on, after i watched Unbreakable and realized that this was the way that M.N.Shyamalan really wanted to direct i let myself free and expressed my true opinion. This movie sucked as his second one. The budget of the flick wasn't small(we are talking about 60.000.000 dollars) and the absence of the visual F\X wasn't something of a trick to cover the absence of money in production. The Matrix was shoot with the same amount of money and you can see where the money went. Here nothing really happens. The action is slow, the acting is just tolerable and the script was a bit boring except the very original ending. This is one of the few ghost stories that i've seen with absolutely no visual effects(the others were mostly b-movies and low budget cults which by the way i enjoyed more). I don't want to get into details but i've also noticed some mistakes-gups in the script which, i'm sure, most of the people that have seen this film also noticed. The only thing that's annoying for me is the money that this film gathered at the box office, which were a lot. Watching all of Syamalans films makes me believe that he tricks people to watching them. He selects catchy topics for his movies and then he plays a game. The game is shooting the movies using minimum f\x trying to gather maximum people at the cinemas. I can say that he does this with success but i think that he is already a castaway in the minds of the true Sci-Fi of Horror fans. Don't take me wrong, i'm not into senseless use of CGI effects which can turn a movie in a video game(see Van Helsing) but when the topic is from the world of fantasy the director should add effects and substance creating a unique result.Anyway i believe that people who haven't already seen the ""Sixth Sense"" should probably do it but i ""sense"" that this will be a one way ride and probably will never watch it again......I sure didn't.",The Sixth Sense
1103,trampoline,Answers to eternal questions,9,22 July 2006,"""The Sixth Sense"" is a powerful movie starring Bruce Willis as a damaged child psychologist attempting to treat a young misfit played by Haley Joel Osment. Willis' Dr. Crowe is certain that Osment's fatherless, tormented Cole is suffering from delusional paranoia and because he has failed a previous patient with similar ills, he is more determined to cure the boy's emotional and psychological hauntings. Crowe has his own internal misgivings for his wife is painfully estranged and appears to ignore his very existence. Cole's mother is unsettled by injuries and events that the child says are caused by ghosts. This film also contains a secret within its finely tailored plot that contributed to its huge mass and critical appeal. When I watch this film , I too get caught up in trying to have its secret revealed to me visually and/or verbally. But the ""gimmick"" or secret is so exquisitely crafted that its divulgence comes as a complete surprise chiefly because the writing and the acting are wonderfully first rate. The play upon our human vulnerabilities such as death, loneliness, fear and separation glues us to this ""ghost"" story. Although we may not trust nor agree with Shyamalan's ideas, this film will capture those who see it as a plausible, nonsecular representation of death and the afterlife. Shyamalan's direction is unfrivolous and well-paced. Osment's Oscar-nominated performance is genuinely heart-wrenching. A superb film.",The Sixth Sense
1104,PlanetBloopy,The worst film ever in my opinion,1,9 April 2020,"I suppose we should all have an answer when someone asks what the worst/your most hated film is. The Sixth Sense is that film for me. Perhaps it's relevant that I felt more immature than most of my friends who were hooked by it at the time. I actually avoided all spoilers and saw it a year or so later on free-to-air TV when I was about 16. It was marketed as a thriller/horror, but it came across as a boring, depressing drama full of crying to the point that I didn't give it my full attention. I kept the TV on but I stopped caring long before the ending was revealed.If I'd first seen it as an adult, I might have a slightly different story, but it's too late. The nature of The Sixth Sense means that it only has one chance to be effective and repeat viewings are laughable. When films grow on you and you enjoy little things you didn't discern the first time around, they're the best. So The Sixth Sense truly is the opposite of the best. It's a film where the more you watch it, the more you notice things wrong with it, until that's practically all you can focus on.It'd be understandable if only bits such as the restaurant scene came across as unnatural. But to me, the most unnatural element is the way Cole's mother treats him. She's surprisingly curt and unmotherlike considering his young age, which only helps to disrupt any suspension of disbelief I had in what I'm seeing. The couple of gross-out/scare moments thrown in are out of place and an insult to horror fans. Such paltry crumbs make me feel that a movie is just scoring marketing points and the real target audience is my wallet or advertising viewership. It's as if they think a sappy drama with a few horror moments resolves to a gritty thriller on average in the audience's mind. I may be mature now, but I still absolutely loathe sappy dramas and these wrongs do a great job of making the film even that much worse.",The Sixth Sense

So I went to the movie theater expecting a great suspense thriller and left my seat at the end of the movie feeling that I had seen something that totally transcended my expectations. I was totally stunned.While it can be compared to the archetypal horror film because of some of its arguably shoddy scares, the denouement gives it a totally different, much greater magnitude that sets it apart from all mediocre Hollywood horror movies. It meant something more special to me because I didn't go as far as interrogating why Malcolm Crowe was being ignored by his wife and went ahead and assumed that they had a bad breakup or something! The ending gave it all clarity, and it was a darn good twist. It left my mouth hanging open for a few minutes. My friends and I were like, ""Are you? Oh my"" It was great. I think Haley Joe Osment's acting was excellent also. His eyes were so expressive, I could feel every bit of his terror! This movie haunted me and my friends for months.

The performances from the boy and his mother were very natural...and Bruce Willis gives one of his best performances *ever*.  The lighting, music and script are similarly excellent.One interesting feature is that many of the scenes begin with a ""pillow shot"" (a Japanese technique where incongruous scenes of nature ""pillow"" the area between scenes...a cinematic pause, if you will).  Except where the typical pillow shot is a stream, mountain or seashore (see the works of Takeshi ""Beat"" Kitano for examples), these shot in ""The Sixth Sense"" are dark, brooding, somber and sometimes menacing.

How long has it been since you've felt compelled to sit down and just *talk* about a movie? For me, it had been quite a while and then I went and saw The Sixth Sense. And I left the cinema having been both scared and moved. I'd had goosebumps, a big smile on my face, and tears in my eyes just over one movie.The acting is seamless - Oscar nominations for the three leads, please! - the cinematography is so moody, as is the music, and the script is SO different from anything you're likely to come across in a long time.Yes, the movie has a twist, and, yes, the movie would have been great even without the twist. BUT what is important to me, personally, is not the nature of the twist. It's the fact that here is a movie with a BRAIN. Unlike the ending of The Usual Suspects which was great but in the end just made me feel manipulated and cheated, when The Sixth Sense twist happens you will inevitably go ""Oh THAT'S why..."" and you will want to see the movie again because you know that it'll be a totally different movie the next time you watch it. The whole premise has changed. In fact, this is two movies in one! A scary story about a boy seeing ghosts and a touching story about... :) See for yourself!!!I cannot recommend this movie enough. Unless you are very cold-hearted or have a short attention span (Yes, unlike so many modern-day movies, this one actually requires that you feel and think as well as concentrate on what's going on), you will love it and you will want to go back to it again, because although close scrutiny will reveal holes in the plot, it's a cracking good story that leaves you *thinking*.

1116,pahool,"Mediocre, at best.",5,11 September 1999,"(This might be considered a minor spoiler, I guess.)Yet another summer 1999 movie that just doesn't live up to it's own hype. This one was not as disappointing as The Matrix, but it's disappointing nonetheless.Having seen the preview, and hearing that there was a surprise ending, I was able to deduce exactly what it was. As will anyone who spends 10 seconds to think about it. Come on! This one is a no-brainer! Even if you can't puzzle it through before going to see the movie, you get pounded over the head with it enough to figure it out in the first half hour or so.
Ever since Braveheart won the best picture academy award, I've been convinced that there must be some mind-numbing chemical in the American water supply or something. When the Sixth Sense is called an ""intelligent"" movie by critics, something is very very wrong.Having said that, it's not an absolutely horrible movie. The acting is passable, and the story is somewhat interesting. The slower pace is admirable in a time when most movies seem to be focused on special effects like exploding tits every thirty seconds, and it worked well toward contributing to the aura of the film.But the film wasn't really scary. A couple of ""Boo!"" type scenes, but nothing that really got inside me that much. I hate to make the comparison that everyone else seems to be making but I've got to say that ""The Blair Witch Project"" was infinitely more scary and effective.If you want to see a couple creepy surprise-ending films, go rent ""Jacob's Ladder"" and ""Angel Heart"" both are much more scary, interesting, and smart, and both deserve your attention much more than ""The Sixth Sense.""",The Sixth Sense

There was even some humor, although it did little to ease the tension.Kudos to the actors in the film... I have to admit, I'd never considered Bruce Willis much of a dramatist before I saw this one.  And, while I'm usually skeptical of movies that have small children in them (I'm always afraid they're just in for ""cute"" value), Haley Joel Osment was actually very, very good.  One performance that I'm sure will be overlooked is Cole's mother, played by Toni Collette.  I was very impressed by the realism she gave her role.The only thing that I didn't understand about the movie was the ""surprise"" ending.  I figured it out a good 15 minutes into the movie, and was sort of amazed at all the people going ""what?"" and ""oh my gosh"" when they revealed it; I kept expecting some other secret to pop up.

Though the acting is excellent throughout most of the movie, it is not ""Oscar-worthy"" as many have claimed.  Also, it's not as original a movie as many critics have said.

1125,scarrow,Entertaining AND Intelligent,10,8 August 1999,Not since The Matrix have I seen a movie that truly integrates entertainment with intelligence. And not since Dark City have I seen such a fulfilling and totally unexpected twist at the end. Bruce Willis is surprisingly competent in this film and Haley Joel Osment comes up with possibly the best child acting job EVER!The Sixth Sense is currently my 2nd favourite movie of the year (The Matrix Baby!). 5 stars!,The Sixth Sense
1126,Jackass-5,"Great Ending! Very surprising, but excellent!",10,19 August 1999,"At first I thought the movie would be really creepy and be all about ghosts and stuff, but the plot was really good.  I thought the writing was excellent.  Haley Joel Osment is a great actor for being such a little kid. The ending is my all time favorite ending that I have ever seen- and I've seen a lot of movies.  I was not expecting it at all, and it didn't quite make sense but at the end my friends and I discussed it and it all fit right in place.  I really enjoyed it and have told everyone I've seen to go watch it.  I give it a 3 thumbs up and a perfect 10.0!  It's wonderful!",The Sixth Sense
1127,Haleys Comet,"Hollywood, this is what movie watchers want to see.",9,26 August 1999,"The Sixth Sense takes an emotional trip into the world of a little boy full of fear and desperation.   Malcolm Crowe (Bruce Willis), a renowned child psychologist sees a chance at redemption and validation in Cole Sear (Haley Joel Osment), a quite, compassionate child that has symptoms uncannily similar to those of Dr. Crowe's previous failed patient. Sixth shows a very human foundation, pulling viewers through an emotional roller coaster of suspense, glimmers of hope, and a corkscrew of a plot twist at the end that will have you doing double takes.  Bruce Willis shows his talent by playing an unusually passive role and allowing focus to fall on Haley Osment's projection of despair.  Haley's brilliance seems to outshine his age and reach to the level of ability far beyond that of a stereotypical child actor.  Sixth doesn't fall into a specific genre, which only helps to increase its believability factor.  Because the camera puts there with Cole through his most personal experiences, you feel his suffering, and understand his despair.  Hollywood, this is what movie watchers want to see. No more mindless psychobabble, outrageously and unbelievably monotonous plot lines and stiff, corpse-like performances (no pun intended).  Let The Sixth Sense stand as a pinnacle for others in the movie industry to admire.Final Rating:Acting: * * * * *, Plot: * * * *, Dialogue: * * * *, Believability: * * * * *, Suspense Factor: * * *, Drama Factor: * * * * *27/30 = 4.5 stars or 9.0 out possible 10.Predictions for Oscar Nominations:Best Film - The Sixth Sense, Best Actor - Bruce Willis, Best Supporting Actor - Haley Joel Osment, Best Screenplay - M.

Of course, the end might be the greatest part of the movie, but I thought the slow clues were the things that made the movie so addicting that you wanted to find out where it was all going to lead.I think the Blair Witch movie is more for teenagers who are just looking for a scary movie.

His role was a little out of character for John Mclane/Korben Dallas.  Anyway, when I saw the sneak of this movie, I thought it was very well done.

1135,muskrat-4,No surprise to me,9,8 August 1999,"Several reviewers noted that there was a ""surprise"" ending that changed the whole tone of the film. I was so easily able to figure out what was going on, almost immediately, it gave me a change to see how the ""secret"" was kept up -- I wonder if it was intended as a ""surprise"" in the sense of ""The Crying Game,"" or if the reviewers were just dense (Imagine!). Relative to my own density, I'd appreciate anybody explaining the scene in the jewelry store -- what did it have to do with anything? Did I fall asleep during a crucial moment?",The Sixth Sense

1137,Lisa M.,Worth the ticket price,8,23 August 1999,"I liked this movie.  It was perhaps not fair to The Sixth Sense that the night before I rented ""Seven"" and was on the edge of my seat the entire time (if you haven't seen Seven yet, rent it!), so this film was probably unfairly influenced by my having seen an incredibly tightly written and acted thriller the night before.  Still, The Sixth Sense is a fine movie with plenty of psychological suspense.  I liked the premise -- that the spirits of dead people can communicate with certain ""chosen"" ones among us -- and the ending is indeed totally unexpected, as I'd read on this site. The young actor who plays Cole, Haley Joel Osment, was excellent in portraying a terrified child who doesn't want the gift he was born with, and even Bruce Willis was decent (I don't usually like Willis's acting, which I think is typically one dimensional, not to mention his trade-mark smirk).

1139,Melody-10,An emotional and physically tearing film.,9,24 August 1999,"The Sixth Sense, has quite the potential to be nominated for Best Picture come oscar night. You're probably asking why. Well, it's better than your standing Bruce Willis-Helps-A-Kid movie, because well it's not like that type of movie. ""The Sixth Sense"" is not at all similar to ""Mercury Rising"", which some people were saying before the film came out. Bruce Willis is probably in his best film role in years as Dr. Malcolm Crowe, the psychologist who's patient Cole Sears (Haley Jole Osment is wonderful as the young child, should get some oscar potential as well) has the ability, to, well, you know. Toni Collete is good as Cole's mother who wants to know what's wrong with him. Olvia Williams is also quite good as Malcolm's wife. The director and writer of the film, M. Night Shyamalan's script WORKS because of Cole's terrified vision. Cole enters another world with us, and we explore that world. Have I said enough? Probably so.

This is a excellent movie; we've had gore-fests, we've had horror-parody, now is the time for the return of the *intelligent* horror story.'The Sixth Sense' works it's magic by suggestion; by simply going *just* far enough from normality that the viewer spooks themselves.There are a couple of moments to make you jump, just to make sure you are in the right frame of mind; there are a few unpleasant ghouls, but this is no Clive Barker fright-a-thon.From those simple elements it builds slowly (perhaps a little too slowly) and you start to share in the torment of young Cole as he searches for an escape from all the ""dead people"" who inhabit his world. Eventually psychologist Crowe offers a way out and you sense that the film will have a happy ending and that, as it were, the ghosts will be laid to rest. But no, just when you start thinking all is well with the world, the *real* truth is revealed.It's not a 'Carrie' style heart-stopping moment, but the final twist is so brilliantly played out, you can't help but go back and revisit all those key moments that suddenly make a totally different sort of sense.The beauty, the magic, of this film is provided by the two splendid performances from young Osement (Cole) and Willis (Crowe) drawing you effortlessly into their world, making the unreal palpably real.Knowing that there is a big 'twist' to this film, you may well be able to work it out for yourself, but even if you do, you will surely enjoy this beautifully crafted film, a film that puts the magic back into the telling of ghost stories.",The Sixth Sense
1143,icarus-11,very disappointing,6,21 April 2000,"I already saw this movie a couple of months ago, but decided to send in a review after all because it just got way too many credits. I was horribly disappointed. First of all, how could anyone call this a horror movie, it's a psychological drama with only one or two scenes that could be described as -slightly- creepy. It's not a bad movie, it just doesn't do much to me, there's no thrills, no false scares, the few ghosts are all very tame and in my opinion the little kid was pretty annoying. The movie goes on and on in the same pace, doesn't have any real highlights, no memorable moments, and the end (though it was kinda interesting) wasn't the roaring climax i was secretly hoping for.

It's so well crafted, so well made, so well conceived, it'll be a crime if it doesn't scoop the Oscars. Anyone who didn't like it simply didn't GET it.Like that other phenomenal blockbuster of 1999, The Matrix, the intertwined story is presented in an unusual and intelligent manner. You do have to think about what you're watching. And you find yourself mentally reviewing the storyline the more you watch.I wondered while watching it why so many people had gone to see such a cerebral film more than once - until the shattering denouement. Suddenly, the whole film falls into place and hits you like a sledgehammer. The boy's performance is inspirational, but with the realisation of that ending, it moves onto a whole other level.If you want to hear a cinema audience go suddenly silent more than once, this is the film to see. I cannot recommend it enough for serious cinemagoers.",The Sixth Sense
1147,frederikos.nikolis,an interesting film that doesn't deliver,8,23 January 2000,"After seeing the trailer from the 6th sense I didn't have the intention of going to see this film immediatly.Everything looked and sounded (the whispering in the trailer still gets on my nerves) very pottered. Thankfully the film itself is better made. In essence this is a simple story about to lost souls and their search for a comprehensive life. The film itself revolves around the surprise ending, which I didn't find surprising at all. In fact watching (and not looking) at this story gives away the ending about 45 minutes into the film. To achieve this ending a lot of scenes feel also pottered and unbelievable. Once again this is a film where characters and plotlines seem to revolve around the story,normally a story is build upon characters and the succession of events and plots. Still we are left with an interesting film thanks to M.Night Shyamalan great acting-direction and his visual flair. Some of the scenes are real terrifying examples of horror. Both Willis an H.J. Osment, cool, performances give the film an extra edge. But the real surprise was the performance of T. Collette. Her performance doesn't have one false moment as the even more scared mother. Even more rewards must be given to the director of photography for his stunning, but underrated, work. All in all this is a film that has a lot to offer, but unfortunately not what it promises. *** out of four",The Sixth Sense

Perhaps looking for all the details that I was told I would have to see the movie a second time to catch prevented me from enjoying it.  Or perhaps, just perhaps, there really wasn't as much that was special, different, or outstanding in this movie to validify all the acclaim it has garnered.  It was boring in places, overly drawn out throughout, and had no outstanding performances by any of the actors.  There were many, MANY plot holes that were simply left to fester, and the end was a little to reminiscent of 'Ghost' for my taste.

It was a great mix of all those things.I don't understand how there could be people that would give this movie a '1'. This movie is great, especially the end, it starts you on a long 'thinking-tour'.

1154,achrya,Talent's Labour's Lost,3,14 August 2000,"""Sixth sense"" is in many ways an extremely beautiful movie and contains some utterly brilliant acting - for example, the initial scene at the Crowes' house made my acting appreciation organ, whichever one that is, turn somersaults. But...Every fictional story depends to some extent on the suspension of our disbelief in impossible things. A film's ambition at seriousness signals that the suspension required will be relatively small, i.e. that the script attempts to be plausible. ""Sixth sense"" obviously aspires at being a serious psychological drama, so one would expect a rather high level of plausibility.Whether or not you can accept the basic premise, that souls have individual existence independent of the body (""ghosts"") and that they can influence some living people, depends on your own religious standpoint and fundamental view of the universe, so let us leave that aside. But one unconditional premise in a story that aspires at any kind of plausibility is that all individuals of a certain species are subject to the same basic constraints: e.g. people can't fly, fish can't talk, ghosts can't handle material objects... and if the script writer decides to let an individual go beyond these constraints, the audience is entitled to an explanation.
WARNING - SPOILER AHEAD!Now, in Sixth sense we find one ghost who can look perfectly ordinary (and even change clothes) while others only show themselves in the state they were in when they died; the same ghost can enter a church, a place where no other ghosts ever show up; he can throw rocks, play audio recordings and take notes, while it's crucial to the story that a ""regular"" ghost can't by herself move a video tape to where it will be found... All this simply because we aren't supposed to know that he's dead!!! And we get no hint of an explanation why this particular individual is Mr. Superghost!Another serious hole in the fabric of the story is the gimmick of people ""not knowing that they are dead"". These people walk about and perceive their surroundings, but they don't notice that there's been a funeral, that their bank account is gone, that they can't get service in a store, that they themselves have stopped eating etc. etc. etc.???Bruce Willis is normally a committed, thorough actor who does his homework and delivers the goods. Even his superheroes and inhabitants of the future are primarily people, who we know can get bored, have a headache or need to go to the bathroom. That's what makes them so easy to identify with and their stories so compelling. - Now, in ""Sixth sense"" individual scenes are beautifully acted, with a gripping psychological reality, but the plot holes indicated above effectively prevent the film from making sense as a whole. Simply speaking, Mr Shyamalan and Mr Willis are too involved in visual and psychological artistry to care whether Crowe goes to the bathroom, and if not, why. And, what's worse, they expect us viewers not to notice. To quote a more traditional Willis hero, ""What do you think I am, stupid?!""
Obviously, on an artistic level, Shyamalan and Willis work extremely well together. But, for it to become beautiful music, we must hope for a better score.",The Sixth Sense

Suspense?  What suspense?  The twists are so predictable and the plot so thin that it almost seemed that the script was nothing but an outline for a bad episode of the Twilight Zone or The Outer Limits.   In the last part of the film I half expected the ghost of Rod Serling to appear and say 'Been there, Done that'.  The so-called twist at the end is easy to predict and is something that would happen in a script written by fifth graders to scare each other in summer camp.   The characters are trite to the point that Mr. Shyamalan should pay royalties to other filmmakers.A new hyped ?Genius? has been anointed.  This movie puzzled me because of the hype around it.  The question is how such a sub-standard movie can become such a hit with audiences and critics.  Is the quality of the product from the studios so bad that this predictable, hackneyed film can be considered art?  Apparently so because most the votes here on IMDB are way above 7.The acting is a mixed bag of okay to really bad.  Mr. Willis can act and has in such films as The Kid, The Fifth Element, and The Story of Us, not to mention Moonlighting but in this film and the other waste of film stock Unbreakable his talent was not needed.  I kept wondering during this film if Mr. Willis?s performance was so stiff because he thought he should play dead through the whole film or if perhaps acting with such a bad kid actor as Mr. Osment caused massive boredom.  Ms. Williams is pretty but underutilized in this film.  Ms. Collette can also act but again she had to act in scenes with Mr. Osment.  This kid was really bad in this film with zero charm or screen charisma and even worse in AI.  I kept waiting for his charactor to be killed in a really gruesome manner to add some sort of emotional spark to the movie.  If Mr. Osment wants to stay in the business perhaps some acting lessons would help but it?s doubtfull.Rated 1 out of 10.  Don't lose 2 hours of your life to this movie.
For real suspense and great acting from everyone try Blood Simple from the Coen brothers.  It will really surprise even the most jaded movie fan.",The Sixth Sense

1169,echolilial,finally a film with a promising child actor,10,12 January 2002,"Shyamalan's 'The Sixth Sense' (1999) was nominated for 6 Academy Awards including a nod for best picture.  It lost to another great, 'American Beauty', however the two are similarly watchable and boast fine performances from a majority of the principle cast.Cole Sears (Haley Joel Osment - brilliant) is a loner-child who has the ability to see 'dead people'.  He tells no-one his secret, not even his Mum (wonderfully played by Toni Collette), until he meets child psychologist Malcolm (Bruce Willis in his best role yet).  The two form a trusting relationship and gradually, Cole's horrifying secret/problem is revealed... both orally and visually.Excellent performances, storyline, direction and a hauntingly splendid score make M.

This film should have won every Oscar that it was nominated for including best picture, because I don't think there was a picture better then this film in 1999.My advice to everyone is to watch the film as soon as they can, just watch it and do yourself a big favour.",The Sixth Sense
1171,Mr-KISS,Shyamalan's crown jewel,10,1 October 2002,"M. Night Shyamalan has created a unique and interesting atmosphere throughout The Sixth Sense. This is a film (not unlike ""The Usual Suspects"")which is often spoken about and critiqued for it's ending, and much is forgotten about it's content. There are genuine spooks and an unsettling feeling that the viewer's feel throughout ""The Sixth Sense"" and is present on each viewing.I comment on the film after having seen Shyamalan's two subsequent works ""Unbreakable"" and ""Signs"". In each Shyamalan attempt's to deliver the message of faith, religion and fate. It is to the credit of ""The Sixth Sense"" that these messages are more cleverly woven into the plot of the film, without being blatant as we have seen since. Shymalan presents this in a down to earth, low key fashion. It is without a doubt the crown jewel of his work's.All acting performances are exceptional. Some stereotyping goes into each character. Colette the typical single mum and Willis the child psychologist out for redemption. However this works well around the deep and complex central character and theme.""The Sixth Sense"" can stand it's head above most other film's of it's time. I rate it very highly. It is certainly the best work of most of the actors involved and certainly the director.",The Sixth Sense

The Sixth Sense was hyped as a supernatural thriller with an unexpected twist. Well once you know the boy can see and speak to the dead - which you know from the trailers - the ending is predictable from the first five minutes. And there are enough clues for anyone. But the idea that the Bruce Willis character could go for a year and realise that he was dead (whoops! did I spoil the ending for anyone?) is just plain ludicrous. Didn't he notice that everyone - not just his wife was ignoring him? Besides these stupidities the film was slow and dull, and about as scary as an episode of The Munsters.",The Sixth Sense

That was enough for me to figure out what the ""great twist"" was about - in the first few minutes.-SPOILER BELOW-As soon as Osment said ""I see dead people"", I thought Willis could have as well replied like ""Like me?""Yes, the ""twist"" was that cheap and predictable.

Maybe because this movie was so surprisingly good, the author might be afraid of screw up the reputation by making a not so good sequel. I doubt it, I guess Mr. Shyamalan will not be reckless to do that. My humble advise: just keep the standards. Why a sequel others might ask? Here is my point of review. Malcolm (B. Willis) did help the kid's (H.J. Osment)issues but what about the tormented should who actually was Malcolm's helpless patient? And the kid continued seeing ghosts. There are many opportunities and fans will love to have the pleasure to enjoy a sequel of one of the best thriller movies ever. Come on, let's do it!!",The Sixth Sense
1175,t-turnquest1,A Psychological thriller with supernatural elements in it: how I not be amazed at this movie,10,24 May 2015,"When I knew that The Sixth Sense was very popular, I tried to find a reason why it was one the AFI list of Best Thrillers. It was on Netflix. I watched it and boy was it scary! The Sixth Sense is one of the best films I have recently seen all summer. I like this movie because it goes into a realistic tale of human elements and the supernatural field to it. But it goes into the psychological and in-debt look into the story while still trying to be a horror film. I love it. Bruce Willis is amazing in this role. I thought he looked good in Die Hard, but man never has he been good in this movie when playing a three-dimensional character in a humane horror film. Haley Joel Osment is great. I really like him in this role, even in other roles when he is child. The story of this movie amazes me to see how M.Night can write and direct a good film with the proper techniques. But overall I adored this film. I would recommend this to every person who wants to make good movie or maybe even a horror film.",The Sixth Sense

And the tiny hairs on your arm, you know when they stand up? That's them. When they get mad... it gets cold.' This movie isn't a thriller in that sense, rather more a ghost story but done right. It will still have a creepy vibe, and not seem at all far fetch - made even more so by the young 9 year old boy, Cole (Haley Joel Osment), getting treated by a psychologist due to being able to glimpse into the hidden dimensions of the lost and mostly angry dead people.",The Sixth Sense
1177,lilliehardwick,This is a thrilling story from start to finish.,10,8 April 2018,"This is a thrilling story from start to finish. Willis effortlessly leads us to believe he is still alive and living his life. Olivia Williams plays the perfect part of the grieving wife. It takes us a long time to realise that she is grieving her husband and not the relationship they used to have. Haley Osment plays an outstanding part as we genuinely feel scared for him and his power. 
Toni Collette, too, should be credited as she gives such a realistic reaction to her son and his behaviour. We see her struggle to believe her son's behaviour as well as trying to protect him from others. 
The best part of the film has to be where Cole and his mother go to a party with some children who are unkind to him. They lock him in a closet where Cole encounters a frantic spirit who, like him, is desperate to get out. Even when he is released from this small space we do not feel at ease because we know he cannot escape these spirits.

Night Shyamalan, The Sixth Sense is a supernatural thriller that is truly a riveting and electric roller coaster ride with enough loops and turns for a lifetime. Not only was this film groundbreaking with its horrifying plot, the acting in it was elevated to an unprecedented level in the way it connected the audience to the personal stories each character had with themselves and the other characters. The relationship between Cole and his mother was one that conveyed the unbreakable bond a mother and child holds. Now, I'm not going to spoil anything, but M. Night Shyamalan really has a way with leading your brain one way in interpreting the movie, and then ripping the rug right out from under you. The plot twist in this film was so surprising I found myself screaming at the television in shock, excitement, and utter fear.

1181,scook-13,I See Dumb People,4,23 July 2006,"First, let me say, hitting the spoiler alert for this movie is akin to telling you that Soylent Green is people. Secondly, I didn't read every reader comment, but virtually every comment I read raved about the surprise ending. I'm not a smart guy, I assure you. But, I didn't figure the ending out after the first five minutes. I figured it out with two pieces of information - a kid sees dead people and there is a really surprising ending. Think about it. What could that surprise ending be? Hmmm, maybe that the kid is really dreaming? Oh yeah, that would leave the audience enthralled. Maybe he only saw people who were neurotic and thought they were dying? I like that, but it's a bit too sophisticated for Bruce Willis. Could there be any other surprise ending than that Bruce Willis is dead? What made me want to see the picture was to find out how a dead guy can't figure out he's dead. Did the director do such a masterful job that you couldn't go back and catch on? To answer that question...no, it's painfully obvious that Bruce Willis is dead, right from the moment you see him being ignored by everyone around him. I guess the point is that dead people are as dumb as the audiences who go to see films about them. Even if the movie had done a little better job of hiding the fact that Willis is being totally ignored, common sense would tell you that there would have had to be some interaction as he was recovering from his gunshot wounds. And, where was he during his funeral. Okay, I'll admit, I turned the movie off after about 30 minutes. So maybe these issues were dealt with, but I'm willing to bet that even if they were, they weren't dealt with in a very convincing manner. Anyway, I think the movie stunk, or is that stinked. After all, I ain't too bright myself.",The Sixth Sense

Bruce Willis gave a good performance (and that is a very amazing statement). The plot was predictable.  I saw it coming about 5 minutes into the movie. I then proceeded to watch the movie and was not swayed from my original guess.  I kept waiting for the big ""Shocker"" at the end only to find out that it was my guess.  Everything at the end was so neatly explained that I was let down.What was more of a ""shocker"" was the audience's reaction to the ending.  I heard gasps, and one woman started to cry.  Couldn't they see the sixty-two allusions to the secret?  Oh well.The Blair Witch Project blew this movie out of the water with its creativity, acting, and unresolved yet appropriate ending.

Bruce Willis and young Haley are quite a team - watching them work together was a pleasure.  They played off each other so well I almost forgot I was watching actors at work and was swept into the scenes with them. If young Haley doesn't make you want to sweep him into your arms and protect him you need to rush to the nearest hospital and check your heart!! If you see one movie this year this should be it.  Not one for young kids but if you are open minded and wish to think out the plot line without it being shoved in your face this will be a winner for you also. It's nice for a change to see the studio's giving the public credit for having minds - I love a movie that leaves you thinking.

I actually appreciate movies that cut out all the standard, ""coming to believe a fantastic tale"", bit. You know the routine - character sees strange things..stranger finally tries to make other character believe strange things..plot creaks along until other character finally be;lives strange things exist. That might have played well the first hundred times it was used, but I'd just as soon get to the meat of the matter and move the damn plot along!Anyway, several scenes are so obviously staged that I found myself watching the extras in the scene, wondering what the assistant directors had told them to do..For instance, take the scene where Willis is late for dinner in the restaurant...The setting and filming looked so obviously staged that I couldn't pay attention to the leads.Or - a long shot of Willis and the kid walking up the street, just when an entire little-league team walks across the from of the shot..obvious and clumsy, slice of life touches that distract instead of feeling a natural part of the scene.But - great ending, serviced by the outline of a great plot that was poorly filled in and poorly directed.",The Sixth Sense

Every scene will make you follow, this is with the help of Bruce Willis and Haley Joel Osment, you can't help being mesmerized by the acting and keeping you centered on these characters. I'll go out on a limb and say that this is the movie of the year (so far).

I thought it was great how the writers took horror to another level, unlike scream etc... I must admit that I almost screamed 4 or 5 times during the movie, even though a lot of people have said that it isn't scary at all. The story was very interesting and the actors were great. I applaud Haley Joel Osment for his brilliant performance and I do the same for Bruce Willis', who should try to make more movies like this one before going back to his bang bang action movies. I loved the twist at the end of the movie and unlike other people, I didn't see it coming at all.

Alas, I was able to predict correctly what the surprise was 5 minutes after the movie's introduction.   I actually enjoyed Sixth Sense more because the dialogues between Willis and Osment, and any scenes w/ Willis in them very much made sense, knowing what's happening/what happened.Osment was very convincing as a kid who sees what others can't and is terrorized by his special gift. Willis, though low key, showed compassion.Overall, Sixth Sense has more plot than Blair Witch and its dealing with spirituality gives it more depth than any horror movies in recent years.",The Sixth Sense

Never is a particularly great deal made of why nobody notices Bruce Willis' presence. Never does the fact that he is shot early in the film have any strong effect on his relationship with Cole. This jumble of clues is never presented as a mystery to be solved, and thus, the little paradigm shift in the last minute doesn't really solve anything, and feels tacked on. No wonder why some people didn't see it coming - because the story's structure never even proposed that such a revelation was at all necessary. At least in ""The Usual Suspects"", the final twist actually answered a question that was posed throughout the entire film. At least in ""Fight Club"", the revelation near the end gave the movie its meaning.Okay, so Dr. Crowe's a dead guy. So what?Here, Shyamalan's just playing for shock value and lasting impressions. Though when I look at the other comments posted here, I'd have to admit he did that quite successfully.",The Sixth Sense
1206,Manson-4,One of the best.,9,10 January 2000,"This is a great movie, that shows that Bruce Willis is capable of doing some serious acting too. Still, he pales when compared to Haley Joel Osment's work as a boy who sees dead people.The final twist, which I have been waiting to see from last August was just as good as any twist can get. I would like to sent Nathan L. to hell for telling it to the masses (who had not seen it yet) in TV. It's just that final thing that makes this movie to be so great. Thank you for making it!",The Sixth Sense
1207,Mr.Berry,"Boring with a predictable ending. That's right, predictable!",3,14 August 1999,"Before seeing this movie, I had heard there was a surprise ending.  I knew no more than that and was able to come up with a nice twist ending before seeing the movie.  True to my instincts, this movie ended exactly as I predicted.  Because I had already figured out the ending, the clues in the movie seemed so obvious to me, I wondered why people were not figuring it all out.  But people are surprised are by the ending, and I can't understand why.  This movie might be worthwhile if you can't pick up on clues.  But I could not enjoy it.  Some reviewers say once you see it once, you have to review the movie to understand everything.  Well because I had already guessed the ending, I felt like I had already seen this movie and every scene just led up to an already known end.  I don't know whether to be proud or disappointed.  Proud as in I guessed the ending before seeing the movie or disappointed as in the writers couldn't come up with anything better. I was left with a ""that's it?"" feeling.  So if you already have an idea as to what the ""surprise"" ending is, then do not go see this movie, you're probably right.  But if you can't even fathom a guess or don't like to think during a movie, then by all means go see it.At least the actors were good...",The Sixth Sense

But after seeing The Haunting, was a little worried with how this film would fare.I can say that I was very happily impressed.  Acting, music, script, mood, setting... I've never been so truly engrossed in a movie before.People cannot compare this film to The Blair Witch Project.  Even though they share the ""scare"" or ""horror"" genre, they do operate on different levels.At times, the film did drag and there was a nagging feeling in the back of my mind that this would end as horribly as The Haunting.

If people are saying this movie is so great because of the ending, but I figured that out quickly.

1213,DemonE-2,"An awesome film, with great acting, an engrossing story, and an ending from way left field",9,18 August 1999,"This summer is a great one for movies.  After the first Star Wars film in 15 years, two awesome comedies in Austin Powers 2 and South Park, and two great horror films (Blair Witch and The Haunting), the Sixth Sense comes out - and continues the trend. Bruce Willis and Haley Joel Osment both turn in excellent performances.  There needs to be a Child Actor Oscar created just for Osment; he is fantastic as young Cole Sear, a child who sees ghosts everywhere he goes.  Bruce Willis plays Malcolm Crowe; a child psychologist discouraged by his one failure, with a case that bears a striking resemblance to Cole's.The film grabs you right from the start, and doesn't let go until the end. Although billed as a horror movie, the scares don't really start until about halfway through, when Cole's ghosts become visible to the audience.  And they're sufficiently creepy - real people bearing the marks of their deaths, as opposed to the translucent shapes of The Haunting.  The ghost-story elements are all there, in both the actions of the spirits and their effects (the cold, the feeling of falling while standing still), lending this film much more credibility than The Haunting - ghost story fans will not be disappointed.Malcolm has his hands full trying to help Cole overcome his fear of the apparitions and try to come to terms with his ability to see them, but as a result his home life collapses as he drifts further and further from his wife.  Ironically, his patient becomes the doctor, helping Malcolm to try to patch things up.  The two work superbly together throughout the movie in fact.The ending, when it comes, is a complete surprise, from so far out of left field it practically skirts the foul line.  I was left with my jaw in my lap as the credits rolled.  The Sixth Sense stacks up as one of the best ghost movies I've ever seen, and certainly one of the best movies of the summer. Stick it on your must see list, right alongside The Blair Witch Project.",The Sixth Sense
1214,cj102359,Excellent Film(Contains Spoilers!!!),8,6 December 1999,"My Comments contain some spoilers!!!I felt this was an excellent film. The plot and storyline were well thought out and the acting was terrific. I'm not much of a Bruce Willis fan, but he did a fine job here. Spoilers below
My one issue is this: taking into account that Willis' character is a ghost and we should assume that time passes differently for him, it still does not explain why it takes him so long to realize that something is wrong. Both at the restaurant with his wife and even more so waiting for Cole with Cole's mother and having no one take note of his presence might be a tip-off.This isn't enough to spoil the film for me, but it is a bit of a loose end.",The Sixth Sense
1215,Razor-18,Very enticing....,9,8 August 1999,"By far the film that Bruce Willis has done in a while but that is not to say that he carried this film. Bruce really needs to let himself into roles like this more often. He wears them well. If he kept it up he could be the American version of Mel Gibson. Cinematography was solid and considering Tak was behind the camera, it doesn't surprise me. Young Osmet actually appeared to put some thought into his acting. Most child actors appear to be nothing more than parrots for the director, mimicking the commands of the script but not having the  experience or emotional base from which to truly act the scene. Not in this case. Haley Osmet did a wonderful job making his character emote. Have seen most of the better films of the year and so far this one captured me more than any of the others. I really truly believe that to honestly experience a good film you must go into the theater weaponless, bring nothing but what you are, your life experiences. Otherwise, the experience always becomes something that was preconceived and you guard yourself from participating in the story. This one rattled the chains of my fathers death while I watched it. Anybody who has had someone close to them pass on will connect to this film in varying degrees. Things left undone and unsaid and so on. It is a tender and meticulously, well thought out story and it *will* get you in the end. Go see it and try to honestly find anything wrong with it. Some of you may be able to pick out the plot early but it shouldn't disrupt your enjoying the film. Doesn't depend on overwhelming buckets 'O' blood or viscous, needless cursing and people lathering each other with their tongues or computer generated whiz-bangs. Even a little spooky in places.....",The Sixth Sense

I Think that this film just wants to be the half way between ""Ghost"" and ""The kingdom"" but it doesn't have either the charm of Demi Moore or the deepness of thought of Lars Von Trier. The result is a ""half baked"" film, not good as a comedy, not good as a horror, not good as a psycological film. I apologize with other commenters...but this is my opinion.",The Sixth Sense
1218,Shane29,This one may actually redeem the summer '99 movie season.,10,9 August 1999,"I, like many others, have been a little disappointed with the summer 1999 movie season. I had seen the trailers for this movie and decided to give it a shot. Once agian, in an attempt to bring in movie goers, they gave away too much of the movie in the previews. Luckily, this movie managed to be great despite this. Writer/Director M. Night Shyamalan gets his vision across. Bruce Willis shows he hasn't forgotten how to act in a movie that isn't all one liners and explosions. The supporting cast, including an unrecognizable Donnie Wahlberg, are top rate. The most impressive thing about this movie was Haley Joel Osment. This young actor made me believe he was living with this torment. It is a nice change of pace to see a young actor who isn't just a cute face on the screen. This young man can act, far out classing any one else in the movie. I look forward to more from him. The refreshing lack of special effects and an ending that will leave you slack jawed are a definite plus. I will be going back to see this one again.",The Sixth Sense

If we take this film as a whole, it was breathtaking right from the start. Before watching the film, i had doubts whether Bruce Willis was suitable for this role. However he was as good as the kid. I don't expect this film to get an Oscar. And i don't think it will get a nomination either. But i believe that the kid really deserves one. Whoever says anything about the film to a friend who hasn't seen it, will be doing something terrible to him.

The first hour or so the movie is just boring, there's no progress in the plot at all. And then there's this terrible goof (microphone clearly visible in the classroom).The second part is better: finally the plot starts evolving. OK, there's some good acting: the young boy (Cole) for instance, but I have my doubts about Bruce Willis: I just don't think this is his kind of role.Many people have mentioned the surprising ending: I thought it was quite predictable.To wrap things up: ordinary movie: not good, not bad.I voted 6.",The Sixth Sense

Exceptional acting  (Bruce Willis plays the role of the suldry psychiatrist sensationally, and young Haley exhibits the best child acting I have ever witnessed).  The storyline was phenomenal, and the chemistry between Bruce Willis and the kid was outstanding.  The climactic ending of the film is the icing on the cake...This is a must-see, possibly the best movie of the year.",The Sixth Sense
1223,Ed-E-2,Let's twist again,9,20 November 1999,"What a good year. The Matrix put the thought back into action, The Mummy gave us fun adventure almost worthy of Indy himself, the much overlooked Go walked a great dramatic line between danger and humour, Blair Witch was incredibly inventive (albeit partly through necessity), and if my friends are to be believed Fight Club,  will in turns repulse and excite me.Another movie to add to the list is definitely The Sixth Sense.  How nice it is to be treated to a mature subtle film for a change.  Although it's doubtful whether you could call Blair Witch or The Sixth Sense 'horror', the pair do make an effective anti-dote to the CGI tedium of The Haunting remake, reminding people that a film can live on in the mind long after the credits have rolled.  It is also worthwhile approaching both films in the same manner:  Ignore the hype, don't expect slick FX, just sit back and watch a nicely crafted little movie rather than the 'event' you were expecting.  Less is  more.  So here's to more less.Unlike Blair however, there are a few traditional 'haunted house' tricks, mostly designed to startle the audience - someone suddenly walks in front of camera, or appears then disappears in the distance.  'Cheap' maybe, but also extremely effective as the camera is so still during the film that any unexpected movement becomes all the more obvious.  The two leads are great, Osment is suitably fragile after home problems and ghostly visits, and Bruce is nicely calm.Problems?  Well, some scenes remind me in essence of Danny in The Shining, but hey, that was 20 years ago now.  A bit schmaltzy in places?  Maybe, but for the most part the overal tone remains dark.  It is also a little slow in places, but to be honest the final twist does reward your patience tenfold. And what about that twist?  Well, knowing there was one did send my mind into overdrive, and one of the (many) possibilities I came up with was correct, but it was still a shock when confirmed.  Long after leaving the theatre I was still remembering all the little details and important clues that totally passed me by, and with each new discovery my admiration grows.Maybe on my visit to Fight Club I might just have a last minute change of mind and dive into Sixth Sense again.",The Sixth Sense

1225,ryoung1776,"Possibly the year's best, certainly the best ghost story",9,9 August 1999,"I have been in love with stories of death, horror, and the supernatural since I was 10.  I am now approaching 46.  I have seen a great deal of death and horror, both fictional and real.  Most fiction does not get much out of me, not a shudder, not a chill.Until I saw ""The Sixth Sense"" (TSS), my favorite ghost story was  ""The Haunting"", the 1963 version.  It was followed by ""Jacob's Ladder"".  ""TSS"" now is in first place.This story is filled with pain and compassion, kindness and fear, and failure and redemption.  This is a lot to get from a ghost story.  And in the end, it all makes sense.Bruce Willis as the psychologist, and Haley Joel Osment, as the troubled child have a wonderful chemistry.  You believe they desperately wish to work with each other towards ending the child's torment.  Furthermore, the terror and emotional pain the  child displays is totally believable.  This is what gives this movie the power it possess.  When an emotional foundation is built, one does not require special effects and blood to engage us.I heard the audience around me gasp at some of the scarier moments. Personally, I had the hair on my arms and the back of my neck raise.  For a jaded cynic like me, this seldom happens.If you have a weak heart or have religious convictions which would interfere with your enjoyment of a ghost story, do not see this movie.

Great movie to see with friends. The use of special effects is sparing and only enhances the story.  For those of you that are overwhelmed with the sheer volume of summer movies where the special effects are the story, this movie is a refreshing change.While it is tempting to give away some key points, I will leave them for you to find out yourself.  However, if you're only going to see 1 movie this summer, I suggest you make that movie ""Sixth Sense"".  It is well worth the 2 hours and price of admission.",The Sixth Sense

The young boy in the film is incredible. And a commendable performance from Donny Wahlberg in this movie. He's only in the movie for about 3-4 minutes tops but he makes his point very well.

A film about a boy who can see dead people, and the psychologist who tries to help him, it held my interest right from the beginning. Bruce Willis actually did a very good job in this movie, as did the rest of the cast. I am sure that anyone who has read a paper has heard about the surprise ending in this film, and don't worry, i am NOT going to give it away, god forbid... but if you don't see this film then you will be missing out  on one of the best endings in a movie since "" The Usual Suspects"". I don't mean that by the content, but just how i totally did not see it coming... anyway, the film was a bit eerie in parts, and although i am not one who scares easily,  it still managed to give me a little bit of the creeps. I highly recommend this film...the actor who played Cole (his name slips my mind) did a great job, as did everyone else... so that's about it! Go see this film!",The Sixth Sense

1232,HITMAN-27,A fantastic must see film.,10,7 August 1999,"In the movie ""The Sixth Sense"", which was filmed in Philadelphia, Bruce Willis plays Dr. Malcolm Crowe, a child psychologist intent on helping a child, Cole Sear (Haley Joel Osment) who has been labeled as a ""freak"" by his classmates. What Dr. Crowe soon discovers is that Cole can communicate with dead people. This movie, which started off a little slow, necessary for good character development, will scare the heck out of you, yet at the same time it hits you on a deep emotional level like a freight train. One minute the hairs on the back of your neck are standing up in a panic, then a few minutes later you are overwhelmed with emotions surrounding death presented in a way that will touch everyone. I heard several people in the theater sob openly, a few others left, I assume that was because they could not take it. This was all done without the use of wild graphic special effects that often kill a good movie. The surprise ending, also excellent, will blow you away and make you think about how the entire movie was presented. This one is a true shocker, the audience just sat in their seats shocked when it ended.This one blew away ""The Blair Witch Project"" which I also felt was an excellent film. This one gets a ten on the Hit Man Movie Scale, a must see movie.  I don't think that I will sleep for about a week w/o getting nightmares.",The Sixth Sense

""The Mummy"", and ""The Haunting"", and even the ""Blair Witch Project"" were disappointing and, to tell the truth, not worth the money I paid to see them.  But this movie, Sixth Sense, left me speechless and trembling as I stumbled out of the theater.The first thing I noticed was the camera work.  The cameras filmed shots that were unnecessary and unusually dramatic,  successfully giving the film it's dark and eerie feel.  Simply artistic!  The camera work is a great example of how much genius went into this movie.And the acting!!  Incredible!  Powerful!  I have never seen a better child actor.  He was so believable and so real that he alone makes the movie what it is, taking the audience to depths of fear, despair, anger, and even joy. Bruce Willis also did a great job in a different kind of role then what I'm use to seeing him in.The movie was so unpredictable, I found myself gaping.  I thought I was in for a reasonably scary horror movie, but it was much more than that.  Though it started slow at first (with excellent character development), toward the end it picked up.  In one moment of the movie, I was uneasy. In another, I actually screamed and jumped out of my seat.  And then in yet another, I was horrified by an Edgar Allen Poetic moment that took me completely by surprise.  And like no other horror movie I've seen, I was moved.  I cried.And the end... well, you gotta see it.  I was on the edge of my seat, staring and listening in unbelief.This movie is for the thinking person, the deep person, the person tired of the overblown big budget bummers of the summer. It's definitely one of the best movies I've ever seen.",The Sixth Sense
1234,victoria-13,See this movie!! But don't let anyone spoil it for you before you go!,10,11 August 1999,"I think the department in charge of marketing this film has done it a huge disservice.  The fact that it was touted to be a horror flick almost kept me from seeing it.  I went in expecting ""scares"" and special effects, but not really getting my hopes up too high . but what I got was something completely different from what I expected.  This movie is more drama than horror, more heart than blood, and more thinking than scaring.  The acting is effective - nice to see Bruce Willis do something other than wield a gun, and he comes across well in this; and Toni Colette, as the boy's mother, is strong in her performance as a loving, but confused parent.  But the real standout in this piece is Haley Joel Osment as Cole, the little boy - now THIS kid can act!!  My heart was breaking for this poor child for the whole movie . as he struggles with being considered a ""freak"" by everyone around him, so afraid to tell anyone what is really going on.  While there are certainly moments that scare and surprise, I think ""horror"" and ""action"" are really the wrong words to describe this movie.   But no matter what genre you want to put it in, I'd still highly recommend this movie to anyone. You aren't likely forget the character of Cole Sear any time soon . and there are enough twists in plot to keep you entertained, and ensure that you are NOT checking your watch.",The Sixth Sense

I think the acting was superb especially by Osment who played the role of the little boy. When I first saw the movie I was like no way at the ending and I was saying thats impossible but after I thought about it I realized it made perfect sense and made the movie even creepier. This is a film I will have to watch more times to catch every little detail. Trust me people you need to go watch this movie immediately and really think hard after the movie to explain to yourself what happened in that movie.

1239,DMB22684,Just a bit Overrated,7,26 August 1999,"[Editor's note: this comment contains a minor SPOILER]The Sixth Sense is a  very good film. Had it not been for it's unarguably clever and surprising ending, it would have been fairy entertaining, by the numbers fare. But the finale does elevate it past that level. However, even with that surprise, the film felt oddly incomplete to me.The film's problem doesn't lie in it's acting. All performances are solid (although the great Olivia Williams is criminally under-used). Toni Collette was especially winning in her role as the Coles Sear's (Joey Hale Osmont) mother. The scene towards the end, when Cole shares his secret with her, it the most touching of the film. An unrecognizable Donnie Osmond gives a very brief, yet powerful performance as well. Bruce Willis and the child (whose name I may have incorrect about) are also good, but their performances are one note. Willis is believeable as the pensive, clever doctor but, with a few exceptions, never really emotes seriously. Osment's performance is perhaps the most overrated aspect of the film. I will be seeing this film again, and will try to pay more attention to him, but after my initial viewing, I wondered what all the fuss was about. True, he does a good job with the interesting character, but he never comes out of his disturbed, whispering mode.Set in Philadelphia in the fall, the atmosphere of the film is successfully bleak and eerie. The chills, when they come, are very well done and will make you jump, but they're awfully spread out (the first hour of the film, for the most part, was dull)The main distraction for me, however, was that the film aspired to  be more than it really was. Willis and Osment meet for the first time, in a church. This church is used a few times throughout the film, but there really is no point to it. The spirituality of the sixth sense and of the character who has it is never explained throughout the film. Also, I wish they had elaborated more on the divorce of the boy's parents. It could have given more insight on both the mother and her son.For the most part, Sixth Sense, was an very well done film. Very well worth the price of admission.

I was a times frightened but mostly I was greatly moved at Haley Joel Osment's performance.  Even if he had never uttered a word, I would have known exactly what he was feeling.  He is definately someone to be watched in the many years to come.  It was not what I had expected and I was very pleasently surprised.  I highly recommend this movie!",The Sixth Sense

I think that the end twist with Bruce Willis's character was a great idea, and unpredictable.  I also liked the particular interaction that Osment's character had with the ghosts.  What I didn't like was that I don't think it was developed enough.  Director m. Night Shyalaman was onto two very interesting plot elements, and if they had been developed a bit more, this film would have been much better.",The Sixth Sense

Overall I give it a 7/10.",The Sixth Sense
1244,JMG-5,Music for the masses,5,15 September 1999,"The Sixth Sense is one of those movies that will appeal to the mainstream viewer: nothing in it is shocking, there's nothing particularly menacing about it and everything is wrapped up in a nice, sweet, little package by the end. The performances by Osment and Collette are excellent but it doesn't make up for the tedious pace of the plot. Two-thirds of the movie deals with exposition which, in this case, is devoted to the interaction between Cole (Osment) and Malcolm (Willis). Cole's got a problem and Malcolm is determined to help him - as his problem is similar to one that another patient of his had whom he couldn't help. The problem is that we already know what Cole's problem is so we're left with an anti-climactic climax. When he tells Malcolm that he sees dead people, there's no shock value or significance. That leaves the resolution to Cole's problem as the focal point of the movie; however, it's so tame it makes you wonder what the big deal was in the first place.
The movie works best when Cole and his mother (Collette) are together. There's a particular scene at the end when they are in the car that is incredibly touching. The movie breaks down when it tries to be scary, though. There are a few startling scenes but, overall, it's devoid of any real terror. How it was labeled as a horror movie, I'll never understand.
Overall, it's a pretty decent movie - much better than what Hollywood usually puts out - but, in the end, it's nothing to write home about. In my opinion, of course.",The Sixth Sense
1245,JMG-5,Custom-built for mass appeal,5,15 December 1999,"**Spoilers**
There's nothing particularly awful about this film, there's just nothing particularly great about it either. About 10 minutes into it, the ending is painfully obvious and the climax - where Cole finally reveals his ""problem"" to Malcolm - has been given away from the very start by the overzealous trailers. What we're left with is an hour and a half of tedious plot exposition and a denouement that is so contrived it makes you wonder what the point of the entire movie was. Then the ""surprise"" comes and you realize that the entire point was to fool you with the ending! If you were fooled then the movie worked; if not then it probably didn't.
On a positive note: the performances were very good - notably, Osment and Colette - and the cinematography was excellent. Ultimately, however, - unless you are terrified even thinking about ghosts - the Sixth Sense is only mildly entertaining and, upon a second viewing, even less so. 5/10",The Sixth Sense
1246,Donna-38,One of the best films I've seen all year,9,17 November 1999,"This film is amazing! OK, the basic story-line may have been seen before, but that should not detract from this movie, or stop anyone from seeing it. The performances are brilliant, especially Bruce Willis, who is at his best, and Haley Joel Osment who should definitely be nominated for awards! His performance as Cole Sear, the little boy who can see dead people, is simply heartbreaking. He is so believable as someone who is very, very scared and unable to tell anyone. Yes, if you think about it you can see the twist coming a mile away, but it doesn't matter at all. Just sit back and enjoy one of the best films of the year.

The plot of the movie ended and you had to wait 15 more mins for the big ""surprise.""Oh well, I suppose this is advice for me in my screenwriting career.

1250,wds-3,overrated,1,17 November 1999,"This isn't such a good film.  I think one of the reasons it has achieved such popularity is because critics everywhere decided to write it as being brilliant.  Viewers think they should love it, so they agree to.  I can remember sitting in a theatre several months ago and being very disappointed in this film.  The Blair Witch Project did a lot more for me.  Willis does not do all that great of job in it.  The kid (his name fails me) does. The script was OK.  The directing was actually poor.  I won't give away the end, for the two or three people who have yet to see it, but I will say that the director gives it away by the end of the second act.  When I went to see it, I knew how it would end with about a half hour left.  This disappointed me. The thing was blocked poorly and the camera could have been used more effectively to keep the viewer in the dark.  The thing felt like it was shot before it was really fully conceptualized.  Also, there were many moments where I found myself wanting the film to be more graphic and frightening than it was.  I get the feeling they were aming to get the PG-13 from start to finished.  This hurt the film.Not the worst thing I've ever seen, but disappointing non the less.",The Sixth Sense
1251,rduke-2,***SPOILER***,8,28 April 2000,"Alright, I have watched this twice now and I must admit, an ending has never done more to shatter my illusion that I can't be completely fooled for 110 minutes. My hat is off to not only the director, but every friend I have that could have innocently spoiled this movie but didn't. I knew not of a surprise ending going in, and it definitely makes viewing #1 thoroughly enjoyable.OK, now to the holes. Most of them really are covered pretty nicely. And if they're not, well, as Howard Stern once said, ""For this movie, ya gotta suspend disbelief!""Let's begin with the seemingly random use of extreme cold. This is the big, stinking, glarer of the whole film. It's used arbitrarily for effect, and omitted during scenes where had it been used, the surprise would have been wrecked early. I admit it's a bit of a cheat, so I won't use space defending it. If logic dictated all, Superman would never have gotten away with a pair of glasses and a comb-over for a suitable disguise. Forgive and forget.Now, for the lack of a bullet hole. Cole does say that ""they only see what they want to see."" That explains Malcolm's not noticing he had a gaping exit wound in his lower back. As far as Cole not seeing it, well...the entrance wound was below the belt, and I never saw Cole standing behind Malcolm sans sportcoat. Shaky, I know...but how does Jimmy Stewart not notice Kim Novak #2 for God's sake! My point is, even the classics falter under the weight of heavy scrutiny.The performances here neutral out any shortcuts taken to sustain the film. Bruce plays a low-key role with the same Everyman Having a Really Lousy Day quality he's brought to saving the world, a building, an airport, etc. Say what you want about the guy, but if the Martians showed up with space lasers cocked for real, who would you call? I really believed this character and it's a testament to his skills that he never appears to be condescending onscreen to his co-star, a common trap in adult-child pairings.That brings me to little Forrest Gump, Jr. (Yes, THAT'S where you saw that kid before!) This was a big-time ACTING role, not a throw a cute kid into a harrowing situation and film his ""horrified"" reactions in cut-away shots. There were a couple of occasions where you could see him ""act"", but mostly, he handled quite a few different emotions with startling accuracy. I look forward to watching his career unfold. He's gonna be a good one, as long as he never, ever, ever finds himself left ""Home Alone"".It's impossible to review this film without coming eventually to ""The Usual Suspects."" I've never cared for that film, because the ending never raises any valid questions that had never been considered before the surprise was revealed. On that count, this movie comes through in spades. After the first viewing, my head swirled with ""But, wait a minute...""'s, which began overlapping into each other as pieces fell together. The number of user comments on this film supports this point: This movie COMMANDS discussion, and that is no small feat.One more thing WHAT THE HECK IS UP WITH MOM'S SOUP? What possible back-story would motivate a woman to feed soup to her child made from Winona Ryder's ""Heathers"" recipe book? That was a VERY CHILLING scene, and was an interesting way to confirm to Malcolm and the audience that this ghost business was for real...but  talk about coming out of nowhere!!I give this movie an 8 out of 10.",The Sixth Sense

Nope, you can find out for yourself.  I was completely and utterly amazed as the twist unravelled before my eyes.  It was the last thing I had expected.  I had contemplated a few endings, what if they.... or I bet that they.....  I couldn't have been more wrong!!!

1253,Pelle the Poet,A feel-good horror from an emerging master storyteller -- a masterpiece.,10,26 November 1999,"""The Sixth Sense"" tells the story of the young tormented boy Cole Sear (played superbly by Haley Joel Osment), child psychologist Dr. Crowe (played by Bruce Willis in for me the best performance of his career to date), and Cole's fiercely loyal mother Lynn (played by Australian Toni Collette).  I happened to catch Osment in an episode of ""Walker: Texas Ranger"" shortly before seeing this film.  He was a few years younger in that but his acting was uncannily affecting for such an unintelligent television program (its not surprising he was nominated for a Young Artists award for his performance).  He stole the show in that, as he did in this.  Everyone seemed to be commenting after the film on how good 'the kid' was -- including me.  I'd hazard a guess to say that he's one child actor who will maintain a strong acting career throughout his adolescence and into adulthood.Told with genuine tension -- hats off to the writer/director M. Night Shyamalan -- occasionally you'll jump in your seat, a chill will run down your spine, and the hair on the back of your neck may even stand up.  The final dénouement was superb (and that's all I'll say about that).  In a word (or three), a must see.  ""The Sixth Sense"" is without doubt one of the best films I have seen for a long, long time.If you loved this film, check out Shyamalan's previous film ""Wide Awake"", a feel-good comedy, also dealing with the spiritual.Mr. Shyamalan -- you are a master storyteller.",The Sixth Sense

The director is the relatively unknown and young M. Night Shyamalan and despite his obvious talents the movie is a bit disappointing as a psychological thriller. The shocks are too far between and even too obvious and the plot, despite of a successful surprise-ending, does not hold up to minute scrutiny. But having said that it is important to emphasize that H. J. Osment is absolutely amazing as the haunted boy and stands out as one of the best child performances for a very long time. Bruce Willis is excellent as well, his performance is very quiet, almost  modest, and it suits him very well. But the outstanding performance of the film is without a doubt the breakthrough of the young Osment and personally I can't wait to see what the future brings for him.

Every aspect of this film makes it worth seeing again, simple camera angles, terrific acting, words are not able to describe this story. I like how IMDB's comments screening doesn't allow for spoilers because this ending must be observed in all of it's majesty. I have made it my mission that no one hear the ending by word of mouth, but instead see it. It's almost fun to make people figure it out, in the months since it's release I have seen the film about a dozen times. Every time I see it like to have someone there that hasn't seen this masterpiece yet. The reactions are almost as good as the film. If you haven't seen this yet, see it.

A number of my favourite films are from the psychological horror genre. I won't compare this film to any other of its kind because I prefer to judge a film on its own merits. This isn't really a review, but rather what I was thinking while watching it.(SPOILERS)OK, so I saw it. I wasn't expecting great things from it. Which is the only reason I can think of why it took me so completely by surprise. It started promisingly, with a quite disturbing intruder scene and a gunshot. Suddenly, its ""The Next Fall"" (Autumn for us Brits!) and here is a man, previously injured by said gunshot, pick up the case of an odd young man with similar childhood problems to his attacker. At this point I had no reason to think that anything was amiss. If you don't start to wonder at this point, it's too late. I was completely drawn into the relationships between the characters and this young man's plight. Obviously I wasn't watching it in the same state of mind as others, who may have guessed the ""surprise"" right away. Call me thick or whatever, but I feel better off than those who did guess. Because they will have missed out on one of the greatest movie experiences for some time.Its a very personal drama with delicate performances, combined with some extremely effective chills. It slowly moves along to it's conclusion, introducing several elements on the way to distract you. Cole's mother's anguish at not understanding what is happening to her son is well portrayed. As things progressed, I thought ""this is a good film"". Then towards the end, a quite devastating shock is revealed at the dead little girl's wake (whom Cole is now trying to help.) I was so repulsed at and chilled with what was revealed here. Now it was a ""great film"". As things were being tied up, with a quite emotional scene between Cole and his mother, then between Malcolm and his wife- BANG! It happened. As Malcolm looked at his hand, my blood froze. And it stayed frozen till the close and well into the end credits. I walked out into the night air, I was dizzy. I hadn't walked out of the cinema feeling like that for a long long time. It's not the most original surprise ending, but it's certainly up there with the best of them.Now, here I am, after buying the DVD and watching it a second time. And even though I know the ending and how obvious it is in hindsight, It still has a great effect on me as I remember my feelings during the first viewing. But isn't that what all great films do...This film has generated a lot of debate in this forum, which says more about it's quality than I can.",The Sixth Sense

I questioned my guess once or twice but ten minutes in became sadly certain of where the whole movie was going, and then for two long dull hours endured one cheat-filled scene after another designed to keep the audience in the dark. The writer's maintenance of the 'surprise' left the script so full of holes that it looked like a lace curtain. I thought Osment and Willis did nothing special (except keep straight, sombre faces throughout) but I did love Toni Collette and thought she should not only have won an Oscar but a medal.

It had a few effects, mostly gore and such, but overall, the cinema-photography, a deeper-than-first-glance plot, and stirring film score gave this movie my high rating.The cinema-photography was excellent.  Mr. Shyamalan (The Director) really knows how to compose a scene, so that you understand not only what the script is telling you, but what the director wants you to feel.The plot was great, as well.  I won't give the major surprises away, in case some of you have yet to see it,  but suffice it to say, I haven't seen a plot this involving and deep in a very long time.  And just when you think you can't possibly be more emotionally drained, the end comes, and you want to go right back to the ticket office, and buy another go-around.The music was also very touching.  Written by James Howard, (Who also did the music for Disney's recent ""Dinosaur"") the score moves you almost as well as the storyline.

1278,vita-24,Wow,8,21 June 2002,O wow. When i first saw this movie i thought it was so good. Not only was this movie good but the performance by Bruce Willis was fantastic.Thumbs up also to Toni Collette. But what amazed me by this movie was Haley Joel Osment's performance. How could this movie NOT win best picture. What made me even more mad was because Toni and Haley did not win there awards. This movie is a 9 out of 10.,The Sixth Sense

Maybe sometimes he goes over the line but it's still excellent. Bruce stars great also, but when haley and him cried together it seems it was hard for him to actually cry. but other wise i just thought the story base line was excellent. Maybe the dead people kind of over reacted though. BUT I JUST LOVED THE MOVIE. Haley was extremly cute in it, mostly when had the pair of humongous glasses.",The Sixth Sense

He spent a year thinking he was alive but dead. Not believable at all and I just couldn't take it seriously.I know a lot of movies don't make since like freddy krouger etc, but I just felt different about this movie. I mean I don't even believe in ghosts in the first place but I'm not complaining about that.

1285,carladionizi,With The Benefit Of Hindsight,6,12 January 2010,"""The 6th Sense"" was a big hit in 1999, Oscar nominations, the lot. Now I finally seen it and I must say that with the benefit of hindsight, the only startling thing about the film is the introduction of the sensational Haley Joel Osment. Plus, a terrific performance by Toni Collette. Other than that, the film is a mess. Am I wrong? A clever designed twist at the end seems to justify, clumsiness of major proportions. Just look at that wake where Haley reveals the message from the dead girl. Unforgivably lame. All the jolts are underline by a vulgar strike in the music score department. Really bad. Mr Night Shaymalan got very luck in 1999 and has not been able to repeat its fortune since, no matter the obvious, desperate attempts to grab another jackpot. ""The Happening"" was unwatchable, ""Lady In The Water"" the work of someone with a an alarming mounting ego. ""Signs"" another clumsy, half cooked semi idea. Strange, how time puts things in perspective. I was recently reminded that ""The Towering Inferno"" was also, in its day, nominated for an Oscar as the best film of its day.",The Sixth Sense

Shyamalan is definitely an artist par excellence as shown by his control over the script and direction. By far 'the best' acting by a child actor in any movie that i have seen so far, simply brilliant. As for Mr. Bruce Willis, isn't he one among the very few actors who can act really well at the same time had a great stint as an action hero, kudos to you Mr. Versatile. I would rate the movie 9.5 on 10 [0.5 i have to take out because nothing is perfect in this world ;) ]A definite recommendation to every movie lover. For the sheer brilliance of the movie in its simplicity, nothing out of the world targeted or overt cheap scare tactics or stuffs like that. An extremely well controlled script with some superb acting by the two lead actors separated by huge age difference and experience but together bringing an absolute movie goers delight.",The Sixth Sense

There is virtually no dialogue, and despite the claims of reviewers, little if any suspense. If you have enough time and money to rent this movie, it would be more entertaining to light the money on fire and try not to burn down your house.

The main reason for my top rating here is that despite me being a careful and experienced viewer (especially because I had being warned for this) I felt stupid due to the crashing and flawless ending of the movie. Very good job by the director who deserves the credit for his careful job, so careful that made me going all over the whole movie again to spot a weakness but fortunately I didn't.

I recently bought it on DVD, but I haven't watched it, as it is very hard to start, and nearly impossible to stop.

The surprise ending totally blew me away.  I see so many movies that I rarely see anything I was not expecting.  If you don't already know the plot, this is the story of a psychiatrist and a boy who sees ghosts.  M. Night Shyamalan showed true genius in the directing of this film.  I had to see it a second time to really appreciate how every detail was perfect.  When viewing the second time I was constantly thinking how could I have missed that?! Every clue was there.  Every scene had just the perfect amount of subtly.  The Sixth Sense was by far the best movie of 1999.",The Sixth Sense

(just not necessarily before bedtime)There are so many twists and turns that even if one was to attempt to guess what the finale holds, one would likely fail. It's best to just play along with the script. The camera work and sets are expertly designed. It's almost impossible to find a mishap in this regard. Another rarely: This film is able to keep one attention on the screen even when it's already been viewed. I have seen this film at least 5 times since its' release in 1999 and it never fails to send a new fright. The wide screen version is definitely the best.",The Sixth Sense

I will just say that although this movie has very good acting and directing, it is not a ""thriller-masterpiece"". It is more like a good human tragedy, with a lot of feelings expressed. If you expect something frightening or thrilling, you will either be disappointed or maybe you are just an easy spectator not asking much from a movie, no offense intended. The whole problem with the 6th sense is that if you pay attention to what really happens, which you should do with any movie, you understand right away what it is about, and it lose the taste that made people vote 10/10 for it.",The Sixth Sense

I am a fan of Bruce Willis and he has his moments in this one, but I for one cannot stand Haley Joel. I believe his best movie was Forrest Gump and thats because he had few lines and was in 5% of the movie. I am not saying that ""The Sixth Sense"" was a terrible movie, but it does not live up to it's hype and certainly not to the IMDb top 100 rating. It was a very uneventful flick with boring dialogue and a very dry plot. To put it bluntly it bored me to tears. After weeks of hearing praise and worship after the viewing I was severely disappointed. The ending was good, but the rest of the movie was just average. If you want to see a good M. Night movie, watch ""Unbreakable"", I think ""Signs"" was just as overrated. All in all I gave this movie a 6/10 or maybe a B-.

1298,mrtynr,A decent thriller with a predictable ending,6,19 October 2014,"I have watched this movie later than most of the people did. As a punishment, I knew the twisted ending before I had watched the movie. However, although the idea was decent, there were horrible gaps and inconsistencies in the logic of the movie. Since it is a N. Shyamalan movie, people got used to these gaps and stuff over the years, however sixth sense is one of the firsts and I believe that is the reason for the high score in IMDb. If this movie was in cinemas in 2014 it could not get more than 6 or 7 stars at most.Anyway, our story is about an child psychologist who was shot in his house by a child whom he was not able to help in the past. It is not a spoiler yet because it is how everything started. Then he continues walking around for almost a year (they say next fall, but it means some time definitely passed), trying to help another little kid who claims to see ""dead people who do not understand that they are dead"". OK, this is also acceptable since it is the basis of many horror stories. Meanwhile his wife is not talking to him, not a word even and we have no idea why. He is the one who got shot, and next scene, wife is not talking to him. At the end, we understood that he is one of the dead people who is not aware of the situation. OK, I can accept this one as well. But how can they accept us to believe that it makes sense when no one is talking to you??? Your wife is not talking to you, even has not a single emotions towards you. Also in one scene, we see our guy waiting with the mother of the child in a living room for him to get back from school. Really? Not a single word with a foreigner in a room? He asked some questions like ""hello, how are you? I am your child's shrink"" and when she did not reply what happened? He taught that no one speaks with him because he got shot???In my opinion it was a forced ending. People were diverted from the fact by some scenes that makes no sense at all. For people who watched a thriller like ""The Others"", this movie is full of logic gaps. If you want to spend some nice time, I suggest this movie. However I believe it is not a master piece or worths anything around 8 stars...",The Sixth Sense

They might as well have ended the movie with the same absurd outlandishness as the utterly silly movie ""Ghost"" with Patrick Swayze, and just have Bruce Willis hug and kiss his wife goodbye at the end. They already ruined it as a serious, believable horror movie, so why not finish it off in the same ridiculous manner. I mean if Patrick Swayze as a ghost can beat up a fellow with a physical body, and Bruce Willis as a ghost can pick up and throw corporeal objects, why not go all out and just give the movie an ending with the same silly elements they already added in to the movie. At least they would win over people like my elderly mother who would rent it for the silly, ""feel good"" 100% Hollywood ending. As it stands now, mature Horror fans rate this movie closer to ""Ghost"" due to the superfluous inane segments, far away from something more sophisticated like ""Rosemary's Baby"", which treats its subject matter with more seriousness, depth, and overall respect.",The Sixth Sense

And, quite frankly, I wanted to see this movie before the trailers or some over-zealous TV show gave away more of the plot than I wanted to know.Now I'm glad my expectations were low because this movie, unlike 99.9% of the movies out there, truly surprised me.  Not only was the writing, acting, and directing excellent, but it was far more scary than any movie I've seen since ""Seven"".  My hands ached at the end of the movie from gripping my friend's hand so tight!  And, for a nice change, I was not able to predict the plot.As a little boy who is gifted - or cursed, rather - with a sixth sense, Haley Joel Osment is mesmerizing to watch.  He is a darn good little actor! Bruce Willis, as the boy's troubled psychologist, also gives a wonderful and subtle performance (didn't see his famous smirk even once!).Go see this movie.

1312,layer,this is a topnotch film,10,7 August 1999,"I love Bruce Willis. I'll bet that's an unpopular statement, but it's true. There is no other actor I can think of that alternately does blockbusters and ""other"" movies.  The blockbusters are sometimes interesting (Die Hard was, Armegeddon wasn't).  The other movies almost always are interesting. For example, this movie, Twelve Monkeys, and Pulp Fiction.  Now, I agree the blockbusters are more numerous than the other films.Anyway, getting to the movie at hand.  A ""horror"" flick with no violence, you ask?  What?  How can this be?  It's true.  This movie is so unlike the rest of the crap flying out of hollywood it is amazing. No state-of-the-art special effects.  None.This movie has a twist that I didn't see coming, and I always see twists coming.  I've seen too many damn movies and I'm too cynical. In fact, during this movie, my cynic alarm went off falsely a couple of times.The other thing which amazes me about this movie is how good that kid is. The lines he says are really good, yes, but he is really good.Lots of scenes in this movie could have turned out a lot different, if the direction and writting hadn't been as good. For some people they may not work (like some of the idiots who laughed at inappropriate times in the showing I saw), but they did for me.

1315,Phil Dog,"A Titanic-like film, which is to say really over-rated",3,26 September 1999,"Let me begin by saying that Sixth Sense is not a ""bad"" movie, instead it is an average movie.  The whole film was built ground up from the ending, and no film has ever made it so painfully obvious that the ending was written first and then a story was added to make it long enough.  Also I have a terrible bit of information to tell everyone, Bruce Willis is really bad at acting like he cares.  It didn't work in Armageddon, it doesn't work here, and it's not going to work the next time he's cast as a truly caring man. Though in all honesty if you think about this film in great detail you realize he does not care, and is simply incredibly self-serving.  Despite all my personal distaste for this film, it is not one of the worst movies ever made, but it is nothing more than average.  The plot is relatively simple, and if you go into the theater actually thinking you'll know how the movie is going to end within half an hour.  The only real reason to see this movie is so that you can see if you can figure out the ending before the end of the film.  After you've seen this once and seen how it ends, it is incredibly unlikely that the weak plot line will be enough to draw you back for a second time.  This movie can be fun as a one-time mind quest to figure out the conclusion, but once you know the ending, this movie really has very little, if anything to offer.",The Sixth Sense

Not only does this movie leave you haunted and chilled, it leaves you with a sense of belief.  The direction and the dialogue keep this film tight knit and doesn't drift off.

This film will make you feel every emotion- happiness, sadness, shock, fear, pity, anger, fear, shock, joy, fear, shock...did I mention fear and shock?I would recommend this to anyone who likes to be scared, not by gore and special effects, but by psychological twists and turns. Oh, and for all you gore fans, there are a few scenes with blood. ;)Even without the last 15 minutes, this film would have been worth my ticket price. But the last 15 minutes had my jaw on the floor in awe and shock-one of the few times a film has done this for me. Go see it.Bruce Willis gives a haunting performance as a tortured child psychologist trying to make up for a past failure, all the while losing the most important thing to him, his wife. The boy who plays Cole, the child who can see dead people, (I just looked his name up but it escapes me right now) is wonderful. This is one of the few child actors I don't want to smack around 5 minutes into the film. The woman playing his mother also gives a very convincing performance of a woman who desperately loves her son and feels helpless in how to help him.My recommendation: Go see it!",The Sixth Sense
1322,lamedog,"Better than I expected, but...",7,11 August 1999,"The ads made it look really cheesy, so the film surpassed my expectations a lot (call it the Hudson Hawk gag reflex, tho Willis has redeemed himself lately - 5th Element, Pulp Fiction).6S is a really chilling horror story to experience on screen (unlike Blair Witch, which to me is more chilling in the retelling, and will creep me out the next time I go camping).  I liked the elements of Lars Von Trier's The Kingdom, Jacob's Ladder, and an old Twilight Zone that permeated it.  I liked the shadowy camera effects.  But, IMO, the plot twist, while clever and somewhat unexpected, negates the whole second act.  I can't get into it without spoiling the movie, so I hope this is clear enough to the folks that did see it.Still, an intelligent, well-executed film that does cater to the mainstream!7/10",The Sixth Sense
1323,KathyT,The best film of the year (so far...),10,24 August 1999,"I've read a few negative reviews of this film and I really wonder if the writers saw the same film I did.  To me, this was an outstanding film.  The story was suspenseful and moving, and the acting, without exception, was superb.  I have always avoided Bruce Willis films because I believed he couldn't act, but I've been very wrong.  His performance moved me to tears. And if Haley Joel Osment does not get an Oscar nomination, I will boycott the awards!  I just loved everything about this film, especially the ending, and I will see it again.  It is by far the best film I have seen so far this year.  No one should miss it!I do have only one small complaint - why is it so many films find they need to include a scene where one of the characters vomits on screen?  I understand the scene's contribution to the story in this case, but these scenes really make me physically sick.",The Sixth Sense
1324,Prav,So so until....,10,22 January 2000,"Up to the last 10 minutes of the movie, I was very blah about it.  Just thinking, ""That's it???""  And then, wham!  Those final 10 minutes raised my rating from a 5 to a 10+!  I remembered later that someone had said the ending was unexpected, but there was NO way that I would have ever seen this one coming.  Not to give anything away, but I highly recommend seeing the movie a *2nd* time.... it is SO unbelievable that the movie is so seamlessly put together that, even knowing the ending, there is nothing to give it away.",The Sixth Sense
1325,spikeplayer,Bruce Willis can act?,9,16 December 1999,This was cool. I thought it was going to have the ultimate in feel good endings but I was wrong. The Sixth Sense has a very unpredictable twist in the last 10 minutes. Very creepy and scary in some parts which will make you jump.  Bruce Willis surprised me with his acting ability in this.  overall awesome stuff.,The Sixth Sense
1326,Hezekia,Quality movie--supenseful plot that draws viewers in,10,7 September 1999,"Such a great movie! I was drawn into the fear of the young boy who sees dead people and felt the mother's pain regarding her son's ""secret"".  Bruce Willis was exceptional as the child psychologist who is helped by the boy as much as he, as a doctor, helps the child. The plot twists are both subtle and overwhelming!",The Sixth Sense
1327,Ronaldo-5,An unrelentingly tense journey through fear to salvation.,9,20 August 2000,"I am not fond of thrillers.  But this film captures some of the dark, brooding, intelligent world of Stanley Kubrick and allies it with the humour Kubrick could never possess.  The child lead is unforgettable and indeed the film owes much of its power to the sympathy you feel with his fear.  Bruce Willis gives a strong performance, perhaps the best of his career.  The cinematography is excellent, none of the characters is weak, and the plot twist -- well, it is jolting.  A very thought-provoking journey using religious references and excellent dialogue that give the film a lasting impact.",The Sixth Sense
1328,Arkham-4,The best film of the year.,10,16 August 1999,"6th Sense was without a doubt in my mind, the best film this year.  Forget the special effects of Haunting, forget the amateur novelty of Blair Witch, if you want to see a great film with ghosts, see 6th Sense. Bruce Willis is fantastic, and the young boy who plays the lead is a real ""child actor,"" meaning a child who can act.  The performances are great, the direction superb, and the storyline...the ending was the first ever to just blow me away. I walked out of that theater open-jawed and wanting to see the movie again. No one bothers to make movies with thoughtful twists and spookiness like Hitchcock or the Twilight Zone anymore, where the twists in the story are more important the CGI...this movie should, if there's any justice, persuade Hollywood to go back to that style of ""scary movie.""",The Sixth Sense
1329,Corky-18,Great character acting by a small boy,8,18 August 1999,"Many youngsters over the years have given good performances, but none have been as great as Haley Joel Osment in The Sixth Sense.  He definitely should get an Oscar for his work.  Bruce Willis was O.K, maybe better than O.K but Haley really made this unusual movie.  Looking forward to seeing ""I'll Remember April.""",The Sixth Sense
1330,TommyE-3,Good but overrated I think,7,21 January 2000,The story is good and gripping and I was really surprised by the ending. We have some good actors and nice camerawork and it's sure a very good movie but I do not think it is as brilliant as some people find it.,The Sixth Sense
1331,RCW-7,A great film with THAT twist.,10,29 April 2000,"It is all too often the case that a film will come along amidst a blaze of publicity and ultimatly fail to meet expectations. On the other hand once every few years a film will come out with little if any real hype and blow the competition away. In 1999 this film was The Sixth Sense. The premise is really very simple, ""boy sees dead people"" and were this a typical Hollywood picture this is exactly all you would have. However writer/director M. Night Shymalam brings a fresh approach which opens new possibilities that many others would not have wasted time or valuable budget on. For example, the special effects are kept to a bare minimum, so that when you do see something horrific it is genuinley disturbing unlike some films i.e. The Haunting. As with most films this one must rely on the performance of it's leading man or in this case boy. In this role Haley Joel Osment is a revelation, cue oscar nomination. He has excellent support from a brilliantly understated Bruce Willis and fellow oscar nominee Toni Collette. Finally for those of you who have been living in outer space, this film has a twist in it's tail that turns your whole perspective of the movie upside down, and this is certainly one of the reasons for it's huge box office sucess, (many people were going back to see it again). However I was one of the unlucky ones who had been told the ending in advance, but I have to say it didn't spoil my enjoyment one little bit.",The Sixth Sense
1332,Latany,Job well done!,10,13 August 1999,"This was an awesome movie! Great script, great direction, and it was nice to see Bruce Willis act for a change.  And the movie moved at a slow, deliberate pace without boring you to death.  It was also nice that the trailers didn't give away the ending.  I loved the Blair Witch Project, but The Sixth Sense has replaced it as my favorite movie of the summer.",The Sixth Sense
1333,ghostboy,Everything a good movie should be.,10,31 August 1999,"Everything a good movie should be.  A great story, a superb cast, and not over-hyped (ala Blair Witch Project).  Bruce Willis plays a rather sub-dued role as a renowned child-psychologist, and Haley Joel Osment plays the chilling Cole Sear.  They have the best on-screen chemistry I have ever seen.  Cole is given a lot of scenes where he has to react well or the scene is blown.  He does it so well, in fact, that it sounds more like a normal conversation than a script.  I will admit that it starts out slow, and it did get boring.  But no matter what you do, PAY ATTENTION.  It will pay off in the greatest ending ever shot on film.  This is one of the most highly enjoyable films ever made and I think that everyone should be given the opportunity to experience it",The Sixth Sense
1334,BDupuis,Fantastic psychological thriller,10,14 August 1999,"This is a movie that is truly wonderfully surprising.  I expected a good,  entertaining movie.  What I didn't expect was such fantastic performances,  and a truly involving story.We haven't seen a performance by Bruce Willis this good since his convincing performance in ""12 Monkeys.""  And the truly unbelievable performance by Haley Joel Osment was over the top.How the director elicited such emotion from this boy is amazing.Frightening at times,  this movie does not allow you to look away for long.  Make certain that bladders are voided and popcorn is purchased...  you're not going to want to leave",The Sixth Sense
1335,royalbob,Not quite as good as I thought it would be,3,10 August 1999,"With all of the good commentaries I read about ""TSS"" I expected much more out of the film than I got.The main problem with the film is its persistent slowness and confusing development. Some of the supernatural the child ""sees"" is given without any explanation, like the ""ghosts"" in the story have no other purpose but to frighten the viewer. The film suffers from a short attention span, jumping from one storyline right to the other with no explanation. The film also focuses too heavily on the score; there is a point where Willis and the boy are sitting in a room by themselves for about a half minute, not saying a word, while the film's music is playing at full forte. Had there been an important plot revelation at the time it would have seemed sensible, but the attitude was more like, ""we spent x number of dollars on this score, so we darn better well use it anywhere we can.""The ending of the movie is genius (which is why I gave it 3 stars instead of one) but by the time I reached it I was so bored and disappointed that it did not have much of an effect on me. It seemed like the writer dreamed up of a perfect ending to a movie but could not put anything worthwile as filler. If the movie was more like an hour-long ""Amazing Stories"" episode, it would have been perfect; but as is it was a little too drawn out for me.***/out of ten",The Sixth Sense
1336,Revolution25,"Very intelligent, very scary",9,6 August 1999,"""The Sixth Sense"" is a very smart, well acted, scary film.  Willis plays his role perfectly, not giving anymore or less than he needed to make it work. Osment gives one of the best performances by a child actor that I have seen in a very long time.  It starts out slow, but I never found it boring.  The scary moments are timed just right and had me on the edge of my seat.  One of the sleeper hits of the year.",The Sixth Sense
1337,joe82,Excellent film that is good 'til the end,10,6 August 1999,"This movie was great.  The plot is exceptional and the acting was supurb.

I assure you that you will not be disappointed.",The Sixth Sense
1338,Reason-3,A terrific surprise (in more ways than one).,10,10 August 1999,"Going into this movie, I was a little upset to realize at the last second that it was PG-13.  It turns out, this added to my enjoyment much more walking out of the theater knowing that such a terrific film, and such a deeply frightening one had been done at that level. And it was perfect. If it had anything that would earn it an R, it would have ruined the effect.On to the actual movie.  More than anything, the less you know about this movie the better, and the trailers are particularly unhelpful in this respect by giving away something that you're not supposed to immediately know (They also portray the movie as being horribly cheesy in my opinion, but hopefully in 10 years no one will remember the trailer and will remember the movie). So I won't say anything about the plot, except that I found it engaging, well paced, and well written; though to state it that way is to make it clinical in a way it really doesn't deserve.Bruce Willis and the kid both turned in great performances (Bruce Willis can really act when he has a good character), and Tak Fujimoto's cinematography was perfect. The lighting was perfectly called for, and of a style rarely seen, and the occasional use of a handheld camera was far from being the recent trendy attempts at ""realism"", but instead brought intimacy (something the movie successfully creates as a whole as well).I ended up walking out of the theater and turning to the person I saw it with and simply saying ""Grand slam."" Why? Because it slammed me with clever fright beats? Or had witty dialog? Or a clever hook? None of these. It simply accomplished everything that it set out to accomplish perfectly, without ever seeming over the top, trying too hard, losing steam, or relying on effects. That type of solid film-making is rarely rewarded and hard to find.And oh yes. It's very scary.",The Sixth Sense
1339,jdkalv,pastiche formula,3,29 September 2000,"SPOILER ALERT I cannot believe that this was so highly commended by others. The phrase of Latin which meant *nothing* to the plot, the ineptitude of a man who, after a year of trying to eat or go to the bathroom without avail, discovers that he is a corpse only through a child, are only two of the many silly elements in the plot. A cute kid actor and a committee-written plot certainly seemed to play well with the public, but when you look beneath the hood, there was very little there. Fight Club, for all its own inconsistencies, had much more to say to the soul. This is where the best version of Sixth Sense lies.",The Sixth Sense

1351,Ana-28,Oh my God.,10,21 August 1999,"I saw this movie last night and have never been so emotionally and physically affected by one movie in my entire life. It wasn't even the terror it installed in me or even the pity I had for the little boy, that made me actually sick to my stomach. It was the raw emotion in the acting and the images on the screen. I just wish that I had waited and rented this movie so I wouldn't have to sit in a theatre full of people who didn't like the uncomfortable and upsetting feelings and giggled uncertainly at the little boy with the hole in the back of his head. Oh yes, America, go ahead. Laugh at the dead little boy skipping off to find his father's gun. Oh isn't he SO amusing. F**k you all. anyways . . . moving on. :)I was stunned by the beautiful and sickening (in the good way) displays of raw emotion in the movie. I had expected it to be just like ""a scary movie."" And sure there were times that it scared the hell out of me, but most often it made me cry. The first ghost, the woman in the kitchen was by far the most effective. When she whirled around screaming ""No, dinner isn't ready yet, and you can't hurt me anymore!"" I burst into uncontrollable sobs while the guy next to me laughed confusedly. The acting was so amazing, not only with stunning performances by the boy and child psychiatrist but the dead people too. I was haunted all night by the face of the little girl crouched under her bed and by the screams of the man trapped in the room. I left the theatre with a pounding headache, a gut wrenching stomach ache and images of the dead and suffering burned into my head. I went home and wished for once that I was one of those desenstized Americans who could see someone mentally decompose and giggle. I wanted to forget the feelings that I'd had. I wanted to be able to sleep. This movie is one of the best movies I have seen. With ingenius camera angles and images and the best acting I have seen in a film since SLC Punk! it is a haunting movie that will hopefully move you in ways you've never been moved before.",The Sixth Sense

1355,Sardonic,Thoroughly remarkable filmmaking!,10,2 August 1999,"Caught The Sixth Sense at a sneak preview.  I'd only had the trailer to go on to know what to expect, and besides thinking that trailer suffers from the give-too-much-away-itis' that most trailers seem to suffer from these days, I had little clue what to expect.  I'd never seen any of M. Night Shyamalan's work, never saw Toni Collette in anything and only had Rushmore to go on in knowing Olivia Williams, so I can tell you I was pleasantly surprised by what I saw tonight.  Shyamalan has written a corker of a script, stylish and lean, and his direction is truly remarkable.  The pacing may make some impatient gonzos squirm (as it did with the moron behind me who kept muttering back to the screen), but this is no cheap-scare-a-minute wild-cutting frightfest.  Instead, we get a moody, creepy and suspenseful masterwork, with a gripping story and great, great performances from the whole cast.  Toni Collette and Olivia Williams are excellent, but it is Willis and Haley Joel Osment (Forrest Gump Jr.) that are the backbone of this film, and their work is incredible.  Will you be frightened?  Yes.  Are there scary moments?  Yes.  Are there any gross-out ghoulies jumping out at you or outrageous FX to make you realize that this is the scary part and I'm supposed to scream now?'  Most definitely not.  What you do get is a convincing and unnerving film that crawls under your skin and waits for the right moment to grab you.  Shyamalan is a talent to watch out for, and Willis continues to amaze me with his keen eye for odd projects that turn out to be fantastic movies.  Can't wait to see it again.  One bit of advice: Go in cold.  Don't read reviews, don't talk to friends.  Trust me on this, you'll thank me later.",The Sixth Sense

1358,paladin-38,One of those rare movies that uses the conventions of a tired genre to to express a deeply humanistic vision.,10,8 August 1999,"Within one month of each other, 2 watershed movies have opened that have, each in their own way, done more to shake the hoary old genre of horror movies to its foundations than any movies in decades. One is the Blair Witch Project; the other is The Sixth Sense.The horror genre has been mired for some time in the baroque self-indulgence of superficial and ornamental special effects.  The Blair Witch Project has come along like the cinematic equivalent of punk rock---stripping away the self-indulgence to help rediscover the elemental core of the genre.The Sixth Sense is quite another matter entirely:  it is quite simply a great pop movie----deeply felt, humanistic---and almost certain to be overlooked and underestimated.  It is a movie that uses the conventions of the horror genre, but bends them to its own purposes. Like the movie ET, which taught us that not all aliens are unfriendly invaders, and in so doing, liberated the alien/sci fi genre.......so to The Sixth Sense steadfastly refuses to view the spirit world as some adolescent frat-party of frights. Instead, it reacquaints us with the age-old lore that tells us that the dead shall walk the earth as long as their spirits are troubled.  The dead do not haunt the earth, and our memories, just to scare us---but because they want something from us, some grace note that gives their lives meaning, and settles old hurts and misunderstandings, but not in the immature and vengeful way that the horror genre had descended into.  And we the living want something from the deceased who have left us:  we want them to be proud of us, to give us their blessing. And so this movie, incredibly enough for a movie that plays almost straight with the conventions of the horror genre, is a subtle meditation about love and connectedness and relationships, between the living, and between the living and the dead.  It is a movie about redemption.  And one thing it helps to redeem is the genre that it arises from.",The Sixth Sense
1359,Netboy67,Surprise Thriller of the Summer,9,8 August 1999,"The Sixth Sense is the surprise thriller of the summer. Not as hyped as the other `scary' movies released this summer, it ends up being scarier and better. The Sixth Sense is not juts a scary movie, it is a psychological thriller. It is a work of art. It is compassionate and appealing and takes over your senses in a slow hypnotic way. Not what you would expect from a movie that has Bruce Willis listed as the main star. Fortunately, this movie is in no way like other Bruce Willis films.I will tell you a little about the story, which is ideally all you need to know prior to seeing the film, just a little. Bruce Willis is Malcolm Crowe, an award winning psychiatrist whom almost a year after a traumatizing event takes on a boy with similar problems of another boy he tried to help but could not. Haley Joel Osment plays Cole, the little boy who is deeply troubled and withdrawn no one knows why. Except, of course, for us, who already know from the ads and commercials for this film that he `sees dead people'. Cole lives with his divorced mother, played by Lynn Collette.Director M. Night Shyamalan has directed this movie in a quiet slow Hitchcockian way that works to its benefit, especially amidst complaints that the film drags. It is a very carefully weaved story that creates an interest that compels you to watch every part. The acting is excellent, particularly that of Haley Joel Osment. His painful and anguished expressions from the terror he feels just tear into your heart. The strained relationship between the scared boy and his single, loving and caring mother is also touching as well. Willis is great as the sad, concerned, and frustrated psychologist, bent on saving the boy, so that he may save his career and his marriage. The dark twists and the commentaries on death and loss make this movie extremely touching and there are scenes in which there are very few dry eyes in the theater, something not expected from a horror/ thriller. And this movie does not over do it in its horror; it remains classy and subtle, yet shocking. You will jump in your seat at least twice, which is once more than I did at The Haunting.This movie is slow at first, but it builds up a great story, superb acting, good scares, and pulls at the heartstrings when you least expect it. The ending is an all out shocker, and makes the movie. I will not predict Oscars for this film, but I will say it is definitely the best movie of the Summer Film Season, and one of the best movies of the year. Definitely one of my Top Ten movies of all time. Give it a shot.",The Sixth Sense
1360,kiki-40,Awesome,10,9 August 1999,"I was very impressed with this movie.  I don't know how to describe it. A love story, drama, horror, action,it is all of these wrapped up in one. When i was in the theater people really got into the movie.  People jumped with surprise, laughed , and just everyone there seemed to really enjoy this movie.  I saw this opening night then went 2 days later and saw blair witch. I enjoyed sixth sense 100 percent more than blair witch(which was an 87 min movie and sixth sense was 114 mins of pure enjoyment) I could really relate with the relationship Malcolm and Cole has and how they help each other out. It's not just the doctor helping his patient out but together they bond.  It is a bit graphic of a movie which all in all really makes the movie.  Go see it for yourself...you will not be disappointed .. i say this will be the number one film of the year",The Sixth Sense
1361,Bennan,"A horror film that transcends the genre, with a stunning ending",10,9 August 1999,"A wonderful horror/suspense film that transcends the genre. How often does a movie come out that takes a long-established and even cliched genre and turn it on its ear? I can think of only a few in the last two decades, including ""Pulp Fiction"" which changed how we look at crime films and ""Die Hard"" which did the same for action films. Well, ""The Sixth Sense"" is one of these rare movies, and it will change how you look at ghost stories forever. (And, interestingly enough, Bruce Willis is in all three of these films! Weird, huh?) I won't reveal much of the plot here, since the less you know about the film going in, the better. But I will say that it involves ghosts; the film has a clearly defined idea of what a ghost is, exactly, and that idea is crucial to the plot of the film... which involves the relationship between a child psychologist (Willis) and a little boy who has a very big problem. ""The Sixth Sense"" is slowly and deliberately paced (though never boring), is filled with both heart-breaking moments and knowing humor, reveals plot through character development and subtle directing instead of through heavy-handed manipulation of the audience like most horror films, and manages to horrify without dumb ""shock""-moments and a minimum of gore. The acting by everyone here is uniformly superb, especially by Haley Joel Osment, a child-actor who plays the main character and who is dead-on perfect in scene after scene after scene. The quiet moments between him and an equally superb Bruce Willis are beautifully written, funny, sad, quirky and original. And the movie builds to an incredible ending that will leave your head spinning, guaranteed. A true classic.",The Sixth Sense
1362,bow-3,A haunted little boy seeks help from a psychologist.,10,9 August 1999,Holy Ghost! is this a great film!  I saw it two days ago and I still am pondering it.  Bruce Willis has never been so good and that little boy is wonderfully sincere.  Go see this movie right away.,The Sixth Sense
1363,JMillion,Excellent,9,11 August 1999,"Maybe this movie was so good to me because it was a surprise, but I think it was wonderful.  I haven't been so taken by an ending since ""Usual Suspects"".Excellent performances by all... most notably the young boy.  Bruce Willis is the best he's been since ""Pulp Fiction"".  Do yourself a favor and see this one.  If the trailer turns you off, ignore it.  It's better than you think.",The Sixth Sense
1364,willie-40,Another great movie for Willis,10,9 August 1999,"Ever since the days of Moonlighting and Diehard, I have been a big fan of Bruce Willis.  This was his best picture so far.  This screenplay and plot development were amazing. The ending gave me chills that I last felt when Kaiser Soze was indentified in The Usual Suspects.  The child in this movie is intensely real in both his scared scenes and happy ones.  Great movie and nice to see Bruce working on something worth while for a change(Mercury Rising ugh!).",The Sixth Sense
1365,Reith-2,This film will keep you awake at night...,10,10 August 1999,"Remember when you were little and had to run up the basement stairs really fast for fear of being grabbed by...something?  Or jumping onto your bed from as far away as possible so as not to have to deal with the monsters under your bed?  Well, get ready to relive those fears for a couple of days after you see this movie.This film had an impact on me like no other film has in a long time.  Not even Blair Witch.  While some parts were scary in Blair Witch, 6th Sense grabs you from the beginning - strings you along keeping you interested in how these things could happen and totally stuns you in the end.If you don't like scary movies - go for the story it's self and just cover your eyes.  If you love scary movies, keep you eyes wide open and relish in the thought of what the little boy has to go through.Is the acting good?  That is a valid question with Bruce Willis and his normal, ""I'm a big tough guy who forgot how to smile in all my adversity"". But Bruce excels in this film, and the child is someone I will watch with interest as he continues his career.Go see this film and then give me a call...it's the kind you just HAVE to talk about!",The Sixth Sense

Through Haley's brilliant acting you can really understand what it's like to see ghosts. And you completely understand Bruce's frustration through out the film...who can help?Though not a Willis fan, I will be more willing to watch his films with hopes to see more performances like this one.",The Sixth Sense
1367,DuDeMaN-5,Awesome. Simply Awesome.,10,10 October 1999,"Of the thousands of movies I have seen, this is probably the most nerve-racking, mind-blowing, excellent movie I have ever seen.  Its soundtrack does a lot of this, since the music is discreetly put in the back ground, with a Jaws-like feel, peeking at the most suspenseful times. However, as it is in some movies, it doesn't do it all.  The very feel of the movie is dark, with everything leading up to everything else.  Plot twists are numerous, and you are always guessing what is going on, BUT YOU RARELY GET IT RIGHT!  Another plus is the use of the camera and camera angles, in which you know afterwards that every camera shot and every angle it is shot from is thought out completely.  And the movie uses discreet details to give it a very eerie feel.  I can't tell you specific examples of this movie, since saying very little is very likely to give away too much. So you're just going to have to see it yourself.",The Sixth Sense
1368,snoopy-44,Great Film,10,24 March 2000,This is one of the most fascinating films that I've seen in a long time. There were great performances in this film and I loved the final twist was grand.  It reminds me of Stephen King's work.  I never would have thought that after leaving the theater that I'd be left so stunned and surprised. I give it two thumbs up!!!,The Sixth Sense
1369,steve-542,See it before someone ruins it!,10,12 August 1999,Wow. A blow your mind film. The script was incredible. The dialog was riveting. The acting was superb. Bruce Willis showed me why I keep going to his crappy action movies. The kid was the best child actor I've ever seen in a movie (and kicked that whiney little punk Anakin's butt). I'll say it again... see it before your moron friends ruin it for you,The Sixth Sense

1372,Synch-2,Very Orginal,9,18 August 1999,"Going into the movie I thought that this was going to your typical horror movie. When you first see the commercials for this movie you are to assume that the ghosts the little boys sees are evil. As you watch the movie you feel that this assumption is in correct. The little boy becomes horrified by the images he is forced to watch. The ghosts all have minds of their own. These aren't the typical ghosts we are so used to seeing in films. All of them walk around not even knowing they are dead. That is what scares the little boy through out the entire film. Why I liked this film was because of its originality. Yes there have been films about people talking to ghosts. But never have we seen ""talking to ghosts"" so dark, gritty, eerie, and real as this film. For instance, the movie, Ghost, where a man dies and comes back to figure out the reason for his death and to help his love in fear of her demise as well in the process. That movie was scary in its own way but also had light hearted humor. It also had the subplot of true love. Six sense on the other hand I feel is the complete opposite from Ghost. True both movies do have the same premise. But as I said Six sense took the whole idea of talking to the dead to a different level as Ghost did. Instead of making light hearted jokes that amused you, like Ghost, it made fun of people and also made u feel bad laughing at them (example the couple buying the wedding ring). and I would also like to point out the movie did have a few faults to it, and a few holes, but overall I felt that this was a very good film and very original. It has made a very good addition to the horror genre . Even though I feel it has many other aspects to it than just being a horror.",The Sixth Sense

Its a totally different movie If you know how it ends, of course most movies are. I loved this movie, Haley Joel Osment was great.I advise anyone who hasn't seen it to see it, unless you are squeamish some of the scenes are a little weird. Also probably not a good movie for kids who scare easily.",The Sixth Sense
1374,Daisy-40,WOW!!!,10,23 August 1999,I loved this movie.  It was one of the best movies I have ever seen.  The acting was great the story line was great.  And the ending was so awesome. It is so worth the money of seeing this film.  I couldn't sleep at all that night becasue I kept thinking I heard people.  My advice go see the movie.,The Sixth Sense
1375,stlblew,Great Movie!,9,24 August 1999,This is the kind of movie you sit and think over for a while after it ends and then discuss with your companion(s).  The acting was great and the characters were believable. Not too scary.  I really got in to the story and situations.,The Sixth Sense

It is a twenty-nine year old, who tackles concepts like death and caring. A review of his previous films suggests that the theme of the child and mentor is an important one for the director. This is a film that captures the shadows of the past cast forward in time and especially in Philadelphia. It should be an Oscar nominee for best picture. It will certainly be a popular one judging by the word of mouth.",The Sixth Sense

Night Shyamalan is working on.This was an amazing piece.By far worth the $14 we spent to see it.I absolutely recommend this movie!",The Sixth Sense

1379,Chipwood,"If you like being scared, but without the gore/sex/language...",10,29 October 1999,"The first time I saw ""The Sixth Sense"", my wife left the theater in the middle of the movie (right before Cole learns the purpose of the 6th sense), because she was terrified.  We had to stay up the rest of the night and watch Disney movies to take her mind off of it.  I was pretty spooked as well, but, since I stayed for the resolution, the movie as a whole was a much more enjoyable experience for me than it was for my wife.I'm glad there are occasional movies like ""The Sixth Sense"" that avoids sex, language, and gratuitous violence/gore, yet still gives you the creeps.  And it's thought-provoking, too!  Highly recommended. (But do not leave before it's over!)",The Sixth Sense

Bruce did a very good job too, one of his best roles to date.",The Sixth Sense
1381,Redfrog-2,They really knew what they were doing...,10,4 September 1999,They really knew what they were doing when they made this film.  This is the kind of movie that makes your blood chill.  There isn't a whole lot of actual horror.  It's a very deliberate take on someone's inner soul.  Many people couldn't handle a movie like this.  I believe they were inspired when they made this film.  I'd only recommend it if you think your beliefs are solid and your faith firm.  This movie will dig into your soul.  You'll think differently but maybe not oppositely when you're done viewing this film.,The Sixth Sense
1382,dark 1,Perfect Movie!!!,10,7 September 1999,"A very intelligent and well orchestrated thriller. A scary and provoking thriller which is centered on a little boy's supernatural dilemma.

1384,Lily-38,Predictable and drawn out,4,13 September 1999,"The so-called great ""twist"" is very obvious early on and causes the rest of the movie to seem incredibly drawn out and long.

This is definitely not one the best movies out there.",The Sixth Sense

How wrong i was. After a fairly uneventful start featuring events that click at the conclusion of the film, I knew this was to be the greatest movie i would see this year. it was the kind of movie that creeps up on you and starts manipulating the little hairs on the back of your neck, then plucks them out, sending a shiver from the hairs on your head down to the extremities of your little toe. The scares don't come thick and fast, but when they do, you are guaranteed of goosebumps. however, the little things just make sense after the twist at the end. The twist at the end is the reason i will not sleep tonight, and i will not work properly tomorrow. the things you thought were irrelevant at the time, all came together and in one fell swoop, melted my mind. my heart stopped, and my jaw dropped until the credits rolled. i'm thinking about it now and can no longer write. i hope everone gets the chance to see this film, and possibly this short comment about it has fueled your curiosity about the film. must see.",The Sixth Sense

Shortly into it, however I worked out the twist which was so obvious I couldn't believe that was it. The rest of the film lumbered on extremely slowly. The music was completely over the top, it was inappropriate to a lot of the scenes. There seemed to be sub plots which did not fit in with the rest of the movie. All in all, quite a painful viewing experience. I seriously do not understand what all the fuss about this movie was, maybe I missed something but I doubt it.",The Sixth Sense

I thought it didn't stand a chance.  Before I saw it, I thought it looked like a lame Bruce Willis movie.  Not scary at all, but interesting.  When I finally saw it, I thought totally different. Before seeing it, I thought it was the last to be given the Oscar for Best Picture.  Now, I think it totally deserved to win.  It was scary, complicated but easy to understand after some thinking, and simply brilliant.  Everybody's making a fuss about the great kid actor Haley Osment, when I think this was definitely the best performance ever by Bruce Willis.  The only thing this film lacked was length.  I thought it was way too short.  All in all, this movie was sad, scary, interesting, and terrific. The only thing it didn't have was comedy.  9 1/2 of 10.",The Sixth Sense
1388,R7,"Nice attempt, falls flat on its face.",2,11 October 1999,"I'm baffled by the popularity of this film -- it is excruciatingly slow, only halfway through it do we find out anything of interest (that the boy can see ghosts), the plot of the movie starts flat and stays flat throughout (the final twist at the end excepted, but that, in my mind, does not save the two hours of drudgery), and the characters seem uniformly one-dimensional. The little boy talks more like an adolescent that he could not be (his performance is good; it's the writing that's not believable), and throughout I felt instead of touched, emotionally manipulated (here's the music for you to feel moved, never mind that the dialogue and the situation is thoroughly cheesy). The story means well, but it feels like the screenwriter's bad first draft -- it needed substantial polishing. If you decide to see this film, know that you're in for a fake, manufactured experience without satisfactory plot development or resolution.",The Sixth Sense

Well I wasn't.Particular praise should go to the boy Haley.  One of the best child performances on screen I have seen.Bruce Willis plays Bruce Willis.  Toni Collette does are wonderful job as the distraught mother although the part is fairly small.  The scene in the car was very touching and believable emotions were portrayed.This was a movie that relied on actors and a skillful director to make it work.  It is good to get away from the action at all cost mentality that comes from Hollywood most of the time.",The Sixth Sense

Luckily for us, M. Night Shyamalan is as much a fan of Henry James as Stephen King, and his movie, The Sixth Sense, is a masterpiece of psychological horror that would make the writer of 'Turn of the Screw' proud. Shyamalan successfully resists the temptation to throw in cheap thrills, and instead focuses on the characters, how they react to their situation, and how they are changed by it.  The audience quickly sympathizes with the young boy who can see dead people, and the broken man who feels driven to help him.Young Haley Joel Osment gives a performance that is more textured than any since Anna Paquin in the Piano, and Bruce Willis' familiar taciturn demeanour works well for him.  Certainly one of the best movies of the year.",The Sixth Sense

I wasn't even in the predicting mode when The Sixth Sense surprised me more than any other movie ever has. And the surprise is not far fetched. It's completely logical but so well hidden in the way the movie moves.
The movie also got my hair to stand straight for a few extended moments, and startled me once.And all that was done with a brilliant script, acting talents, brilliant cutting and direction, and music that plays with the viewer's feelings.I love surprises.I'm hard to surprise.I got surprised.Excellent movie.",The Sixth Sense

Sometimes ghosts don't know that they are dead and only see what they want to see.Cole meets child psychologist Malcolm Crowe  (played by Bruce Willis) who tries to help him get to grips with his ""sixth sense"".The movie is touching and sometimes scary but never gory.

Macaulay Culkin, Shirley Temple and Gary Coleman to name but a few.  There seems though a marked difference in the promise of young Haley-Joel Osment who almost carries the brilliant 'Sixth Sense' on his own shoulders as the apparently mentally troubled Cole Sear.  Osment seems to almost inspire the likes of Bruce Willis to separately stellar performances.  Cole Sear claims to have the ability to 'see dead people', Willis is the child psychologist who helps Cole deal with his strange 'hallucinations'.Willis' character, Malcolm Crowe is determined not to fail Cole in the way he failed an almost identical case years before.  Crowe eventually discovers the incredible truth behind young Coles claims in one of the films more chilling scenes involving a tape recording of a previous session with another 'psychic'.  Another scene which seemed to highlight the films Oscar potential involved Cole and his mother (played well by Toni Collette) caught in a traffic jam resulting from an accident, it is in this scene that the film reached its emotional peak and seems to reach out to anyone who has lost someone close to them without warning and with so much left unfinished.The Sixth Sense is an emotional and truly hair raising, fine piece of work that contains a final twist that will drop your jaw and send you back for more.  It truly is a film that warrants a second viewing. 9/10",The Sixth Sense

Willis is a depressed, disorientated child psychiatrist who has to deal with an apparently reclusive, paranoid child (The remarkable Osment)who exasperates his mother played by Collette (Again excellent). We keep on being told that their ""three minute culture"" attention spans mean slow paced mood pieces like this just won't make it with the popcorn set. Wrong. This film starts slowly, and never speeds up. And It's just because of this slow pace that it generates it's extraordinary power. Willis gives a performance that is so understated it almost seems as if he isn't acting. It turns out the child sees dead people. What is then discovered is the nub of the plot. Rather like Psycho, to reveal any more would ruin it. Shyamalan directs with an aplomb that is tight and underplayed. The whole feel of the piece is positively European. Because of our conditioning from a succesion of easy thrills Hollywood schlock you assume certain scenes will end with gore and splatter. Instead Shyamalan takes the pace down every time. Atmosphere oozes from every scene. This is quality filmmaking for the masses that doesn't take you for granted.It's not a classic.It is a bloody good piece of entertainment",The Sixth Sense

It was okay, but definitely not what I expected.  The trailers portrayed this film as if the majority of it consisted of Cole Sear being frightened and cajoled by ghosts (one example is the scene between Cole and the poisoned girl in her bedroom.  Commercials seemed to imply she was chasing him).  This was not so.  Instead, he didn't reveal his ""secret"" to his psychiatrist until the movie was halfway over.  Even though ""I see dead people"" was the most overplayed line in the commercials, the movie left me under the impression that the audience wasn't supposed to know.  As for the twist, any sharp and clever person can figure it out prior to its revelation.  I am not one of these people, so it was surprising for me.I guess I just expected this movie to be more terrifying than it really was. I thought the twist would be of the frightening, makes-you-jump variety.Also, there were some forgivable but annoying holes in the plot, as other people have mentioned.  The one unforgivable element was Bruce Willis.  He was expressionless, and this dragged the movie down (like the scene where Cole's ""secret"" was revealed, ugh!).  Haley Joel Osment's performance, however, was incredible.  He deserved the Oscar.  He'll probably get one later, the same way Whoopi Goldberg was passed over for The Color Purple but got one for Ghost, instead.All in all, a worthwhile movie to see.  The scenery is great, and the storyline is interesting if you let your imagination fill the gaps.",The Sixth Sense

So I decided to end the constant badgering by my friends and went to see the movie.  I went in expecting average and getting anything but.  The movie keeps you on the edge of your seat with ghosts (that are frighteningly real) and chilly air and the little boy's fright until the incredible turn of events at the end that will make you say, ""Now I understand!"", but you will end the conversation with that.

It could have been so obvious, (well, I'm sure some of you bright ones picked up on it) but he just lead most of us down the path of a completely different story that really didn't even happen! He knew that all he would have to do is show us a little trickery and we'd assume one thing and not worry about considering the alternatives, and we did. The ""mock"" story was already so interesting in itself, that I didn't question the possibility that I was missing something. If you have the DVD, you've probably seen interviews where he explains (in detail) all his carefully thought-out reasons for everything he did- EVERYTHING including where and why he used the color red throughout the movie.

Many leave the theater in awe of the GIANT plot twist, obviously, but that seems to only be the icing on an already richly sweet cake.Almost everyone agrees that the movie was a whole entity before its shocking conclusion surprised them.  I've never seen a plot twister that relied so little on it's ""big secret"".  Perhaps that is part of the reason that so few guessed the ending before it materialized; the audience was so enthralled by the drama, suspense, and downright eerieness of the film that the notion that the wool was being pulled over their eyes simply did not occur to them. This is what made the ending so shocking and incredible.However, a plot twist, in the end, is really just a gimmick.  The layers that made the film so complete were plentiful.  The tone and pacing of the film were appropriate, the directing was obviously focused, and the performances were stupendous.  Truly stupendous.Toni Nicolette: touching.  Donnie Walberg: unsettling.  Haley Joel Osment: inspiring.Hollywood loves to manufacture its child stars and milk whatever attention they can out of their cute faces.  Too often young stars are credited with undue respect. It is seen to be incredible for a child to pull off an emotionally complex role.Haley Joel Osment did not simply ""pull it off"".  He did not merely ""portray"" a character.  He made a character real.  He made us all feel as terrified and as alone and helpless as a boy so cursed would.  I was moved.Donnie Walberg's part was small, but the madness in his face cast a shadow over every moment that followed it.  It prompted me once again to ask why his brother receives so much more work than he.Finally, Toni Nicolette.  I had no idea the level at which her talent reaches.  Now I do.

1431,0478709,One Viewing Only,5,10 June 2001,"Contains Spoiler
The Sixth Sense is a good horror film if viewed only once. Additional viewing's unveil numerous inconsistencies and the blatant manipulations of the director.  Really now, are we to believe that the main character, as played by Bruce Willis, is oblivious to the fact that since his traumatic experience of being shot, no living person is aware of his existence? Where does he get the referral for the young boy at the start of the film? Another disembodied dead psychologist I guess.  Bruce Willis's character laments that he rarely (actually never) converse's with his wife or anybody else for that matter. We're supposed to believe that for a full year he wanders through life oblivious to the fact that no one acknowledges his presence. Horror films such as Psycho, Rosemary's Baby or The Shining stand up to repeated viewings because the essential story line of these films remains consistent and plausible within the world created by the director.  There is a richness of ideas in these films that can be continually unearthed. The Sixth Sense is a one shot wonder, a good one at that, but it does not stand up to subsequent viewing's.",The Sixth Sense
1432,jerrymr_lyn,My favorite thriller movie,9,5 September 2020,"I have never seen a thriller suspense film that touches me so much.
At first glance, I only stayed on the emotional resonance the film bring to me . The boy and the doctor heal each other, and the affection between family members always makes people cry. However , in the second review, I saw more details. It is obvious that the whole movie is so complete and what you get confused at the beginning will be answered at the end.
When he was a child, Haley Joel Osment 's acting skill was too explosive. Every line and expression in his eyes, is so natural and you can really feel what he think or how he feel. Later, I also went to watch ""AI"", another film he played in where his pure eyes left me a very deep impression.
Now, let's talk about the plot. The plot of this movie is very clever and ingenious. And the ending is so exciting . At the end of the film, Cole told his secrets to her mother and the existence of her grandmother. Both generations have been blessed by family affection. There is no doubt that every mother will always love her child.
And the love between Crowe and Anna, I prefer to call it an unspeakable and moving emotion deep in heart. Finally Crowe realized the truth, from shocked, unacceptable, to despair, painful, and finally calmed down. He still accepted the truth, for he helped Cole and fulfilled his wish; he could still be there with his wife in the end.
""You are never second ever"". Despite the reluctance, in the end, they said good night to each other . Tomorrow everything will be different. The movie came to an abrupt end. . . . .In order to match the theme, the overall movie is in a cool tone. The symmetrical still scene lens is left blank, and the rhythm of the whole movie is very comfortable. With the bleak autumn scene and beautiful soundtrack, the appreciation is also high.The horror and suspense effect is quite enough, but the latter is very healing. The timid friends must persist until the end.",The Sixth Sense

I don't think the pace of the movie is too slow, it's necessary to build up the right tension. I saw the movie three times in the theathres in 1999 and I was just as scared every single time. Just like in all movies by this director the ending is very surprising. Still, I don't think that Schymalan has ever made a movie this good again. Unbreakable was a decent movie, so was Signs and The Village but they're not even close to The Sixth Sense. Haley Joel Osment is with out a doubt the best child actor ever and it's too bad you don't see him in so many movies today, except for that time in the news when he was caught drunk driving.

I admit I was surprised by Willis being dead. However I rewatched the movie and realized how deceitful it was to the watcher. A two minute dinner scene is believable that a wife doesn't talk to her husband but think about it, she has ignored him all year. How did he know that she was there. Then at Cole's house his mother and him sits there without talking. How did he get in? Did he introduce himself to her and she just ignored him. The kid is moving around and talking awkwardly in front of his mother to someone she doesn't see and she doesn't get concerned.

1439,TVOR,Somewhat predictable but emotional strong tension,8,22 November 2002,"I didn't see the trailer and I didn't knew anything about this movie excluding that many have said it's very good. Afterwards I saw the trailer and thought; that's like taking part of the effect out of the movie. Name Sixth Sense was only clue and from the first scene I knew this is going to build up into very pensive and prosperous atmosphere. Movie works extremely well almost throughoutly, but tension suffers in last part. It's not the ending itself, but certain aspects of melodramacy and the story itself is a bit repetitive towards ending. Anyhow that's only criticism afterwards.When watching the movie it takes psychological control over your mind if you just let it to do so. Then it goes on all the way to the end and you should find yourself staring vacantly ending credits with strong emotions on surface. Sixth Sense had the same effect than Jacob's Ladder. Nowhere near same movies, but psychological emotional effect is same. Second time watching this film will be different experience.Story itself is being weaved together almost seamlessly. Shyamalan has certainly put a lot of thinking how to build up the story properly without taking compromises. Simplicity works like a beauty and film maintains calm, even peaceful atmosphere all the way despite of fearful moments twisting your mind and sending cold chills down to your spine.Haley Joel Osment as a little boy Cole does just astonishing job. Not just as a child-actor but as an actor. Toni Collette as his mother does a good job too regardless of few mediocre scenes. Bruce Willis is just a slightly bit too self-sufficient in his acting, but does maybe one of the best roles of his career (12 Monkeys was pretty good too). It's more to do with his general acting-personality-image from other films than acting itself in this film.If you're going to watch Sixth Sense, watch it with open mind, otherwise you'll spoil the experience.",The Sixth Sense

Malcolm, in my first viewing, seemed like a good guy who was using Cole as a surrogate for a mistake he made with a previous child. The movie seemed like Malcolm felt if he could help Cole, it would be like helping the previous child he originally ""failed."" And Cole, in my first viewing, seemed like a child with a secret that he did not trust Malcolm with. Then we find out that Cole sees dead people, and that Malcolm had been dead for most of the movie.That first viewing was incredibly satisfying. Then, some months later, I watched it with a friend who had not yet seen it. And in that second viewing I experienced a whole new movie. Now it was about a ghost unable to accept the failure that cost him his life, and a boy who did not understand why was trying to understand why this ghost was trying to be more helpful than the other ones; and how they each helped the other to come to terms and accept what they were.Very rarely does a movie give me such an experience, and that is why I have always made it a movie that I have had in VHS, DVD, and now Blu-Ray.",The Sixth Sense

It is scary without all that gore and killing. It has a really good plot, and unexpected turns. They did a great job on the ""DEAD PEOPLE"", they look dead without looking overdone. I love Cole's character, he's so natural, and Haley does a great job acting scared and sad in this movie. It's entertaining to watch it over and over, and it never gets boring. Bruce Willis was great! He worked so well with Haley. They were both really interesting to watch and each scene was done soo well. I like to hear second opinions, so I asked everyone I know that saw it, what they thought of it, and they all loved it too! It got a great rating (8.2/10), and it is definately worth seeing!! I bought the movie as soon as it came out, and it's really one of the great movies people should own.

Twenty minutes into the film and I could see the twist at the end of the movie. They show the psychologist being shot at almost point blank range and then the same psychologist is shown moving with a child that can see dead people. To add to this, we see the psychologist being ignored by all, except this child! Does it take anything more for one to guess the twist?

From the beautifully haunting score by James Newton Howard, the unbelievably sophisticated performance by Osment (I hate pretentious child actors doing scary, ie 'The Ring', but this kid is special), the dark,moody directing of Shyamlan, Bruce Willis's excellent tortured performance (fast believing he's the best at tortured expressions in the business. See Twelve Monkeys & Unbreakable) and the unsung hero or heroine in the form of Toni Collette (easily the pick of the performances. Haven't seen her mentioned much. Watch the movie again and just focus on her).So what's bad about this movie....ummmmm. Give me a minute or two. Nothing. Not a thing. Its a masterpiece. Need more evidence?Focus on the little subtleties in the movie. I'm not talking the 'Rules and Clues'. I'm talking human eccentricities. Those things that breathe life into a character. I don't care about the horror. My favourite bits:The 'step backwards' scene. The camera from Cole's POV zooming out. The fact Cole wears his father's glasses with the lenses taken out. His father's watch he found in the drawer. The fact he pays the kid to pretend to be his friend for his mothers benefit. The line 'They don't have meetings about rainbows.' The 'shopping trolley fun ' scene.Obviously I still like the obvious scenes (the twist revelation, the 'revealing to his mother the truth, Watching it again and missing the clues) buts it's the human characteristics I like.There's so much more than just a twist movie here and it pains me to think that people that think otherwise should have a voice on here. Then again everyones entitled to there opinion. Even if it's the wrong one...which I guess is subjective anyway.Anyway, I'm rambling. Go watch it now...I don't care if you've seen it. Watch it again....and again...and again.This is how to make movies.Welcome any feedback/criticism. The e-mails there.",The Sixth Sense

1451,x-atahualpa,One of the most overestimated films in recent years,6,25 June 2004,"Mystery novels are probably the most abundant. Not to say they're not enjoyable or that many of them, or their authors, aren't remarkable. But the immense majority of them could possibly not exist and few would notice. In cinema, probably the situation is not identical: there aren't as many mystery films (although there are a LOT) as there are mystery novels. But the impact of a medium-size story in cinema or in literature is the same: it can be a pleasant reading (or a pleasant flick, in this case), but you can forget about it few days later. The thing is that people aren't that accustomed to read. The basis of the success of ""The 6th sense"" is the fact that people today isn't familiar with all the mystery stories of the XIX century and before. Otherwise, there wouldn't have been so much fuss about it. This is a movie that is well told, yes. It's story, at a certain level, is effective. But there is nothing else to it. Except for the overwhelming performance of H.J.Osment (that should have made Bruce Willis ashamed of his).",The Sixth Sense
1452,Movielover129,M. Night Shyamalan at his best,10,13 June 2013,"I went into this movie knowing the twist ending and thought it was going to be not as good as I has hoped of, but I was very surprised. This is about Dr. Malcolm Crowe (Bruce Willis),a child psychologist, who meets a strange, frightened, confused boy named Cole Sear (Haley Joel Osment). Dr. Crowe is trying to help the boy with his problem, Cole does not think he can help him though. What Dr. Malcom does not know about Cole's ""talent"" or when Cole tells him, he does not believe Cole about this sixth sense. This is one of my favorite movies of all time because of the dense and quiet atmosphere. This is to date the scariest film I have ever seen because it is very unexpected in what it does. I would recommend this film to anyone who likes a good scare or likes a good ghost movie.",The Sixth Sense

1454,oscarburton,enjoyably terrifying and amazing storyline,8,3 January 2013,"""A boy with a haunting secret seeks help from a child phycologist"" ""I see dead people"".I don't usually enjoy all these paranormal ghosty stuff but this is one of my all time favourite films. When I first saw this film, it was halloween which added to the suspense of an already very suspense filled film and I have to say I was expecting a clichéd teen thriller with blunt acting and a meaningless storyline- I couldn't have been more wrong!The director's camera shots, lighting and music were perfectly placed to make this an enjoyably terrifying 107mins.i think what really made me want to review the sixth sense was the broad range of genres that were skillfully included;thriller, horror, paranormal, romance,drama, comedy which generally incresed the all round impact of it.Chilling, haunting,eerie,well written and with an amazing storyline that has you thoroughly gripped all the way through.The only criticism would be that i would have liked to actually see more of the ghosts. Of course i must mention the brilliant acting skills of Bruce Willis in his prime, Haley Joel Osment and Tony Collette whose acting helped keep this film fresh and engaging in a sinister way. M.night Shyamalan, in my opinion is a genius and a true master of screenplay and I feel I couldn't write a review on this film without mentioning what i think is one of the most immpressive, shocking twists in cinematic history perfectly timed to shock you just enough for this to be an all round brilliant film. Like a lot of reviewers i tried to find a storyline error or a plot hole(without success)although it will blow you away, unlike a lot of other films, the twist does not make you feel cheated, just impressed and stunned.I would definitely recommend it to people who are in to thriller, drama and mysteries as i doubt that there will be a thriller or any movie as skillfully written as this for years to come.",The Sixth Sense

1456,imbroglio9,This is the Only One....,7,23 July 2013,"Of all the M. Night Shamalyan films that have been made (out of which I've seen five or six) this film (The Sixth Sense) is the only one I liked. Probably because it is the only one with a reasonably consistent plot that has a nice logical (but quirky) ending. All the others are full of loose ends that never come together, are illogical or have endings that are not explained or so contrived that I can only call them 'cop outs'. An example is 'Signs' which ends with a very small alien invasion by creatures intelligent enough to travel from the stars but who cannot figure out how to break into a rickety old barn who get so frustrated that they simply disappear. I suppose they get back into their starship and go home. As to who these alien gents are, where they came from or what they want is never explained and is really unrelated to anything else in the film. Shamalyan's work is very sloppy. What should be clever plot twists or fascinating endings turn out to be foolish tries, very falsely contrived or just too impossible to suspend disbelief. He must think we are all idiots. Guess who I think is the real idiot?",The Sixth Sense
1457,nicolaasvanos,Unbelievable plot,2,19 April 2014,"I'm actually not agreeing so much with the complaint that the pace of this movie is too slow. I think a slower pace can contribute to a good movie. And the acting is different enough to keep you intrigued.However the plot is so bad that I was really disappointed in the end. Half way through the movie I figured that Malcolm was dead himself, but decided again that it wasn't so. Too many events were contradicting this conclusion. So when in the end Malcolm turned out to be really dead I felt tricked. So I watched the movie back and concluded that this plot was really unrealistic and badly written.I didn't get the fuss around this movie in the 90's and still don't get it. This movie should get a very low rating, because the storyline is just terrible.",The Sixth Sense

It has one of the biggest plot twists in cinema and leaves you until the very end wanting more. The acting is phenomenal. Haley Joel Osment makes a great protagonist as Cole Sear, a young boy who has the ability to see dead people. Bruce Willis also does a remarkable job. Making his character seem believable. He plays as Malcolm Crowe, a child psychologist who intends to help Cole, after a failure with his former client Vincent Grey. Even though you might've not seen the film but know the ending, I still suggest you watch it. The ending of this film isn't the only highlight of it. If you watch and listen closely, you will understand and see more depth to this film than just the ending. That characters all help each other in a way, they all make choices that develop them by the end of the film. This movie should get a higher rating on here. It deserves more rates.",The Sixth Sense

I won't spoil what it's about but I will say I've never seen anything like it. The chemistry between Haley Joel Osment and Bruce Willis is incredible! They need to be in another movie together. The fact that such a young kid can be such a powerful actor is amazing. You should never doubt the youth because you never know what they can do.

1465,b_vinod_iitm,The film is greater than its climax.,9,25 December 2005,"The Sixth Sense is one of the celebrated movies of all time more because of its mind-blowing climax. To me however, the movie stands for much more than just its ending. In particular, the two relationships in the movie, that between Cole and his mother, Lynn, and between Malcolm and Anna were handled with great delicacy.Toni Collette has delivered a flawless performance as Cole's exasperated mom who tries in vain to understand her son's psychological nightmares. The scenes between mother and son are few in number but have been constructed with great care and meticulousness and go a long way in describing their relationship.In the case of Malcolm and Anna, the former's confessions to Cole about his marital problems and Anna's vacant stares into space also describe their strained marriage effectively.The scenes where Cole confesses his biggest secret to his mother and Malcolm talks to Anna in her sleep are, in my opinion, Shyamalan at his very best. With minimal but very effective dialogues, he shows why he is the master of underplay and subtlety.The Sixth Sense truly is M. Shyamalan Night's masterpiece.",The Sixth Sense

Love for another person that go on living over Death (at the beginning Malcolm doesn't resign himself for being death)and the ability in feeling over our normal senses is the message i got.

It was also about family; his relationship with his mother, and about single parenting.  I thought Haley and Bruce Willis acted well together (they clicked well).  I think Bruce's character was kind of laid back. But maybe that was on purpose; Bruce allowed the very talented Haley Joel Osment to take center stage. I've seen Haley in other projects and he always seems to stand out. I think Haley was the star of this movie. The actress who played his mother was also great as the divorced mom.  I really loved that scene in the car between mother and son.  Brought tears to my eyes.

1484,dvder,"Damn, I loved this movie!",9,22 August 1999,"Combining elements of drama, thriller, and horror, this film could easily have been a muddled disaster.  Indeed, the trailer didn't give a good impression of which type of movie to expect.  Happily, the blend works beautifully, mostly thanks to the unbelievably mature performance of 11-year-old Osment and an amazing ending that will make you want to watch the movie all over again.The film opens with a harrowing scene that sets the tone for some of the more disturbing images to come.  Successful child psychiatrist Dr. Malcolm Crowe (Willis) and his wife (Williams) are celebrating at home after he wins an award, when they are accosted by Vincent Grey (an emaciated and very frightening Wahlberg), a former patient who blames Crowe for failing to help him.  The deranged Vincent first shoots Crowe in the stomach, then kills himself.  Fast forward to Crowe meeting Cole Sear (Osment, best known as the son of Forrest Gump and last seen in Bogus), a young boy who suffers from the same type of ""mood disorder"" that Vincent did.  Gaining the tormented child's confidence, Crowe eventually discovers that Cole thinks he is being visited by ""dead people.""  Crowe's initial skepticism gives way after he hears something strange on an old tape recording of a session with Vincent. Together, he and Cole try to discover a reason for the visitations so that Cole won't have to live in fear any more.  Meanwhile, his obsession with the boy threatens to derail his marriage as his wife becomes increasingly distant.The Sixth Sense works because it plays out like a really good short story. The more dramatic moments are emotionally engaging, and humor is used to complement them.  The brief scenes involving ghosts are quite creepy (thanks to their generally shocking nature and some fine makeup by Stan Winston). The characters of Cole and Crowe are well-developed, and convincingly portrayed.  Willis, coming off the disappointing Mercury Rising, gives the man-helps-wunderkind premise another go, and this time he comes out a winner with an unexpectedly warm performance.  Williams is used sparingly, but serves the story well.  Collette is also effective as Cole's beleaguered mother.  Best of all, though, is Osment.  He gives Cole both the haunted maturity and wide-eyed terror needed to play a boy who is routinely subjected to horrific encounters with wronged ghosts.  Given his tender age, he is almost impossibly good, certainly good enough to merit Oscar consideration.  He and Willis work well together; there is a quirky chemistry between them that makes for some funny moments in the film.Director M. Night Shyamalan (whose Dickensian name somehow fits this movie perfectly) once again explores the reactions of young children to traumatic events-- basically the same territory he covered in 1998's Wide Awake (which featured a similarly adult performance by young Joseph Cross).  At only 28, Shyamalan has already developed a strong style as both a writer and director.  Even in the slower moments, The Sixth Sense has enough intensity to keep things interesting, and it is capped off by a twist ending that is wickedly clever without seeming contrived.",The Sixth Sense

It was very unsettling indeed.The acting job by Bruce Willis was probably the best of his career. He is so believable and he's not even hanging from an elevator shaft or racing in a cab through Central Park.  He's just acting, and he's great in this film. As for Osment, well he deserves the Oscar.  If he doesn't get it, then the academy is even more blind than I thought.  (I.E. Shakespeare in Love beating Private Ryan-get bent!)  Quite simply these actors make the characters frighteningly believable.And that's just for starters.  For the first time in years this was a movie with an actual story.  I know, unreal idea in today's big Hollywood, with their awful big money concepts.  It just proves, give the public a story rather than Godzilla, and they'll go see it.  There's no reliance on special effects made on some turbo-geek's CGI machine to drive the film. Shyamalan has written an amazing script with twists and turns that will leave you with goosebumps for the full two hours.  He also did an incredible job directing the film, with filters, and angles that will make you quite nervous, as if you're with the boy and Willis throughout the terrifying twists.As for the ending, go see the movie and you will be blown away. It's right up there with The Usual Suspects as far as surprises go.  And bring a warm jacket to the theater because you will have the chills as each plot twist hits you.Simply put this is by far the best movie I've seen all year. It'll make you ponder the paranormal, even if you don't want to.",The Sixth Sense
1486,llis,"See it! - even if you don't like ""horror"" movies...",10,28 August 1999,"The Sixth Sense is one of the best movies I've ever seen, both technically and entertainment-wise.At least on first viewing, I did not see any holes in the plot or story-line - something that's very important to me in a good movie.  For the story to work, you must believe that it is possible for someone to see ghosts.  M. Night Shamalan wrote and directed this film in such a way that you can't walk away from the theatre saying ""I might have believed this story, except that the kid or the doctor did such and such, or didn't do so and so, or did you notice how the ghosts did this or that...""  Going back over the things the characters did and said, you find that everything matches up with the surprise ending perfectly - no holes.Haley's acting is incredible, Bruce Willis' is acceptable and improves as the movie continues.  M. Night Shamalan did an outstanding job creating a different kind of a ghost story - just enough 'blood and guts' to call it a horror story, but more thought-provoking than anything else.  Oh, by the way, bring a handkerchief or some tissues!",The Sixth Sense
1487,Rare,Best movie I've seen all year,10,7 August 1999,"Most horror/thriller movies see how far they can go to scare the hell out of a person. They'll usually start with a grisly murder, or something that foreshadows the many grisly murders that will occur during the movie. Though this formula can sometimes be effective, it gets old and sour faster than you can scream bloody murder.The Sixth Sense, however, defies all the conventional horror rules. Instead of putting together a series of unlikely events that ends up as a bloodbath at the end, it slowly draws the audience into its web of mystery and thrills. Though it does start with an event that foreshadows events in the movie, it does it in a way that nobody will expect. In a tense yet nuanced style, it keeps you enthralled in the plotline while finally blowing you away at the end.The performances are Oscar-caliber, at least by 11 year old actor Haley Joel Osment. Though Bruce Willis's performance isn't bad (and a very refreshing change from his usual action fare), its this kid that carries the movie, and drives the emotion home. Highly recommended.",The Sixth Sense
1488,josh-65,please,4,30 August 1999,"i heard so many great things about this movie. are they kidding? i didn't find it scary at all. the overuse of music to set the eerie mood completely gave away any frightening surprises. the kid was endearing at first, but kept the same expression throughout the film. his dialogue wasn't very believable - what kid tells his mom, ""i'm ready to communicate with you now?"" beyond that, the whole film was built around the surprise ending, which was pretty good; but thinking back on the story, there were too many coincidences which neatly fit together to bring about the ending.  of course, i didn't even have to think back, because the pertinent scenes were all replayed in the montage. what i thought might be a refreshing film turned out to be another piece of hollywood drivel.",The Sixth Sense
1489,Swan82,One of those truly rare films that stay with you for a long time,10,13 August 1999,"I hardly ever see a films like this that makes me feel so many emotions all at once.  I was scared, but on a totally higher, almost spiritual level. The Sixth Sense is extremely well-rounded and brilliantly thought out. The acting was phenomenal (especially Osment's performance... Oscar worthy and nothing less).  The power of the story was unique it's ability to make perfect sense of the otherwise unexplainable.  I left the theater in a state of bewilderment and awe.  I was reminded of how intense and inspiring cinema can be.",The Sixth Sense
1490,RichA33,"It is not late 90's Hollywood, but a genuinely well-constructed suspense drama.",9,6 September 1999,"Here it is, a wonderfully-crafted, low-budget (except for Bruce Willis), low-tech thriller.  Suspense builds throughout the film while we watch two extremely likable characters struggle with their own personal demons.  There are no car chases or explosions, and even the ghosts are reasonably tame. There are, however, Bruce Willis and Haley Joel Osment who play their roles with precision, leading us to the surprise ending -- which need not be a surprise to make this picture work, but adds to the enjoyment of this wonderful story.",The Sixth Sense

Wonderful performances from all the leading actors - especially Haley Joel Osment as Cole Sear (the kid). The plot twists very unexpectedly, and managed to avoid falling into the obvious cliches.

Hope everyone take time to go see the movie.",The Sixth Sense
1493,state,The Best,10,5 September 1999,I think this may be the best movie I have ever seen.  The child acting is better than anything I have seen before. The ending took me total by surprise and as many movie goers..you will find yourself wanting to see it again.  This is what movies are all about and don't let your friend miss this one.,The Sixth Sense
1494,MarkusC,You'll want to see it again,9,9 August 1999,"This movie was so enjoyable that you'll probably want to see it twice. There's been a lot of talk about the startling ending, but I'd love to hear how the director planned out the interaction between the characters so well that you have to get to the end of this film to ""See"" what you were missing. This sounds vague I know, but that's why at the end you'll think ""I have to see this again, now I understand!"" The Sixth Sense is a movie lovers film. It's slightly slow to start even though all scenes are needed to make the story just right, with a great build up and ending.",The Sixth Sense
1495,theguru,Senseless,6,7 August 1999,"I was terribly disappointed. While the end had a nice twist, the movie moved slowly. It seemed that over 90 percent of Willis' lines were whispered, and I couldn't wait for him to speak in a normal voice. The kid was great, though. Save your money.",The Sixth Sense
1496,gk-8,One of the better thrillers in quite a while.,10,9 August 1999,"I've seen the Haunting, Blair Witch, and Sixth Sense.  Sixth Sense and Blair Witch were equally 'good', although very different movies (Haunting doesn't even rate, in my book).  I'd give the edge to Sixth Sense.  When the final twist occurs, it's a real eye-opener, because the story has carried you along so well.  I wouldn't really call Sixth Sense a horror movie, although it does have some good scares, but it's a lot more subtle.  The acting by all the characters is great.  Yeah, you can find some plot holes, but if you do that during the movie, you're wasting your time.  Enjoy the film.",The Sixth Sense
1497,ChefCork,The twist(s) are the CLINCHER!,10,21 August 1999,"This movie surprised me.  I was not anxious to see it due to the subject matter and genre.  But, friends persuaded me to go and I'm glad I did.  The scenes with the dead were not pleasant but the last half of the movie made up for it. I was not expecting to cry and I was not expecting the big plot twist at the end.  And everyone that has seen this movie has had the same response I had.  You playback the scenes to put the puzzle pieces in place.NO ONE should divulge the secrets at the end of this movie.  Everyone should have the opportunity to experience it without the benefit of a clue. Recently, a girl at work revealed the ending of ""Blair Witch Project"" - now I have no desire to see it.  Why should I?  I know what happens now!  One of the sad facts about movies today is that they are so predictable, you could have written it yourself and gotten the million dollar paycheck! The director/writer of this movie deserves both of his paychecks!  He broke the mold! GO SEE THE SIXTH SENSE!",The Sixth Sense
1498,Anakin22,Stay away from this movie at all cost!,1,27 August 1999,"I swear, this movie is the most god-awful creation I have seen since I had to review ""Holy Man"" for my school paper. Osment did a good job though as a small kid having to deal with seeing dead people. When it comes to Bruce Willis, any role that doesn't include a gun, grenade, or explosion is beyond him. I warn you, do not contribute money to this film in any way, shape, or form, as it only encourages more new filmmakers to produce this kind of drivel. If you still feel the need to see this, drive over to your friend's, and do not chip in for the pay-per-view. After you sit through it, I have no doubt you'll even want him to reimburse you for the gas you burned on the way to and from his house.",The Sixth Sense

There was no realness to the movie it goes off in one direction then another.  None the less it is so inconsistent that the whole idea wouldnt work.  The movie tried to do too much and all it did was spoil a good idea.  Anyone who tells you this was more than a middle of the road movie ignore.  I am disgusted that such a movie could be even ranked in the top 250 ever none the less #23.  Every one who gave this movie higher than a 5 should be ashamed.Thank you",The Sixth Sense

1502,Rebecca4-2,Effectively scary but overrated film.,6,15 September 1999,"While I admit that the suspense scenes had me covering my eyes, I was disappointed with this movie as a whole. The script was corny and overwrought and other than Haley Joel Osment and Toni Collette (the actors portraying the little boy and his mother) I felt the acting was stilted and uncompelling. This movie has uneven, and, at times, frustratingly slow pacing. Some of the plot points are ridiculously pat (and obvious) and I didn't find the ending to be terribly surprising (or satisfying). There are other films with similar last-minute twists that are much more effective... see Jacob's Ladder, The Seventh Sign, and the one that I think inspired them all, ""An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge,"" based on the Ambrose Bierce story. I can only guess that the popularity of this movie is due to the performance of Osment, who is really excellent--he is the highlight of this overrated film.",The Sixth Sense

If The 6th Sense doesn't go down in history as one of the best in the horror/thriller genre, it would only be because it is so difficult to find the proper genre in which to pigeonhole this movie.  It hasn't been since Rushmore that I've sat through a movie (in a mainstream theater) and thought to myself as the film was running, ""this is a very good movie..."".  The acting in this film is great.  The kid is phenomenal.  The images are suitably eerie at times and the soundtrack is as well.  Sure the ending is good, but the film as when viewed as a whole is one of the best of the year...and you can trust my opinion...",The Sixth Sense

1505,CineMmon,Write with your gut - Direct with your heart,9,31 August 1999,"The Sixth Sense is about passion and restlessness, about the unseen world. From the outset the story tears at the inside of your mind and seeks a comfortable place to hide, a warm understanding place to call home. This movie slowly creates its premise from the veil that shrouds the spirit world and pulls you into a place that is both familiar and uneasy. This is the small noise in the night not the loud shrieking of banshees. With out a doubt  M. Night Shyamalan has written and directed a brilliant look at the spirit world, his command of character and plot and the compelling use of camera and editing reminds one of Hitchcock or a more mature contemporary director like Altman in the Gingerbread Man. Though much of the focus has rightly been on the child actor Haley Joel Osment and tough guy Bruce Willis' re-birth as a charming and complex vehicle, the cohesion and mounting tension of the film owe much to the well thought out work of Shyamalan. Starting with the development of a wonderful chemistry between the actors and their slow developed interaction with each other the writer-director M. Night Shyamalan weaves a work that somehow keeps you both pressed back into and at the same time on the edge of your seat. He is the face that we see in the firelight for he tells stories in much the same way that other master storytellers do  slowly building up each piece of his fantasy world. It clearly is Shyamalan that continually surprises us with small feints and intricate maneuvers, for me it was his work that was a pleasure to watch. On the other hand  the inspired Osment / Willis pairing is also a treat - reasoned, well paced and seasoned with the just the right about of well spoken lines and haunting  haunted looks. The other cast members major and minor also help to round out a believable story. This was a true example of movie as a team sport!Shyamalan is a talent that knows what buttons to push, this is not someone who feels he has to shock us every minute to scare us or preach to us every minute to open us up to new ways of thinking. He slowly reveals to us our uneasiness with things in the natural world - like houses that creak in the night. What a complete story, what a deep imagination. This is a story of restless passion that takes hold of you and won't let you go.  Even after you return home something will gnaw at you. We'll leave the light on for you - Ya hear!See this film in a theater with an ample screen and good sound system.",The Sixth Sense

This film almost caused me to make that mistake. This is a smart, dark, haunting, clever and moving film about what scares us and what we do to confront our fears.

Night Shyamalan deserves most of the credit for writing such a beautiful story.  As for Bruce Willis, this is probably his best performance ever in a dramatic role.  He plays a child-therapist in the film.  But the real asset of the film is the eleven year old Haley Osment, who, in the story, has the gift of seeing dead people.  His performance is probably the best child-actor performance I have seen in a decade.  Not even in one instance, did I sense any sort of over acting from him.  He truly deserves an Oscar nomination.  That's probably the least that academy could do for his performance in this film.  Although it's the superb ending of the movie that one leaves the theater remembering most, the whole movie was so carefully done that I enjoyed the entire movie as much as the end.  Kudos to Shyamalan for making such a great film.",The Sixth Sense

The interaction between him and Willis is so believable.  I was mesmerized by the depth of the kid's portrayal of fright, paranoia - everything!

The best thing going for this movie, however, is the theme.  If you're into ghost stories and weirdo/psycho kids, then here's an entertaining couple of hours for you.

An example of Hollywood's ability to take an interestingly dark plot and water it down with a touchy-feely child-pathos vehicle. One can really smell Disney's stinking hand behind this. Once young Cole realizes that he is merely a helper-monkey to the ghosts, he returns to his role in society, becoming popular, and beating out a child actor and schoolmate for the lead in a play. Clumsy and heavy-handed.The film also contains a surprise ending that may be surprising to some, but seems extremely tacked-on and poorly handled. You can almost see the pitch for this one, ""its like 'Ghost' meets 'Little Man Tate,' with just a little bit of 'Seven's' atmospherics thrown in for color.  Sadly, the film's melange does not live up to even one of its parent films (with the exception of maybe the worst moments of 'Ghost').This film is a testament to the dullness of the American thriller at the moment. The ghosts in the film are about as terrifying as the homeless people you'd see on a trip to New York, the tone of the film is unjustly gloomy, and the plot is so formulaic that, in instances, you can see its chemical symbols peeking through. See this only if you like cheap sentiment, mild fear, and a heartwarming, stomach-turningly sweet ending.

The actor who played the young boy Cole, was brilliant. He was like no other child actor I've ever seen. I felt I was experiencing the horrors with him.

This movie doesn't have all the hype, but is bound to be the #1 movie of the year.  I went to it with high expectations and was blown away at the suspense and twists and turns in the plot.  This is the best movie of the summer.",The Sixth Sense
1531,Elsie-5,More varied emotions than the norm,8,8 August 1999,"Not your usual horror film.  I can't remember ever seeing another horror/suspense film that actually brought tears to my eyes.  Tears of sorrow and empathy, not fear.  This is not to say that I was not afraid, just that there were other, more surprising emotions as well.  There were a couple of places that could've used a little more development and the film did lag once or twice.  A nice twist, which I did not anticipate, saved the film for me, and has me thinking still.  I will probably see it again. Liked it better than the newly released The Haunting.",The Sixth Sense
1532,jjlandry,Mystery and horror for the mind,10,8 August 1999,"This movie is probably the best non-action summer movie this year. Featuring a very subdued Bruce Willis as a child psychologist who finds himself in the worst situation possible, a vengeful patient who returns.
On the night he is honored for his skills, one of his patients comes visiting, asking why he did not help him. Donnie Wahlberg does masterful work, portraying a tortured soul. As instantly as he arrives, he exacts his revenge and ends his torture with a gun. We forward to fall, when Willis is helping a small child adapt to a single parent home and very peculiar behavior. This movie is a combination of Heaven Can Wait, Ghost, Beetlegeuse, and Jacob's Ladder. The difference is that The Sixth Sense is directed, edited, and acted much better. It has some scenes that are downright chilling and and ending that you never see coming. Unless you see it again and look for clues, you never see it coming. There is one scene that I actually found downright stunning. Most of that is due to Haley Joel Osment, who plays the young boy who should wake up when the nominations for the Oscars are announced.
This movie is a must-see. Forget about other ""horror"" movies out this season. The Sixth Sense should be your first choice.",The Sixth Sense
1533,SLIM-45,Hurry,10,9 August 1999,Run and see this movie before someone gives away the ending. The story was excellent. Haley Joel Osment gave a great performance for someone who is so young. Bruce Willis was far better than any action hero he has played in the past.,The Sixth Sense
1534,filmfan-33,A must-see thriller! Don't let anyone tell you about it before you see it.,10,8 August 1999,"The Sixth Sense is a brilliant film that gives you chills and thrills, but also leaves you with much to think about. This is quite a departure from other Bruce Willis films: no guns, nothing blows up. It's nice to see that he can perform well without the pyrotechnics. But I think young Hayley Joel steals the film with his amazing performance. Wish he had been in Star Wars: though a kid, the term ""child actor"" seems misplaced, as his acting is on par with his adult counterparts. Go see this film!",The Sixth Sense
1535,dwg82,A Masterpiece,10,8 August 1999,"I thought this movie was a masterpiece. The wonderful plot, along with some great acting from Willis and Osment, made this movie a sheer classic. I must say however, that I was totally blindsided by the ending. It (The Sixth Sense) contained the best ending to a movie that I have ever seen.",The Sixth Sense
1536,kyun,Better then Blair Witch,10,9 August 1999,Blair is no way a scary movie of all time when there is a movie like Sixth Sense. I believe Blair had great hype generated by great marketing and thats all. Sixth Sense though uses great visuals to scare the pants out of its audience with great timing of each scenes. Its a rare Hitchcock like movie that uses the whole movie to build up suspense until jaw droping twist at the end.,The Sixth Sense
1537,doodles-6,A very positive review,10,9 August 1999,"I saw this film last night, and I'm not going to say much about it other than:  see it TODAY.  Don't wait for video, don't wait for the crowds to thin out...the cat will not remain in the bag for long, and once Joe Blow starts talking about it at the watercooler, it'll ruin the film for you. I have not seen a film of this...utter coolness in quite a while;  Bruce Willis and his young co-star were excellent,  to the point where I don't know what to say.  You will jump in fright, you'll get all misty eyed, you will leave the theater unsettled, freaked out, and satisfied.",The Sixth Sense
1538,sammie-2,Absolutely Fantastic,10,9 August 1999,"I thought this movie was excellent, well worth seeing. Haley is fantastic and Bruce Willis does a terrific job.  The twist it takes in the end catches one by surprise for sure.  Don't miss this one. Great story, great acting, can't go wrong.",The Sixth Sense
1539,CrashCob,A Great Movie,10,9 August 1999,"This movie was extremely well made.  Suspense hides around every corner, and the surprise ending makes the whole movie worthwhile.  Bruce Willis and Harley Osment really connected on screen and this made the movie even better.  I give it two thumbs way up.",The Sixth Sense
1540,Daisym,Excellent Film,10,9 August 1999,"This movie live up to expectations and more.  It started out kind of slow but it picked up its pace quickly.  The plot was very interesting and it kept me wanting to know more about each character.  Bruce Willis is an excellent and versatile actor.  He is very talented and he proves it in this film. Haley Joel Osment also contributed his talent as a young actor.  He was very convincing and he brought emotion to the entire film.  All the elements that are brought forth in this excellent film is an example of the kind of work that other films should try to convey in their projects.  I am sure this film will not disappoint anyone with its wit, intelligence, and suspense.  Even though Donnie Walhberg did not have much screen time he did an extraordinary job with his character.  I hope to see him in future films. Overall, this film is one of the best I have seen in a long time.  I suggest everyone go out and see it.",The Sixth Sense
1541,PAG-6,"Amazing, Haunting, and Powerful! It will be remembered for years",10,10 August 1999,"This is the best film I've seen this year!  A masterful work by M. Night Shyamalan.  Bruce Willis delivers one of his best performances, and Haley Joel Osment is absolutely incredible!  This is a powerful film that must be remembered at Oscar time for Best Picture (yeah, it's that good), Director and Writer (Shyamalan), Editing, Actor (Willis--yes, Bruce Willis), Actress or Supporting Actress (Toni Collette), and Best Supporting Actor (Osment). I'm not kidding, this is an outstanding film!  Bravo!",The Sixth Sense
1542,powerdance,"great acting, great thrills, and a great ending",9,11 August 1999,"This was one terrific movie. It was especially great because I was truly expecting this movie to be even worse than the Haunting.  The trailers for this film were so cheesy( ""i can the dead"") and another Bruce Willis film. Whatever. But the movie is completely different than the trailer.  It was not filled with computer effects but rather good acting and direction.  Willis and that kid realy work terrific together. That kid is a real actor.The best part of the movie is the terrific ending. This is a movie you should see twice because it will even seem so much better. Go see this movie!",The Sixth Sense
1543,filmbuff-46,Ending is great,7,13 August 1999,"As I was watching this movie in the theatre I thought it was a drama gone bad, until the last 10 minutes of the movie.  I loved the ending it was very unique and to me surprising.  I think it made the movie worth seeing.",The Sixth Sense
1544,KReese-2,Superb movie!,10,16 August 1999,"Don't make the mistake of thinking this is a typical Bruce Willis flick or yet another cheesy horror movie. I'm not a fan of either, but absolutely loved this movie. Is this movie perfect? Definitely not. But it is one of the best movies of the year, and perhaps one of the best all-time for its genre.I think the distributors actually mis-marketed this movie as strictly a horror movie. In reality, it is much more of a drama or human interest story. The plot, character development, and acting are what really make this movie, not the occasional scare. In fact the acting is likely (I hope) to produce at least a couple Oscar nominations. I hope the Academy members have the guts to nominate Haley Joel Osment, he absolutely deserves it.The best part of this movie is the drive home afterwards. You'll replay every scene in your head realizing how everything makes sense. So, go see this movie immediately!! But don't go in looking for a hard-core horror movie, instead look for the most emotionally gripping movie of the year.Highly, highly recommended.",The Sixth Sense
1545,Doodle-7,"Excellent ghost story, all that's missing is a campfire - Slight Spoiler",9,13 August 1999,"I have to admit, I went to see this movie not expecting too much.  Bruce Willis in a dramatic, non-action role was hard for me to accept, since I would have to watch him try and ""act"".  I am here to say I was totally wrong about any misgivings I had about The Sixth Sense.  It was a compelling and chilling story, with an eerie surprise ending.  Bruce and the kid have excellent chemistry together, and the supporting roles are strong as well, especially Cole's mom.  Now, as good as the ending is (I won't say anything about that), my vote for the best scene in the movie HAS to be the funeral/videotape sequence.  I'll keep the details to myself, but I'll tell you, my jaw was on the floor through that whole 15-20 minutes or so.  I also liked the fact that the director and his excellent cast (give that kid an Oscar!) were able to freak me out without resorting to silly computerized ghost effects (ala The Haunting), or gory, slasher scenes (Scream, etc.). Highly recommended for scary movie fans!",The Sixth Sense
1546,delsol80,A Stunning Film...,10,16 August 1999,"This movie was absolutely incredible; though I raved over ""The Blair Witch Project,"" ""The Sixth Sense"" had more heart, more emotion, more suspense, and more power than Blair Witch. I will undoubtedly see this movie several times, and recommend it to anybody. The conclusion was a such a shock it brought both gasps and tears to myself and the viewers around me. This film was a true masterpiece...",The Sixth Sense
1547,Bruce-116,Excellent Overall,8,16 August 1999,"One of the most enjoyable movies this year, with a most excellent ending. This is a movie best seen without reading any reviews, including this one. So don't read further if you haven't seen it.I found the pacing to be a bit slow in the first 45 minutes, but the wait is well worth it.  Excellent performances by all, with Willis surprisingly effective and the young boy (Haley Joel Osment)'s  being Oscar-caliber.  A thought provoking movie with a number of good scares.  While highly recommended, the movie does contain some (very few) false cheap scenes, including an early one involving a picture frame and a later one involving a videotape.For an opposite review, I would recommend the brutal (and pretty funny) review in the New York Times by Steven Holden, where he gives the movie the ""Touched by an Angel"" award for ""gaggingly mawkish supernatural kitsch"" and where he gives Willis the ""Robin Williams Award"" for ""ineffable, twinkling, half-smiling misty-eyed empathy with adorable tots.""Interesting factoid:  Toni Collette, who gives a great performance playing the young boy's mother in this film, was the overweight distraught Muriel in ""Muriel's Wedding.""  Quite an actress!",The Sixth Sense
1548,harrylun,This film is one of the thrillers of the Summer of '99 comparable to Arlington Road,10,16 August 1999,"I just saw this film this past weekend and I definitely enjoyed it.  I thought that with Bruce Willis, this film would be a flop, but his acting did not undermine the film, but made it stronger.  The child actor in this film was extraordinary.  George Lucas should have cast him in Star Wars instead of the child he used who could not act to save his life.  The ending of this film was on par with the ending of Arlington Road, in that, it was totally surprising and made the film very memorable.  Don't let anyone tell you the ending of this film or else you'll regret it.",The Sixth Sense
1549,natedog-4,Well done!,9,16 August 1999,"I normally avoid movies with child actors in ""leading"" roles, but was very pleasantly surprised by this film.  Bruce Willis, who I have previously only enjoyed in action roles, was also very good.The ""kid seeing & talking to dead people"" bit is not overdone, in spite of what the trailer might lead you to believe.  There are several unexpected scares (the best kind), and well done story elements which cannot even be touched upon here without spoiling them.Even if you generally don't appreciate child actors (or Bruce Willis, for that matter), don't let that stop you from seeing this very good movie.",The Sixth Sense
1550,movieman-179,This is a great movie,10,31 August 1999,"I thought the movie was well put together. It has a great story line and was well directed. This movie may never make the best seller list, but it is well worth two hours of your life. If you think it is just a scary ghost story, it is not.",The Sixth Sense
1551,GYP-3,It kept me on the edge of my seat.,10,18 August 1999,The movie was great. There were parts in the movie that made me scream and I cried I felt I was there. Not only me but the people around me were the same way. When the movie finish everyone started clapping. I will see it again. I totally recommend it to everyone.,The Sixth Sense
1552,DIZ-7,Wonderful,10,19 August 1999,"I didn't read a review on this movie until after I saw it. I was so disappointed in what the critic had to say. I thought this was a wonderful change for Bruce Willis, it showed he is a wonderful actor and able to portray any role he is in. The child was absolutely magnificent! He had me convinced he was seeing dead people! Hope to see this film at least nominated for some award. It really reminded my of an old Hitchcock film. My fiance and I were blown away by the ending, and this is a film I would definitely see a second time.",The Sixth Sense
1553,Lizkk,Best of the Summer,9,22 August 1999,"Except for a slow pace which at times was a bit maddening, the last 20 minutes or so made up for it.  It's a must-see movie.  Obviously, in fact, a twice-must-see.   Highly recommend. Even if you are not a Bruce Willis fan, its the kid you gotta see, and his interactions with Willis.  Willis comes across as his wise-guy, smart-a** type self, like usual, but.... In this movie, his  bored wish-I-was-somewhere-else personna works.  Hard to explain.  Well, you have to see it to understand it, and by the latest box office numbers, a lot of people are doing just that.",The Sixth Sense
1554,MRJ-6,"Who writes these reviews, the studio?",3,26 August 1999,"The story moved like molasses from the opening title screen on.  I was having trouble staying awake for most of it.  Little and no musical accompaniment didn't help.  There were about 3 'gotchas' when considering the length of the movie, there could have had at least 10.  I figured out the 'surprise' ending less then half way through the film.  The only bright point was the acting in the kid.  A couple of scenes were overacted just a tad, but this little guy is overall a fine actor.  The mother did a good job too in a working-class role.  I did love the shots of Philadelphia.  It was nice to see Bruce Willis without a gun in his hand.  I feel he did an adequate job in his role.  I think the only reason people are raving about it is because he has had so many macho roles that people had typecast him. I think most people liked it because they didn't foresee the ending.  For those of us that did, the movie wasn't nearly as fun.  My recommendation is if you have to see it, wait for it on video.",The Sixth Sense
1555,melatina,Old fashion Ghost Story,10,23 August 1999,"This was a old fashion Ghost Story.  The best movie I have seen in years! Smart, spooky, mysterious with a great ending.  This was a really good movie even for the kids.  My two girls, ages 10 and 5 loved it as did my older kids. Thumbs up from everyone I know.",The Sixth Sense
1556,LilJestr,A well-researched paranormal suspense thriller that will have you on the edge of your seat.,10,27 August 1999,"An incredible film - the most suspenseful and frightening that I've seen in years. It's not a scary movie that's frightening because it's gross and disgusting. It's a scary movie that's simply scary, without special effects or excessive gore, which, to me, is the greatest kind of thriller that we see too little of these days._The Sixth Sense_ is exquisitely acted, written, and directed, with a score that brings the film chillingly to life. Bruce Willis (Malcolm Crowe) and Haley Joel Osment (Cole Sear) have a chemistry and power together that is utterly believable. Their performances almost make you suspend reality and believe that the characters are real people.Another thing that struck me is the attention to detail and the research that went into the storyline. Being a paranormal buff, the movie didn't look too promising as far as realistic paranormal investigation goes. However, the attention to free association writing, electronic voice phenomena, cold spots, a spirit's violent actions, and the stress the ability to ""see dead people"" puts on someone, especially a young child, was amazing. If you're into ghosts and the paranormal, this is definitely a film for you, and will strike you as being more than just ""a scary movie.""Just a word of warning: Don't let your guard down. If you don't like sudden parts, this may not be a movie for you. Go with a friend or family member who's already seen it and can tell you if something is sudden is going to happen. I usually don't like movies with any sudden parts, but I think this film, without that suspense, would not nearly be as good.I don't think there was anything that I didn't like about the movie... it's most definitely worth the ticket price and should be seen on the big screen in order to get the full effect, like _The Haunting_. I guarantee the story will keep you on the edge of your seat, and the ending will shock you - Everyone says it, don't think it's hype. It really will. I also guarantee you'll fall in love with young Haley Joel Osment, and his performance as Cole Sear. This is a fantastic movie certainly worth seeing in the theatres.",The Sixth Sense
1557,Pisi,Major disappointment.,1,8 February 2002,"I find it really hard to believe that one could highly regard this film given its MAJOR inconsistencies. The idea around which the movie is built is original indeed; it takes, however, a lot more attention to detail to avoid turning it into a major disappointment--which is what actually happened in this particular case. Again, it doesn't take an extremely picky attitude and/or personality to spot the huge incoherencies that plague it from almost the very beginning. Just like in the case of ""The Others,"" illustrating the interference between the realms of the living and the dead turns out to be a very hard thing to do as long as one doesn't give up the requirement of a minimal compliance with elementary logic, and an elementary critical spirit.",The Sixth Sense
1558,kraetrae,Not what we expected. Excellent movie!!!,10,2 September 1999,"When we saw the trailer for this movie, we weren't very impressed, although we like Bruce Willis is many of the movies he has made.  We aren't usually into ghost story-horror movies, but decided to go because a friend suggested it.  We loved the show and were very impressed with the acting on the part of Haley Joel Osment and Bruce Willis.  We were shocked by the ending, exactly as the producers intended the audience to be.  The last 5 minutes of the movie were worth the price of admission!! It is the type of movie that you will talk about for awhile afterward, trying to figure out all the pieces of the puzzle.  It is a shame that more movies aren't of the high quality that this one was with a truly terrific ending that you only find rarely in movies these days.  We would recommend this movie to anyone who hasn't seen it!  We simply loved this show!!  We give it a 10, and would give it a 12 if we could!!",The Sixth Sense

Haley Joel Osment is terrific, and it's interesting that 1. the biggest box office success of an action star (Bruce Willis) is not an action pic and; 2. Bruce top two most successful films can be counted as one of the fastest editing in history (Armageddon) and one of the slowest (The Sixth Sense). You can't miss The Sixth Sense.",The Sixth Sense

Excellent camera work. The story is perfectly acted out. You could actually feel the characters pains and fears. I loved it not only for the above, but because, finally, the ending went against the old fashioned 'and they lived happily ever after'.

The Blair Witch Project was good but the early hype and too much information about the movie ahead of time kept it from being great for me. The Sixth Sense is a great movie! This is the way I like my horror movies. It is more scary than gory and the story is touching without going overboard. I like it when my skin crawls about what might be there as well as what is.,The Sixth Sense
1567,Jeff25,What a great movie,10,18 September 1999,I thought that 'The Sixth Sense' was easily the best film of the year and should definitely be an oscar contender in the spring.  I think the way the movie plays on all of our assumptions is its genious.  The news perspective it gives of life and death is intriuging as well.,The Sixth Sense

But 6 weeks at #1 and all the buzz finally made me cave in.  I'm glad I did.The biggest complaint I hear about this movie is that it starts too slow.  I think the slow build up is necessary for the story, and thought every scene was necessary for the full effect.  It's interesting to point out that there were pretty much NO special effects, just great camera work, good use of music (both the presence and absence of it), and great acting.  Although I think an Oscar might be a little too much, Haley Joel Osment did a great job and really made me feel for him.  Willis was actually pretty good, too, I must admit.Of course, none of this would have mattered without a story, and this movie had it.  The ending was a true surprise, and, just like they want, I'll be shelling out another $6.50 to see it again.",The Sixth Sense

1572,zaglam,great movie!,10,26 September 1999,Did make the mistake of thinking that a film that casts Bruce Willis can only be marginally good. This movie is the best one that I saw for a very very long time. It is not for people who like special effects or fast action. On the other hand if you like leaving the theater actually thinking about a movie and wanting to see it again as soon as possible you will not be disappointed. I guess one needs to create a separate genre for this movie cause saying that it is a horror flick does not do justice.,The Sixth Sense

I feel that this movie was well-made. The writer must have taken lots of time to write a movie of such high-caliber. Granted, there may be lag times, but overall, the plot keeps you thinking all through the movie. Every twist and turn has you wondering ""what will happen next?""In my opinion, this movie deserves some Oscars when the time comes.  The actors were great, the plot excellent, and the production and directing brilliant. I now know what they mean by a ""thinking man's movie"", because this one is definitely a thinking man's movie.Food for thought:  How many of us are like Dr. Crowe, but don't know it, or want to admit it?

I REALLY don't see how anyone could not have guessed the ending, it was painfully obvious.  The man never changed his clothes, interacted with anyone.  I also don't understand how Malcolm didn't realize that something was up with him.  ""Hmmmm...I don't talk to anyone and no one talks to me...wonder why?"" All of the ""red"" clues were obvious as well, but not exactly brilliant.I also don't think this movie had much of a plot.  It just kind of moved along, at a rather boring rate.  I understand that Cole was there to help the dead people, but if that was the whole outcome...why didn't we see him helping more ghosts? Just that one girl.  They could have done a lot more. I was also waiting for more to come of Cole's dad, especially the way Malcolm emphasized it so much in the beginning.In summary, a thriller which didn't create suspense with a boring and obvious outcome. I think Haley's a good actor and did a great job, but other than that, this movie gives nothing.",The Sixth Sense
1579,iferoz,More about love than horror,10,23 October 1999,"Is this a Horror Film ? While it has elements of horror, is  very suspenseful and contains it's fair share of shocks, I found this movie to be so much more. I was very moved by this film. To me it was more about acceptance of who we are, of other people, and of things we cannot change. That by doing so and maintaining our self esteem and learning to love ourselves  we can triumph.Scary? Yes. But also a film about love. The best film I have seen this year.",The Sixth Sense
1580,xason,Two-hour Outer Limits with better acting,9,14 November 1999,"The Sixth Sense is not quite a horror movie.  You might call it drama, but of that I'm not even sure.  But whatever genre, the movie transcends it.I do not wish to spend my time summing up the movie's plot.  It is quite simple enough, and if you haven't seen it, you've probably heard something about it, or else you wouldn't be here.What really struck me about the movie was it's interweaving details.  If you've only seen it once, see it again.  Then you might notice the fact that Malcolm always has problems opening the cellar door; that Cole's mother never awknowledges Malcolm when he comes to see the boy; the looks Cole gives Malcolm when he asks him ""what is it that YOU want out of this?""; and other things.  The clues are all there, but subtly woven into the plot.The acting was very very good also.  The young boy always portrays exactly what he is feeling--we can tell, and we feel sympathy and pain for his sake. Bruce Willis makes the perfect psychologist--he is calm and caring, and he doesn't give up.The movie's surprise ending didn't catch me off guard--because I had been previously told.  But it was still as emotional and well done as I ever might have expected.The Sixth Sense really impressed me--and it made me think profoundly--few movies do that nowadays.  See it.",The Sixth Sense
1581,mike.hales,"Excellent, very different for a mainstream US film.",10,27 October 1999,"In my opinion, Bruce Willis should be very proud of his performance. At last, he's proved he's more than a pretty face. However, the star is the young boy in this film, who is quite simply brilliant. This film reminded me why I love going to the cinema so much.",The Sixth Sense

1583,Claudio Rezende - Brazil,A star's vindication of excellency,10,7 November 1999,"He's got the looks, he's got the charisma, he's got the talent. ""The Sixth Sense"" is the vindication of excellency of a great Hollywood star: Bruce Willis.After all, ""The Sixth Sense"" is one of these movies where you can't go wrong. An extremely well done story, well directed, with a hell of a cast. No one could ever forget the memorable roles played by the boy Haley Joel Osment and the incredible Toni ""Muriel's Wedding"" Colete. Everything matches so well in the whole thing that it is hard to believe this won't be a favorite nominee for the Y2K Academy Awards.",The Sixth Sense
1584,nbowen,"If You haven't seen this movie, DON'T READ FURTHER!!!",10,9 November 1999,"First of all anyone who trashes this movie either doesn't understand the movie fully or doesn't want to understand. Every actor in this movie played an important role and gave brilliant performances. Particularly Bruce Willis in his first successful serious role, definitley his best and Toni Collete for a fantastic portrayal of a single mother.Now lets get into it... This is not a scary movie, the main issue here is the afterlife which would probably fall into a supernatural/psychological drama. This movie is about one mans journey into the afterlife.As we begin the film, we see the final moments of Malcom Crowe's life. Note how his wife Anna and him communicate. When Vincent Grey actually enters the scene notice the striking physical resemblence to Cole Sear.Could they be the same person? It is possible, notice the voice simmalarity, of young vincent. This leads to a theory that Crowe's life is flashing before his eyes and has stopped at where Vincent  is a boy except his name is Cole yet they are the same person, however Crowe switches into the present every time he is with his wife. Which leads to questions like: Who is the young man Anna is with? Is it a younger Malcom? Why does Anna give this young man a first edition book?Anyways back to the plot Crowe is confronted by a patient whom he has failed(Vincent/Cole?) before giving the chance to help, the patient shoots him and then himself. The movie begins one year after the murders. Crowe is waiting for Cole, and he is reading  a file similar to Vincent's. Heres a question: If Crowe has been dead for a year where did he get the file? How did he know about Cole?The film then journeys into the building of Crowe and Cole's relationship, the problems and triumphs Cole and Crowe have during the process and the frustrations and understandings Cole has with his Mum.
Notice how no one ever notices Crowe, yet Cole does. Can Cole See this? Does Cole Know Crowe is a Ghost? Now here are some things to think about: When Cole's Mum is looking at the photo's why is their no ghost's sprite when it shows the youngest picture of Cole? There are alot of first person views in Cole's house especially with his Mum,like she is being watched. These are all important but, pay attention to every scene Crowe is in and look at how he handles himself and how others handle him. He knows he is dead, he just forgets or wants to forget.Cole sees ghosts they scare him, Why doesnt Crowe scare him? Crowe helps Cole with his problem, by telling him to listen to the ghosts and they will go away. Cole does this and he infact helps one and it goes away(crosses into the afterlife) he realises that he has a gift and he shouldnt be scared. He then helps Crowe with his problem, even though Crowe was dead he didn't know how to communicate with his wife. That really is Cole's role in the movie except one bit: How did Cole open so many drawers and cupboards so quickly? Did he infact do it? Why did the hand print appear then disappear afterwards?Where as for his mum she just wanted to understand her son, and when she finally did he solved a grief she had for years and no bond could have been greater than her new bond with her son.As for Crowe he is infact the main character, and the film is about him and how he helps a boy with a great gift that others dont understand, and how he deals with the fact he is dead.The ending is a twist when watched for the first time, but when watched more than once it shows infact that even though Cole said ""people don't know their dead"" they do know they just dont want to admit it. The final moment is one of great WARMTH, LOVE, LIGHT and LIFE. The words he says here show that he in fact knew he was dead, HE JUST HAD A HARD TIME COPING WITH IT. This is a film of the ages and makes us think about death and the afterlife the way it should be looked at, this will forever be a film that will constantly bring up new things and intrigue us forever.",The Sixth Sense
1585,Kieron Salt,Creepiest film of the year,10,17 November 1999,"This is the first film in about a decade which has forced me to watch certain scenes through half closed eyes. I think that this is due to the realism portrayed by both the direction and the quality of acting.Bruce Willis does an excellent job but the real star is the young lad who plays Cole (there is no way that anybody could have acted the part better, definite Oscar material).The deliberately slow build up creates an almost tangible atmosphere and the lack of CGI makes the whole think more realistic and hence more creepy. I have never seen more people jump or scream whilst watching a film.The most amazing thing about this film is the way it merges so many emotions, you can't help but begin to care about the characters. This is all built up towards the end where one minute you are watching an incredibly emotional scene regarding Cole and his mother and the next you are left spinning by perhaps the most incredible ending to a film this decade. Forget The Usual Suspects.I urge anyone who enjoys a night out at the pictures to go and see this film, I can almost guarantee that you will enjoy it.",The Sixth Sense
1586,Joanna Kelly,You'll be knocked for six,9,26 November 1999,"This is an incredibly powerful film. Awash with emotion but never stooping to sentimentality this is the story of one frightened little boy you will never forget. All your worst childhood nightmares: the noises in the attic, the intruder in your house, that cold breath that makes your hair stand on end are here and then some.Bruce Willis gives one of the best performances of his career as the child psychologist trying to get himself back on track after a violent encounter with a former patient and it would be a crime if Haley Joel Osment were overlooked at coming awards ceremonies for his powerful performance here. It has been a long time since a child actor displayed such maturity in a role. Cole's innocent little face hidden behind his absent father's large-framed spectacles betrays a child coming to terms with a terrifying secret in the only way he can.You don't need to go and see this film again to realise why the end is such a surprise but you will rush out to watch it again purely because it's an almost perfect example of it's genre.Laugh, cry, jump a mile out of your seat, sigh with relief - but not too early... We did!",The Sixth Sense
1587,nickdj,One remarkable screenplay,10,1 December 1999,"Though I agree with so many others who have commented that the quality of the acting in this movie is truly excellent, I'd like to focus on the quality of the screenplay.  So many movies feature so much tedious, unreal dialogue--assuming they feature a plot at all--that it struck me as a real revelation that M. Night Shyamalan's script could ring so true and sound so human. I think I am going to savor a number of scenes for as long as memory lasts, some scenes were gripping, involving and satisfying; credit should go to the actors surely, but surely to the screenplay, as well.I hope Haley Osment receives at least an Oscar nomination.  I also believe Mr. Shyamalan deserves an award for best original screenplay.",The Sixth Sense

1589,Fender-3,Creepy and utterly enjoyable,10,5 December 1999,"I have not been this terrified since seeing The Shining for the first time! A true quality horror flick. Bruce Willis was his usual self, but Haley Joel Osment - I can't possible say anything which would do justice to his acting. It goes simply unsurpassed. I'd be very, very amazed if he doesn't get an Oscar for it! I am yet to see Stigmata, but I seriously doubt it can move me the same way this great piece of filmwork did. If you are into quality horror, go and see this, you won't be disappointed.",The Sixth Sense
1590,Readster,One of the films of the Nineties,10,8 December 1999,"This is perhaps my film of the decade so far. The reasons are too numerous to go into in such a short critique. Surely there have not been too many films that can take you through the range of emotions that the Sixth Sense does. The prime emotion; fear, is a difficult emotion to generate in a modern audience that has seen it all before, but this film succeeds where others fail, praying on your imagination and generating suspense from subtle devices rather than blatant horror.It is such a relief that the performances of Willis and the excellent Osment live up to an excellently directed quality storyline. I will be disappointed if the youngster doesn't receive at least an academy nomination.I seldom go to the cinema twice to watch a film, in fact I cannot remember when I have done it before. Tonight I am taking an old friend to see this film as it will be a tragedy if he doesn't see it on the big screen. He has heard so much about it that he is reluctant to go, as I am when something is over-hyped. Just for a change though, here is a film that lives up to its billing and has you thinking about it for weeks to come. As for the twist at the end? Well it totally disorientated me, my mind spinning back throughout the whole film. A fantastic punchline to my film of the year.",The Sixth Sense
1591,j-man-6,You'll either get it or you won't,5,8 December 1999,"Oh dear I was so looking forward to being scared and surprised by this movie. I knew it was a huge twist at the end movie but sadly I figured it out after the opening scene. Once you have figured it out you can't go back and enjoy the movie. It is wasted on you and you're left wondering why the twit next to you can't grasp it. The whole movie is very carefully put together to hide the ending, every word and movement has been painstakingly choreographed (especially in the restaurant) but all I wanted to was shout "" don't you get it, **** ********* *********!!!!!"" Still there are a few creepy moments and the spirits range from scary to gross to downright hilarious looking (the cyclist made us laugh out loud, what an expression!) Collette is very good and a scene towards the end is beautifully played by her and the kid who is also great. Bruce's wife in the movie is painfully underwritten once the movie gets going but maybe they had to do this as it was the scenes between her and Willis that were most likely to give the gme away. Bruce is okay, but you do expect him to go and shoot some ghouls at any minute, no action in this though. All in all not a bad movie and if like most you remain in the dark you should get a pleasent surprise, but shame on you for being so slow in the first place!!",The Sixth Sense

1593,Caelmi,"Not that my opinion matters, but...",5,19 August 2000,"The Sixth Sense is a two hour magic trick, of sorts. There are a few good scenes here and there -- viz. the opening, the funeral twist, etc. -- but I have no doubts that Shyamalan came up with the ending before he wrote the movie, and as such the first two hours only exists to avert the audience's attention from the twist ending that is really the point of the whole movie. There are upsides, of course: Osmet's acting was a pleasant surprise, the direction was dark and somber (which -- though it may just be me -- was very appealing), and the score. However, as a whole, it seems like a tedious exercise with a pay-off that doesn't make up for the two hours of dullness that precedes it. That being said, see the movie anyway, because if public opinion means anything (and it does, I reluctantly admit), chances are you'll love this movie.",The Sixth Sense

This was a gimmicky, non-scary horror flick with a sappy hook ending that paled in comparison to the similar ending of Fight Club.  It was cheap entertainment at best that causes me to completely lose respect for the Academy Awards. To totally disregard an innovative, thought-provoking film with some semblance of cultural relevance like Fight Club and then nominate this piece in almost every major category is ridiculous. What does the audience get out of this film besides thinking of ghosts the next time they get goose bumps? The hokey plot was lame, the kid was annoying, Bruce Willis was Bruce Willis, and what was with the classroom scene with the microphone visible at the top of the screen? Granted I went in expecting to hate it, but this film was decent for a horror movie at best and not nearly in the same league as Being John Malkovich, Magnolia, or Fight Club.",The Sixth Sense

Great script, great actors, great directing, great score, you name it. It was all perfect, but the most thing to be said about this movie is the acting of Haley Joel Osment, is  one of the years best and still has me think about it. Just like a young Robert DeNiro. Together with Toni Collette this is the only movie in the fright genre that gave me tears in my eyes. Especially the scene in the car and some scenes where you see Haley with his tears in his eyes. I hope he wins the Oscar for 'Best Supporting Actor', because I think you won't see this the next year from others anymore (only from him, can't wait for his next movie) and same for Toni. This is such a frightening and beautiful movie it gives me goosebumps. I love Horror movies for a very long time, from Hellraiser to Evil Dead to Braindead, to name a few movies, but this is of only movie of the decade together with The Blair Witch Project that ranks up to my favorite top 10 movies I've ever seen, and that says a lot.

Director Shyamalan has made this movie with perfection to the core. Its a touching tale of a child who sees ghosts and his relationship with his psychiatrist ....his mother...and himself. Its about his discovery of his own personal powers. It is also a tale of a man(Willis) whose life has a lot of loose ends to meet. These intertwined...it makes it a mesmerising cinematic event.

I was captivated from the beginning despite Bruce Willis starring.  He seems the same in every movie except for this.  I hardly realized it was him.  The direction is absolutely brilliant as well as the writing.  Haley Joel was amazing.  The movie took me in and made me forget to think ahead as to what might happen.

1625,DerekC,About the supposed plot holes...,10,25 February 2001,"First off, I think this is a great movie, and my opinion of it hasn't diminished with multiple viewings.  It's a shame Osment only nabbed a Best Supporting nod; whatever you thought of his performance here -- and the praise seems pretty unanimous -- he certainly carried enough of the movie to be considered in the Best Actor category.Now, as for all these complaints about the supposed plot/logic holes in the movie...*** SPOILERS ***I can't believe how many comments here have echoed the same complaint: ""How could Malcolm not know he was dead?  Didn't he ever try to eat / talk to his wife / change his clothes / go the bathroom / etc?"".  I thought it was implicitly understood that Malcolm saw whatever he wanted/needed to see, in order to maintain the illusion of his former life.  Whether he subconsciously knew the truth, I don't know, but it's the only explanation for how he could have ignored the above issues.  In fact, the end montage showed an example of this, when Malcolm finally noticed the desk blocking the basement door (the same basement he'd been coming and going from every day).Sure, it's a catch-all solution, but I don't think it's a cop-out; it even makes sense within the context of the story.  Otherwise, as everyone's pointed out, how could he *not* know he was dead?  He'd have realized something was wrong the first time he tried to talk to anyone, or touch anything.And as for being able to break the window that one time... I thought the ghosts all had limited physical ability when they were under stress? Isn't that how Cole got his scratches and bruises?",The Sixth Sense

The thing that makes this movie work as a genuinely creepy movie is that it's plausible.  It's not scary in a blood-curdling-scream kind of way; it's more psychological, and it's more likely to make you lie awake at night and wonder if this might happen to you.  After you see ""The Sixth Sense,"" compare it to a traditional horror movie, such as ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"".  Which movie's plot and characters seem more believable?The ending is fantastic, and it came as a complete shock to me.

1632,jacksn-72483,Sixth Sense is a creative masterpiece,10,4 August 2019,"The Sixth Sense is a drama/mystery thriller film about a child psychologist who is trying to help a young boy who sees dead people and is constantly being tortured about it. Bruce Willis plays Dr. Malcom and Haley Joel Osment plays Cole Sear, the troubled boy in the film. This film is directed by Manoj Nelliyattu Shyamalan. Dr. Malcolm feels the need to help Cole because he feels like he needs to make amends more a wrong that he made earlier in his life. He thinks that if he is able to help Cole overcome his issues then, he will feel better about a past patient that he had failed.
The theme of this film is about regret, pain, and loss. Throughout the movie there are several instances where these theme elements are showcased. When Cole's mother is asking Cole where her family heirloom is that her mother gave to her, Cole wouldn't tell her the actual likely cause of how it got into his room, but he just insists that he didn't take it. This scene really shows how much her mother meant to her. Also, near the end of the movie when Cole tells his mother that the woman died in the accident and then he finally confesses to her that he can see dead people and they talk to him and he does things for them, he tells her how his grandmother wanted her to know that she is proud of her and that she loves her. During this scene, we learn just how much regret that the mother felt because they weren't on good terms when she died. When we find out that Dr. Malcom was dead the whole time, we also realize the loss the regret that his wife feels when she asked him why he left her. This film's theme is similar to that of Shutter Island because of how the characters deal with the inner conflict of fear.
Two techniques that were used to really support the theme was lighting and angles. The scene when Cole finally tells Dr. Malcolm that he sees dead people is very significant because immediately afterwards the camera cuts to Malcolm's face and it slows zooms in on his face. When you're watching it for the first time, chances are that you missed it, but this camera angle is brilliant because it's the director's way of telling us the Malcolm is dead. Another technique that was crucial to the film was the lighting or use of certain colors. In the movie, the director was very careful about how he used the color red. The color red was used to show anything that the dead people had impacted in the film. Some examples of this was Cole's red shirt, the red doorknob, the red jacket on the mother who was keeping her daughter sick, the red stairs, and the red balloon.
This movie was beautifully directed and the attention to detail was just spot on. Unlike many horror films nowadays, this movie was true horror and focused on things that can truly terrify us.",The Sixth Sense

1635,johngoodwin-53009,An introspective film with breathtaking twist,9,23 September 2019,"The sixth sense put me on a rollercoaster ride. I was drawn into the story immediately with the scene where Bruce Willis as Malcolm Crowe is shot in his home by a child he just could not help. The theme of the film is two central characters finding out about themselves. The acting by Haley Joel Osment as Cole Sear was inspiring especially for such a young talent at the time. The guilt that Crowe feels as he is unable to help his former patient Vincent drives him to give Cole his utmost effort and attention. The angles the cinematographer uses to bring us into the point of view of each character is flawless and draws the viewer in without even realizing it. It takes Cole a while to open up to Crowe because he seems to be embarrassed to say what is wrong with him. Once he finally does tell Malcolm what is wrong, which happens to be the fact that Cole sees ""dead people"" his fear is almost true as Malcolm does not believe him at first and believes he is hallucinating and may be delusional. Eventually after listening to Cole on tape over and over again he happens to hear a voice an the background which leads him to believe Cole. Malcolm then recommends that Cole should try to use his ability to try and understand why the dead people are coming to him. As Cole speaks to the spirits, he is finding out how they passed away. One for instance leads him to a gun then reveals a gunshot wound to the back of his head. Then a girl shows up in Cole's room. He goes to the girl's house during her funeral and finds a video tape which he gives to the girl's father. The father then watches the tape and finds out that it is his wife who is poisoning the children and killing them, not that a naturally acquired sickness is taking them. Once Cole feels good about his ability while riding in his car, he finally decides to open up about what is going on with him to his mother. His mother does not believe her son until he tells her a story about a dance he heard from his grandmother that would be impossible for Cole to know otherwise. After feeling better and actually healed by Malcolm Crowe, Cole advises him to talk to his wife while she is sleeping. It is during this talk that Malcolm realizes that he actually died during the confrontation with Vincent. This realization along with Cole's newfound freedom and ability to fit in in school ties up the theme of the film.",The Sixth Sense

1642,hatem-06313,Sixth Sense was a great psychological thriller if you like seeing dead people!,7,22 June 2020,"The sixth sense is about a single mother, Lynn Sear, played by Toni Collette and her son Cole Sear, played by Haley Joel Osment. Lynn's son Cole sees dead people. The dead people scares Cole, so his mother Lynn takes him to see a child psychologist Malcolm Crowe who is played by Bruce Willis. Cole, being scared to death, his mother, Lynn, felt helpless. Maybe Malcolm can help him get through the emotional trauma that seeing dead people are causing him.
There are a couple of themes in the movie, but the biggest one is facing your fears and, in a strong second, is mortality. Cole had to face his fears in the movie. Lynn, at all costs, is going to be there every step of the way. After the child psychologist got Cole to open up, Malcolm found that talking to Cole not only helped Cole, but it helped him. Cole had to face his fear to overcome it, and he was helping Malcolm to face his own mortality.
Cole suffered in silence about what he has seen, but he knew he had to face his own fears. A ghost named Kyra was showing up in Cole's room. She scared him because of how she looked, but this is his chance to face what he feared. It was not that bad. After all, she just needs help because she was scared and wanted to move on.
In this movie family, ties are strong because Cole is all Lynn had, and Cole is the support Malcolm needed. Cole learned to face his fears. Malcolm learned to face the fact he was dead. In the end, everyone faced their fears with a little help from each other. This movie has the same underlying theme as The Others mortality. Although The Others is considered a horror genre, it has some striking similarities as the Sixth Sence both visited by the dead.
No movie is scary or had so many visits by the dead without a little magic behind the scenes. The movie uses darkness, temperature, and even emotion to give the psychological response and the visuals. Cole uses the teary eyes to give emotional appeal while close up frames to get the attention of the living in and outside (us) the movie. The movie also used darker frames where very little light gets through again to play on the fear of the dead and emotional impact. Lighting was used in a number of ways of darkness, meaning death, and the frame brightens up when Cole or his mother were in the frame. The temperature was played with to give the ice-cold feeling of the dead. In a couple of scenes with Cole and a dead person, his breath gives the illusion of it being cold in the room.
This movie is a great movie to see good acting, and even the dead do a great job of being dead. It is a hit all the way around. You will receive the psychological thrill, but in the end, it is the chill you will feel. So if something goes bump in the night, do not turn on the light.",The Sixth Sense

1645,destinysblade,Not Every Gift Is A Blessing,8,2 December 2006,"The story takes place in modern day America where a child psychologist Malcolm Crowe (Bruce Willis) is looking for redemption for a former patient's suicide. He finds a young Cole Sear (Haley Joel Osment) and along comes a bonding relationship; a man torn and broken and a collapsing marriage, and a boy terrified to wake up in the morning and classed as a freak by his peers. Directed and written by M. Night Shyamalan, it's clear that everyone on the set has worked extremely hard to make this movie what it is. But to have written such an elaborate and well thought out story is quite remarkable also.Haley Joel Osment delivers an astonishing performance for such a young actor, it's clear that he has a bright future ahead of him. It also refreshing to see Bruce Willis take a different role not the whole stereotypical Hollywood action film hero. He actually keeps his shirt on and he's not wielding some kind of firearm nor does he have a woman leaning on his chest saying how much she loves him. In this film he's really shown that he can do so much more than take out a gang of mobsters and be the hero of the day, in this story the hero takes a completely different role.It's very difficult to talk about the film without saying anything to spoil it but as Malcolm and Cole finally start to connect, Cole wants to tell Malcolm a secret and he says, ""I can see dead people."" Probably one of the most chilling and memorable lines in movie history it also had a big effect on me to see now what the child was going through. All these years of suffering and torment, and now he's finally being able to talk to someone about it.Toni Collette also delivers a fantastic performance as a regular 'super' mum; her husband has passed away and she is now working two jobs, constantly trying to protect her child. In one particularly well acted piece of drama Cole is unwell and faints; she takes him to the hospital and is accused of hurting her child as markings were found on his back. As she looks away towards Malcolm in disgust a tear falls from her eyes, But the unexplained issue is what gave Cole the scratches, a group of children could not have given him that. Nor can his mother understand why was he screaming, it just constantly builds up to the film's climatic and dramatic ending.Another well-acted minor role was Vincent Gray (Donnie Wahlberg). He was only on screen for about three or four minutes but you could see all the emotion and drama that was put into that short while on screen. But the minute he appeared there was a lot of eeriness and feelings of despair, and he was a completely unpredictable character.As the plot gets deeper the actors immerse themselves in the characters and really start to show their emotions, this is cleverly portrayed by several tear-jerking moments. Credit to Willis and Osment; they really make it the great film it is but my greatest amount of praise would have to be awarded to Shyamalan as for coming up and directing such a spectacular film nearly flawless in every aspect. I think it's clear that The Sixth Sense is one of the genre defining movies of the 20th century. 8/10. A genre defining thriller, really one of the must see movies, all I can do is praise this film, its blockbuster genius.",The Sixth Sense
1646,mccabe-25306,Are We All Dead?,10,18 March 2021,"I found this film to be an excellently crafted film. It stars Bruce Willis as Malcolm Crowe. Malcolm is a child psychologist who is assigned to work with a young boy named Cole who is played by Haley Joel Osment, who can see people who have passed away. Malcolm's wife does not enjoy the amount of time that he is spending with Cole, but Malcolm is determined to help Cole.
The theme that is seen throughout the film is getting over one's fears. We see Cole struggling with the daily visions of dead people. It is only when Cole helps Kyra that he is able to understand that he doesn't need to be afraid of ghosts and he can actually help them. Malcolm tries to help him get over that fear. Another theme is dealing with death. Malcolm's wife still sad, celebrates her anniversary. It is just part of her healing process.
There are many twists and turns when it comes to Cole and Malcolm. Cole tells Malcolm that he can see dead people, however, they do not know that they are dead. The dead also can't see other people who have died. The real plot twist is at the end when we find out the Malcolm is deceased.
The Sixth Sense reminds me of the 2001 film The Others with Nicole Kidman. Her and her children have passed away and their spirits cannot leave their home. The way they interact is very similar to how Malcom interacts with other people.
The sound in the film helps intensify feelings of fear. We hear sounds enhance before a ghost comes on the screen. We can hear eerie music play in the opening scene. Lighting also helps the mood of the film. When Cole sees a ghost, the lighting dims, making the advance feel uneasy.
There is much loss in The Sixth Sense. Cole loses his dad and Anna loses Malcolm. There is always a fear of losing loved ones. How do we deal with it? Are our loves ones walking around not knowing that they have passed?",The Sixth Sense

1648,kellyjcutright,The Sixth Sense,9,2 May 2021,"Sixth Sense, 1999 Starring: Bruce Willis, Haley Joel, Olivia Williams, and Toni Collette
The Sixth Sense film is an eerie, thriller/horror film released in 1999. The beginning of the movie gave you a sense that the movie was going to be terrifying and exciting all at the same time. Malcolm Crowe (Bruce Willis) is a child psychiatrist that dedicates his life to helping children overcome their obstacles. In the opening scene, we see Malcolm gets shot by an ex-patient that was now an adult, standing in his bathroom. Malcolm falls on the bed as he is consoled by his wife but he states that it doesn't hurt him anymore, but we never see him getting better or being rescued. The film just continues a year later when he agrees to take on a new patient, Cole Sear (Haley Osment), which had a very similar problem to the patient that he had years prior. Malcolm records all his sessions with all his patients to later assess the situation for further diagnosis. Later when Malcolm is reviewing the tape, he hears a familiar sound in the background of Cole's assessment. He hears whispering and muttering that he had once heard with another patient from years before. He finds out that Cole has a secret and that he can ""see dead people"" that do not know that they are dead yet. Malcolm suggests that Cole try and see what the ""ghosts"" want from him and to try and help them.The film carries a lot of clues that Malcolm is one of the ghosts that do not yet know that they are dead. For instance, we only see Malcolm interact with Cole throughout the film, such as conversations and eye contact. However, there are some scenes that he is in with his wife Anna (Olivia Williams), but they are non-interacting scenes that, in turn, try to portray that she is cold and upset with him. Thus, keeping the twist for the end of the film and not giving too much away, too early on. We never actually see any conversations that transpire between Malcolm and his wife Anna. Although we see him talking to her, she does not respond to him directly. Malcolm also wears the same clothes throughout the entire movie, keeping to the theme of him being a ghost.Cole had stated that his secret was that he can see dead people and when they are near and upset, the room gets cold, hence why you can see your breath. However, this never happens when Malcolm is around. This is because Malcolm is a ghost that is not yet upset. Cole states that the ghosts do not know that they are dead, hinting more at the fact that Malcolm is one of these ghosts that need help finding their way home.The editing of this film took a lot of creativity in the sense that the twist had to stay hidden until the end of the film. The scenes with his wife had to look as if she was just upset with him and giving him the cold shoulder. As well as all these scenes had to look as if he was there but, then again, not there. The film had to be carefully thought out to manipulate the fact that he was never really in any of these circumstances, but with Cole, alone. In turn, not giving anything away until the very end of the film. This plot brings me in mind of the movie, The Others, written/directed by Alejandro Amenabar, which has the same motif. Only it is a family of ghosts that do not yet know that they are dead. A mother had killed her two young children as well as herself, trapping the three in their home as another family moves in to be haunted by them.The Sixth Sense is a thrilling, edge of your seat, movie that keeps you engaged until the very end. Haley Joel Osment does an impeccable job acting like a scared young boy that needs to find out why this is all happening to him. In turn, being Malcolm's saving grace at the end of the film. So, the film has two twists at the end; being, Malcolm is indeed a ghost, as well as Cole is the one helping Malcolm as well as Malcolm is helping Cole.",The Sixth Sense

(The director certainly expected everyone to.)Overall, this is a tour de force with Bruce Willis in the last role you'd expect to see him in, and a shining example of what modern movies should be.Rating: 5 out of 5 stars",The Sixth Sense

1654,ten_neon_hearts,My lovely friend Emma's review!,3,16 December 2008,"This is my friend Emma's review!'The film starts off with Dr. Malcolm Crowe (Bruce Willis) and his wife Anna Crowe (Olivia Williams) getting drunk as a celebration of Malcolm's honour plaque given to him by the Government/Council. After running upstairs, ready to jump into bed together, they hear a noise in the bathroom. It turns out a mental ex-patient of Malcolm's has broken in (""Vincent Gray""), and in the end of the scene Malcolm is shot by him, but the audience don't know yet that he is, in fact, dead.The first plot hole my friend and I came across was the notes Malcolm has on Cole Sear, his new client. How did he get the notes? We don't know. As it turns out in the very end, Malcolm has been dead the entire time, so he finds out for himself then why nobody has spoken to him for such a long time (yet another plot hole, because you WOULD notice that). You can rule out the idea that 'Coles mother filled Malcolm in with all the details' because Malcolm is dead and nobody can see him. A ridiculous detail I found out was that Bruce Willis had to write with his right hand in this film (he is naturally left-handed) to hide the fact he is not wearing his wedding ring since his death in the first scene. Plot hole number three comes up soon after, when we find Malcolm and Cole's mother sitting opposite one another in chairs in the Sear's resident lounge. I started to wonder; how did the very-dead-and-invisible Malcolm actually get into the house in the first place? Did he simply knock on the door and dart in as a confused Mrs Sear opens the door to an empty space? That, of course, would be ridiculous. So we are left wondering how the Hell he got in. Anyway, it is ""cleverly designed"" to make it look like Mrs Sear was speaking to Malcolm before Cole enters the house, returning home from school. Of course, when you figure out he's dead, you end up thinking how stupid that technique was because it was pointless and confusing, NOT a 'twist' in the plot. Later on in the film, a few scenes later, there is the scene where Malcolm is supposedly 'unravelling the secret' Cole has about his sixth sense, seeing dead people. The scene is where Malcolm is listening to a recording of himself and Vincent years ago in one of the counselling sessions. This scene soon gets on your nerves as all you can see is a confused Malcolm with a ridiculous expression on his face listening to what sounds like an out of tune radio. Yes, spooky, Shymalan. Apparently, from the ""information"" Malcolm gets from this event, he ""figures out"" that Cole has a similar condition as Vincent did. Diddy-Mao, Malcolm, we already figured that out for ourselves scenes ago! Now would be an opportune moment to mention that the actor that played Cole Sear (Haley Joel Osment) is incredibly irritating throughout the film. He gives off that 'theatre-brat' attitude that makes you not want to give him any sympathy for his issues, but instead put him in a cage and throw away the key.After a scene where a pathetic Malcolm tells Cole of his ""explanation"" regarding the ghosts Cole sees, that the ghosts are actually wanting to have Cole's help, they summon up this idea for Cole that he should indeed help the people he sees. The acting is, again, ridiculous and melodramatic as Cole sees more hanging dead people.Plot hole number 5 occurs when Malcolm visits Cole in his school play. Why didn't anybody sit on him? He's not there, after all.In the next scene or so, Malcolm returns to his home, where he finds his wife asleep on the couch with the couple's wedding video on in the background. As she sleeps, Anna's hand releases Malcolm's wedding ring, which he suddenly discovers he has not been wearing. Ding, ding, ding! Plot hole number 6! A shocked Malcolm has only JUST realised he hasn't been wearing his wedding ring! Oh dear! What an atrocity! I think not, just plain stupid. He then attempts to open the cupboard door he attempted to open on more than one occasion during the film, and then realises he can't open it because Anna has blocked the door with boxes, as revealed by the camera as it falls back to show the boxes. Yet another unfulfilled, pointless, random scene. Wouldn't you notice the boxes before then? A confused and upset Malcolm then rushes upstairs to the bedroom and discovers his wound from the gunshot. Cue plot hole number 7; who in their right mind doesn't notice a gaping hole in their stomach for over a year? Malcolm really isn't on the ball is he? Anyway, he realises he's actually dead now and puts two and two together as to why his wife has been ignoring him. After a few flashbacks we realise Anna wasn't actually in a mood with Malcolm, she just never saw him! Oh the twists and turns of this film just get worse, don't they? Cheesefest. Malcolm has a conversation with Anna, as Cole told him to. He says he loves her and that she wasn't second best to his job. Oh, what a lovely ending. The screen then fades to black. Fin.Another plot hole/random 'detail' I noticed was the amount of red props used in the film (Lynn's red nails, Cole's red sweater, the red balloon at the birthday party, etc). The camera makes a bee line for all these random red items but we never really find out why. According to Shymalan, it symbolised something the audience had to figure out. I didn't figure it out, it's just too out of place and stupid.'",The Sixth Sense

1656,shadowfur,Sixth Sense Review by Shadowfur,9,4 April 2007,"This was the first of M. Night Shyamalan's films I'd seen. I've now seen all of his five majors, and this is still a great one. Of course, I'd heard the line ""I see dead people"" previously, but hadn't known where it came from. Of course, the twist at the end *SPOILER*(with Crow being dead)*SPOILER END* is one of the most startling revelations a movie has shown me plot-wise, and I know only maybe two people who predicted it would happen (one of which is my mother.) A really great movie, highly suggested for Thriller lovers and who are new to Shyamalan's work. If you don't like gore, not to worry! Hardly any gore here. P.S. Look for the color Red!",The Sixth Sense

1658,ctreyz,Totally predictable and very poor story - forget this movie!,2,22 February 2002,"This movie surely has its moments. Mainly during the first 30 Minutes. Then it fades into dumbness (why would dead people ask certain kids to do obscure things ??)... not even the strange twist at the end of the movie may save the whole thing from being more than a C-Picture Storyline. You could feel the twist coming right after 30 Minutes and that makes it booooring like hell. Two or three nice shocking effects are not enough to make a good suspense thriller out of nothing. Sorry, but there are way better supernatural thrillers on the shelve.",The Sixth Sense
1659,sneaks76,Unadulterated Trite,1,7 August 2007,"This film is a one-trick pony that's far more nag than it is thoroughbred and would be more effective as a half-hour episode of The Outer Limits. Any potential suspense is nullified in the opening 15 minutes, when it is explained that the apparitions seen by Haley Joel Osment's character are appealing to him for assistance, rather than having any sinister intentions. Therefore, no matter in what manner the spectres appear, the audience has already been made aware that no harm is intended to the major character and that to classify the film as a horror is wide of the mark, as no threat or danger is present in any scene. This leads the audience to then cogitate on the big ""twist"" which is central to the plot (and I would even go so far as to say that it is the only plot in the whole turgid affair). I'm afraid to say that I worked this out within the first half an hour, leading to an excruciating remainder of the film, where it is consistently rammed down your throat that the kid sees dead people, the kid helps dead people and that Brucey's character is seen by the kid. Even my friend (who I went to the cinema with) who didn't work out the ending said that it was unadulterated trite, so I should thank him for my summary line, as I couldn't have expressed this film in a single phrase any better than this. Anyone who finds this film even remotely scary, complex, or views it as a classic psychological horror clearly needs to watch a Hitchcock film and try to raise their intellectual standards above a primary school (6th grade) level. On the plus side, I thought the cinematography was excellent, so kudos to you Tak Fujimoto.

Most of the time it was unexciting and bland, and the storyline just seemed to drag on to an implausible ending of confusement. bruce willis was absurd as usual, when is this guy gonna give up trying to act in what could be top-notch thrillers and go back to meaningless action romps? Osmond was okay, you have to give him credit for working with such a 'twilight-zone' script, though I must admit Toni Collete did outshine as the disturbed boys mother.The simple fact is, for me at least - this movie would have looked better on the small screen as an episode of the X--files or the Twilight-Zone. It just didnt have the strength in characterisation or thrills to make it exciting as a two hour holywood movie. And of course.. like most hollywood entertainment reviewers do..they hyped the movie up and it was applauded by all alike, just beacuse the genre was 'unique' and 'different' from the rest of the crap that hollywood produces.Though the storyline and genre are certainly unique.

I've heard that it has been no changes in it. Only that is worth an Oscar, I think. He is also a very good director! My favorite of all times! I'm looking forward to see ""Signs"". It might be the film of the year. All his films are that so why shouldn't it?!It feels nice to see Bruce Willis play an other character than some action-figure. Also he is great in this film!

'The Sixth Sense' is one of those extraordinary films that does that for me, as all the conventions have been sculpted to manipulate the audience.This film reflects on some difficult and what would've been 'dodgy' subjects that will make the viewer walk away asking loads of questions about death, about letting go, about love and commitment, about the love shared between parent and child and husband and wife.

In the world of The Sixth Sense logic is your worst enemy.There are obvious (and sometimes less obvious) hints right in front of you but you don't grasp them because of your preconceptions and premises. I once read a novel called 'Somewhere carnal over 40 winks' which used similar techniques found in this movie, but in writing. I'm sure you will enjoy this book as much as I did, if you like to be intellectually surprised.If you haven't seen this movie, don't read reviews and don't talk to your friends who have already seen it.

He is then attack by a ghost and taken to the hospital by his mom where the whole ghost situation begins to unravel and he open to Dr. Malcolm and reveal his secret. The movie is really similar to others M. Night Shyamalan movies with the same suspense and secret plot as The Village (2004). The lightning use in the movie was dark and really helps the suspense outcome. Motif of the movie for suspense and thriller was really express during the whole theme and plot. Cole is expose constantly expose to a life full of seeing ghost everywhere and the petitions they have of help. The unraveling of their own situations and the scary way they invade his life.

The video player started and I was sitting by her ready to respond to her admiration (as I expected). What happened really shocked me. It was not about her but rather about me. I discovered a sluggish scenario, an intolerable cool looking Willis, an unrealistic performance by a 10 year old child, gaps, Jumps and oversimplifications in the story and so on. Approaching the end my wife told me, what kind of crap you made me see and lost my evening, he is also dead isn't he? I surprisingly responded, how did get it? well!! piece of cake, she replied, even a child can foresee it. That was the end of all. She has a good judgment of movies so her phrase shock me. The magic was all lost. Conclusion. This is the first time it happened to me. Usually when I see a film again it is because I am sure 100% that it worth it. I am a voracious film eater and I cant be wrong. Final comments. A childish scenario, a commercially promoted film that otherwise could be a masterpiece in another director's hands.

1679,hounddogemilee,This film is clever in more ways than one,9,4 May 2015,"The Sixth Sense is one of those movies that each time you watch it, you can pick up something new. M. Night Shyamalan and his crew created a world and characters that were easy to believe in as well as engage in. There may have been one or two scenes that were necessary, but the movie never felt like it was dragging on. It also doesn't rely on just scaring the viewer, but draws out all sorts of emotions.The biggest thing about this film is its cleverness. Everyone mentions the twist at the end, but I argue that this film was good without it. The film is complex enough to keep interest. Yes, the twist is what this movie if really known for, but I think that it sometimes over-shadows the story of a young boy who sees dead people. All of the parts of the film work really well together and I never felt there was something that was out of place.The cinematography is not ground breaking, but it creates lots of contrast that definitely adds to the story. I thought the music was a great fit as it was not too overpowering at emotional moments, but was able to create suspense when needed. Haley Joel Osment's acting is fantastic. He looked as professional as the great adult actors. Although Bruce Willis acts this part very well, I may have gone with a different actor because of his reputation as hard edged characters. As I said before, it is as rewarding if not more rewarding to watch it more than once. It has many little ins and outs that make this film more complex than most.

Cole, the young child Dr.Malcolm is now set on helping has the same conditions as the child he previously could not help. Dr.Malcolm faces what seems to be a struggling relationship wit his wife due to his obsession of helping Cole. Cole is also facing a similar battle, not being able to communicate with his mother Lynn, who is very concerned for her son.Courage, fear, and the strength to over come seems to be the main themes during this movie. Granted ""The Sixth Sense"" does a great job of covering not just one, but a variety of major themes during the movie. Such themes can be viewed just about the whole movie as Cole faces his own fears, Lynn also overcomes her fears for her son. Similar to the ""The Haunting"" (1963) this movie deal with the dead and the unknown, and the characters have to adapt in order to overcome their fear in order to be free.The lighting through out this movie really sets the mood for the scene itself and what potentially could happen. The angles that the director chooses to shoot during this movie really adds to the drama through the film. The different angles that are shot add suspense to certain scenes and in some cases fear is intended for the viewers. Overall ""The Sixth Sense"" is good drama that really get your emotions going and makes you wonder about your own courage, fears, and what you would do to overcome them.",The Sixth Sense

Though it didn't have numerous action sequences, the plots many twists and occurrences were perfectly done (not dramatized and/or overly exaggerated.)The biggest twist in the plot (I'm not going to spoil it for those of you who haven't seen it) wasn't obvious at all, but supported by other details in the movie that led up to it. All in all, I loved this movie and could watch it over and over again without getting tired of it!!!",The Sixth Sense
1687,bacocbrother,Probably best scary movie of the nineties,8,14 August 2004,"The Sixth Sense is one of those films worth watching several times. It has a great unexpected twist and keeps you on the edge of your seat throughout the whole film. Bruce Willis, Haley Joel Osment, and Toni Collette all give great performances. The fact that Bruce was snubbed by the Academy for a nomination should be a crime. The entire movie is brilliant and should be put on many top movie lists and should probably be higher on the top 250. This is by far the best movie from this director who ended up making only disappointing films after it. This is a must see because of its great writing, directing, and acting. Plus the ending is so unexpected that you will fall over the first time. Highly recommended.",The Sixth Sense

Bruce Willis with his usual slightly not so witty detective feel threw me off the scent. To this day, I still remember: ""I see dead people...""",The Sixth Sense

The acting by both Bruce Willis & Haley Joel Osment was terrific. I think that Bruce really shows how well he can act in this movie. Too many of his films are box office smashes without showing off his acting chops. My husband & I both ""try to figure out"" movies. This one was well-written and well-acted, and we were both caught off guard late in the movie. (I won't spoil it - you really need to see it!) I've seen this movie classified as a horror movie, though I don't think that really applies. It is much more of a suspense/drama movie. I've seen other of M. Night Shyamalan's (with apologies for the likely misspelling!) work, but I think this is his best.Rent it/buy it/borrow it - but SEE it!",The Sixth Sense

How could he go so long without realising he was dead? No talking to people, not eating, etc. What a shame to have such an almost brilliant ending, but dumb. I give it a six because it was very entertaining. The kid was really good, Bruce was excellent, though he is a one or two role actor. I must say though I still get wound up by the major logic flaw I did not see it because the twist was so well covered up.

1692,IndustrialCocoon2020,The Beginning of the End (of good horror films),1,12 March 2005,"Thank you, M. Night, for beginning the trend of PG-13 horror flicks. You know what I mean, the movies that come out every quarter and are gonna be the ""hottest scare fest"" of the season. Of course, It'd be great if we could just leave out the part about this film and it's predecessors choosing to appeal to jumpy amphetamine-laced 13 year old girls that shriek hysterically whenever a loud noise plays on screen. It would be just peachy if the fact that ever since this film, the scare factor of most modern horror films makes Goosebumps look positively horrifying, could be ignored. Unfortunately, it can't. What we have here is a ""modern-horror classic"", and indeed, it has all the makings of one. It brought horror filmaking to a new level, the ""I wonder how many sixth graders will jump when we play that jump sound and something pops up on screen"". It brought the career of rising star ""I see dead people"" to astonishing heights (shudders). It also got studio executive interested in the horror genre again. Too bad the genre become so badly butchered that it's practically unrecognizable. So, on to the film. The story is about a young boy who can see dead people. It's also about his shrink, who is trying to help the boy get through his ""dillusions"". Of course, as we see right away, the kid really does see dead people, and what follows is the kid wandering around seeing dead people, and the shrink wondering why, until the ""unpredictably and surprising"" twist ending. Ah the twist ending, yet another technique in film that the Sixth Sense transformed from original to cliché. The pacing of the film is repetitive and dull, and the directors laziness when bringing ""scares"" to the screen is appalling. My score for this film, while abysmal, does not reflect it's production values. The acting, cinematography, and special effects are all top notch. So why such a low score? Well, put simply, this film was responsible for a crumbling away at a fantastic genre; a genre that was called ""horror"" for a reason: it's supposed to be scary.Enter my feelings on the entire ""PG-13"" genre of horror flicks. The rating limits the possibilities of the filmmaker so much, that fear can never incubate within the viewers mind. It takes disturbing images, characters, mood, and shock, to truly scare most viewers. Simply isolating the ""shock part"", and cutting out the rest may sell a lot of tickets to 13 year olds, but that doesn't convince me that these films are any good. I understand that, as a filmmaker and fan of the genre itself, I can be a little jaded when it comes to horror. Maybe the reason I thought ""Boogeyman"" sucked was because I'm immune to terror, and that movie really was scary. But for some reason, I doubt that. Good cinema, for me, is about pushing the envelope of human emotion. If it's a romantic comedy, and it's not funny or romantic, it's not a good romantic comedy. And if a horror film is not scary, it defies what the genre is supposed to be. Therefore, as a fan of horror, I am disappointed with this film and the trend of films it started.In one final note, I would just like to thank Asian cinema for not backing down. Films like Audition and Ju-On continue to push the envelope and create truly terrifying worlds for the viewer. And this is a warning to Sam Raimi. I loved the Evil Dead movies, but if you try to ruin another great Asian film by having it remade, you'll be hearing from me.",The Sixth Sense

With great anticipation, I recently watched a video tape of it and found myself as drawn into it as the first time.

Cole is played by Haley Joel Osmont and is experiencing visions that are worrying his mother Lynn Sear played by Toni Collette. Cole's visions are those of the dead who do not realize they are actually dead. There is ongoing conflict between if Cole is actually having these visions and if he is what is causing them. With Dr. Crowes passion for work, he and Cole develop a relationship. Crowe at first finds it hard to believe the problems that are affecting Cole, but then realizes there may be similarities between Cole and a former patient of Dr. Crowe's. As Cole opens up to Dr. Crowe and his mother about his visions they slowly start to realize that what he is seeing may be real. Cole has to convince his mother by questioning her about a dance recital she felt her mom did not attend and ultimately provides the answer of her question she would ask while alone at her mother's gravesite. Cole's gift was something that was to help those understand the reasoning of some deaths and to help the restless souls find peace and to give comfort to their loved ones that had unanswered questions. In the birthday party scene, Cole wanders upstairs after seeing a red ballon drift to the ceiling. Cole starts to hear the voices coming from behind the closet door and is stuck in shock. Two children then decide to play a trick on Cole and place him in the closet. Cole is then attacked by the dead character that was stating he ""did not steal the master's horse. In the scene the relevance of color used and camera angles contributed to the significance of the scene. At the point Cole's mother had taken extreme cautiousness in her son's claims of seeing and hearing things. The sound effects used to depict the undead before Cole's entrance into the closet, and the sounds used while in the closet made the scene that much more dramatic. The pain was so horrifying that the screams could be heard over the loud music of the party and attracted not only Cole's mother, but other party goers. The slow motion at the end of the scene where Ms. Sears is pulling Cole out of the closet gives the dramatic effect needed to show the seriousness of the scene and that Cole may actually be telling the truth.",The Sixth Sense

Most of the time the films I watch serve as two hour diversions, brief respites in the midst of often long, tiresome, and occasionally depressing (at least for me) days. THE SIXTH SENSE triumphantly resides in the former category. In both of my viewings from the opening confrontation in Malcolm and Anna's apartment to the pitch-perfect finale, I was inseparably wrapped up in the events on screen. Through flawless direction, disturbingly convincing performances, and a beautiful yet mysterious score, this movie managed to not only invest me in the action, but even went as far as to occasionally make me forget I was even watching a film; such an occurrence happened during the car scene between Cole and Lynn.I know that I haven't elaborated much on the details of the plot, or even on a few of the film's inconsistencies, but in my opinion the best way of viewing this film is to not know too much about it going in. Avoid message boards, FAQs, and even the original theatrical trailer as best as possible, all of which are laden full of spoiler-filled information that'll reduce the intrigue. That's not to say that knowing the plot beforehand, which is what happened to me, will prevent you from greatly enjoying the film, but it will lessen the feeling of discovery that can come from the experience.Watching this movie on New Year's Eve was a lot of fun last night, and right next to black eyed pea dip I'm definitely going to make it a New Year's tradition.10/10",The Sixth Sense

After the boy is able to help the ghosts he sees pass on it is revealed that the psychologist is also dead. The boy then helps that ghost move on as well. Nowadays when people talk about M. Night Shyamalan there is an air of disappointment that always seems to be present. His recent movies have not been received well, for good reason. But why aren't they good? The one consistency that appears throughout his movies is his style of storytelling. ""The Sixth Sense"" benefited greatly from his model, as it was his debut into the film industry and it might'v felt fresh as M. Night was rather unknown. Pinning ""The Sixth Sense"" as anything other than M. Night's first in a series of mediocre movies would be (in my opinion) dishonest. The only redeeming quality about this film is Haley Joel Osment's performance, and I would not accredit that to M. Night's directing skills considering his later works (""The Happening"", ""The Last Airbender""). Everything else about the movie is told in the M. Night style I have grown to resent.

1713,lizzardbreath,This movie is not a thriller,10,16 December 2005,"""The #1 Thriller Of All Time""Yeah, Right!(spoilers)""The #1 Thriller of all time!"" is how the movie, The Sixth Sense, is advertised. But is ""thriller"" the best way to describe this story? Certainly there are many shocking, startling scenes. However, the story seems to be more of a psychological journey, colored with melancholy and sadness than most thrillers. Granted, The Sixth Sense has many scenes that employ ""scary graphics"". But these graphics look like they were designed by a seven-year-old. And does the movie fit within the thriller genre when it does not have chase scenes? The closest scene would be Malcolm walking after Cole when he had missed an appointment! Not exactly startling or thrilling.Although we have had this movie for a couple of years, I had not watched it until October 29, 2005 because my little brother kept telling me how terrifying it was. I found it intriguing, but was surprised that it did not frighten me more. I even watched it again on Sunday the 30th so that I could go through and look for slip-ups on the whole ""Malcolm is a Ghost"" idea.The over-riding idea within this movie of Malcolm not knowing he is a ghost carried a solid emotional punch. I found myself afraid that Malcolm's wife, Anna, was cheating on him and no longer loved him. The director, M. Night Shymalyan, did an excellent job of masking what the truth was and because of this, when it all became clear at the end, it was even more tragic. Throughout the movie Malcolm was under the impression that his wife was leaving him, but in fact he was the one to have left her! He had displayed all of the symptoms of a ghost throughout the movie, but because he had been presented as a living therapist, him being a ghost was not evident. The clues were not something that the viewer would focus on until the end of the movie when Malcolm remembers what had happened the night that he was shot. I love the scene where he realizes that it was never his wife's fault that she was not talking to him, but that she was in fact still very devoted to him. She repeatedly watched the video of their wedding, and went back to the restaurant he had proposed to her in. It is a powerful scene when Malcolm comes to understand that the loneliness that he feels is about a hundred times worse for Anna because she cannot see, hear, or smell his presence any more. She just gets cold when he is angry.The graphics in this movie were simplistic and unimpressive. Scary scenes were often blurred and bloody wounds were lavishly covered in fake blood. For instance when Malcolm is shot, the camera zooms in on a clean bullet hole through the his shirt and then a growing blood stain on his back - not exactly high tech. It was evident that a hole punch was used for the shirt, with an extreme close-up to make it look bigger than it actually was, and then fake blood from a pump was used to make it look like progressive bleeding. In the scene where Vincent kills himself, they simply move him out of the range of the camera! All that is heard is a gunshot and icky, squishy sounds. And then there is the makeup used for each of the ghosts to show bruises and wounds that looked fake. When the back of the young boys head was blown off it looked like strawberry jelly slathered in his hair. And when the little girl ghost was throwing up it looked like oatmeal with yellow food coloring in it. The graphics seemed absurd and predictable to me and therefore, not very scary.Unlike most thrillers, this movie carries sweet over-tones. The child, Cole, who has the sixth sense, is successful at maintaining his innocence no matter how horrific the ghost scenes are. And when Cole finally tells his mother his big secret, that he sees dead people, it does not make her look at him any differently. She loves him just the same as she always has. Although I believe that the genre this movie was placed in was ill suited, it is still on my small list of favorite movies. It contains messages of love and the need to understand others within the context of their lives. Because of this, I will watch it over and over.",The Sixth Sense

The boy becomes very frightened each time he sees these spirits and requests help from a child psychologist. Malcom Crowe, the boys psychologist, receives an award and then on the same night is visited by an old patient of his who has the same issue as the boy and is very dissatisfied. After this experience, Malcom decides that he will try to help the boy. I really enjoyed the different parts of this movie, except the really scary ones of course. This movie was very suspenseful and always left me wondering what was going to happen next. The Sixth Sense was put together very well. The writer/director does a great job at sculpting the movie very carefully in order to get the viewer to feel every kind of emotion. However, I did not love it of course because it was creepy and involved a numerous amount of dead people.",The Sixth Sense
1718,ashleylovett-25842,"This is one of my favorite movies, I watched it as a child and re-watched it for a class and it is still as interesting and brilliant as before",10,10 December 2017,"** This will contain spoilers!** In the Sixth Sense, it starts out with a child psychiatrist that is confronted by a former patient. This patient says that Dr. Malcolm failed him. Then cuts to Dr. Malcolm watching a child. He believes that he was hired to help him. Throughout the whole move there are hints and a foreshadowing of then ending. The little boy, Cole, tells Dr. Malcolm that he sees dead people all the time. That they don't know they are dead, that they only see what they want to see. Which is what makes the ending so powerful After watching this film, you see there were so many things that could led you to the ending. Overall I think that the movie shows a lot about death and life. While Cole was living and seeing the dead, even as a scared little boy, took an opportunity to go alone to help a little girl that died and needed him. Just as Dr. Malcolm needs Cole, and didn't realize it as he felt Cole was the one needing saving. This is one of my favorite movies, I watched it as a child and re- watched it for a class and it is still as interesting and brilliant as before. The scenes, the casting, the music, everything in the film was brought together perfectly to become a powerful movie of its time.",The Sixth Sense
1719,bnjmn333,Great film.,10,17 June 2007,"Donnie Wahlberg and Haley Joel are playing the same character. The film moves from 1997 (scenes with the wife) to 1986 or 1987(scenes with young Vincent/Cole). Look at the clothes, hear the music, the references to Pedia Ease and the musical Cats!!! In the bathroom, Vincent tells the Dr. he has waited 10 years since he was treated by the Dr.! The gray hair is too obvious. But, the Vincent and Cole characters have the same ""sense"" as well as both say people see them as freaks. Also, both characters plead with Dr. Malcolm not to fail them. Just before Dr. is shot, he tells Vincent he wants a chance to help him, then he is given the opportunity after his death. Ultimately, he does help Cole/Vincent. Cole helps Dr. Malcolm say what needs to be said to his wife as well. With each script, M. has become less dense. I do not know if that is bad or good. But, I am a great fan of M.'s work. Sixth Sense is his richest screenplay and film.",The Sixth Sense
1720,gordon-69874,"Social Problems, Fear and Human Nature",8,14 March 2018,"The film The Sixth Sense (Shyamalan, 1999) is a story of Cole Sear (Haley Joel Osment), a young boy with a supernatural ability to see the dead. This ability, or sense, has been haunting him since birth causing him social insecurities to communicate with those around him for fear of being an outcast. Dr. Malcolm Crowe (Bruce Willis) is a psychologist trying to understand Cole situation and help him. The Sixth Sense (Shyamalan, 1999) confronts social problems of those who are deemed different from what society considers 'normal', encountering the fear of the unknown and truths of human nature set aside individual desires to help those in need.
 Multiple times in the film The Sixth Sense (Shyamalan, 1999) Cole is referred as a freak by the kids in his school. He is a child that keeps to himself and avoids talking with others about his experiences. He lives in a constant state of fear which can be identified through his body language. In the past Cole has tried to express what he is dealing but people become quick to judge him negatively. In one scene Cole tells Dr. Crowe about a picture he drew in school of a man killed by a screwdriver to the neck. The school had a meeting with his mother who cried over the event. Cole states ""I don't draw like that anymore...I draw people smiling, dogs running and rainbows"" (Shyamalan, 1999). This scene provides an example of how individuals on the surface present that everything is fine because that is what others want when in reality they may be struggling on the inside. 
 Dr. Crowe in The Sixth Sense (Shyamalan, 1999) struggles with the decision to continue to help Cole because of the amount of time needed to help him. While Dr. Crowe feels obligated to aid Cole, it is interfering with the time he could be spending with his wife. Dr. Crowe loves his wife but he also knows Cole needs him. This scene helps to understand the conflict some face when deciding what is more important, helping others or focusing on one's own needs
 This film uses two techniques that relate to the theme of fear and the unknown. One technique is motif of a room getting cold. When the presence of the dead are in the room the individual fells a sudden coldness and cold air can be seen from their breath. Another technique involve dark rooms, or the lack of sufficient lighting, where it is hard to make out what is truly there. Unable to clearly see our surrounding allows fear to sit in and imaginations to run wild. These techniques are used for the audience to experience the same sensations as the characters in the film. 
 A similar suspense film Shutter Island (2010) also has a main theme around social problems and how other in society are view that do not fit what is considered normal. The Sixth Sense (Shyamalan, 1999) leaves the audience considering the question of how far one is willing to understand and help someone else who may be in need.",The Sixth Sense
1721,hockeynomnom,All senses felt...,9,17 March 2018,"This film was a remarkable way to end the millennium and provided sight to what was on the horizon for director M. Night Shyamalan. As a fan of psychological horror films that provide an unforeseen twist at the end, The Sixth Sense provided all the feels that I look for in this type of script. The first 5 minutes or so of this movie gave a pivotal scene where Malcolm was wounded by a former psychologist patient that won't have much importance on the film until we're fast approaching the credits. Soon after Malcolm is shot we meet eight year old Cole who is played by Haley Joel Osment as a new patient to Dr. Malcolm Crowe we can tell Cole is different than other children his age. We see Cole walk fast through the streets of Philadelphia straight into a quiet church where Malcolm observes then follows Cole for their first scene together. At this time no one is imagining that we are seeing Bruce Willis as a ghost, but as a human having an introduction to a new patient. As we move further into the film we really start to see where the theme was headed not only for the film, but also a number of characters. In my opinion the theme was certainly showcasing unfinished business or righting a wrong. We can see that Malcolm really has remorse and heartache where he couldn't help save his former patient Vincent Gray and I felt that taking on new patient Cole was a way to heal that pain. Once Cole reveals that he can see the dead walking around not knowing they're dead, we start to see new images of characters in limbo with unfinished business where Cole can be the messenger if he has the courage.Once we see what Cole has the capability of, we start to see the heartache but also the gift where he can help the dead. Cole was able to help a little girl who ultimately was murdered by her mother through poisoning and was found out with Cole's assistance of delivering a VHS tape to the young girl's father. This scene was heartbreaking and really made you feel pain when it focused on the motif with the color red, but his scene was also very joyous when this woman was found out for an unexplained act. This scene showed me that Cole was a helper with his gift and we soon realized for the previous hour that he was also helping a ghost named Malcolm.I would recommend this film to anyone who enjoys psychological films with a major twist at the end such as another film by M. Night Shyamalan Unbreakable. In closing this film is still one of my favorites even after being released almost 19 years ago and I certainly hope they have a 20th anniversary showing at my local theater.",The Sixth Sense
1722,Caleb-Ross,it is a masterpiece,10,22 May 2018,Thats all.

1724,klopf123,I don't think I've seen that film but yea that happens to me,5,26 January 2006,So then I just felt like disclosing after a rather intense paranormal encounter that this does indeed happen to me. There is a parallel universe that your spirit can go to that is very much apparently simular to this world. I would imagine God runs one side and gods wife runs the other or in other words one is ying and one is yang. It is very difficult to know even which one you are in apparently. I cross over every once in a while out of my control entirely. It's a very difficult thing to understand even from my perspective and it appears to be sense orientated as Mr John from crossing over might have sight or sound or something he's a little elusive. I have touch for sure i know anyway. It's not all that useful to me and rather strange and a little scary for these ghosts can indeed hurt me if they want to but mostly these are just people meandering around and they have little motive to do to much harm. The other day a lady ghost I think that I have been sensing for some time rubbing paint on me pushing me once and waking me up in the morning the most vivid being me losing control of my mind and visualizing falling into the wall possibly upstairs and the wicca lady says that was possibly me reliving possibly her death then awaking and a spirit looking as a shadow running fast down stairs and being exited and rubbing while looking at me up and down my body. It wans't snowing and then I went up stairs and it was snowing hard. So it seems that she was exited about the snow and not too concerned with her death. Maybe she was old and just fell who knows.

1726,ohithastobeORIGINAL,*spoiler warning*,8,17 October 2018,"M. Night Shyamalan's The Sixth Sense is a chilling tale that will leave viewers on the edge of their seats up until the very end. The story mainly revolves around the ideas of the paranormal and supernatural. The movie opens with child psychologist Malcolm Crowe (Bruce Willis) and his wife Anna (Olivia Williams) going up to their bedroom, about to go to sleep. Upon entering the room, Malcolm finds an intruder, who is ex-patient Vincent Gray (Donnie Wahlberg), in his bathroom, holding a gun. Vincent is angry at Malcolm for not being able to help him when he was a child. Vincent shoots Malcolm, and then proceeds to shoot himself. The scene then cuts to Malcolm sitting on a bench outside a building looking through some papers from work. 9-year-old Cole Sear (Haley Joel Osment) walks out of a nearby building. When Cole sees Malcolm, he starts to run down the street, away from him. The development of the plot is not at all laggard. The story evolves mostly through dialogue and characters' actions, though there are some exceptions to this. In a scene in the middle of the movie, Cole is lying in a hospital bed, with Malcolm in a chair by his side. Cole is telling the psychologist his secrets, and says ""I see dead people."" Immediately after he says this, the camera cuts to look at Malcolm. Malcolm then asks Cole where he sees dead people. Cole responds with ""Walking around like regular people. They don't see each other. They only see what they want to see. They don't know they're dead."" M. Night Shyamalan uses suspense to keep viewers on edge. Throughout the movie, the characters, especially Cole, know more than the audience. 
The setting of the movie is not typical of horror movies. There is no gothic mansion or castle. The main setting of the movie is in Cole's house, or Malcom's house. The houses are small and modern, not something you would find scary. One of the movie's main themes is finding a purpose in life. After Malcolm strikes a discordant note in his relationship with his wife, he tries to drop Cole as a patient. Cole is upset with Malcolm for giving up on him, and he tries to convince Malcolm to stay. Malcolm realizes that Cole reminds him of Vincent Gray, and he realizes that the only way he can really be happy with himself is to help Cole. At the end of the movie, Cole says he found out a way that Malcolm can fix his relationship with his seemingly churlish wife. Cole tells him to talk to her while she is sleeping, so she no choice but to listen to him. Malcolm goes home to find Anna asleep on the sofa, watching videos of their wedding. He tries to talk to her, but she all she does is mutter, ""why did you leave me?"". Malcolm's wedding ring then falls from Anna's hand. The movie cuts to the beginning scene where Malcolm is shot, and then to the scene where Cole is describing ghosts to him. As Malcolm comes to this horrifying realization, he discovers that he fulfilled his goal in helping Cole, and is ready to move on. The Sixth Sense is a film that keeps the audience in touch with their emotions through its entirety, and highlights the importance of perseverance.",The Sixth Sense
1727,toontalk7,I could have made dead people...,8,25 February 2006,"Talk about spoilers--when I saw this movie, it was spoiled for me, and I could have committed murder--no jury would have convicted me! After learning there was a secret to the plot, I made a point of not reading any reviews, nor talking to anyone who had seen it. I finally got a chance to go, settled into my seat, and as the lights dimmed, excited for a good story, I barely noticed the two men who sat down behind me. I couldn't miss these two jack-asses a few moments later though, as the movie began and one of them said to the other, ""So when did you figure out that Bruce..."" and proceeded to discuss the secret of the movie...the whole theater almost saw dead people! The viewing was ruined for me (it will always be marred by the memory of two jerks with no movie-going manners who revealed the big secret, robbing me of the suspenseful movie-going experience...).Ever happen to you?",The Sixth Sense
