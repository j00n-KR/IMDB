0,SnoopyStyle,sci-fi premise,5,23 August 2021,"On an alien world, only the men are left. It's New World, 2257 A. D. Thoughts are broadcasted visually which is known as The Noise. Some are able to control it better than others. Women are not affected but all of the them were supposedly massacred by the native aliens called The Spackle. Davy (Nick Jonas) is the volatile son of Mayor Prentiss (Mads Mikkelsen). Aaron (David Oyelowo) is the fundamentalist preacher. Todd Hewitt (Tom Holland) is the youngest in the settlement. One day, he finds a survivor from a crashed spaceship. It's a girl, Viola (Daisy Ridley). His adoptive father Ben Moore (Demián Bichir) reveals that there is another settlement.This is the first book of a sci-fi series and directed by Doug Liman. There are issues with the premise being visually chaotic. Liman does the best he could. He's able to make a fine road chase movie but the premise is a real hinderance to the story telling. First of all, the story as told by Mayor Prentiss never made much sense. The older men would all know the truth and apparently, it's hard to hide their thoughts. If I could figure out that there is a secret within five minutes, how does a relatively smart boy not figure it out in almost twenty years? The initial premise makes no sense from multiple angles.Then there is Todd's relationship with Viola. It's initially funny that she demurs when he can't keep his thoughts secret from her. After a couple of times, she can't be doing that. She needs to change. She can ignore him to sarcastically making fun of him to whatever. She could have done more as a character. Everybody could have done more. The movie suggests that the Mayor has some kind of power of influence due to his Noise but it's never fully fleshed out. In the end, the movie starts with an intriguing premise. It has some flaws. Liman struggles to flesh it out. He's able to make a good chase movie but the substance of the central premise is never completely solved. I can imagine the books able to give the premise real density and any perceived flaws can be papered over in the books.",Chaos Walking
1,Prismark10,Chaos Walking,3,4 April 2021,"Chaos Walking demonstrates once again that Patrick Ness is still a novice when writing directly for the screen as he did for the Doctor Who spinoff Class.The film is based on Patrick Ness's YA novel. Directed by Doug Liman, it all comes across as a bland generic futuristic Dystopian movie. The surprises are obvious.Set in 2257 on a planet called New World colonized by settlers from Earth.Todd Hewitt (Tom Holland) is a teenager growing up in Prentisstown a small village run by Mayor Prentiss (Mads Mikkelsen.) This is a male dominated society as all the women were killed by the original inhabitants of the planet.The reason being that the men cannot always conceal their thoughts and the women could. So others can hear the thoughts of men in their heads which is regarded as noise.When a spaceship crashlands carrying Viola (Daisy Ridley) as the only survivor.Todd finds herself taking her to safety as Mayor Prentiss rounds up a posse are intent on killing her.The noise aspects to the movie is extremely irritating. It becomes a cumbersome concept.The villains are too obvious with Mads Mikkelsen being shifty. His son played by Nick Jonas annoying. The angry preacher (David Oyelowo) is just plain loopy.For a film that wants to take potshots at a patriarchal society. Ridley has nothing much to do here than get a device working so she can send a signal. The heroics are left to the males.",Chaos Walking
2,nogodnomasters,Control your noise,5,31 March 2021,"In 2257 there is a colony in New World. There is a village of all men who can read each other's thoughts. They have been out of contact for a long time. A scout ship crashes with Viola (Daisy Ridley ) being the sole survivor. Unlike men, women's thoughts can not be read, but they can see the thoughts of men. The Mayor (Mads Mikkelsen ) wants to do her harm. Viola takes off with Todd (Tom Holland ) to seek refuge in another village.I didn't like ""the noise"" gimmick. It made the film annoying to watch as we hear people talk while their thought is going at the same time as we watch thought-action inside the real world. As typical Daisy Ridley has very little personality.Guide: F-word. No sex or nudity.",Chaos Walking
3,paul_haakonsen,Have you met Todd Hewitt?...,6,19 May 2021,"Were I excited about this movie? Nah, hardly so. Why? Well, because it didn't exactly sound like all that much of an interesting storyline, given the movie's synopsis. But still, as I had the opportunity to sit down and watch the 2021 movie ""Chaos Walking"" from writers Patrick Ness and Christopher Ford, of course I did so. It was, after all, a movie that I hadn't already seen.And I will say that ""Chaos Walking"" is definitely a watchable movie. However, it just wasn't a particularly outstanding movie. It was, for me, a movie that was good enough for a single viewing, but it is hardly a movie that warrants more than just that one single viewing. Why? Because the storyline just doesn't have enough contents to it to sustain more than a single viewing.Sure, ""Chaos Walking"" had an interesting and good ensemble of actors and actresses, with the likes of Mads Mikkelsen, Tom Holland, Demián Bichir and Daisy Ridley. And yeah, they did portray their given characters quite well and did indeed add to the overall enjoyment of the movie. I must say, though, that the Aaron character was the type of character that you just can't help but loathe. Not that there was anything wrong with the actor David Oyelowo, not at all. Just the character itself. And I must say that I quickly grew tired of hearing Tom Holland repeating ""I am Todd Hewitt"" so many times throughout the course of the movie.Visually then ""Chaos Walking"" was good, it wasn't a movie that was overly much relying on special effects, but the special effects that were being used were good and added to the movie. It was definitely interesting with the etherealness haze that emanated from the men as their thoughts were projected. That was certainly something unique and unseen before.Once ""Chaos Walking"" came to an end, I have to admit that I was left with a feeling of 'seriously? Was that really it?'. Especially since the movie was close to two hours. While the movie was nicely paced, it just felt somewhat hollow and I feel a bit bereft of what could potentially had been a much grander movie experience.Now, I am sure that a movie like ""Chaos Walking"", from director Doug Liman, will find an audience out there that thoroughly enjoys it, of that I am quite sure. For me, though, ""Chaos Walking"" provided me with adequate and above average entertainment.My rating of ""Chaos Walking"" - despite of its somewhat stupid title - lands on a six out of ten stars. Sure, ""Chaos Walking"" is worth a watch. Just don't expect to be blown away by an over-the-top cinematic experience.",Chaos Walking
4,CinemaSerf,Harmless escapism that could have been better..,6,17 September 2021,"First question - seeing as this all takes place on an unknown planet, why does Tom Holland have to speak with an American accent? Neither co-stars Daisy Ridley nor Mads Mikkelsen bother. Anyway, the fact that that bothered me at all might indicate that I was less than impressed with this big budget sci-fi story. Mayor ""Prentiss"" (Mikkelsen) runs his town with a rod of iron, aided by his son ""Davy"" (Nick Jonas). When a ship crashes and young ""Todd"" (Holland) discovers a survivor ""Viola"" (Ridley) - the only female he (or just about everyone else) has ever seen, the two embark on a series of escapades - hotly pursued by mad Mads - to find her spaceship. What's quirky about the plot is that everyone can see and hear everyone else's thoughts (""The Noise"") - they swirl around outside of a person's head like lots of little halos, and frequently form actual images that can betray even the most intimate or deeply held secrets. Power is exercised by those who can best manage that ""Noise"" and exploit it of others. Money has undoubtedly been spent here - the credit roller indicates a cast of thousands involved in what is a very high end production, and both Holland (and his bum - albeit very very briefly), Ridley and Mikkelsen do try hard and engagingly, to be fair, to help to rescue the film from the doldrums of plot mediocrity, but sadly the story needed much more substance. The idea is sound, and the cast could certainly have done more had the writing just given them a little more to work with and had the visual effects taken slightly more of a back seat. It does have moments of excitement - a trip down some rapids on an upturned boat - but these are, frankly, few and far between. It's fine - and on a big screen might look better (I am not certain it got a cinema release anywhere?) but as it is, it's a film that nobody, including those acting in it, are likely to remember in six months.",Chaos Walking
5,deloudelouvain,Much better than those negative reviews say.,7,6 July 2021,I'm flabbergasted by the extremely negative reviews for Chaos Walking. That you don't find it a masterpiece I can get but that you were not even remotely entertained by this movie remains a mystery to me. I was actually enjoying this quite refreshing story. It's fantasy and so I don't expect true or plausible stories. The acting wasn't bad at all and that from the entire cast so there again I don't know what's wrong with those eternal unsatisfied reviewers. If you're not too picky and like a fantasy story that has not been done before Chaos Walking is definitely worth a watch.,Chaos Walking
6,FeastMode,"cool premise, poor execution",5,14 March 2021,"This movie was okay. it had some enjoyment, some cool ideas, and some good laughs. but it was poorly-made overall. too many subplots that lead nowhere. paper-thin characters. a bland story, bland action. and really nothing special about it. (1 viewing, 3/12/2021)",Chaos Walking
7,Cineanalyst,Empty Vessels Make the Most Noise,3,2 June 2021,"Another fortune wasted on young adult fiction--an utterly formulaic and vacuous genre. This one, ""Chaos Walking,"" has the laughable gimmick of displaying thought bubbles for half its characters. Well, more than half given that the Western-knockoff town had all its Sphinx-like females murdered--leaving it with only its lucid males. See, men's thoughts are seen and heard, which they call ""noise,"" and women's thoughts aren't, because... who knows; it's stupid. It feels like I was suckered into seeing the non-comedic version of ""What Men Want"" (2019), the gender-reversal remake of ""What Women Want"" (2000). It's laughable because there isn't a demonstrably intelligent thought throughout the entire pitiful excuse of a movie. It's a standard and superficial quest narrative, and the twenty-something leads are written as adolescents. One might think some clever film-within-film reflexivity could be made of character thoughts and dreams being projected visually, but it's exploited inside the narrative the same way as without: as a trick or, worse, a plot device.As in most of these juvenile dystopian romances, the boy and girl are from different worlds in one sense or another, which in this sci-fi, planet-hoping version is quite literally the case. In other versions, it tends to be cross-class ones from obvious caste systems, or they may be different species, or one's a robot and the other is human, or some other goofy Romeo-and-Juliet type rip-off of kiddies rebelling against their elders. Again, as usual, the girl is consequently initially unsure whether the boy is out to harm or help her. Gee, where have we seen that before except for in The Hunger Games series, the Twilight series, the Divergent series, probably the Maze Runner one, too, which I haven't seen, but I assume so... ""Warm Bodies"" (2013), ""The 5th Wave"" (2016), ""Alita: Battle Angel"" (2019), etc.Unfortunately, this childish slop is in vogue these days and so attracts some big-name actors hoping for a franchise. This one has the kid from Star Wars and the other kid from Spiderman, and the likes of Mads Mikkelsen (recently of ""Another Round"" (2020)), Cynthia Erivo (""Harriet"" (2019)) and David Oyelowo (going from playing MLK in ""Selma"" (2014) to this god-awful garbage) are entirely wasted. Fortunately, the production was so tortuous and it was such a box-office bomb upon release that it likely won't waste any more of anyone's time.What's also amusing is that Charlie Kaufman wrote a draft for this, but left production early in the process only to go onto make a cleverly mature movie, ""I'm Thinking of Ending Things"" (2020), where characters' thoughts are also heard and seen. Not in a stupid synesthesia manner as in this one, though, but in a cinematically and novelistically reflexive and thoughtful manner. ""Chaos Walking,"" on the other hand, is only worth watching if you're curious what it looks like when $100 million is spent on brain farts.",Chaos Walking
8,westsideschl,Gawd!!,1,11 June 2021,"Ever have left over food & just tossed it all together to see what comes out?1. We have this CGI created bluish wispy stuff around peoples' heads that is suppose to be their thoughts being seen. Oh, and others can read those thoughts. Oh, but can't do it with females (more on that later).2. It's the year 2257 & people (humans) still dress & talk perfect English like 19th & 20th century wild west Americans. Hint: Saves money on props, writing, & acting (really bad), i.e. Very low budget film.3. We're on an alien planet (we are the aliens) which just so happens to look (with O2 just perfect for us) just like Earth. Except we get a couple of scenes of slightly large bugs, and only one scene of the planet's inhabitant that has a head (but no mouth, ears, eyes, etc), two legs, one & a half arms. Note: Another cheap sci-fi hook of a person in a costume. For some unexplained reason this planet's inhabitants chose to kill off the invading humans's females only. How, why? Who knows.4. Brief scenes of the usual laser weapons looking cartoonish (from grade school level drawings). Usual very large aerodynamic spaceship (not needed in vacuum of space) that in some mysterious way just hovers in the air. Usual ancient century old crashed spaceship that still powers up (another borrowed seen-before sci-fi hook).5. What's a movie without a romance hook, and who better to get the paying female demographic than Nick Jonas.",Chaos Walking
9,The-Sarkologist,Why All the Hate?,8,7 March 2021,"From the trailers this film looked pretty good, but upon watching it the film turned out to be pretty good in a much different way. At first it seems to be about a film where all of the women on the planet have died while the men have developed telepathic adbilities, however once you get to the middle of the film you suddenly realise that there is actually much more to the story than meets the eye. For instance, they suggest that the reason all of the women were killed was because of an alien race on the planet, but that sort of turns out not to be the case.The film is about this girl who survives this pod that lands on the planet and she has lost contact with the colony ship that is orbiting it. The suggestion is that if she doesn't contact them, then they will leave and go and look for another planet. Another thing about this ship is that it is a generation ship, meaning that she was born, and grew up, on the ship.This film, and in turn the book, deals with some quite important issues, and it is quite ironic that the film was released this week with all the stuff going on in the Australian Parliament. One thing that the film touches upon, as opposed to really exploring, is the idea of colonialism, and how the colonists respond to the inhabitants of this world. In fact, it is interesting how the protagonist, Todd, is convinced that the inhabitants are actually bad, and because he knows no difference, then he doesn't question it.In fact, the film is set initially in a small colonial town, and all he knows is what he is told. In fact, later in the film it is revealed that he thought that this town was the only town in existence on the planet, namely because nobody actually told him otherwise. Of course, there is also the fact that he has never seen a women, with the exception of Viola.I notice that a lot of people really didn't like this film, and in a way it sort of doesn't surprise me because, well, it is pretty confronting in parts, especially when it comes to the idea of gender relations. I don't want to say too much because it will give away the plot, however, I certainly did appreciate the issues that were explored. Okay, I sort of could see the twist, and it was fairly predictable, however, the concepts that this film explores are concepts that we really can't let go away.",Chaos Walking
10,Thanos_Alfie,Good enough...,6,13 April 2021,"""Chaos Walking"" is an Adventure - Fantasy movie in which we watch a young man helping a mysterious young girl who crashed on his planet. There all the thoughts of men are called 'Noise' because they are presented above their heads and can be heard from everyone.I found this movie very interesting because it had a very different and new plot, something that I had not watched before. The interpretations of both Tom Holland who played as Todd and Daisy Ridley who played as Viola were very good and the combination of both worked very well. The direction which was made by Doug Liman, it was very good and he did an excellent job on how he presented both his main characters and the plot, something that made more clear a lot of things that could confuse the audience. To sum up, I have to say that ""Chaos Walking"" is an interesting movie and I advise you not to hear the critics and just watch it because I am sure you will enjoy it.",Chaos Walking
11,cruise01,Missed opportunity of a sci fi thriller but decent cast and concept.,6,5 March 2021,3 out of 5 stars.Chaos Walking is a fair science fiction adventure film based on a young adult novel. Taking place in a future on a new world where mans thoughts are projected and called the noise. And only man are inhabiting in a colony while all the woman have died. Todd (Tom Holland) find a crashed ship with only one survivor Viola (Daisy Ridley) which the noise does not affect her. While Todds colony lead by Mayor (Mads Mikkelsen) and his group of men are on the hunt for Viola. Which Todd helps her escape and trying to find a way to signal her ship in space.Decent concept and plot about the noise affecting man. Which there thoughts projects. No secrets or thoughts are kept. Unless they are trained to clear there minds. While some are religious maniacs like Preacher (David Oyelowo). They are all living on an estranged planet which has humanoid aliens. New species.The script and direction really did not go further into the plots potential. The direction and script spends majority of the time with Todd and Viola walking through the forest. Todd trying to hide his feelings and thoughts about Viola. While Mayor and his people are after them. Even during the climax encounter with Mayor and the two leads. Not to give away spoilers. The exposition does not show about what else happened to the rest of the bad guys or Davy (Nick Jonas) who is mayors son and also accompanying Mayor during the hunt. Not sure if they are saving the side characters for future sequels which may or may not happen. Some of these characters are underwritten.Tom Holland and Daisy Ridley did good with there characters. Mads Mikkelsen was good as the villain. Demian Birchir and Nick Jonas were underwritten. Along with Cynthia Erivo.The visual effects. Production settings and music score were all decent. It has a few decent action sequences that is very few in between. And an emotional scene that may hit a certain audiences.It is one sci fi franchise that does have a weak start. It was kind of boring and dull at times. But has an interesting premise.,Chaos Walking
12,eddie_baggins,A bland high concept sci-fi that wastes a lot of talent,4,14 March 2021,"I'm fairly certain this is the only time we will see Rey, Peter Parker, Martin Luther King and Hannibal Lector in the same movie, so if there's nothing else, Doug Liman's long delayed Sci-Fi at least provides us as viewers that opportunity to see some of cinemas most iconic characters (both real and conjured up) together for one big merry adventure.Filmed way back in 2017 and a victim of some clear struggles in the editing suite/studio boardrooms, Liman's adaptation of Patrick Ness's extremely popular book at points appeared to be unlikely to ever enter existence but after re-shoots in 2019 (with help from Evil Dead director Fede Alvarez) and a global pandemic to contend with, the mid-budget offering has finally seen the light of day.Considering the traumas of bringing this film to life, Chaos Walking could've been an absolute dumpster fire of a film and Liman has had history in the past of delivering highs such as The Bourne Identity and Edge of Tomorrow and forgettable outings like the recent Locked Down or Jumper, with Chaos Walking not unwatchable by any means but also not a film that deserved over four years of attention given to it just to end up like this.The most obvious trouble the film has is in dealing with the central concept of a future planet where men's thoughts are exposed through an odd occurrence known as ""the noise"", an issue that has caused the female population of the planet to become extinct and males on edge at every moment as they try to control their inward thoughts and not let others into their most intimate and personal thinking.On page this idea may've been a lot easier to imagine or conjure up but in a film, poor old Tom Holland as the main focus Todd (a name you will hear pronounced more than you will care to hear) and a rather stagnant Daisy Ridley as Todd's new friend/love interest Viola struggle to get things happening around a concept that actually is more annoying than it should be when trying to enjoy a film and one that has a lot of ideas but none that really stick or are allowed to breath in a rather generic out couple on the run tale.None of the energy or spectacle that Liman bought to his key films like the aforementioned Bourne Identity or Edge of Tomorrow is present in Chaos Walking either which is a big missing element of the film.Exploring Todd's world that Viola has found herself crashed landed on should be thrilling and full of adventure and filled with heart in mouth moments but mostly you're just feeling sorry for the actors of this calibre, that includes a you guessed it villainous role for Mads Mikkelsen and a fairly embarrassing batch of roles for the likes of Demián Bichir and David Oyelowo (ranting and raving his way through his screen-time) getting stuck with such dry and uninspired material that should've been anything but.Final Say -Unfortunately not worth the wait and pain of the troubles that followed its creation, Chaos Walking is a mostly poor attempt at creating a new Sci-Fi world for cinema-goers to explore and a waste of a large collection of talented performers.2 antennas out of 5",Chaos Walking
13,Tweetienator,A Rather Bad One,4,11 June 2021,"I don't know the books so I won't judge them but the movie, well, the initial idea is interesting but that's already the only one good thing. I do not like the cinematography nor the settings and the main plot, well, not interesting at all, if you take the ""mind-talk"" idea away.

Not recommended. Exact rate: 3.5.",Chaos Walking
14,DarkVulcan29,Daisy Ridley and Tom Holland just didn't click,4,13 March 2021,"The premise has promise, men live on a planet where there thoughts was a reason to see this.At times the setting feels like a Planet of the Apes likeness to it. But has it went on the film became less interesting. I felt this movie was poorly put together, and it shows cause there where so many re shoots and you kind of see it. Daisy Ridley and Tom Holland no doubt are talented actors, but the chemistry is not there, feeling like there are trying to force it down our throats.
But them together on film just didn't work at all. The movie has plot points that just don't anything with them, and go nowhere.Nick Jonas is in the movie, but very little is done with his character. Now Mads Mikkelsen has the main bad guy is the only that makes this memorable, cause he just comes together when he's on screen.

15,stevendbeard,Feelings Are Fully On Display,8,6 March 2021,"I saw ""Chaos Walking"", starring Tom Holland-the Spider_Man movies, The Lost City of Z; Daisy Ridley-the Star Wars movies, Murder on the Orient Express_2017; David Oyelowo-the Cloverfield Paradox, Jack Reacher and Mads Mikkelsen-Rogue One:A Star Wars Story, Doctor Strange.
This movie is based on a trilogy of books written by Patrick Ness, so I'm guessing that there will be a trilogy of movies-if this one does good at the box office. The Chaos book this movie is based on is called, 'The Knife of Never Letting Go'-and Tom, as well as almost everyone else, carries a knife. The story takes place about 200 years into the future where a colony of people from earth have homesteaded a new planet. Tom is a farm boy that lost his mother when he was just a baby when all the women were killed by the native population. Mads is the mayor of their colony and David is the preacher. Daisy plays the only survivor of a shuttle that crash lands nearby. Tom discovers her and is shocked-remember, he has never seen a girl before-and she tells him that she is from an orbiting space ship that was sent to check on the colony. All the men of the colony-including Tom-have developed what they call, 'The Noise'. It's the ability to see and hear other men's thoughts-the women didn't have it, at least not before they were killed-and the effects showing their thoughts is pretty imaginative. Daisy is suddenly very popular; some people want to befriend her while others want to kill her-and it's hard to hide your feelings when they are fully on display, right above your head. That's where the title Chaos Walking comes from. Tom decides to try to save her from everyone and in the process, discovers secrets that have been hidden from him for years.
It's rated ""PG-13"" for violence, language and some partial nudity-Tom's backside-and has a running time of 1 hour & 49 minutes.

June), the Preacher's perfidy in drowning Winston is soon repaid by Viola's Act of Immolation (even if there's no evidence that she subsequently chows down on shank of p;arson). CHAOS WALKING is NOT anyone's idea of A QUIET PLACE. Noise pollution is the order of the day, even with the work stoppage on the Monorail (due to an apparent slave revolt in the iron mines, steel mills, rock quarries, cement plants, machine shops and power utilities needed to erect the scores of transportation towers pictured as already having been erected by the First Wave).

When Daisy Ridley crash lands there and you can't hear her thoughts, the pair are pursued by brutal village chief Mads Mikkelsen.Heavily criticised upon release, this is a perfectly fun sci-fi idea which is adequately delivered, but no where near as badly as has been suggested with some fine sets and action scenes although the key idea about hearing each other's thoughts is not really explored at all. It is essentially a chase movie aimed at a young adult audience and might have worked better if it had been a bit tougher.

The story revolves around a colony on a distant planet two hundred years in the future. The viewers follow Todd Hewitt, a teenager working on a farm in Prentisstown. He believes that all women of the colony have been annihilated by a species known as Spackles. The surviving men experience a phenomenon known as the Noise: they can hear the thoughts of everyone around them. One day, a spaceship crashes next to Todd Hewitt's farm. Its only survivor is a mysterious female named Viola who doesn't have the Noise. While megalomaniac Mayor Prentiss and insane preacher Aaron want to catch and harm Viola, Todd Hewitt falls in love with her and decides to save her. The young couple goes on an epic journey that will help them understand their past, present and future.This film convinces on numerous levels. First of all, the locations are mostly intriguing and well-chosen, finding a good balance between futuristic and conservative environments. The special effects are immersive, both on the visual and especially on the auditory side. The actresses and actors are mostly convincing, especially the villains portrayed by a gritty Mads Mikkelsen and a psychopathic David Oyelowo. The movie has fluid pace and a perfect length just above an hour and a half.There are also a few flaws that need to be pointed out. The plot is overall quite predictable and seems like a mixture of multiple dystopian science-fiction novels and movies. Some side characters are poorly developed, such as the farmers Todd Hewitt grew up with or the intriguing character of the priest. The weakest actor in this film is lead actor Tom Holland. He is lacking charisma and seems to be quite exchangeable.At the end of the day, Chaos Walking is an entertaining dystopian science-fiction movie for genre fans as well as teenage and young adult audiences. The movie has received negative reviews from fans of the novel series which can be observed in most film adaptations of literary works. Once you ignore those who can never be pleased, you will realize that this is a decent movie but lacking creativity to truly leave a mark.",Chaos Walking

25,aidanratesmovies,Among the biggest box office bombs ever made,2,2 August 2021,"Messy, bland, and forgettable- Chaos Walking does little to nothing with it's all star cast and makes the film feel like a teen soap opera on a blockbuster budget rather than contributing anything new or significant to the sci-fi world. None of the actors in the film are very good throughout the film to be honest, Ridley and Holland have absolutely no chemistry together and it's quite painful to watch their wooden performances collide on screen at times. Both actors try, but there is no doubt they the films dialogue is at times so ridiculous even they can't take it seriously. The story is also a complete mess, the film has no idea what it wants to do. The film feels like two different films in one, reshot partially to make it conceivable but still making it quite hard to watch. The film is incredibly awkward at times, it has some entertaining moments, but the films concept seems too ridiculous the way it was translated to the screen, and it's quite hard to take seriously as an audience member- let alone filming it. There is some cool imagery throughout, but the CGI of the 'noise' is incredibly unappealing to look at- and honestly made me realize the type of film I was bound to sit through from the very beginning. In the end, Chaos Walking is not the worst sci-fi flick I've seen- but made with very incapable talent and translated to the screen as poorly as possible. It's production issues show, and it's lack of enjoyment makes it feel dull and lifeless- which is never a good sign when trying to create a new world.My Rating: 2/10.",Chaos Walking

Anticlimactic Ending
Antagonists that need more explainingReview:A movie like this showed promise for a landscape of our heroes facing this alien world and the elements that it brought. Surprisingly, the movie accomplishes this well for me, using filters, lenses, and angles to really bring the western/new frontier horizon to life. This film pulled me into the science fiction feel, and yet kept it on the pulse of reality at the same time and veering from the fantasy, which works given the theme of the movie. Within this blended world, the acting to bring the frontier dwelling inhabitants of the new world is not too bad either. Holland has taken a step from the hero regime and plays the cynical teen with a lot of questions and emotional conflictions and does it quite well. He sells the mood well and his portrayal evolves alongside his character as the movie progresses and again make a believable performance. Former Jedi Daisy Ridley, has had a bit of a change too, dropping the super powers of Star Wars for one of strategy, smarts, and determination that was quite enjoyable. Like Holland, she surprises me with how much the character seems natural to her, vulnerable beneath her strength and cockiness, she worked well with Holland to make a fun duo to follow. As for Demian Bichir, a character with pizazz and the rock foundation for Holland's character, the main weakness was him not having more screen time to develop and show off his skills, but did well to chop up the slow opening. And of course having a cute dog throughout the film is always a plus for this reviewer to add some suspense, some adorable tricks, and in this film another dynamic to explore.
But outside of acting and setting, the story itself is better, albeit not as bizarre, than I expected from the trailers. The gimmick of the Noise is a centerpiece of this film, a concept that was consistent, symbolic, and yet diverse all in the same movie which is impressive for me. As the synopsis says, men have been afflicted with a new ability to express their thoughts, and various settlements have risen around handling the Noise and the different approaches they see. While each settlement has many guys with the generic power of projecting their thoughts, there are a few players that have higher functions that sort of get used later on in the movie. The gimmick works though and the writers/directors were able to build a lot of entertainment aspects from comedy to ""action"". For this reviewer, the comedy was the better angle, with the writing and delivery perfect many times to bring a good laugh that I did not see coming. Todd (Holland's) thoughts are hilarious and relatable, with his mind arguing with itself as it tries to censor his thoughts from those around him and his responses when he fails. And with his unique ability, the comedy takes new forms for some good fake outs that once revealed had me and the audience laughing out loud. As such, the movie gets points for establishing the rules and playing by those rules that they spent the first third of the movie world building with, even when a few wild cards get thrown in. This is not always the case, as movies often take shortcuts or exceptions to allow for character development, but in this movie there was no compromise as the evolution of the group starts to pick up. I can't say much to not ruin, but when the big hits happen, the movie manages to push the characters without going down the cheesy avenue we've seen in a lot of films, though I was not a fan of the means to evolve them.However, the curse of the movie still falls on this film and a few of these points were not for me in this film. Without reading the books, one of the things I did not like was the attitude of the character at the beginning, or more so the focus of the attitude of the main character. The loose cannon, chip on his shoulder attitude was annoying and felt very teenage drama, and while fitting there were few characters to help balance that sour attitude out. That was a minor flaw for me, but I felt it magnified by the slow pace of the movie at the beginning as we waited for the adventure to begin. These two components danced a slow waltz that was trying to establish the world, but only delayed the adventure without the bite they were trying for. In addition, the voice in the head gimmick at the beginning started to annoy me in the first settlement, the repetition words, the pointless thinking for communication banter, and the aimless wandering around the contained setting did not help things.
Once the adventure starts, these limitations start to smooth out, but one thing that was disappointing was the aliens that were talked about for so long. Chaos Walking teases plenty of local fauna dwelling in the forest setting, but they do little in the movie and these supposed obstacles remain very lacking in the backgrounds for most scenes. Even when the main aliens hit, the scene is over before it begins, meaning lots of unanswered questions and missed potential for me, but perhaps to be explained in future installments. In addition, the presentation of the movie feels incomplete, gaps of the motivation, story, and interactions seeming to be missing during the presentation. Catching a comment from another member who had read the books stating they left much out of the movie, especially the inner mindsets which for a movie about thoughts leaking out for people to hear is kind of important. The antagonists in particular feel incomplete, and perhaps were the biggest limitations of these cuts. Just enough details to get the gist, there were several bands of the first settlement set up to be alpha hunters, but fell short in the grand scheme of things. This really reared its head near the end of the movie, where the big rush to accomplish Viola's goal felt very simplistic, weak, and though justice filled, was not the epic conclusion I expected. Oh well, it at least kept to its physics so I'll take it to some degree.The VERDICT:Chaos Walking was not as complex or bizarre as I had thought, but it does have fun moments and some quirks that make it a good science fiction movie. It plays well by its rules and establishes a good frontier for the new development setting. I felt it uses the gimmick of the noise quite well, and managed to give it diversity without breaking the mold and expand it to various facets of entertainment. And I liked the character development and the acting for the main characters evolving to bring those changes out. Yet, the movie has some flaws for me that needed to be ironed out to help make it better. The opening takes a little time to get off and could have used either more explanation or getting to the adventure sooner to help smooth out the annoying parts for me. In addition, the movie's gaps in explanations for the alien fauna, the potentially complicated characters, and maybe a little more into the minds of our heroes would have been greatly appreciated to tighten up the suspense of this film and help add layers to these characters. Still, for the target audience of teens and young adults who like the books/drama (and are not purists), this film works for fun entertainment value and set of laughs for this weekend. Worth the trip to theater? As a group yes, but otherwise, this film is probably best experienced at home given not much theater effects presented that a large screen makes the difference.My Scores are:Adventure/Sci-Fi: 6.5

27,rannynm,"Demonstrates bravery at every corner, in its intricate and complex plot",9,11 March 2021,"Chaos Walking is an amazing film that demonstrates bravery at every corner, has a very intricate and complex plot, and has subtle but amazing dialogue!The storyline follows a boy, Todd Hewitt (Tom Holland) who is about to become a man. In his world, he has been brought up to believe that all the women have been killed by the Spackle and all the men are affected by ""the Noise"" - a force that puts all their thoughts on display. One day, Todd stumbles upon a spaceship that crashed into his village, believing there are no survivors. Little does he know there is one survivor - Viola (Daisy Ridley). Seeing that she does not have the Noise, he tries to protect her, but he isn't the only one that discovers her.One of the best parts of this film is the graphics. From a tree to a mountain, everything looks so vivid and real. Because this story takes place in a dystopian society, the setting is something imagined to be ""foggy."" The sets are magnificent and provide a background for every scene exceptionally well. As for talent performances, both Daisy Ridley and Tom Holland are marvelous. Tom's brave face really sold me on his character Todd. With Daisy, her charming smile and presence shows how empathetic, sad, happy and a sometimes flirty she is.This film demonstrates the true meaning of bravery and what one sometimes goes through in order to be called brave. Although this movie is rated PG-13, it really pushes the rating to its limits. There are frequent uses mild profanity, which are used aggressively and often as name-calling. There is also quite some bad behavior, such as killing animals and there are scenes with violent images, of shooting and stabbing, although nothing is too graphic.I give Chaos Walking 4.5 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 12 to 18, plus adults.

Chaos Walking is filled with terrific actors and actresses that are in an intriguing world, but has a terrible script. The story they have is so compelling, yet they struggled with building it. I feel like I didn't understand many plot points. I loved the concept with the men having their thoughts out in the open. There were even funny parts that I couldn't stop laughing at. Also, I wanted to see more romance between the leads. Their chemistry was great. And I wanted to see more of Nick Jonas and the various other characters, but they kept it very limited. Plus, I wanted more action and emotions.
Even though this movie wasn't the best, Tom Holland really surprised me! I couldn't believe how talented he was in this.
Overall, this movie could've been as great as the Fifth Wave.",Chaos Walking
31,abisio,Great potential,8,7 March 2021,"In distant future and planet; a group of Earth settlers try survive on a town were women had been killed in a war about 20 years ago. The planet has some effect with male and all they though are reflected in images and sounds; they called it THE NOISE.
A new arriving group had a catastrophic landing and only one women survive. The town mayor get crazy but a young boy (who never saw a woman in his life) fight to protect it. A persecution on the wild ensures.
It is basically a Western (in far away planets). Locals are violent, run in horses and there are ""Indians""; basically the natives not human at all.
For most of the part; Tom Holland the ""young Spider Man""; with his inability to hide his immature and insecure thoughts made this look like a comedy. As the movie advances and secrets are reveled; things get more dramatic.
The story is interesting but the movie ends leaving us waiting for more. This really looks like the first chapter of a saga or perhaps a pilot for a series.
Tom Holland is pure fun; he is like his Spider Man character without the suit. Mads Mikkelsen as a bad guy is charismatic and believable. Daisy Ridley only adds her cold beauty and little else. I did not like in Star Wars; and still do not like her acting here.
Contrary to the apparently big budget; there are no spectacular special FX aside from THE NOISE and the resolution could have been a better writing. There two many incomplete situations; like the women town; the Native Alien and the settlers story itself which is mentioned but looks more like a lie; thus a follow up could be welcome.

Chaos Walking is mostly running around in the bush with poor dialogue plus irritating noise and monotonous visuals. Only the last half an hour is different with some entertaining action. But considering that about S125 million dollars was spent on producing this charade, it is wasted expenditure alright. At this rate no more movies will be produced in the near future.Three stars are mainly given for Daisy Ridley, from keeping us falling asleep of boredom.",Chaos Walking

34,kjproulx,A Great Concept with Very Little Payoff,5,28 April 2021,"This is a film that was likely doomed from the start, but nobody knew that. After years and years of delays due to reshoots, Chaos Walking is finally available on-demand. More than anything, it ended up being a very frustrating watch for me, simply because the entire film was a cool concept, but it never ran anywhere with it. With a cast as good as this and a concept this inventive, I expected much, much more. Here are my thoughts on Chaos Walking.On a planet where the only human survivors are men, with not a single woman in sight, these people must deal with the fact that this planet has given them what they refer to as ""noise."" This in turn puts the mind of every single man on display. Every one of their thoughts is heard out loud unless they're able to suppress it. As Todd is going about his day, he stumbles across Viola, a woman who is the only survivor of a ship that has crashed on this planet. Since he knows his way around, she uses his thoughts as a map/guide to find her way around. This set-up was great, and the film's idea hooked me from the start, but it's almost as if the second half of the film didn't know where to go.Tom Holland and Daisy Ridley both deliver solid performances here and I enjoyed their early comradery. They were the glue that held the movie together overall but with supporting performances by David Oyelowo, Mads Mikkelsen, and a couple of others that I won't ruin in this review, it should have been so much better. By the time the third act started, I began to wonder where the plot was really going. By the end of the film, I simply didn't care about any of the consequences, due to the fact that it goes in a very generic and simple direction.I honestly don't know what happened here in terms of writing either. I admit that I haven't read the novel that this film is based on, but this is the prime example of why certain films need to be adapted in certain ways. Creative liberties need to be taken in order to fit the narrative of a movie and I don't believe that happened in the right ways here. With the talents of both Patrick Ness and Christopher Ford penning the screenplay, both of which have multiple projects I have loved in the past (A Monster Calls, Cop Car), I just found myself wondering if they had too much interference when writing. There are so many things that went wrong during the production of this film, which is too bad because it had a lot of promise.Overall, I'm very disappointed, to say the least. I was very much looking forward to this film, not just because of who was involved, but because I really liked the idea as well. The cast, the direction by Doug Liman, and the overall concept all worked very well for me, but I never connected with anyone and the movie felt empty by the end. This is just another film that has a lot of build-up to nothing and probably won't ever see a sequel either. I wish this story had a better film to go along with it. It's not that it's a terrible movie, in fact, I thought most of it was okay, but the second half of the movie just didn't explore enough. Chaos Walking is now available on-demand.",Chaos Walking
35,AhmedSpielberg99,Chaos!,3,3 April 2021,"Taking such a stupendous premise and whittling it down to nothing more than an Avatar-ish story didn't only diminish its message completely, but also squandered a huge potential that could've been put into creating one of the most unique dystopian Sci-fi movies of late. The Noise gimmick serves as a fairly effective comedic tool as Todd proves awkward around Viola. Other than that, it is nothing but a constant nuisance that made this cliché-loaded Sci-fi actioner an unbearable watch. Tom Holland deserves so much better.(3.5/10)",Chaos Walking
36,Movi3DO,Chaotically Boring,4,5 April 2021,"Haha Tom Holland being a hormonal boy in this movie. In a dystopian world, young boy Todd lived in a colony with only men, and these men were plagued with the Noise, where all their internal thoughts were unfiltered and leaked out that others can hear. One day, a girl came down from space, met the colony, and stuff happened.What I enjoyed the most was the unique premise. The boy Todd, played by Tom Holland, could not control his Noise around the girl, played by Daisy Ridley, and it gave for some funny and cringe moments.And yeah, that's pretty much what I liked about the movie. Despite the premise, the movie went for a predictable and formulaic plot that was pretty boring for the majority of the runtime. The characters were straightforward and had little background that can make me invested in them. The cast was pretty strong, but the script didn't give them enough to shine.Also, there were major plot points that were ignored. The ending didn't make it look like there's gonna be any sequel, so I guess I won't know much about those plots.This movie would honestly be better as a TV series like The 100. It somehow felt rushed and empty as a 2 hour movie.Overall, a movie with potential but was wasted with mediocre plot and characters. It's not chaotically good, but chaotically boring.

38,msbreviews,"Chaos Walking will end up as one of the most disappointing, frustrating movies of the year.",3,3 March 2021,"If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)After decades of experiencing so many films and understanding the respective industry, I rarely get extremely excited for an original sci-fi movie starring famous actors. I wouldn't be surprised if Chaos Walking is the most anticipated film of the month for thousands of viewers, which isn't an easy decision having in mind March is releasing tons of highly expected movies, such as Raya and the Last Dragon, Cherry, Zack Snyder's Justice League, Godzilla x Kong, amongst others. It' almost impossible not to feel remotely interested in watching a film with such a phenomenal cast - Tom Holland (Spider-Man, The Devil All the Time), Daisy Ridley (Star Wars, Murder on the Orient Express), Mads Mikkelsen (Doctor Strange, Rogue One: A Star Wars Story), Demián Bichir (Land, The Grudge), Cynthia Erivo (Widows, Bad Times at the El Royale), and more.Add Doug Liman (The Bourne franchise, The Edge of Tomorrow) as the director and screenwriters with tremendously successful credits as Patrick Ness (A Monster Calls) and Christopher Ford (Spider-Man: Homecoming), what could go wrong? Well... almost everything. I possess no knowledge of the source material, but from what I could gather, the book trilogy of the same name was very well-received, which I don't doubt for a second. If there's one thing no one can take away from Chaos Walking is its incredibly captivating concepts and imaginative visual ideas. From the premise of people being able to hear men's thoughts (noise) to the actual visuals of said brain activity, I felt deeply invested during the first act.The futuristic setting is somewhat familiar, but the production/set design definitely set an engaging atmosphere. The score (Marco Beltrami, Brandon Roberts) also features interesting tracks that create a sense of wonder in this new world. Unfortunately, this is as far as I can go compliment-wise. Sure, the cast offers remarkable performances, especially Holland and Ridley, who obviously share most of the screentime as the underdeveloped protagonists, but sadly this is one of those movies where it's hard not to find a significant flaw with everything. The lack of proper characterization is one of the main issues. While Holland's character misses a regular arc - he has no evolution whatsoever, ending the film with the exact same defects as in the beginning - Ridley's character raises dozens of questions that remain unanswered about herself, her past, her abilities, and her origins.The new world presented to the viewers packs hundreds of unquestionably innovative and exciting ideas, but none reaches even a fraction of its potential. The ""superpower"" of hearing thoughts is rarely seen in a different manner other than chaotic, annoying noise, which is hugely disappointing, having in mind the scarce showings of its real power. Nevertheless, the most frustrating component of the narrative is the introduction of massively important story elements that are completely forgotten by the end of the movie, namely - without getting into spoilers - an entire native population that remains as one of the most fascinating aspects of the screenplay that wasn't remotely explained.Nowadays, people have more knowledge and understanding of how much studios impact the production of any film. Honestly, I don't know if this is one of those projects ruined by awfully dumb corporate demands or if Doug Liman and his team of writers screwed the pooch. One thing is for sure: director, screenwriters, and/or producers, they're the people to blame for such a frustratingly terrible adaptation. I apologize to Doc Crotzer, but this is one of the worst editing jobs I've seen in years, though I want it to be clear: Crotzer is far from being the sole or main culprit of such a horribly put-together movie. The camera work is also all-over-the-place (Ben Seresin).Finally, I don't know if this following story detail is as explicit and barely explained in the source material as it is in this film, but due to the lack of any decent explanation besides ""because"", I strongly dislike the whole ""everyone can hear men's thoughts, but no one can hear the women's"". To be clear, my issue isn't related to the idea but to its evolution in this movie. Men, especially Holland's character, are shown to think like a primate with sexual thoughts concerning women and offenses to everyone and everything. Men's thoughts represent them as utter pigs. However, the whole ""women's thoughts are hidden from everyone"" can easily be interpreted as ""women don't have brains"", especially considering the film's failed attempt at elaborating this concept.Chaos Walking will end up as one of the most disappointing, frustrating movies of the year. In addition to this, it's also another entry in the list of ""films with innovative, interesting concepts that fail to reach half of their potential"". Besides the engaging production design, a cool score, and decent performances, any viewer will struggle not to find a massive flaw in every single aspect of the narrative. From the dozens of unanswered questions regarding Daisy Ridley's character to the lack of a proper arc for Tom Holland's role, the underdeveloped protagonists are just one of many screenplay issues. Critical plot points and story elements either miss an explanation or are entirely forgotten by the end of a horrendously edited movie. Transitions between cuts are very choppy and make zero connection between storylines. The whole ""men's thoughts are seen by everyone, but women's thoughts are not"" is depicted in a way that leaves men portrayed as pigs and insinuates women have no brains. I genuinely don't know if this massive disaster is due to studio interference and/or to the director and screenwriters team-up, but one thing is for certain: personally, it's one of the worst films of the year.Rating: D+",Chaos Walking

41,MrDHWong,A Chaotic mess that weakly Walks through a potentially interesting story,2,17 June 2021,"""Chaos Walking"" is a sci-fi action film based on the novel ""The Knife of Never Letting Go"" by Patrick Ness. Directed by Doug Liman (The Bourne Identity, Edge Of Tomorrow) and starring Tom Holland, Daisy Ridley, and Mads Mikkelsen, it certainly lives up to its title - it is a Chaotic mess that weakly Walks through a potentially interesting story.In the year 2257 AD, the all male colonists of the planet New World are affected by a condition referred to as ""The Noise"" which causes them to hear and see other people's thoughts. The small settlement of Prentisstown are led by their mayor David Prentiss (Mads Mikkelsen), who has found a way to control his Noise to suppress his own thoughts from others. One day, Prentisstown resident Todd Hewitt (Tom Holland) stumbles across a crashed spaceship whose only survivor is a young girl (Daisy Ridley), whom much to his surprise, has no readable thought patterns. The girl introduces herself as Viola and the two of them are soon forced to go on the run after mayor Prentiss decides she must be held prisoner to extract further information regarding her origins.I'm not really a big fan of young adult fiction novels, although I am fully aware of their popularity. The Harry Potter and The Hunger Games series have all been adapted into successful feature films, and as a result, have managed to earn the respect of both fans of the original books and filmgoers alike. ""Chaos Walking"", on the other hand, does nothing to follow the winning formula of how a book, let alone an entire series, should be brought to the big screen. Rather than taking the time to immerse its audience in the world it has created, it instead throws out plot elements at such an erratic rate that it is impossible to invest yourself in anything. Within the first ten minutes, I was already confused as to what type of movie I was watching as it never properly establishes its tone. Is it an introspective science fiction drama or is it a nightmarish dystopian action film? This clash of genres may have fared better on paper but on screen it simply doesn't work. Since I have not read the original book, I don't have much to compare it to, although ""Artemis Fowl"" and ""A Wrinkle In Time"" do come to mind. Each of these two films did a terrible job at bringing their stories to the screen in a way that could please everyone and this film is equally punishing to newcomers to the source material.Given the film's intriguing idea of being able to see and hear the thoughts of every other person, it runs the concept into the ground almost instantly. The constant overlapping voices became very annoying after a while and I was often begging for scenes where characters would just interact with each other normally. In addition to this, the editing in this film is downright dreadful, always cutting back and forth between the main characters running away from something and bad attempts at expository dialogue from their pursuers. This is also not helped by the film's lurid colour saturation, which is a dull grey from beginning to end. Scenes that could have taken the opportunity to show the vibrance of certain areas of the planet are instead putrid and ugly to look at. Upon some post-viewing research, I discovered that this film was supposed to come out in 2017 but poor test screenings required reshoots, shelving its release until four years later. If this is the final product of all those changes then I'd hate to imagine how bad the original film must have been.None of the cast members looked as though they wanted to be in this film. As much as I enjoy the individual work of both Tom Holland and Daisy Ridley, their chemistry here was non-existent. It never felt as though these two characters were growing close to one another during their journey, aside times where the plot demanded it. Holland always looked as though he was annoyed when saying his lines and never displayed the usual enthusiasm we've come to expect from him over the years. I guess this may be due to his frustration from all the reshoots he had to do, so you can't really blame him considering he apparently missed attending the premiere of Avengers: Endgame to finish this film. Likewise, Daisy Ridley looked bored throughout the movie, so much so that in one scene where she's reading from a diary, she sounded so monotone that I'm convinced she was just reading lines from a changed script handed to her for the first time. It's very clear that these two didn't care about being in this film and if they don't care then why should we?Though I can't speak for fans of the original novel, I can tell that this big screen treatment of an otherwise popular set of books is complete failure. It would be unfair to assume all of the author's work is as bad as this so I'm going to place the blame on scripting issues, production troubles and various other problems. All the potential was there for this film to be at least semi-decent but it seems very little was done in the past four years to make it happen. Due to the film being a box office bomb (it only grossed one fifth of its total budget), it is unlikely the other two books will be adapted anytime soon but after viewing this travesty, that is definitely for the best.I rate it 2/10.",Chaos Walking
42,Stanlee107,Worlds apart,5,9 April 2021,"I was excited at the prospect of both Tom Holland (Todd) & Daisy Ridley (Viola) being in a film together. This is a watchable sci fi film. In a world where men's thoughts are heard aloud & only women can keep theirs to themselves, a teenager Todd stumbles upon a female astronaut that has crashed landed to their world and more specifically in their small primitive village. Whereas most the male residents want her to themselves for insidious reasons, Todd has a more innocent intent for her therein lies the story ahead.I do not understand why the 2 protagonists do not end up being together & end up with a forced platonic relationship. If it was to interject some humour with this ""friend zone narrative"" then I would say it failed but rather it created an awkward characters dynamic.Furthermore, I do not understand Todd's motivation for helping her when he gives up everything for a hand holding. This is not the Victorian times where this would have been erotic nor is it set in Japan where this type of PDA would be considered risqué or outlandish. Oh the missed opportunity!",Chaos Walking
43,johannes2000-1,"Very original story, with an excellent Tom Holland.",9,25 June 2021,"I am a bit surprised at the low rating (5.7 at the moment I write this) and the many lukewarm if not downright bad reviews. Because in my opinion this is a pretty good movie. Okay, not Oscar-winning material, but still. You have to look past the bizar premise of a planet where people's thoughts are being heard and seen by everyone else (based on a book, I learned; well, it still is pretty farfetched!). But if you can, you get a fine, exciting, fast paced story, a mixture of sci-fi, dystopia, run-and-chase and coming-of-age, in an undoubtedly highly original movie.The CGI is mostly fine, (apart from a short scene with an original alien of the planet, the creature looked like something out-of a videogame), and the acting by all concerned is great, with palpable chemistry between Tom Holland's and Daisy Ridley's characters. I have to say that Tom Holland is really amazing, he's excellent here and more or less carries the whole project by himself, and I got the same feeling as when I watched his movie ""The Devil all the Time"": there is really so much more in him than ""just"" Spiderman, wait and see!",Chaos Walking
44,trinaboice,Love the concept of visualized thoughts but the movie missed the mark,6,14 March 2021,"IN A NUTSHELL:
A dystopian world where there are no women and all living creatures can hear each other's thoughts in a stream of images, words, and sounds called Noise. Sounds creative, right? The concept is intriguing, but sadly, the film is a bit of a mess.This dystopian thriller directed by Doug Liman is based on Chaos Walking: The Complete Trilogy trilogy by Patrick Ness. The first book in the series actually won the Guardian Children's Fiction Prize award. Tom Holland had an uncredited role in A Monster Calls, which was another book by Patrick Ness that was turned into a movie. After years of delays, rewrites, and reshoots, this movie is finally getting its day in the sun, but most of the viewers and critics say it just doesn't shine.THINGS I LIKED:
I adore Tom Holland. He's believable as the boyish Spiderman, but he's also been pumping out some impressive dramatic roles lately, such as CHERRY. He keeps showing us that he's much more than our friendly, neighborhood superhero. To play this role, he was asked to grow as much facial hair as possible, but it didn't amount to much. During the first week of filming, he broke his nose after getting punched in the face by a stuntman during a fight scene. On the last day of filming, he actually passed out on camera when he had to hold his breath underwater!
I hadn't seen Daisy Ridley in anything since Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker. She wore a blonde wig in this film to change her look. She and Tom Holland have great physicality and chemistry in this movie.
I love the visual concept of showing thoughts. I loved hearing Tom Holland's thoughts, especially when they weren't congruent with the words coming out of his mouth. I laughed when he kept saying, ""Be a man.""
It's especially poignant that the men can't read the girls' thoughts. So true, eh?
The movie feels like a mixture of a western flick and a dystopian movie.
Lots of action.
Good for Nick Jonas. He has been showing up in more and more films lately.
Most of the filming took place in Montreal, Canada back in 2017 with reshoots done in Atlanta, Georgia. Both Tom Holland and Daisy Ridley were busy filming other movies, so they didn't actually film those reshoots until 2 years later! Sadly, Tom Holland actually missed the premiere of the Marvel Studios' Avengers: Endgame because he was busy doing reshoots for this film!
I thought the story idea was intriguing. Visually, it created an entertaining viewing experience.THINGS I DIDN'T LIKE:
The script is really messy, which is just unfortunate. The film looks more like a series of events, rather than a sequence that builds into the next scene.
What a shame to have a movie with the incredibly talented David Oyelowo and not give him much screen time.
I was also wondering when we were going to get to see Cynthia Erivo in another movie again. I thought she was great in Harriet in 2019. Unfortunately, she doesn't get much screen time or a big role to sink her teeth into.
It takes a while to understand what the heck is going on. A lot of people will be confused.
The characters' motivations are not explained very well so their actions make the characters appear to be paper-thin. That's especially strange considering you're able to hear people's thoughts.
Characters come and go rather quickly, especially the aliens, which are never fully explained.
Not all of the humor lands.
The trailer actually gives away some plot points surprises.
The movie kind of ends abruptly without allowing us to sink into an emotional build-up.
The movie is supposed to lead into a franchise, but if it doesn't do well, this one could be the end of the story.
Supposedly, the movie cost $100million. Parts of the movie look very cheap, so I guess the budget was spent on building a cool spaceship and adding visual effects ""noise"".TIPS FOR PARENTS:
Lots of profanity and F-bombs
Kids will mostly be bored
There's a scary monster-looking creature
People and creatures die
There's a homosexual couple but that part of the story didn't go anywhere.You can see the rest of my review on my Movie Review Mom YouTube channel!",Chaos Walking

47,sweidman-28016,Extremely Messy but Fine If You Forget About It,5,16 March 2021,"""We call it the Noise. Happened to all the men when we landed on this planet. Every thought in our heads are on display. It's fairly harmless, so. Some of us can control it better than others.""At last, we finally got to see Chaos Walking. Based on a book trilogy, the movie takes place in a dystopian world where there are no women and all living creatures can hear each other's thoughts in a stream of images, words, and sounds called Noise. When a woman lands on the planet, a young man must protect her from the remaining men who are hiding a dark secret. Firstly, what an amazing story idea. The main reason I wanted to see this is because of the story and how unique it is to anything we've seen before. Originally, Charlie Kaufman was attached to write the screenplay back in 2013, I believe, but was later discontinued to work on the project. That's very strange seeing as he's a master of writing and filmmaking. I can tell you everything that he may have wrote wasn't included. Chaos Walking is an extremely messy movie. Not just because the plot is hard to explain in general, but there is no flow to the story. It kept hinting at something good, but fell short every single chance it had. As a viewer, I had trouble making sense of everything. The way it's presented is easy to follow, but subplots and ideas are dropped easily. For example, there's an alien species that's considered a threat on this planet. It's talked about and shown for a couple minutes and never talked about again. The dialogue is one of the worst aspects here. It's just bad dialogue. And with a messy script, it's hard to direct well enough to make it into something. I'm not a big fan of Doug Liman's work. He makes best of the situation, but it's not quite enough.The major problem is what the filmmaking process had to undergo. This was filmed back in 2017 and had plans to be released in 2019. This obviously didn't work as it underwent heavy reshoots later that summer. When I say heavy reshoots I mean $15 million worth of reshoots. You can see this especially messing with the flow of the story. It feels all too choppy and doesn't have its footing. This may have also caused side plots to be thrown away or them to come into existence but not get full attention. The acting here is fine. The characters aren't fully fledged as they could be. Made Mikkelsen plays the antagonist of the story. I get that he's bad, but I don't understand what's motivating him to. Even with the explanation of why, it's not enough to be convincing. Nick Jonas is heavily miscast here. Tom Holland and Daisy Ridley share most of the screen time. Either something happened on set or this is due to the reshoots, but there is no chemistry here. We're supposed to believe a romance is starting to bloom, but when it's show it feels forced. When you think of how they're only together for a couple days or so it really makes no sense. Another aspect that's failed due to the writing.I've said many negative things so far, but when you don't think too hard of how the important aspects don't fully work, it's not so bad. As a mindless sci-fi thriller I was entertained. Some action scenes are done well. The visual effects work in its favor. The portrayal of Noise is a cool way to think of it. With the scenery, the cinematography is actually really good. If it did one thing, it made me not want to look away. I can't say I hated Chaos Walking, but I'm definitely disappointed. Not many have actually liked this having received poor reviews from audiences and critics alike. But I can understand if you found it to be something good. It's definitely entertaining when you don't focus too hard on the issues. After this long, I wouldn't say it's worth the wait. Even the actors and crew attached to the project haven't even been advertising for it on social media or anything. That has to indicate something. The movie definitely won't make back it's budget by a long shot. Even without the pandemic, most were in consensus that it would be a flop. I will reiterate, I don't hate this. With more work focused on the script, something could've been made out of this.",Chaos Walking
48,namstonk,Decent film from very difficult representation,7,2 April 2021,"It was hard to fathom how Liman was going to bring this children's book to screen but he does succeed relatively well. The thoughts of the men are depicted well as well as all the other aspects, cinematography and direction. The dialogue does feel laboured on many occasions and ends up somewhat bland, you get the feeling that it couldn't decide on what age group it was going for. However the weakest part of the film is Daisy Ridley, convincing she is not, being pretty has never been an ability and in this role you definitely need more than said looks. As usual the critics will pan it, as will idiot sites like Rotten Tomatoes but they are so far out of touch with the average viewer you wonder why they even go to the 'free' preview.",Chaos Walking

52,daisukereds,A fine little release,5,21 April 2021,"It's a quaint little pseudo-Science Fiction movie. Sadly, it isn't anything memorable.Sure, no character is annoying, there are some interesting effects and usage of the premise that was invented.. but it is a tad too simplistic (which might a positive for some). Also, it feels like it had a small budget, basically shot ""in the woods"" like cheap movies of old.And for some, the concept of the noise is probably going to get old fast.. to the point where it becomes annoying, specially since it used so much without a real point.Daisy Ridley grew on me, even if her character is a bit dry (still the only thing I really liked). The rest of the characters are just fine, even the talented Mads.** At some point during watching it I thought.. this is something Hideo Kojima would write as a foundation for a story. But he would have elaborated it better, put in more layers and messages, make it deeper and more elaborated.. and probably mess it up anyway.Watch it to pass the time, not with the intention to discuss it with others.I wouldn't really recommend it.. I fee like they could have done more with what they created.",Chaos Walking

Director: Doug Liman
Starring: Tom Holland, Daisy Ridley, Mads Mikkelsen, Demian Bichir, David Oyelowo, Nick Jonas, Cynthia Erivo etc
Overall rating 41/100Chaos walking is about two unlikely companions who embark on a perilous adventure through the Badlands of an unexplored planet as they try to escape a dangerous and disorientating reality, where all inner thoughts are seen and heard by everyone. This film had such an interesting premise and such a charming cast, but I was left incredibly disappointed with how the film turned out.My first few positives would be the interesting idea, creativity to the plot, the good worldbuilding and the fantastic cinematography. The idea and premise of the movie itself was intriguing and was explored well. The thought of all the men having all there thoughts out in the open really intrigued me and made me think of the lack of privacy that gives you with all the characters. This introduced some really interesting elements and some good worldbuilding. Learning that different characters with higher power within the town learned how to control their powers or use it to protect themselves was well done and established a good world for the audience to get invested in, especially within the first half of the film. Moreover, the cinematography was excellent. How the noise was visually conveyed was creative and interesting with an eery almost mist like quality to there thoughts, and the colour palette for the different noise was excellently done.My next couple of positives would be the set up for character development, and the promising set up for the main two characters. I thought that the film set up development between a lot of the characters, especially Todd (Tom Holland) and his parents as well as Todd and the Mayor (Mads Mikkelsen) they did some intriguing things with how Todd felt about the mayor and set up a good character arc for proving that he could be a man and rise to the occasion, whilst also balancing that with his more grounded homelife with his parents. It's a shame this set up wasn't executed (more on that in a future paragraph) but the set up itself was strong. I also thought the main set up for the relationship between Todd and Viola (Daisy Ridley) was also strong. It set up a great mystery of why she was the only woman and why her ship was coming to the mayor's land. It also set up a clear fantasy and sci fi genre and tone and left me intrigued as to how the plot would develop from there and was a strong start to the film.However, now lets move onto some negatives. There was a complete lack of character background, a lack of explanation to the plot therefore effecting the pacing, whilst also having some very irritating creative moments. The movie jumped straight into the setup, now if done right this could be a positive. But the audience had absolutely no clue who the characters were or any form of fleshing out of the story world before jumping into the action, this is frustrating because It made me really struggle to connect with the film or its characters from the beginning and that's never a good sign. One of my biggest issues was the complete lack of explanation to the plot. It had a great set up but never developed that until about two thirds into the story, for so long the film kept the audience in the dark to what was going on, therefore this really effected the pacing of the film as it just wasn't going anywhere, and I often found myself losing interest. There were also some extremely irritating creative decisions as well, the idea of the noise despite definitely being interesting soon wore very thin. It was overused and the film relied on it too much to attempt to develop the plot and characters, it just created too much exposition and got extremely irritating after a while.My final couple of positives would be the great creature designs and the chemistry between the cast, specifically the two leads. I thought that the creature designs were very creative and interesting, despite only being in one scene possibly due to editing issues, the creatures proved that the money was well spent on the film and I wish they were Included more. I also thought the whole cast had great chemistry with each other. Tom Holland and Daisy Ridley are very charming and likeable and they both did solid performances here and definitely had great on-screen chemistry. The whole cast did a solid job with what thinly written material they had. Plus Mads Mikkelsen is great in whatever film he is in.My next few negatives would be the lack of development to the relationships, how predictable the film was and how emotionally disconnected I was. The movie set up so many great relationships with the characters in the first act, and then went on to not develop them whatsoever, there was so many missed opportunities at character depth, the characters just stagnated and stayed the same, this made me completely emotionally disconnected. Character deaths had no impact on me due to not caring about the relationships and the lazily underdeveloped characters and was a massive disappointment. The film was also painfully predictable, it left the audience in the dark for so long and when they finally started to develop the plot slightly and reveal more, I had already predicted it and there were no other surprises, a good movie isn't supposed to be so basic and structured in such a basic step by step way that you can predict it all.My final few negatives are the mediocre villains, the lack of expansion to the story world and the underwhelming ending. Despite the strong performances from the actors the villains were very underwhelming. They had no depth and development apart from the simple point that they were threatened by the woman because they had no noise, they just needed more intensity and the film focused more on the conflict between the villains instead of developing them more. They also failed to take it to the next level in terms of developing the story world, there was some interesting elements to do with the noise and the dynamics between the different villages, but it always felt like it needed to up a gear and expand the story world and the stakes and it just never went there. The ending was also very underwhelming, there was no character arcs and it just wasn't satisfying, it felt like a lazy set up for a sequel that most likely won't happen.Overall, Chaos walking had a very intriguing premise. And a solid start, but despite the charms of the two leads, the film fell flat. Leaving the audience in the dark for so long and when it finally revealed something it was painfully predictable. It just turned into a generic YA film that honestly felt lazily made and felt like it was edited multiple times, lazily setting up a sequel that I unfortunately don't want.",Chaos Walking
54,gavinp9,"Solid, if unspectacular, sci-fi",6,9 March 2021,"'Chaos Walking' is a near-future humanity-trying-to-colonise-a-new-planet film, based on the book 'The Knife of Never Letting Go' by Patrick Ness, which I haven't read. I may have to read the three books, as the unique ""power"" all the men on this new planet have is that their thoughts are visible - called ""the noise"", shown as multi-coloured clouds around their heads. No secrets here! Or so you'd think. Todd (Holland) is a teenager raised on this planet, guided by the mayor, Prentiss (Mikkelsen) & preacher (Oyelowo), when Viola (Ridley) crash lands from the 2nd fleet from Earth.It's directed by Doug Liman, who has a very interesting CV now ('Swingers', 'Bourne Identity', 'Mr & Mrs Smith', 'Edge of Tomorrow') and does a good job to keep things moving, while slowly fleshing out the characters. It's essentially a chase film, with Todd & Viola on the run the whole time. Quebec does a good job of standing is as not-unusually-seen terrain. The ""noise"" can get annoying at times, but Holland's charm helps.I should highlight that some won't like the few instances of animal cruelty shown on screen, so be warned. Good to see Spider-Man and Rey acting together - you can see the studio trying to cash in when they filmed this 3.5 years ago! Why there are some quite obvious reveals (reminds me more of 'The Chrysalids' than other sci-fi novels), and there is a little more world-building needed (I'm sure we'll see sequels), it offers enough to leave you satisfied.",Chaos Walking
55,MogwaiMovieReviews,A Great Disappointment,2,6 April 2021,"I'd been looking forward to this film for years, ever since the announcement of the involvement of Charlie Kaufman, who I still consider the most creative screenwriter in Hollywood, though it's been a good ten years or more since his work has resulted in a good movie. Even without Kaufman (he quit early on), the film had such a great premise: a dystopian planet, upon which everyone can hear what males are thinking, gets visited by a woman astronaut.Unfortunately this compelling starting point is completely wasted: there is not one thought heard out loud that sounds anything like the thoughts that would pass through someone's head in real life. The men's thoughts are all primitive, stupid and apelike (""I'm so scared!"" ""Go fast!"", etc.), and any sort of abstract reflection or private revelation is entirely absent, so the thoughts we hear are basically just clumsy and awkward versions of what the characters would say out loud anyway, if they were unusually boorish and stupid. Plus, the premise, once established, plays almost no real role in the events that then transpire for the rest of the movie: it could all be played out exactly the same just with spoken dialogue. So what was the point?In the first 5 minutes it becomes clear the actual aim of the film is some preachy political agenda about how all men are taught to want to control and kill people (I guess I missed that class). Messages among these lines crop up throughout the film, heavy-handedly telling us that when white men are in charge, there is misogyny and murder, but when black women are in charge there is peace and love.While all this is, obviously, an ugly and unwelcomely racist and sexist sentiment to find sprinkled upon your popcorn, it wouldn't necessarily have to ruin a film if its makers could only manage to construct a consistent and believable world around it, with well-rounded, compelling characters in it we care for. Chaos Walking fails in this completely: Tom Holland is a hopeless buffoon and Daisy Ridley is a pristeen plank of wood. The rest of the unrelatable, shallow-as-cardboard characters don't matter in the slightest: no man is shown to have any redeeming feature, and no woman is shown to have any flaw. This is all so boring, so presently predictable, and so unlike actual lived life the film can have no use or relevance to any audience of human beings, in this or any other age.It briefly picks up a half hour in, and there are precisely two decently-handled action set pieces, both to do with falling over things, and both are over in seconds. Then there's once again a lot of chaos, and a lot of walking, but that's about it. Chaos Walking might not be the very worst film ever, but it is certainly one of the most exasperating, and an enormous waste considering what it could have been.",Chaos Walking

Through this, the thoughts of all men can be heard. Young Todd Hewitt (Tom Holland) struggles to control his train of thought. When he finds the crashed space girl Viola (Daisy Ridley), he tries to help her. To do this, he must hide her malfunctioning spaceship and take her to a location where she can contact her people. To get here, the two must travel through perilous landscapes, all while Viola can hear what Todd is thinking throughout the journey.The making of this film took some time, because the film has changed directors and writers during production. As a result, scenes had to be filmed again, but due to the busy schedules of the film cast, these reshoots took a lot of time. The final film has become so chaotic. The film often jumps from scene to scene, has separate scenes where you see characters walking alone and other characters suddenly appear in scenes. The film also lacks explanations about certain things that suddenly happen in the film.The effects used to portray the mindsets of the various male characters also look unrealistic. With each character, a colored cloud of smoke is shown, in which his thoughts can be seen. This idea sometimes makes for some comedy as Daisy Ridley can hear what Tom Holland's character is thinking. Furthermore, this can cause confusion, or distract you when watching. Especially when this happens to several characters at the same time. It seems as if different colored fireworks smoke bombs go off at the same time. For this idea they should have chosen a different method like they did for example the telepathic powers of Professor Xavier in the X-Men movies.The acting is well done by the movie cast, but most of the cast have played in better movies. Due to the chaotic way in which the film is put together, the relationship between Daisy Ridley and Tom Holland is also not so strong. Mads Mikkelsen, who plays the villain in the film, doesn't get much to work with in the film either.",Chaos Walking

Well, The age range of a young adult is 18 to 35, I find it hard to believe anyone in that age range would find this movie or its novel anything more than utterly silly.This movie by definition is moronic, the story could actually be quite good if it was thought out more thoroughly rather than it just being cliché after cliché to facilitate a very bland, very silly & very boring story of ""man bad, woman good"".The entertainment value is reduced to non existent due to the ridiculous plot, poorly constructed scenes, awful dialogue & stupid use of the ""psychic

65,carlos37andre,"Fascinating concept, that's not as well explored as it could have been, but still pretty decent",7,19 April 2021,"When I first about this movie I was like ""well, cool, two actors I like, in a sci-fi? Sign me up"", but then, I ultimately saw the bad rating everywhere and I almost didn't even watch it. But well, screw it, I might as well give it a shot. And honestly, I thought it was pretty decent.First things first, the acting is pretty great, I love Tom Holland, and as always, I think he is pretty charismatic as the lead, you feel his emotion, he is funny, you feel he's constant confused and bothered by the whole noise thing, and well, he's a good and likeable lead. And Daisy Ridley is also pretty good in it too, also charismatic, you feel she is scared, even tho she is also kind of a badass, and well, for the most part I don't think the characters or the performances here are like masterclass or anything, but these are two great actors, giving pretty solid performances. Mads Mikkelsen is also great, as always too.I also liked the score.And well, I believe that the thing I liked the most was the concept of the story itself, it's actually pretty unsettling and fascinating idea... like you sort of understand what living hell must have been for both man (who literally couldn't have privacy with their thoughts anymore) and woman... who, well, had to live with all the noise and I'm sure hearing the disturbing thoughts from them constantly, and ended up been brutally murdered by the man, but well, I mean, you even understand why they went nuts and killed every single woman here, this would be a constant nightmare for everywhere, and it's totally believe people would literally go insane. Anyways, I loved how much I was fascinating by the concept.Also, I liked the world they've built too, I'm always a big fan of a new and different sci-fi that tries to create its own world and mythology, like you feel there is so much more under the surface we don't actually get to see, and that constantly got me invested.But well, it isn't perfect, if I had to say my main issue with it, it would have been that they actually didn't explore enough of the world around them, and just stayed with the ""quest"" of bringing Viola back to her ship. The whole relationship between the cities, or even how the people actually live their lives there it's fascinating, as well as the why humans would have gone that far to create a colony? Did something happened to earth? I mean, so many questions, and it's a shame we won't probably see a sequel to it.Also, after writing most of the review, I actually went and saw some reviews of the movie, to see what people were actually complaining about, and well, I get the points, and I believe they sort of aligned with what I said was my main issue with the film, but well, I thought the positives overall overcame the cons, and even tho I think is fair to say the movie could have been much more, I'm ok with what we got.So, the movie isn't perfect, and it would have been cool if they had explore more of the world they settled up, but overall, I thought it was pretty decent, I loved the concept of it, I will admit that I almost got to the point where I was annoyed by the noise, but I would also guessed that was the goal of the movie, and well, there are some pretty funny moments we get from the situation (like Todd clearly crushing on Viola - can't blame him - and not been able to hide it).To sum up, Chaos Walking is a fairly decent movie imo, it has a fascinating concept, with good acting, good soundtrack, and got me entertained for almost 2 hours. Overall, it could have definitely explored its world better, and showed more of this colony and how everything works, but still, it's a good story, with a fairly simple quest that gets you involved for the duration of it.",Chaos Walking

68,AdrenalinDragon,Chaos Badness,3,12 March 2021,"Chaos Walking to probably nobody's surprise is an utter mess of a movie. With so many rewrites, reshoots, and production problems, it was most likely going to suck. Honestly, I'm really angry at how a potentially great concept was wasted with such a forgettable and bad film. It's kind of unintentionally funny in parts I'll give it that, but the problem is it's almost all serious and there's no surprises or good uses of the concept. In the end, it's a bad, maybe below average at best film, and that's why I'm harsher on it. I wanted to like this and came out super annoyed by the end of it.So the main gimmick is that all men have this thing inside them called ""The Noise"" which means their thoughts come out in the open as audio and visual signs. Maybe in the right hands this could have been done really well, but in the end I just couldn't stop laughing at how stupid these lines and visuals came out. It was clear most of them weren't meant to be funny. It kept taking me out of the film and some of the performances were a bit wonky in places. Yes, that also includes Tom Holland and Daisy Ridley. When the dog is one of the best performances here, you know you've probably messed up big time.The plot is basically just two people walking around a planet being hunted and looking for something. There's no sense of cohesion to it, no excitement to it. It basically plays out as random things happening with barely any explanations and feels like filler to pad out the runtime. Any proper attempts at humour play out exactly as you expect it would with a guy who finds a girl attractive. Very basic stuff. The visuals aren't really all that impressive, and for a film that's just over 90 minutes long, it surprisingly dragged.I can think of perhaps one scene in the entire film that kind of worked for me, because it gave me an emotional reaction. Other than that this was just rubbish. The villain and bad guys were nothing special. It felt like a crap western in places, and I hoped it was better than it looked in the trailers. Wouldn't surprise me if people start calling this Chaos Flopping one day.3/10",Chaos Walking

However, once you get around the novelty of those premises, the story unfolds exactly how anyone would expect it to, with little to no surprises, including falling prey to that idiotic trend of the 21st century that demands movies must shy away from depicting any heterosexual romantic liaison (granted: that's just a minor annoyance, but it's so obvious it's still an annoyance).",Chaos Walking

75,Mivas_Greece,"An authentic idea, but a very mediocre and boring result... Too pity for the great actors and concept to be buried by this script...",5,8 April 2021,"Fantasy movie. We are in the future where humans have built colonies on other planets, viable, fertile and with a compatible atmosphere, while the colony we see is a small rural community from which women are absent. According to the mayor's story, the women were exterminated by a local tribe on the planet. However, the most important peculiarity of the planet is the ""noises"". The thoughts and dreams of all men are heard and projected as holograms because of some effect that the planet has on them, while it has no effect on women. So a monotonous life in the rural colony, until a small detached spaceship vessel crashes in the area, from which only one young woman survives. What's the truth hiding in the colony? What happened to the women in the community? Are there any survivors in other colonies on the planet? What was the mission of the spacecraft that crashed? All this will concern the rest of the film, while the young protagonist will be asked to make important decisions and face the truth. Very good central actors and original central idea but the script treats this idea as something extra for enrichment and not as its main focus. The scenario mainly concerns the rural community and the above questions, setting aside the highly original and interesting idea of the projected thoughts but also the fact that we are on another planet. The viewer is like seeing a small rural settlement with crops, horses etc. It's a real shame to let an idea that we've seen in a few fantasy movies and here could be the center of the script. The result is nothing special and the film is just mediocre. Can be watched for once, but that's it, nothing special.",Chaos Walking
76,hunter-friesen,"""Chaos Walking"" is just white noise",4,26 March 2021,"Like ""The Hunger Games"", ""Harry Potter"", and ""Percy Jackson"", ""Chaos Walking"" is the newest attempt to establish a lucrative franchise based on a series of popular teenage-audience books. But unlike those successful series, this Lionsgate release is more likely to fall in line with the other failures such as ""The Golden Compass"" and ""The Mortal Instruments"".Haven't heard of this movie? Well, I wouldn't blame you since Lionsgate has attempted to bury this money pit in the middle of the pandemic to save themselves from further embarrassment. Filmed in 2017 and originally to be released in early 2019, the film underwent extensive (and expensive) reshoots after the first cut was deemed unwatchable. It was shelved for nearly two years until crawling its way back from the grave into newly reopened theatres. So, is this movie as terrible as its reputation precedes it? No, but that's not to say it isn't bad.Similar to all YA novels, ""Chaos Walking"" takes place in a dystopian space colony in 2257. This planet is like Earth, except that there is something in the atmosphere called The Noise. An introvert's worst nightmare, The Noise makes it where the thoughts of men are heard aloud, and is something our hero, orphaned Todd (Tom Holland), still has yet to control. Everything he thinks is broadcast to anyone within earshot, restricting any sense of privacy. No one knows why this is happening, and why women are not affected.The colony Todd lives in also has no women there, as he is told the Spackle - the native inhabitants of the planet - killed off. Obviously, what you're told isn't always what actually happened.Everything changes when a scout, Viola (Daisy Ridley), crashes on the planet. The leader of the colony decides to use her as bait to attract her command ship so he can ambush it and leave this godforsaken land. Naturally, Todd develops a crush on Viola, agreeing to help her escape to a deserted colony fitted with a communicator that she can use to warn her rescuers.If you wanted to know what Tom Holland was thinking all the time, this will be a supreme disappointment to you. The character is very bland, and so are his thoughts, which consist solely of him saying his name to calm himself down and suppressing his budding feelings for his newfound partner. Holland tries to use his Peter Parker charm to make the character at least bearable, but the script makes his efforts a waste.The word bland is the best way to describe everything about this movie. It might be a weird movie, but that doesn't mean it's interesting.There's a lot of semi-world building here as we are introduced to all sorts of details about the planet and its backstory. I say semi because the movie never gives away too much information, as they want you to pay more for that in the sequels, which are never going to happen. It's also done at a rapid pace, moving from one location to another like we're just skimming through the pages. Adapting his book, writer Patrick Ness seems more interested in setting up sequels than establishing an interesting base.Take for instance the Spackle, who look like all-black Martians and rightfully fought back against the colonizing humans. In this movie, we see them for one three-minute action scene. After that, they disappear completely and are never mentioned again. I was told by a friend that the Spackle are reintroduced in the third book, a fact that I audibly groaned at. I want to learn about these natives now, not these boring humans!Even for a $100 million (+ reshoots) blockbuster, ""Chaos Walking"" is sparsely light on meaningful action. Director Doug Liman had the potential to mash the sci-fi and western genre into something off the beaten path, but he instead stays in the same lane as his contemporaries. Like ""Star Wars"", the guns shoot plasma so the wounds are bloodless and any serious violence is cut away from. The one unique feature is the movie's questionable hatred towards animals, as a horse is violently put down and a dog is drowned in the frame.I'm glad no one in the cinema could hear my thoughts while watching this movie because my head was full of a lot of questions and negative comments. By next month, ""Chaos Walking"" will feel like a distant memory, a fact that we should all rejoice in. It was nice to be back in the cinema after a long while, I just wish it wasn't for this.",Chaos Walking

Yes, it has THAT trope in it.I'm not an animal rightist by any stretch of the imagination. But tropes are always a clear indication of a crappy movie vomited up from a lazy story composed of exceptionally lame writing and utterly devoid of actual creativity. And needlessly killing a harmless little dog because the writer was just too inept to find a legitimate way to pull our emotions other than by the hackneyed use of this clumsy cudgel is an expression of the lamest unforgivable trope of all.The presence of this trope in this movie tells you everything you need know about its level of quality storytelling.",Chaos Walking

The script in this consists of spewing exposition and video-game-like checkpoint locations.You need to go here, we can't help you, go here, encounter this, then go to this location for this specific thing that will help you all while the bad guy is after you.There's even this Alien race that lives on this planet, that gets introduced and has literally zero to do with the story and they never get mentioned ever again. There's a surprising lack of world building and character depth in this too. What a waste.Not even the star studded cast of Tom Holland, Daisy Ridley, Nick Jonas (who does nothing in this whole thing), and Mads Mikkelsen could do anything to help this film.Chaos Walking had the potential to do so much, but utilized none of it.

Im still very surprised how well the mayor controlled his noise.The noise practically is their thoughts, every thought that a man had was visible to everyone, and they use this noise to make illusions and stuff, which again was pretty impressive.I had no clue about what happened with all those women from their village in the beginning, but when they reacher Farbranch village and I saw a few discussions there and then that journal I started to put pieces together.",Chaos Walking

The reviews had me thinking this was going to be a terrible movie, but I was pleasantly surprised that it was honestly quite entertaining. The problems with the film are directly related to casting and story. Now I'm sure the book this film is based on must be quite good, many people have read it and rave about it, the screenplay for this film, on the other hand, felt simplistic and bland - I saw opportunities where there could have been so much more texture and adventure and it was all wasted on ninety minutes of what felt like a Western chase on horseback and with a plot to lynch a couple of innocent kids - but without the Western gravitas. I would have enjoyed more back story and narrative with the indigenous species on the New World and more conflict between the men and their noisy thoughts. Secondly, while I love both Daisy Ridley and Tom Holland; they are both truly A-list talent, the two of them together in this film just didn't work. There was no chemistry, none, and because of the lack of romance - the boy meets girl part of the film falls completely flat. You just end up caring less. Had they paired Daisy with a beefier, more dangerous lead like Dacre Montgomery or Ansel Elgort, or practically any young male who's not Tom Holland, I'm sure there would have been fireworks and the notched up romantic tension would have helped overcome the soft, boring story. I'm giving this a 6.5/10 for very competent acting, great special effects and a passable amount of entertainment from a one trick pony of a story about silly men with noisy thoughts and a girl with yellow hair.",Chaos Walking

We have some great actors in this movie but the story isn't all that well done and the budget was lower than expected. Toss in a bit of Hollywood ""Woke"" themes and we have a recipe for one below average film. If this film was going to run with a sci-fi theme then they should have written the film and set aside the budget to roll with that. If we had some additional sci-fi cgi it might have improved this one.The writing wasn't very good which is the most notable issue I have with this film. The entire plot based on a planet of exiled human men living together in a town is silly. Everyone thinks that females were killed off a long time ago which is far from the truth. The fact that they believe this to be true when they discover that the next town over is filled with women just doesn't make sense. It also has an alien species living on the planet that as far as I can tell holds no plot purpose, nor does it drive the plot forwards when they run into an alien.The climax of this stinker takes place with a ship full of human refugees from Earth arriving and deciding that they will setup a new home on this planet. The end. It's entire story as far as this movie was told was underwhelming and felt very rushed. The writers through in some big Hollywood woke turds into the film also where this all men town was populated by a good number of gay couples, which is ok except that their entire town will die off in one generation.

Doug Liman is a pretty decent director and even though not all of his films are amazingly written, he always succeeds in this department.The actors do an incredible job of conveying this interesting story, as you would expect from names such as Tom Holland, Daisy Ridley or Mads Mikkelsen.Overall, it is a fantastic movie, both in the scifi and drama department.

As anyone who has seen many Stephen King adaptations can attest; plot complexity, characters, and depth are removed in order to condense the story into a two-hour or less run time.The rise of streaming services has allowed many books to be adapted into series without having to cut much of the adult content in the books which would make it difficult for network television.As such it makes adaptations such as ""Chaos Walking"" a delicate undertaking. The film is based on a series of books and stars Tom Holland as Todd; a young ma living on a distant world where there are no women and people can hear and see each other's thoughts by a process known as ""Noise"".Their rustic colony is run with a firm hand by their Mayor (Mads Mikkelsen); who keeps those around him from seeing his thoughts which gives him a big advantage over those who rule.When a landing craft from a mothership filled with a new wave of colonists crashes on the planet; Todd is shocked to find that the only survivor is a woman named Viola (Daisy Ridley) whose arrival disrupts the community.The Mayor wishes to keep her from contacting her ship so they can seize it when it lands to maintain control of his empire as he sees the arrival of new individuals as a threat to his power.Todd and Viola escape trying to reach a distant colony where she hopes to find a way to warn her ship about the danger the Mayor and his men present and they pursue the duo to keep this from happening.The film lightly touches on the native race that Todd believes killed all the women of their colony but they are not visited save for a brief appearance. It is clear that the Mayor is hiding something and the reveal of what and why is fairly underwhelming which reduces him and most of his followers as thinly developed stock characters.There is also the mystery as to why the Mothership does not bother to do any sort of follow up when they did not hear from their lander and like many aspects of the film; require the audience to simply go along with things and not ask too many questions to make things work.Thankfully the two leads are interesting enough and they hold attention even when the story is slowly moving along with scene after scene of rivers, woods, and a little conversation.One big issue with the film is the Noise as the visualization of thoughts as well as hearing them mixed in with verbal communication can get very confusing as it is like multiple voices in a crowded room.Despite the issues, the potential is there and I found myself wondering what was next for the characters and hope that they do adapt future books in the series. While the film on its own does not work as a fully developed story' as an introduction to the series it does enough to peak the interests for more.3.5 out of 5",Chaos Walking

Every sentence is first spoken out-loud by a voice over, and then spoken by the main character, and then repeated a couple of times by the voice over thought voice.

110,GavWaskett,Chaos Walking or Keep Your Thoughts to Yourself.,9,12 April 2021,"Chaos Walking (2021) - Adventure, Sci-Fi
Tom Holland and Daisy Ridley lead this Sci-Fi adventure about a colony of men who are happily living their lives on a far away planet, only suffering from the occasional argument because their thoughts manifest aloud and in the form of pictures. Now that's a scary thought for anyone! Daisy Ridley's Viola crash lands in the forest near by and is found by Tom Holland's Todd.The introduction of a women into the community brings about some issues, especially as all the previous women were killed by the original inhabitants of the planet, or at least that's the tale that the town's Mayor -David - a brilliantly malicious Mads Mikkelsen, weaves. It just so happens that the planet does not affect women in the same way as their thoughts cannot be seen or heard. They have no 'noise'.Cue, an escape across the planet, pursued by menfolk on horses and a religious nutter, David Olelowo's Aaron, whose thoughts manifest as fire, well he is a bit hot under the collar about women! The finding of other settlements and ships and a whole lot of Tom Holland being charmingly awkward.The film is a very good action, film and the two leads are completely likeable and both very funny in an understated way. It is based on Patrick Ness' Young Adult trilogy's first book - The Knife of Letting Go. It hopefully will get a second film as it deserves it, the critics didn't like it though, but we really enjoyed it. One of the best films that I have seen in a long, long time.Well worth your time, even just to delight at Tom Holland's thoughts about spending time with a female for the first time and his completely embarrassed reactions, when Daisy Ridley hears and sees his thoughts.",Chaos Walking

Even little, incongruous things like wearing a thick animal pelt when everyone else is in shirts, seemed silly. And the super-powerful gun that only gets used once. And other intriguing ideas that were just ignored. TBH, overall, it's a 6 but I gave it an extra point for imaginativeness.

113,waltermwilliams,"""What Women Want"" set in Space",6,5 March 2021,"In a World...a Brave New World you can open a movie with a random quote from imaginary people.
Welcome to ""Chaos Walking"".
This movie, like many, has been in production and postproduction for years and was meant to be on the big screen in 2020, but that's when our world changed forever.
So, you can understand why settlers from Earth left decades ago to create a dystopian world on another planet about 200 years from now.
How's that working out for them?
Not so good.
All the women have been killed by aliens...apparently!
We only see the aliens twice and they are not fully explained, but I feel that door has been left wide open for parts 2 & 3...along with more Settlements.
There's even talk of a monorail, but it's more of a Shelbyville idea. (even something for Simpsons fans here)
The thing separating this world from our planet is that all living creatures can hear each other's thoughts.
Just when you thought no one can hear you scream in space.
The main issue with this is that you can't go silent or quiet because your thought's come out as a stream of images, words and sounds called (imaginatively) Noise!
Think ""What Women Want"" set in Space as a Sci-Fi/Romance and you've got ""Chaos Walking"" ...literally.
Except men can't hear women's thoughts and the local raving looney Preacher, played by the award-winning David O, thinks all females are evil and should be punished.
This movie has a stellar cast (see what I did there?).
From the Marvel Universe comes Tom Holland minus the Spidey suit as Todd.
He's been orphaned as a baby, never getting to really know his mum or dad and taken in by a Gay couple, Demian Bichir unrecognisable as Ben and Kurt Sutter as Cillian.
Todd's spider sense should have been tingling as this Adventure, Mystery unravels.
Star Wars alumni, Daisy Ridley, is another space traveller who fell to this new Earth as Viola.
The Mayor of Crazy Town is the Danish, Mads Mikkelsen, as Prentiss.
Never has a better bad guy character actor been born, he is pure evil from Netflix show ""Hannibal"".
Director Doug Liman gave us ""Edge of Tomorrow"" with Tom Cruise and now he's working with a massive 125-million-dollar budget on a flick filmed on location in the wilds of Canada.
To date this movie has not made even 1-million-dollars Worldwide Gross at the Box Office.
The ""Noise"" SFX are visually interesting and different.
The sets are very much from the George Lucas camp.
""Chaos Walking"" is based on a trilogy of novels by author Patrick Ness.
The first being, ""The Knife of Never Letting Go"".
Fun Fact: Holland had an uncredited role in another film based on a book by Ness called, ""A Monster Calls"" and both Holland and Ridley worked on this movie between MCU and Star Wars movies.
This movie is more fun than having your wisdom teeth pulled (although that did happen for Spider-Man during filming).

The story boils down to boy meets girl and then both are chased across country by pose of men on horseback. It is basically a western targeted at tweens.It's not particularly exciting, there isn't any real suspense or peril and the ending was pretty dull.

117,neener3707,A Good Watch But.... It Was OK,6,22 March 2021,"I did not read the books, I just wanted to see a movie for the first time in over a year and while I did like it in a way; I did find some of it interesting. But it came across very middle of the road for me. Fun? Yes. Fantastic? Not so much.I did find the idea of the background story very interesting as a premise, cool idea. First wave of interplanetary settlers land and the second wave gets lost (or something...) and the first wave is left without the infrastructure to continue thriving so they resort to a more 1800's wild west sort of lifestyle with futuristic weapons, after what's described to us as a terrible war with the planets inhabitants that left all the women dead. But while I did like the main story of ""oh look a girl"" and the complications that imposes on their little community I felt was a little thin. Cut and dry, it is what it is, lets go this direction to this place, now we go here.The acting was fine, some better than others. I loved Daisey Ridley and Mads Mikkelsen, their performances were fantastic. Tom Holland was alright and Mr. Jonas and the mad preacher I found to be sort of try-hard, little too much. The back and forth between the two main characters was fun at first but after a while it didn't get much from me, definitely not as much as the 40 year old guy and his friend in front of me. Every other actors were furniture. Nothing very special or extraordinary.I feel like something wasn't so great about the tone. I'm not sure tone is the right word. There are movies like this such as Children of Men that have a sort of feeling to them. A world that felt unique and interesting. But this film is..... the woods.... and some Antarctic research looking buildings and cowboy hats. The world of the film did not leave the slightest of an impression on me whatsoever. The scenery, the costume design, the art direction, whatever it may be it either did not line up well to create a cohesive world that stays with you, or it just wasn't there at all.All in all I liked it generally speaking, fantastic idea for a story, with a twist that was cool but didn't light me up, the acting for the most part was great. But some other things were average, overdone, but I would still recommend it, if nothing more than just for a fun watch.",Chaos Walking

Seriously there had to been some big settlements at one time if they were putting up monorail towers (dont get me started on why they would need that if a ship only carried 4k people). Also was Tom's charcter the only one that thought there were no woman I mean Mads charter rides up with 30 guys and no one blinks an eye at the woman at the other town?The little bit of aliens had me wondering how the humans interacted with them.I can see a small community with the issue of thoughts being seen and heard devolving into religious extremism but only one seemed to be nuts was preacher guy.And what was mads character planning with no more children just to waste away and all die. And if he got to ship exactly what was he going to do Hijack a ship with 4k people on it with, what? 30 guys?Why was the ship abandoned these ships if they can land on the surface would have acted as perfect city to start with And if the ship in that bad state could still send a signal why didnt they send one 50 years ago?Tom Holland is a decent actor I dont understand Daisy Ridley I thought she was awful in Star Wars but of course if you say anything its because you misogynic or some other bs.So many questions - actually the world it was sat in, if it had been fleshed out better, could have been good and interesting movie.",Chaos Walking
120,kingsx_64,Books vs movies,7,13 July 2021,"Book readers will not like what I'm about to say.But seriously, do they like anything?But before you jump all over my review, please know,
I'm one of you. (kinda)
I used to be a book snob. Instantly criticizing any book adaption to the screen. Why did they leave out that character ? Why didn't they explore this plot/topic more? Etc.For the past 30yrs, I've read every night until I fall asleep.I love a good book. But I also really enjoy a good flick.I always found myself unsatisfied when the movie I watched didn't live up to my love for the book.You can read review after review from any movie that was taken from a book. And you will see the constant battle between, 'i read the books and this movie sucks'..to... 'Since I didn't read the book, I really liked the movie'.Then one day I saw a video clip of a director being interviewed, and it changed how I think about adaptions.He was asked how he decided what to use from the book, and what to leave out. His answer blew me away. He said, 'These characters are know and loved by so many people, I was literally having panic attacks during the script writing. And then, someone told me to stop worrying about the book, and make the best movie I can. You see, with the exception of Harry Potter, even with the most popular books, the percentage of people who come to a movie who actually read the book is still under 10%. And you simply can't make a movie for the 10%. It will always fail. You have to make a movie knowing that 90% of the people have no idea who these characters are. It's really all about the numbers'.So, knowing this, does this still make you angry?I didn't say it was fair. But it is what it is. Once you accept this, you'll see how much more enjoyable movies can be.There will always be book snobs. That's just life. But if you read their reviews, you'll see a pattern. Look, everyone who enjoys a book has their favorite character. And every one of them has characters they dislike/hate. And trust me, they will tell you. They will let you know what the movie 'did wrong'. And again, it's always different. So my question is, 'how in Gods name can they please every book reader?The answer is simple,,,,Obviously, they can't.So. Did I like this movie? Yes. But were their things I wish were done differently? Of course.But I'm not going to list them. Because I'd rather be happy that one of my favorite books (trilogies), got some national attention.So if you read the books and are upset with the movie, I'm sorry. I know how you feel.

And then we find out there are other towns all around this planet (called ""New World"") with men, women and children, and they also are okay with this whole town of men who murdered a whole town of women and girls.And it also doesn't make any sense that a boy (Todd) would grow up in a violent rural setting and have little to no fighting skills.

Also I can imagine converting a trilogy into a movie, especially with something that we have not seen before on the big screen (visible thoughts) is not a small feat. All things considered, I think the director and the CGI work in this movie is pretty good. I was expecting another silly sci-fi coming in, but I was pleasantly surprised. The production delays of this movie might have been worth it and maybe cleared out some of the pitfalls of screening such a story.Overall I liked it, one of the better sci-fi flicks of the year. I can't believe there are 1 & 2 star reviews for this. Acting is above average, so is the story, plausibility and filming. It is a shame that maybe the core target audience of this movie is the book enthusiast that will have the most criticism over this work. Again, without reading the book I could see a few things that didn't make sense (like old-school doors on a space-dome) but it is ignore-able and overall it is a plausible story and an interesting one at that.I hope they do make a 2nd installment for this movie, if they do I'd be sure to watch it.

136,cristinalinderman,An entertaining adaptation but lacked depth.,5,4 April 2021,"* There is no end credit scene *The director Doug Liman and crew brought an entertaining adaptation but lacked depth. I love to read certain genres and this book series was my kind of book but I couldn't read it because the first book's point of view was completely a male character. A long time ago I did gave it a try on reading a book with a male's point of view but it was torture, even though the story was interesting my mind wanted a female character for me to able to really get more invested in the world and easily put myself into that world. That was the first and last time I read a book only from a male's point of view. It was kind of refreshing watching a movie based on a book I haven't read. The movie captured me quickly, it was such a great story, a planet causing the men to hear each other's thoughts called the Noise. I was on edge throughout the whole movie because watching how they heard every single thought was unbearable. The mind will betray you even at the moment of trying to save a life and the visual effects of the Noise were phenomenal.The composers Marco Beltrami and Brandon Roberts set the perfect science-fiction music to this unique world. I loved the music theme, it goes incredibly with the story and it captured beautifully the New World.The cast was great but the script was too light and not making the proper time to give any a more solid background. The two main actors were the exception but I would have liked more connection, though what was shown was more than enough for me to like these two, Tom Holland as Todd and Daisy Ridley as Viola. Even though the scenes were rushing too much, both of them were extraordinary. Their performance was keeping the movie afloat but it doesn't stray away from how the story needed to explore deeply what they were unfolding like the moment when they arrive in another town. A lot of scenes felt too superficial not giving other characters time to have a weight and a purpose in the presence of the main characters. I really enjoyed the chemistry between Tom Holland and Daisy Ridley it was such an adorable and awkward connection. I liked the way she looked at him when his thoughts were on display. I kept forgetting about the hollowness of the story while the movie was trying to keep up with these two amazing actors.There was one scene I can't watch ever again, I will always skip the river scene, and I won't spoil what happens. I'm just going to say that I find it disturbing the way they shot that heartbreaking scene. When I watched it, my tears couldn't handle what I was about to see I know it was just a movie but I invest in what I watch and that is the point of a story. My heart was completely heartbroken and from that point on I felt detached from the movie by that moment. I get if they needed that to happen but there are ways to do it without showing it in a very horrifying way. There are a lot of good movies having those kinds of scenes and when I rewatched I just skip it or don't watch until the scene moves on, but none of them were as disturbing as this one. It took me so much time to stop crying and to keep watching and since I felt detached what made me keep not losing interest in the movie was Tom Holland and Daisy Ridley, their performance gave me the strength to finish the film.Watching this film made me yearn for more even though it wasn't great I hope they adapt the sequel because I want to watch more of the two main characters, what the Noise is really about since is not affecting the women and about the natives who are called the Spackle. I really hope the studios give the greenlight and take a chance to make it better in the sequel and with a new director because I wouldn't be able to endure again to read a male's point of view to know more about this intriguing story.",Chaos Walking

It's also got a nice little sci-fi concept where the males who have landed on the planet are subject to an effect called ""the noise"", which projects their thoughts aloud. Some of the concepts like the actual backstory of Prentisstown in relation to the other human settlements and the native species that inhabits the planet would have been welcomed.

What isn't is the mediocre plot, and the pace of the narrative.There are pieces of brilliance throughout the movie but they're scattered in-between far too many (In my opinion) slow pace. Somehow when the narrative start to get tense and speed along, the narrative puts a huge brake on the pace, and everything slows down to a boring crawl. Before picking up again. But by that time, the tense the story has built, has been lost.Tom Holland, once again delivers a brilliant performance (he's definitely an actor to watch). His performance is equally matched by Daisy Ridley's equally brilliant efforts - though I feel she was under utilised in this movie.I like how the movie slowly unveils itself to the viewers. Which keeps us guessing on what's around the corner.

152,alexkzapf,What a letdown,3,4 April 2021,"I love movies. Especially when they try something new or introduce a new concept. When I saw the trailer. I got excited. This looked new and fresh and had a good feel to it. Unfortunately, this is a case, where the trailer is the best part.I've read other reviews. And while I have not read the source material, those who have claimed to, seem to say that the story was completely butchered. Sans one reviewer And only one.The story is non-existent. There is no real explanation for the motivation of Mads character. Just utter nonsense. Hey guys. Let's kill the women because we can't read or see their thoughts. What in the actual f$&;. What was the endgame to that? So you're just going to get rid of all the women. Therefore nailing your own coffin shut. And eventually not continue the human race.And the other tribe that had women. How did this come about? Did they escape the massacre? If so. How? One of their compatriots came from that other tribe.Holland's character never completes any sort of arc. A good story takes characters and takes them on a journey. As the viewer, we follow along and at the end of the story they would have completed some type of growth or awakening.Daisy does a good job of her character. Although, I feel, that the extend of her acting is looking lost and disinterested in anything that is going on. And always playing the person who seems they'd rather be alone than with anyone. Just my opinion. I feel she hasn't gotten a real chance to show what she can do. Hopefully the dumpster fire that was the Disney Star Wars trilogy has not ruined her career. We never get to understand her at all. Except that her ship crashed and now she is trying to contact her people.I've read that there were comprehensive rewrites and reshoots. This hardly ever bodes well for a movie. If you noticed. I did not mention the towns names or anything. Quite frankly. Couldn't remember. That is how confusing and forgetful the story is. It truly distracts you from paying attention. The entire time I kept asking why?The worst part, they are on an alien planet. And we only see the alien or native species once. And for about ten seconds. What in the hell. At the climax. Mads character, who for most of the movie showed himself to be cold-hearted and unflinching in his conviction, is scared by a person he knows is projected. ???? Wow. Just wow.Now. I like a story that makes me think and challenges me. But. This story does neither one in the right way. You will find yourself chaotically thinking. Why. Repeatedly. Had they opted for a true trilogy as some have mentioned. We may have gotten a coherent story. But. As it is. Either because of studio interference or director being lost. Or someone just saying. Nah, it'll be fine. Quote from my favorite movie reviewer. The story is utter garbage.It seems that now at days. A lot of people are satisfied with no story and just crave mindless movies. Hey. I love a blockbuster brainless movie every once in a while. But. When I see a trailer for a movie that looks to bring something new and fresh. That's what I want to see unfold before my eyes. So. If you want to see a movie where a character says their name over and over again. And we are able to see his thought. Than. Go ahead and watch this movie.There are so many more issues. I simply am as tired of writing this review. As I am of non coherent stories in movie now at days. Hopefully this review will help someone or not. I had some time to spare. And kept thinking why?What is up with all the high scores. It saying they are wrong. Everyone's opinion is true. It's their opinion. But. Some high scores remarked ""fantastic story"". Uh. No. Sorry. You can score the movie high on other merits. But. The story is nonexistent. There is no story. We jump from scene to scene. Again. If you liked the movie. Great. But. Don't sit here and say the story was good. This is not even a good popcorn flick. It's annoying at best. And. It's obvious they knew that the story was not engaging at all. So.

It's got an interesting premise and the movie is competently made. Compared to some of the crap that's come out recently, this should be considered for an Oscar, frankly.Daisy Ridley does a good job in this movie. And Tom Holland is a good protagonist. The movie has tension, it keeps you on the edge of your seat. The movie does have a bit of a slow burn. But I think that's a good thing with what I would consider fairly hard science fiction. I would put this on the same level as a movie like Oblivion.Anyway, ignore the haters. If you enjoy science fiction- real science fiction- then this is a solid movie.UPDATE: As I'm watching the movie, I'm trying to figure out why people hate it so much. Is it the differences between men versus women? I recognize that's a REALLY touchy subject these days. But this almost perfectly describes our differences. Men have to fight their baser instincts. Men have to dominate their feelings. Women have more control over their thoughts. They're also more in touch with their feelings. This is a fantastic allegory, to be honest. I'm quite impressed.

156,northernpaladin,What?,4,11 August 2021,"Well it's official, Daisy Ridley really can't act and Tom Holland is not far behind in the over promoted league.I watched this mainly because Doug Liman was directing, thinking that someone who gave us films like, The Bourne Identity, Edge of Tomorrow and The Wall, could make a passable sci fi story. How wrong I was! I don't know whether it was the script or he just couldn't get into the groove of the books but this was poor work indeed, not helped by the wooden performances of Ridley and Holland.The basic idea of an all male settlement on an alien world where the men's thoughts are visible to all is intriguing enough and the disturbance the arrival of a female outsider creates should propel the narrative but it doesn't. We are told all the women were killed by the native planet dwellers which even when it is said you think 'what? The men all have guns'. Then when we get to the reveal (spoiler) that this is a lie the truth never makes sense and is never adequately explained. The fear of other outsiders turning up is never rationalised and even as a a parable of our current fears doesn't work. The reasoning behind the actions of the Mikkelsen character are never explained and lack any rationale path but pale into insignificance when compared to David Oyelowo's comic book religious villain; these two guys just took the cheque and walked through the film without a care for the final product.A poor effort by all concerned and not to be bothered with.",Chaos Walking
157,TheLegendOfThe42,Another brilliant satire,5,4 April 2021,"Far in the future, when humankind has interstellar travel and colonizes distant earth-like planets, a capsule that is shaped like a 20th century capsule crashes on one of those planets which is very adequately and creatively called ""New World"". A world where settlers live like in the 19th century. Obviously.Now, this ""New World"" has some neat little surprises in store for us. One of them is so nonsensical that it would immediately pull you out of the film, but alas, in satire, everything is allowed.You see, this planet makes it so that everyone can hear and even see your thoughts. But strangely enough, only men are affected. Women's thoughts remain inside their heads. So clever. Who knows what women really think anyway, right?I would really question how this actually works and why this mechanism seems to be perfectly tuned to only work on human males, but again, that's why this is a satire. The whole backdrop is just some silly construct to serve as the perfect setting. Because in anything else than a satire, this whole premise would seem so naively put together that you would laugh it off immediately.Down there, in one of those settlements, our story begins. And with the crashed Gemini capsule, the clever writers introduce a woman into an all-male village. See, this gives this smart construct an opportunity to create conflict and mystery. But even more so it does what it actually sets out to do: expose men for what they are. Violent, primitive, horny pigs that actually KILLED all the women because they couldn't bear being exposed as those violent, primitive, horny pigs anymore. Yup, that's actually what happened there.This, of course, is utterly fantastic, cunningly exposing toxic masculinity for what it is. Because, you know, men without women are nothing, which is brilliantly shown when our main characters arrive in another settlement. There, everything is fine. Why, you ask? Because it's governed by a diverse woman.We have to talk about the ending. It's so mind-blowing and positive that I can barely put my amazement into words. See, the crashed girl is from a second wave of settlers, the more civilized ones, and in the end, she manages to call them for help while killing the most toxic of the toxic males, the one responsible for killing all the women, thus ending the patriarchy. And she takes our male main character into a bright future.Some details that speak for the utter brilliance of the filmmakers:
Casting Tom Holland was genius. Pure genius. Because while everyone else has those nasty beards, Tom Holland apparently can't really grow one. A clear sign that he's gonna be saved in the end, missing this subtle sign of toxicity.The little messages are pretty clear: Every toxic male gets the rope. Those meat eating, fur wearing machos! The new wave is here, even if the writers decided to call it the second one, despite obviously meaning the third one. Wink wink, nudge nudge, say no more!There even is a very well-developed colonization critique in this movie. Natives that are being killed by humans because they don't want to share their planet. Incredible, how amazingly the writers have woven in that aspect to total satisfaction.If you want the ultimate woke satire that the patriarchy will not recognize, since it looks like an utterly stupid pseudo-sci-fi movie on the surface, look no further. After all, what is a man other than CHAOS WALKING, right? Wink wink.",Chaos Walking

161,kaideneve,Standard sci-fi fare,6,7 May 2021,"This is one movie I think has a fairly accurate rating for what it is (currently sits at 5.7). We're introduced to an all-male human settlement on another world where the females have apparently been slaughtered by an alien race native to the planet. To top it off, every male has a 'noise' emitting from their heads that is visible and expresses what the person is thinking. The mayor of the settlement is able to control his noise and even use it to create illusions and influence others. Females don't have this noise, which is hinted as a reason to why the aliens killed them.It's actually a pretty cool sci-fi premise, and the movie does a satisfactory job with it, emphasis on 'satisfactory'. I feel like both the characters, noise abilities, and the world could have been explored a great deal more. For example, the only encounter with the alien on the planet is fairly anti-climactic, after which we hear nothing more about them.The characters are pretty basic, and aside from the main character (played by Holland), their histories are never really explored. There's also a wacko priest who I have no idea what his purpose is other than to spout pointless nonsense which is supposed to be key to the plot.I'd say the acting is good given the script the actors were given.

I state the obvious because it is clear many reviewers don't understand the difference in the abilities of a book v movie to convey length and breadth of meaning.

The overlapping dialogue (audible thoughts competing with conversations) gets very annoying, quickly.If that weren't enough, the weird clan cultures that exist are too bizarre and unrealistic. The fact that an obviously insane ""preacher"", who calls for killing all women in a village, is put in a position of authority is lame storytelling.The secondary characters are all one dimensional. The big solution that saves the day? An incredibly weak and not believable clunky technological answer that reeks of more bad storytelling.Holland does okay. Daisy Ridley has no chance to rise above her material because the way it's written any actress of any skill level could have been cast in the role. And Mads is stuck in a crazed end-of-the-world local baron that we've all seen before (Gary Oldman in The Book Of Eli, Dennis Hopper in Waterworld) except it's not written well either.Don't start watching this hoping it will get better as it goes along, because it won't.

It's ok but that's about all.",Chaos Walking
172,Jim_Screechy,Only Half a Movie Really,5,1 April 2021,"By the time I made it to the end of this movie I felt like you do when you go to the rest room half way through a meal only to return and find the waitress has cleared away your food.It has an interesting plot - colonist ships leave earth to find a new home and a better life, but things go sideways when the new planet they find and land on has unexpected psionic forces that affect men.Unfortunately very little is revealed throughout the majority of the movie, so although you get a quite detailed account of the effects this strange phenomenon has, you get little else about the planet, the particulars of their ordeal, or even the indigenous intelligent humanoid life that exist there. Your really just plonked into the setting with a ""these people are here, deal with it"" sort of experience.The effect is you can't really invest in the movie because your not given any information to do so. I was anxiously awaiting things to unfold to give me some thing to cling on, but it didn't really come, not even at a intravenous drip pace...that is till the 3rd quarter where I was a little detached from the proceedings.Its a real Firefly-esque type world setting, where there is limited real technology to speak of and everyone is riding around on horseback acting (and speaking) like Wyatt Earp. The main focus is Tom Holland's character, saddled with Daisy Ridley as they try to escape the rag-tag posse on horseback that is chasing them... seriously! For the most part this consists of Tom and Daisy shambling through lush green forests guarding any talk of their young experience like its granny's best china.Tom Holland carries this one almost singlehandedly. There isn't a lot for Daisy Ridley to do other than reveal nothing and remain as distant as possible as she reluctantly follows Holland while they try to reach their destination, all whilst evading the pursuing posse. Unfortunately as an actress she doesn't really have the range to pull this off, and what you really get is a very wooden performance which doesn't compliment Hollands efforts particularly well.There is certainly a lot of suspense and build up. This aspect of the movie is done well, so there is a lot that keep you interested, but I'd never go so far as to say I enjoyed it. The swiss cheese story structure simply leaves too many unaddressed issues of significance to ignore.For the most part its watchable, but not enjoyable or even entertaining.If I had the opportunity to watch it again I wouldn't, and more pertinently if I knew that this was the experience I'd be presented with beforehand, I wouldn't have watched it the first time.As such 5/10 is the most I could give this one, and can't recommend it.",Chaos Walking
173,neoclone07,Clearly rushed,5,13 April 2021,"By the time I saw the trailer, I didn't know it was based on a book. Got the movie, started watching it and thought to myself ""this is clearly based on a book"" because it felt so rushed, with undeveloped characters, several plot holes (no one noticed or heard a spaceship falling from the sky in flames only a couple kilometers away? Seriously?), bland acting, even though movie is crawling with superstars... and an entire sentient alien species to deal with... and what do they do? Squat! It makes Dark Tower looks like a masterpiece (and DT was baaad, very baaaad).Unfortunately, it had so much potential... why not make a series out of it? It wouldn't need great FX and writers would had the chance to come up with a thicker script.But nooo, intead, let's rush it, spend over 100 million on it and ruin it.Sometimes I just can't understand movie industry...By the way, Tom Holland's character sounds like a jerk saying his name all through the movie, which is another major plot hole... in a world where anyone (men only, actually) can see your thoughts, there's no reason on letting them notice you're trying to hide something because you can't think on it, because, well, they can see you doing that.

He is so good at developing characters and everyone in this movie was one dimensional. Its worst crime is that with a huge budget, great source material, and good actors...they still couldn't afford a plot? It gets pretty boring and alienates both people who have and haven't read the books. What a waste of resources. Studios should have learned that fans require more out of adaptations and sci-fi.

There is no character development, no brief introduction to the native species (the Spackles) of the New World. Only one goal. She needs to communicate with her people. Are you excited about how it would be glancing at the unfiltered thoughts of the settlers? Well, abandon all that high expectations of yours. Sorry to disappoint, but the farthest their thoughts go out of filter is when Todd thinks of not letting Viola go, or kissing Viola manifested by his own Noise (twice). They failed to show how thoughts unfiltered can really be and how out-of-balance they could be.

183,nwsts,The elephant blocking the movie,2,4 April 2021,"I'm a scifi nut and this is *not* a scifi movie. Worse still, the movie has huge blurry thought bubbles the size of elephants overlaid constantly on the screen and worse than that the movie has incessant thought dialog from 2 or 3 or even more people overlaid over each other all at once making for a jumbled mess of audio. If the goal was to give the audience a nerve-wracking headache then mission accomplished. And, if you sit through the above agony, you'll find a story that is nothing more than a hiking-through-the woods western with the fakiest ""futuristic"" laser rifles I've ever seen. This movie is one gigantic bust.

What a waste of budget, but most of all, what a waste of a good concept. In the first 15 minutes I was actually really interested in the story. The concept of people seeing your thoughts is terrifying, and with a cast like this you would think it would at least be a decent watch. Well, about that. The execution is so frustrating to watch. There are a lot of interesting elements, but none of them are good developed. Also, the so called 'noise' is so inconsistent, it hurts. Apparently, people can only think when the camera is on them and everything else is quiet. And there are so many more things like this. It's not the worst movie of the year. The acting is solid and some jokes and action moments are actually really good, but the main story is just too underdeveloped to really enjoy.

The movie has good, dynamic action, but there is a lack of pace to the chases. I wish they had developed the history of the natives much more. I wish they had developed the story of the first wave much more. Still, it is an entertaining movie, with some suspense and light humor.

We are at strange planet where first wave of human colonists landed and men has their thoughts projected around them, not for ladies. Tom is playing character.... Named.... Damn i know they said it in the beginning but... It was... T something... Lets that be lesson to all creaters to repeat main character's name at least several times. Jokes a side repeating his name was annoying and stupid since by that everyone knows he's hiding something. There are locals... Mysterious... Caused big thing in the story... Well theres not much about them unfortunately even we saw they react differently to cosmic lady, unfortunately creators decided not to explained it. There's huge twist... Well pretty much obvious after 10mins from the start so not really a surprised either in the revelation in the middle of the story and even more stupid is that it wasnt done by one guy but all of them... I mean like they were ok that their wives and sisters were included... And even after that they didnt move to another camp or just run away from evil man. How they want to survived without women and having babies? Story has so many holes and action is... Like speed walking in forest so it cant really pull you out of those nonsenses. Characters are wierd, evil guy can influence minds of others for shortime somehow even nobodyelse can do it, he is also the only one reaching level grandmaster wizard in illusion but somehow being twice fooled by others... Because. Tom's dad knows everything but even being super nice he seems to be rather threat like a garbage in evil village near evil man who badly influences his son. Wicked fanatic priest....

193,iamMarkPrice,Cliché walking,1,6 April 2021,"This movie is as basic as a story can get and still technically be called a story. It sets out the framework of a story, but never builds upon it.Boy meets girl, girl is apprehensive at first. Girl needs item. Boy knows how to get item. Boy and girl must quest for item. Boy endears himself to girl over quest Girl decides to stay.It's a basic framework of thousands of movies, detailed in script writing books the world over as a basic framework. Normally mentioning it wouldn't require a spoiler alert, there would be so much more on top to build out the story that such a framework would be trivial. Unfortunately, Chaos Walking does need a spoiler alert when mentioning this framework. There is nothing else, quite literally, to the movie. So congratulations, you just heard the entire film and I saved you an afternoon of disappointment.There are no real stakes, every problem is instantly and miraculously overcome. Every loss is momentary fleeting before it's forgotten by all.Outcomes do not matter in Chaos Walking and the core protagonists are never in any danger. It's the kind of sloppy writing your highschool English teacher fails you on but somehow managed to become a punished book and film.One cannot even redeem this film by calling it young adult fiction, even teen audiences will come out wondering wtf they just wasted their time on.This is a movie that should have been shelved in 2017, not reshot.

201,taranpannu01,Chaos Walking (2021),7,7 March 2021,"I have been waiting for this film to come out since it was announced Mads Mikkelsen would be joining the cast in 2017. Since then I have followed the troubled production, read the books (which are great) and have just been patient and it all came to a close in an a brisk 1hr 49m film.Firstly, I think most of the reviews for this film are genuinely harsh and unfair. I was expecting a really messy film and I can't lie, it was not as messy as I believed it could've been. The third act is easily the worst as it takes a lot of liberties with the the book but the first half is as good as an adaptation as cinematically possibly. Yes a lot is not in it, but the feeling, tone and aesthetic of the book (at least how I read it) was fairly consistent and faithful.The 3rd act has clearly been reshot during the dreaded reshoots with Tom Holland sporting a poor wig and the absence of Oscar Jaenada's fan favourite character Wilf no longer in the film.Performances are solid Holland and Daisy Ridley share decent chemistry and feel like their characters. There is decent humour and attempts at heart that will likely work on younger audiences. All in all they felt like their characters.Mads Mikkelsen as usual stole the show and ate the scenery as the villainous Mayor, although some liberties were taken with his character, he still embodied him with the charisma and secrecy found within him in the book.David Oyelowo was great as the mad Preacher Aaron who was a favourite of mine in the book, I wished they had more of him and the whole idea of sacrifice that was in the book but still a great, hammy performance.Equally, my other book favourite characters were done justice, Ben and Cillian played by Demian Bichir and a PERFECT casting of Kurt Sutter were good and were glad that they still kept their respected arcs.Cynthia Erivo did what she could with her limited screentime, her scene with Mikkelsen was a highlight. Sadly Nick Jonas did not make an impression at all as his character just doesn't do much unlike the book, Davy Jr is a huge character in the first book and I believe he was most likely rewritten out of the third act.The cinematography was actually surprisingly decent, the editing I was expecting to be a shocker due to the lack of the editors experience and certain reviews but again, not bad at all. The visual effects were the obvious standout and there were some great shots of the noise and how characters used it. The Spackle were a little underused and so was Manchee (although the animal performances from horses and puppies alike were impressive)I think a lot of reviewers problem with the film were story based, having read the books I think because I already knew the history and the world I wasn't having to be introduced to certain ideas and elements that first time viewers might find to chaotic. Sorry, couldn't resist.Overall this film does a good job of capturing the intense, world establishing feel of the first book and attempts to make it a little more viewer friendly (which judging by the reviews hasn't worked) and the outcome is an ensemble cast doing their best with a well scored, shot and visually impressive film that races to the finish and falls just a little flat for this book fan. Not disappointed at all though.",Chaos Walking

I loved the world and the large set pieces which really made the story come to life. The ""noise"" FX were reminiscent of the ""Shimmer"" in Annihilation, but were subtle and executed well, I thought. Supporting cast was good and the characters, like the Preacher and the Mayor had character backstories which genuinely provoked my curiosity, which ultimately turned against me and soured the rating I wanted to give this creative little film.I really wanted to love this more than I actually did, and the primary distraction for me was the various sub-plot points which are introduced, then ignored or left unfulfilled. It felt as though this movie was meant to be more but got castrated on the editing room floor. The script, while based on a fascinating premise, is poorly fleshed out in an almost amateurish fashion unbefitting the all star cast and visuals.--spoiler alert
I don't believe everything needs explaining, and I respect when a movie leaves some things to your imagination, but this movie left way too much to the imagination, seemingly without any cause for doing so. The writing built up several elements of character arc or story development, only to forget they existed or rush past an explanation. In a typical end-of-the-world Michael Bay film this might be expected, and be made up for by larger than life action sequences or something to distract you from the paper thin plot. This film, however, had a very promising plot that seemed rich and ready to be nurtured into a blossoming low-key sci-fi hit. Left unexplained were some key questions:
Why were settlers on this world?
What's the story of the native species?
Are the natives really dangerous?
If their ""noise"" clouds are so clearly visible why can't their thoughts be heard in the brief encounter where they actually appear on-screen?
How did one main bad guy convince a whole village of men to murder all the women? That, being central to the plot, was weakly explained to the point I felt incredulous. You're telling me a persuasive instigator managed to talk EVERY man in a village into killing their lovers and children? No way.
Why doesn't Todd use his noise powers? It's hinted from the opening scenes that he can manifest cool apparitions with his focus, but there's no payoff on this hint until the final scenes, and there could have been so much more.
Why did the colonies lose contact with the ships and completely neglect communications?
And why, if none of the colonies kept a form of coms, did this long abandoned ship have a working transmitter?
Why is there ""noise"" on this planet?
Why does it only affect men?Unlike some movies, which feel poorly written and thin, the plot material here actually felt like these questions had answers. It felt like somewhere someone wrote them into the script and for some reason the movie cut them out. That was the most frustrating part. The story WAS THERE, the answers were there. Why not let the audience in? Convince us?Develop the characters and earn the climax.Still, a very ok movie. An almost awesome movie.",Chaos Walking

213,orangehenryviii,Chaos walked out of the theater,1,2 April 2021,"First off, this is a bad made-for-tv level production with a big name cast who apparently ate all of the budget with nary a nickel left over for a set, so they pulled the ol' SyFy Firefly trick of making outer space westerny and filming in the nearest field with wardrobe salvaged out of storage. However, most distastefully, this movie is rife with gratuitous scenes of animal cruelty. Why, why, why? I've no idea, they are of no intrinsic value to the story and are of a particularly mean and nasty nature. If you are an animal lover you will want to avoid this one, I felt like throwing up. The story and plot are unbearable tripe anyway. Finally I have to say, a bleached-blonde Daisy Ridley did not sit well with my eyeballs.

It will leave a lot of unanswered questions in the end unless you read all the books beforehand. What's worse, all these special properties of the world are pointless in terms of world and character development. All you see is just another Wild West with a bit of funny Noise effects and some (very little!) alien fauna, and all this never impacts the story in any meaningful way.Tom Holland and Mads Mikkelsen are good, as expected. Even Daisy Ridley is more or less okay. Their characters are not. You can understand what drives the young Todd, he's the most developed one, still, there's a lot to reveal in his background, in his past, in his relations with the other settlers of his town. Others are worse than that. Most of them talk riddles all the time, just like in a teenager's fan fiction, and the Noise never helps there.Another problem is the lack of reason, the lack of sense. There's just a lot of tiny little details that clearly make no sense, both in character's judgement, in their actions and in the world itself.Overall. This is bad as a tale. This is bad science fiction. And this is also bad in terms of storytelling. What I liked: the new fresh world, and the beautiful visuals.

229,ddmcd-34250,"Reminded me of a Heinlein ""Juvenile""",7,1 September 2021,"Watching CHAOS WALKING (on Hulu) reminded me of a sumptuously produced Heinlein ""juvenile"" novel. We have a young here tottering on the edge of adulthood. He's eager to Do Something More With His Life, a theme to be popularized later by Luke Skywalker.That reference to Heinlein is not meant as a putdown. I cut my sci-fi teeth on Heinlein novels and still have fond memories of The Rolling Stones, Have Spacesuit Will Travel, and Citizen of the Galaxy. In fact, this movie is based on an YA novel trilogy (by Patrick Ness). That shows by some of the punches that are pulled both dramatically and dialog-wise.Nevertheless we have a very well constructed action-adventure with some very interesting concepts at the core including telepathy and a female-free planetary colony that has lost touch with its Earth roots and now depends on a minimum of technology to scratch out an existence.What really saves the movie is the camaraderie that develops between the two leads played by Tom Holland (as the young and impulsive guy) and Daisy Ridley (as the calm and collected astronaut whose ship has crashed and who is now being chased for reasons that will eventually be made clear). They are on screen constantly and, as movies like this are wont to do, they spend much of the movie on a dangerous cross country quest to find a more hospitable society. Adventure and well-produced action - including horseback and motorcycle chases - accompany them all along the way.A little research shows that this film has been much delayed and that much reshooting was required by the studio. It shows. There are plot loose ends and the very final scene between Holland and Ridley was clearly shot at the beginning - they both look noticeably younger. Still, it's an enjoyable and very attractive film populated by interesting characters and well done action sequences. Enjoyable.",Chaos Walking

They look ridiculous from the start and gets old really fast. The alien planet looks identical to Earth in every way though, they should have put some more money in that instead.The whole concept of thoughts bleeding out of yuur head for others to see must have worked a lot better in book form, in the movie it just comes down as ridiculous and annoying.Having said that, it's a fresh and original concept. So some credits for originality.The characters and the backstory seems quite rushed.

As sci-fi, it's a rather tired theme, the reversion to savagery in colonizers isolated from the warm embrace of earth. I may be overambitious, but I saw homage to ""The Revenant"", ""Cloud Atlas"", ""Avatar"", and ""Alien"". It looks as though it will have a much worse financial return than any of those, but that's the risk they took.There is a parable in the story, a central question in human relations: what if the thoughts of men were known? How would our society survive? The writers of this parable also pushed forward a distinction between that ugly thought mess which men have and women's thoughts do not, those (as revealed solely through actions and spoken words) being much more straightforward, uncomplicated, and yes, beautiful. It is no accident that the rating by women here is a full point higher than those of men.One additional point: The ""noise"" conceit of the original novel gives it all a stream-of-consciousness vibe that I haven't seen for awhile.

257,chloeurc,Pros and Cons,7,17 March 2021,"Pros:
The people. The actors and actresses in this movie aren't random people no one has heard of, they have Oscar nominees, Golden Globe nominees and BAFTA nominees in this film. Not to mention the two Marvel and Star Wars stars playing the lead roles. While this film is not exactly award worthy it's got a good cast, and I wouldn't say anyone does a bad job.The idea. The story is based off a book, a very Hunger Games/Maze Runner meets Passengers type book and apparently it is a popular one (although I've never heard of it). The idea of a futuristic sci-fi world where the women are gone and you can hear every man's thoughts makes for quite a story. A guy (Tom Holland) meets a female (Daisy Ridley) for the first time while trying to help her and save her life and the crazy journey that follows.The music and sound. Surprisingly, the suspenseful music was perfectly placed as well as the quality of sound and songs you hear as the characters were in the forest. Again, a reminder of the first Hunger Games in a way. I saw the movie in XD (which is similar to IMAX) so that may be why I was able to pick up on the immersive experience.Cons:I would of liked a better ending. While I won't give anything way, the ending could of been better. I've never read the book so I'm not sure if it was accurate or not, but I thought it could've ended in a different way that would of made the movie better.Animal lovers may have to close their eyes for a minute. About 3 animals die in this film and it's hard to watch. It's not a long scene by any means but the lead character mourns later and it is sad.Empty at times. You can tell there were probably moments from the book that were left out of the movie but you could tell something wasn't there. Although again I haven't read the book so I'm not entirely sure. Some moments are calm and may be boring for 5 minutes or so but it doesn't ruin anything entirely.Overall it was a 7/10. It wasn't a failure, I actually enjoyed it more than I thought I would, although I would of liked a little something extra.",Chaos Walking

If anything, he looks a touch out of place. Which was just perfect given the uncontrollable nature of the si-fi aspect.
Daisy, has of course, mastered the blank stare to perfection. Again, lifts the si-fi elements.
Supporting cast fit very well together. I could name drop. But read the cast list yourself and I'm pretty sure you'll see a standout name or 3 that will surprise you.
Having just read that this was based on a trilogy of books, (rights purchased by the studio back in 2011) I'm hoping it does well enough in profits to give us at least one spinoff. Even a tv series has potential. You'll see what I mean in the last 60 sec of the flick.
I was going to rate it a 6ish. Just because of it being like nothing else atm. But bumped it to 7 because of the production team producing such a nice fit with cast & the direction keeping the pace constantly interesting. You don't really get the chance to drift off in your own thoughts because you're too busy keeping up with theirs.

300,ckhr,Sadly a lot was left on the table..,6,11 June 2021,"I will start off by saying that this movie isn't perfect, however the things it got right, it definitely got right. That being said this shouldn't have been made into a movie. We live in a world where Netflix and HBO Max exist. I'm sure this could have been easily made into a 10 episode series in one of those two streaming platforms. Maybe not with the same actors (Tom Holland & Daisy Ridley) but those characters didn't need A-list actors to be interesting to the audience.I have a feeling that this is going to be a one and done sadly. Which is a shame really, because the world is very interesting. But the fate of this movie was set in stone when they formatted the story to fit the run time of a movie. I can tell a lot of things got left on the table. For example; what the hell happened with the native inhabitants of the planet? There was a moment where it looked Viola was controlling one of them and it was never spoken of ever again. Do women have a hidden power we don't know of? We'll never know.Mads Mikkelsen did what he could. His character was poorly written. If I didn't know him from his other work I would have completely dismissed him as an actor all together. It seemed like he was just a bad guy just for the sake of being bad. He was a bad guy without a motive.The preacher was useless, only cool thing about that character was how visible his anger was through his noise. Which spoke to me in a personal level as I've dealt with plenty of religious leaders who turned out to have ill intentions. But to someone who doesn't have the same life experiences as me, this character will be useless to them.I liked the idea of a planet granting people different abilities. In a way it reminded me of Kal-El. Regular guy where he's from, but Superman on Earth. Very interesting concept, too bad this will be the end of it.",Chaos Walking

To be fair we didn't know much about it and hadn't (thankfully) read any of the reviews beforehand. We just really wanted to go to the cinema and there wasn't much on and we both liked Daisy Ridley and Tom Holland.The storyline I felt was a difficult one to pull off and it was done excellently. I'm not going to give away the plot or story but I cannot possibly see how else or better it could have been done. The acting from the two main cast members were really good. Was it an Oscar movie? No of not. However did it keep your attention for the entire duration of the movie? Yes. Was the audience captivated. Yes. Did you feel for both of the main characters? Yes. To me that's what makes a good movie. Also what makes a good movie is when it's over you have a smile on your face and you turn to the person next to you and both say ""that was actually a really good movie! I really enjoyed that!""

303,cmhouser,"Not good, not terrible, definitely not like the books",4,4 April 2021,"It's real hard to pan a $100+ million dollar movie starring a bunch of really talented actors but here we go. I'm going to approach this review as-if someone hasn't read the books as the difference between the movie and the book series is monumental.If you don't know anything about the premise of the movie and haven't read the books, it's going to seem like a rather silly story to you. If you've read the books it may still like a silly screen play. Unfortunately, they never really attempt to explain some things in the movie which are crucial to connecting to it and without those it seems like a bad Netflix sci-fi with good actors and lots of budget for CGI.Scenery and Cinematography are excellent. Screen play and writing, not so much. The acting for the most part is good but they should have recast Daisy Ridley's role as she is too dry for a more dramatic role. I like Ridley as an actress but she seems to fall short in dramatic roles that need emotion. Tom Holland does an excellent job even if he's still learning, as well. Mads is obviously the most experienced one on the set.The story is just weak and never really explores its options despite the book giving them plenty of direction. They should have spent another hour on the story in the movie but at second thought... it may have gotten worse. Not good, not terrible and DEFINITELY not like the books.",Chaos Walking

And if you see propaganda here you're the one with an agenda,10,17 September 2021,"Good acting, good effects, well developed world that needs at least two or three other adaptations of the books to really come to life. A lot of genuinely thought-provoking and sad moments, especially thanks to the lead actor's performance.If saw what is happening in Afghanistan, or if you're simply a woman, you know how it feels to lose or gain any right depending on who is at the top. There's no propaganda here, only a sad truth of how our world is built and how it is easy to wipe minorities.In this movie, fortunately as we get to see three different worlds that clash, it becomes very soon obvious that it is the one born from ignorant hate, treachery and lies that is self-destructing. And I mean, nature knows how to take care of that kind of world. If you killed all your female population, you're going to disappear anyways. Good riddance.At the end, no 'man bad woman good' anywhere. Only what can await powerless minorities like there are so many in the world.",Chaos Walking
305,sneakychicken,Overall I liked the movie,7,12 April 2021,"I came with no expectations - didn't read the books (will be fixing that soon), didn't read the reviews either - and I wasn't disappointed. Now, I can kind of see where the negative reviews are coming from, I just don't see it as bad as they do. I do agree that some characters or events lack background. For example, I don't understand the religious nut, which could be an explanation in itself, but why they are tolerating him, why does he have the power to push people around being in absolute minority, why is he so aggressive - this is what I don't get, he didn't bring any value to the movie. It is clear who's good and who's bad, but they could have made the characters a little more multidimensional, so there's more intrigue. What I liked was the story overall, the actors, the costume design, the set, the CGI I thought was great. I actually thought that the thinking aloud concept was cool and funny, and it certainly didn't annoy me as it did some viewers - I believe in reality it would have been much the same, if not worse. I fail to see any negative connotations to this concept - it's just is the way it is on that planet, and it is portrayed in the main character that good people can have low thoughts, but it doesn't make them bad, it just makes them human - at the end of the day, it's what they do matters. I appreciate that the movie wasn't heavy or overly dramatic - it is just entertaining more than anything else. So I think the movie is worth a watch, I just wish it was a little better executed, because it left me wanting to know more about this universe they showed us. With that thought I am now going to go read the actual book - it's promising to be great and I'm hoping to get the answers I wanted from there :)",Chaos Walking

310,Son-of-WRA,"An annoying television episode inflated to movie size,",4,10 October 2021,"With sincere apologies to the three main stars, whose previous works have distinguished them, their individual performances couldn't lift this movie out of the ""seen it all before"" heap.Throughout this movie, all I could do from getting bored was to play a game of associating scenes with those of other films. After a while, I just became so annoyed at the distracting thoughts of Todd. Yeah, it was cute, melancholy and funny in spots, but it became a distraction before a third of the run time had elapsed.More importantly, The Noise wasn't as integral to the main plot. It played more into the relationship between Todd and Viola, but not as significant to the story as the black floaters in ""Alien: Covenant"". Perhaps I missed something in relating The Noise to the plot. But it just held no importance as far as I'm concerned.Usually, sci-fi films require a quick primer at the start in order to prepare viewers for the backdrop. Many times this does little to make a bad movie better. But I'll say for this one, the lack of backstory is actually a plus. I like trying to piece together the fictional reality in which the premise exists. I like mystery. I don't need to know as much as like not knowing. It's not an ignorant bliss mind you. It's more of an acceptable sense of intrigue.I take no joy in panning this particular title. I respect the three big names. The acting is believable, the setting a bit of a stretch and the special effects are pretty cool. If you aren't too much of a critic, or will watch anything, then this one's for you.Some light cursing, an out-of-focus view of a man's rear end and mild/strong violence are all a parent should be concerned about. Far from being the worst movie anyone could see, it was a bit bland for me. It had a lot of potential, but it came off as a humorless episode of ""Firefly"" more so than the movie it was no doubt meant to be.Sorry Daisy, Tom and Mads.

I'm a fan of the books and if you are too then don't even bother watching this dumpster fire. I saw an early screener and I could barely take this movie seriously. The villains goals are devoid of all logic, the humour is awful and dry, none of the events are really tied together, it feels like a bunch of scene strung together in a hope to come up with an actual plot. Daisy Ridley is fine, Tom Holland is fine, Mads Mikkelson as always is flawless but it would be good if they actually made his character have logical motivations or if they fleshed him out. These actors don't deserve this, Daisy was screwed over big time with the sequel trilogy and now this, I hope this isn't the end of her career. As for Tom, he needs a better agent. Cherry was a self indulgent disappointment, but not as bad as this. Do not watch this movie, it'll be a waste of time and money (if you're gonna buy or rent it) ESPECIALLY if you're a fan of the books. This movie massacres the books story and characters.

Beyond that, the plot is perfectly up to the task of delivering a satisfying, straightforward science-fantasy tale with allusions to historical scenarios that some will recognise, especially given the first-rate, committed acting performances.I think the main character is the new technique of representing surface thoughts (so fun!) and bravo to how well that's done - cutting new ground.

Yeah I know, he's 25, but he's typecasted isn't he?Mad Mikkelsen plays the leader of the community of men they're in. It's never explained why or how he's the leader, and answering that mystery would just be another 20 minutes you don't need in this movie.Daisy Ridley plays a young women who's a survivor from an earth like ship, on the planet they're all on. Of course she bumps into Todd, and the pair form a very cliched, formulaic plan to escape, (why?) and go to a safe heaven for her, whilst Todd will totally disown his entire family and community for this woman he's just met.Cue cliched encouragement from Mad Mikkelsen, who seems to have learnt his skills from the Gillette code book of how to be a toxic man.The Preacher, a character first introduced along side Todd/Tom, is never explained, and just speaks nonsense. His character is pointless and without any context in this film. All he serves as, is the leaders lead henchman, and its hysterical nonsense.What's sexist about this movie, is that the movie is all about division, where the men were driven mad by the idea men's inner voices could be heard out loud, whilst women didn't. This means (on this world) that men are unreliable, rude, liabilities that need to be managed by women apparently, or they're prone to group thinking, and being influenced to kill and murder. All the men in this film are BAD, all the women are PURE AND INNOCENT.Even the ending is like some kind of joke on men, as the lead character understandably quite fancies the only woman he's even seen in his life, and he's just friendzoned, despite saving her countless times, without even an explanation.

328,adamrosolowski,"Oh, it's one of those....",3,15 June 2021,"Yet another movie set to ingrain in your psyche that men are feeble in body and mind and inferior to women. It's all made of it, wrapped in it and infused with it. Daisy Ridley plays a stern-faced tomboy and Tom Holland is a mindless bimbo. It's a femdom flick but unfortunately without all the thrills. It doesn't really deserve any more to be written about it.In my book, three stars is a fair and generous prize for this 125m USD priced effort. It's just such a shame to see all that money gone to waste.Feel free to disagree. :-) However, if you agree with my opinion, you may want to watch a Polish comedy from 1984 called 'Sexmission'. They predicted that one day women will indoctrinate us that Copernicus was a woman. Looks like we are very close to that day now.",Chaos Walking
329,cole_groth,"Reading the books ruins the ending, everything else is fantastic.",8,5 March 2021,"""This is the most painful score I've ever had to give a movie. Yeah, I know, an 8/10 seems like it's rather high, but future me, I hope you realize how much you loved the Chaos Walking trilogy, and understand why this score seems so low to you. This should have been a 10/10. It's a fantastic concept for a movie that fails because everybody gave up. This movie took 9 years to complete, starting with a script from Charlie Kaufman back in 2012, which I'm sure was better than what we ended up with. When the film was originally completed in 2017, it was met with horrible reviews from test screenings. My theory is that this movie stayed faithful to its book counterpart, The Knife of Never Letting Go, and ended with Mayor Prentiss taking over the town of Haven. 4 years later, we get a different ending. Mayor Prentiss falls down a hole, Aaron the Preacher burns to death (?? it was very confusing), we never learn the fate of Davy, and Todd wakes up on a ship from the new settlers with Viola, seemingly continuing on with their lives. The biggest change in the whole book comes from the fact that the ship arrived early, however, there are no people seen on the ship. I absolutely hate that this movie will never get a sequel, because ALL of these changes could be resolved with a second film. But without a second movie, we are left with an ending that is far too open to interpretation and a series of totally missed character developments, especially from the relationship between Todd and Davy. Anyways, I just read the script written by Charlie Kaufman, and oh my god, if the movie was this, it would be my favorite film of all time. I can understand the change of the ending, because if it ended in the hopeless way that the book did, it would be extremely disappointing. Like any book adaptation, this one has several changes from the books, and many of them are actually pretty good additions, but there are a few glaring changes. Let me go through them one by one. Firstly, the animals don't speak. This proposes some real problems with Manchee, because his death (which surprisingly is still in the movie) is much less impactful, and is only as effective as """"awe I hate when cute puppies die"""". Secondly, Todd does not have nearly as good of a relationship with the Mayor as he's initially portrayed to. His feelings are much more complicated in the books, and it's a strange interpretation to make the Mayor this father figure for Todd when that's never what he was. Thirdly, Wilf and his scene are missing from this movie. Why? I don't really know. I remember reading the Wikipedia for this movie for months and seeing that Wilf was cast, but he seems to have been cut last second. Fourthly, the Spackle are underutilized. They only appear as semi-antagonists for a very short amount of time, and they skip to the scene where he attacks (in the book also killing) one of the Spackle, but then they NEVER appear. This was a very odd choice to me. Fifthly, there was a lot of missed opportunity with Aaron's death as well, because this was a fundamental scene for Todd and his """"I am not a killer"""" mentality that is core to his character.This all being said, there is actually a lot I seriously love about this movie. Firstly, the production design and music are absolutely fantastic, and there are some absolutely wonderful scenes that take place throughout this film. The first 90 minutes or so are absolutely a 10/10 from me. I love the romantic connection that Todd and Viola build, and I think there are plenty of hilarious scenes between the two of them. I've never been so happy at a movie before, and if the movie had kept this up until the very ending, it would have been my favorite movie of all time. I love the scene of Viola and Todd talking in the rain, because it's just so beautiful. The absence of Wilf's scene with the creatures described as the most beautiful Todd could even imagine might be missing, but there are some genuinely beautiful shots that I just fell in love with. Tom Holland getting butt ass naked was hilarious, and him and Daisy Ridley just have great chemistry in this film.Now why is this movie going to fail? Well, first of all, because of the 5 reasons I mentioned above. It's a critical failure right now, but that could be solved if it gets a second movie. Everything could be wrapped up by a sequel (or two), and it makes me wish that this was a limited series instead, with 15 episodes covering all three of the books. Anyways, what the hell happened to the marketing of this film? Tom Holland (the star), Doug Liman (the director), and Lionsgate (the production company), all just gave up on the film. There was no marketing from any of them, and poor Daisy Ridley was left with all of the marketing, so the movie probably won't make anywhere near its budget back at the box office. I want this movie to do well there, because if it does, then we could possibly have a second film, and I would bump this rating up so fast. Until then, I'm left with a hole in my heart, and I feel absolutely defeated by this film. I'm disappointed as hell, but I can't wait to finish Monsters of Men (the third and final book in the series). Chaos Walking was my most anticipated movie of all time, and with it releasing, I feel strangely empty now. I guess that's life.""",Chaos Walking

338,ajk232,Creative Premise Wasted,3,2 April 2021,"General Thoughts:A less thought out and less exciting or interesting ""YA"" movie aping off of the success of The Hunger Games and recent similar films. The general premise of a man's thoughts being vocalized without their consent has potential to be interesting, but is never used in a way more creative than a tween-level comedy trope of what I believe is supposed to be a teenager being unable to hide his affections for a girl. This film would have benefitted from a harder rating and its writer allowing more depraved or ""honest"" thoughts to escape from the men's brains in this film.The Good:The movie is relatively well shot, even though its color palate is extremely boring to look at, and blends together over the course of the film. It does not fall into the realm of un-watchable thanks to its creative premise, which it unfortunately does nothing interesting with.The Bad:Typical ""YA"" movie tropes in the form of taking an interesting or creative idea which has the potential to be fleshed out in a creative way and dumbing it down to appeal to a tween audience.

It doesn't pull you in. The story itself is sparse, even for a 100 minute movie. Actually the story feels more suited for a 45 minute television episode. And one could imagine that. As the premise ain't bad it could be interesting to explore such a world over multiple episodes. And I mean episodic television, without a continouus story. This movie right here, cut down to 45 minutes would be a great episode in that imaginary show.But that's all fantasy.

People have become programmed to accept junk. Totally called in cgi to cover bad story telling I now good apparently. Maybe they want a nonsensical smorgasbord of actual chaos in a standardized climactic scene that quickly becomes boring white noise despite the unending explosions. Or maybe they feel they need some political and social treatise on sexuality or some other issue. ALL movies of late, particularly sci-fi have left story telling and character development in favor of explosions and ridiculously unkillable heros. They have given in to the politics of gender exploration and sexual content that has no place in a basic hero story. EVERY movie does not have to be about that, there are plenty.A story like this is unique and has actual human characters with emotions and conflict, with actors that rely upon acting over simply jumping and rolling and never being hit by the thousands of bullets screaming by. It also has a whole community full of men with no mention of their sexuality. Apparently this is intellectually too much for today's movie goer who want the standard drivel that placates special interests and sacrifices story and all fans who just want to go to a movie without being assaulted by personal political and sexual views of writers and producers.I wish we could just get back to adventures for the sake of adventure and not make everything about cgi, sexuality and politics.",Chaos Walking

The story moves along at a good pace, feeling neither rushed nor drawn out.The acting and directing are both quite good. Character exposition and development occurs. The conclusion is satisfying and there are no loose ends. The glaring cosmetic continuity error is a blond Daisy Ridley with unnaturally dark eyebrows given her hair.A common stupidity is to compare a movie to its written originating source material (typically a novel).

356,forcech0ked,Beautiful and amazing movie.,10,21 March 2021,"Chaos walking was a fantastic movie, from the symbolism of the 'noise' and the actors. It was a master piece of 2021.I absolutely loved how we got to see into the men's heads, to be able to see their thoughts and feelings. It also shows how toxic masculinity affects young men with Todd telling himself to be a man and not let himself so weakness even though there's nothing wrong with it.
Tom Holland was a perfect choice, the way he becomes Todd is amazing. He really gets deep into the character and brings out his emotions and his reactions to his own thoughts. Telling himself to shut up or others to ignore him.
I also loved the 'aliens' I have my own theories that Mads character influenced the men (including Toms character) to see woman as the creatures which is why Daisy Ridleys character told Todd to stop but didn't say why.I also love the noise, they way we see it effect each character is beautiful, from the preachers angry and loud noise that he seemingly can't control to Mayor Prentiss who nearly acts like a God called 'the circle' even seeing how powerful Todd's noise is, is really cool and how it can influence how others act or perceive things.The soundtrack is also something I loved. Anytime Todd and Viola we're talking together there was no music bringing you into the scene and really feeling their emotions as well as being able to hear Todd's better. I think my favourite soundtrack would have to be when the preacher is following Todd and Viola in the river, the chaotic music with the scene worded perfectly and it really made you fear for the characters lives.Todd's character was quite an interesting one, we really get to see some amazing development through the movie where at first he's quite naive but over the course of the movie and as he starts to learn the truth we really see him start to understand the world and actually does better with controlling his noise to the point of tricking the Mayor, as well as his development with Viola and how he learns about girls.Overall I really enjoyed this movie, the actors that were chosen were perfect for this film and it was a joy to watch. I'd recommend this to anyone and there's so much more depth that I wouldn't have gotten and I love that.",Chaos Walking
357,willemsensem,Pretty well,7,14 July 2021,"So, it's pretty decent. For me it was even a bit sentimental for being this sci-fi teenage growing up kinda story, which could be made into a trilogy.In my youth at some point a few of those sci-fi trilogies came up; Divergent, The Maze Runner, Narnia, Hunger Games. This really brought me back to that time in my life. That is one of the main reasons I enjoyed this so much. The plot is a bit thin, but if worked out into a trilogy could be really nice. I felt there were a little bit too many details left out, which made it a bit dull at times. Still it's a very original concept with the noise and such.The acting was fine. I'm not a big fan of Tom Holland or the chemistry between Holland and Daisy Ridley. They both did what they could to develop their characters though. You just see that they're both not super experienced yet in these big roles, especially when there are not a lot of other characters around and they have to build the story on their own.The visuals are very nice. I really love how they visualised the noise and the colonies and all that.

359,adrianf2001,Another executed Sci-Fi franchise.,7,9 March 2021,"Chaos Walking for me was a great movie experience, the movie is simple and comparable to other big Sci-Fi franchises like Hunger Games or Maze Runner.
Although I've never been a fan of said movies, the world inside of CW takes you away from today's current world as you cling on to the interesting unique elements.
Unfortunately, Chaos Walking lacks a lot of depth as I imagine was solely because of the buildup to other sequels. As you finish watching CW, you're left with more questions than answers and I can agree that it may frustrate most people as it leaves a very incomplete feeling.
I don't know if I could say certain scenes needed more emotion or not given that both Tom Holland and Daisy Ridley were alright. Tom Holland being more exceptional, seems like his charming like-able self as he always knows the fine line of inserting his own personality with the roles he plays and never seems repetitive compared to other actors who cross that line. Again, one could argue against my opinion and I'd completely understand.
Dialogue comes off smoothly with majority of the characters and because of this the scenes are easily comprehensible which is always satisfying for a first time watch (especially for Sci-Fi's).
If I could say what could've helped audiences like CW more is a problem most of these franchises have; which is to not worry about money and rushing to set up a franchise before it's even well-received. I wish more thrill was added to the movie and overall the execution of the movie's conflict was fought against better rather than pushing it to the side in the end to have more to talk about in the sequel.",Chaos Walking

372,marc-shellard,What a waste of such fantastic source material,1,9 April 2021,"When I heard that Charlie Kaufman was writing the script to one of my favourite young adult science fiction series, I was excited to see what he would do with such wonderful source material.And as it goes with studios, they rewrote, reshot and massacred this project into a badly written, wet fart of an adaptation.For those who have read the series, don't waste your time. Nothing that made the books great is on display in this film. Mayor Prentiss is an amazing character but Mads is given nothing to do here he's just a basic villain. The spackle are poorly designed and are not a prominent feature of this story. No New Haven, no Ask and the Answer, I AM THE CIRCLE AND THE CIRCLE IS ME is not explained and is just there. At best, this is a reference to the source material and is basically an entirely different story.For those looking for a new sci-fi adventure, I'd say this fails as a film too. The story makes little sense, the acting is quite poor, the world, characters and their motivations are not established well at all. Things just happen for no particular reason. It's an intriguing concept that has awful execution, if you want explore this universe I recommend reading the books, they're wonderful.I can't believe this is a world where the Twilight franchise has 4 films and this series only has 1. As a film I'd give it 3/10 but for the dishonour and disrespect it gave the books I give it a 1/10. I'd love to see this series done properly, with 3 films each based on the 3 books, there's more than enough story for a franchise. Please let Charlie Kaufman write it his films are creative and interesting.",Chaos Walking

Of course, it's not a masterpiece and yes, a lot of things are lacking from the movie but I don't see it deserving a note below 6.My main bad point about this movie is that it feels like some scenes are missing. For example, when they arrive in the far branch, everybody hates him but he never tries to understand once why. I guess it's done like this to have the ""emotional"" book moment but it does not make sense, or the scene should have been placed before the one where people try to mug him.And to be honest, the death of the black guy seemed a bit odd to me.

BUT when it's declared that all women and girls have been killed and this is a logical reason for the lack of female colonist and you're given this information in the initial section of the film you have a strong indication that it's going to be an uphill struggle for the rest of the film.

He also kept me smiling with every noisy interaction to Daisy Ridley's calm persona.So what went wrong? It's hard to say.I can understand why some reviews would say this one waas dull or boring but I completely disagree with them. It's not high impact and there isn't a lot of deep thinking involved, well, at least not from the audience.While it starts off weird and annoying, the film grew on me and I wanted to see it through.

In the first book, there is a line that reads, ""The Noise is a man unfiltered, and without a filter, a man is just chaos walking.""I really wish they could have portrayed it better in the movie.They obviously can't since it would probably be a noise-filled mess, however people's minds are VERY loud, very fast, very full of thoughts, and the movie is pretty selective on when people's thoughts are heard and when they aren't. I understand there are a few who have mastered their thoughts, so to speak, but it still doesn't account for the overall unrealistic pauses and silences when there should be noise.I think if it's a trilogy of books, they probably could have done a film trilogy as well. The characters lack depth and we don't spend much time getting to know anyone, or really becoming attached to anyone or anything at all in the film.While it's pretty-looking, I find it was a bit empty and unmemorable overall.",Chaos Walking

I was originally upset that they used adult actors in their 20s to portray 12 year old preteens when they could've given actual child actors the opportunity, however I get that they probably wanted big names to help rake in the money or whatever. Despite playing roles they were not supposed to take, Tom and Daisy did a good job at bringing Todd and Viola to life. They embodied their personalities well.Considering there probably won't be a sequel (it was filmed like 4 years ago and forgotten about by everyone so I highly doubt there will be sequels, but who knows), I wish they showed more of the spackle. I also wish they made it longer and used all three of the books instead of just the first one. When it ended, I was kind of like ""THAT'S IT?? I WANT MORE""That being said, I loved it. Tom Holland gave an A+ performance once again, like he always does. His American accent was flawless, like always. Daisy Ridley was great too. The dog actor who played Manchee was exceptional and deserves a raise. Nick Jonas wasn't the worst, however they should've hired a real actor to play the role because I could not take him seriously and I just thought about Camp Rock every time he came on screen.For people who have NOT read the books, this movie was great.

The whole film, apparently based on a book or even a trilogy just seem to exist around the idea that men's thoughts could be heard by anyone on this planet, but not women's.

Unfortunately it wasn't long before my spidey senses started tingling.When it was mentioned that all women were dead on the planet & only men survived a wave of disappointment washed over me. The only question now was how it was going to be blamed on all men. The convenient indigenous Aliens were said to be the culprits but this was revealed so early on that I knew it couldn't possibly be the plot and more importantly it didn't paint men as the root of all evil so they couldn't possibly be villains of this story.It takes a little over an hour for the most obvious plot twist in history. Turns out, . . . . . Men did it!! What a shock, yet another film were the Patriarchy destroys lives.I mean it's just relentless at this point, ""MAN, BAD!!!"", christ we get it, how many times do we need to suffer the same worn out storyline, there is no suspense or plot twists left, all films & TV must come to the same conclusion, its men's fault, The End.All this woke culture is the death of art & freedom, its so disappointing but totally expected at the point. I gave it 2 stars out of hope but like all other disappointments it was destroyed by the writers/producers trying to force gender politics down your throat.

447,sambattyman,"Not as bad as I expected, but still fundamentally flawed",3,3 April 2021,"My expectations were extremely low and this didn't seem to be a film that i would get anything out of, but a simple plot, a few funny jokes and clever uses of the 'noise' at least made the film interesting.I've been following this films production for well over 2 years, and all things considered it wasn't as much of a mess as it could have been.The runtime being just an hour and a half meant that the film definitely didn't overstay its welcome. Taking into account how much of a mess this could have been, making it quite short was a good decision.All of the emotional beats that were supposed to have resonance did not come across at all how they were intended, with the dialogue in these moments raising from boring to laugh-out-loud cringe.My biggest complaint is how inconsistent and under-utilised the 'noise' was. At some points like when characters are hiding and trying their best to not think, it makes sense that they would be too scared to make noise, but there were times of big action scenes in which in order to simplify it, they didnt have character's 'noise saying anything.More importantly however, in scenes of high emotion between the characters, in order to not take away from the scene, they decide to just forget about characters thoughts all together.Overall, most of the film was a complete mess that had a clearly very simplified version of the story, that would work more effectively as a book. But considering the amount of production issues that this went through, it is never boring and has a few good moments.I'm still unsettled on 3/10 and 4/10.",Chaos Walking

450,aprilshikari,Better than expected!,10,6 March 2021,"I walked in predicting I would hate this film. With reshoots, delays, the lead (Tom Holland) barely mentioning the film and (at least in my country) zero marketing for it, everything told me this would be a flop. Although this film would have been a lot more successful being released closer to the Hunger Games and Maze Runner era I do think this is worth a watch if you're into that style of movie. I loved the idea (I'm so glad they did reshoots, the original plot sounded awful) I loved the way they did the ""Noise"" it reminded me of the way they did Ghost from Ant-Man and the Wasp. It was funnier than I was expecting and I loved the cringey, hard to watch, extremely relatable, awkward scenes between Holland and Ridley.Overall I don't know whether I like this film more because I had very low expectations going in, or because this was my first time in the cinemas since Invisible Man but I am honestly surprised at how much I really enjoyed this charming film and I will be going to the cinemas to rewatch it real soon!Really hope they don't make a sequel though!

454,rimskaya,Shot like an indie film but with blockbuster special effects,8,8 May 2021,"7.5 but rounding up to 8 (because a 5.7 as the average rating is frankly ridiculous). Chaos Walking might be one of those films that initially flops at the box office but garners a cult following over time. It isn't your typical sci-fi blockbuster interested in subverting your expectations or spelling out every story element. It merely asks the audience to engage and put some of the pieces together for themselves. It is styled like an indie film, concerned with theme, archetypes, and plot but with the budget for decent special effects and A list talent. Is it a perfect film? No. Is it obvious there were some production and script challenges? Eh, kind of? But it's a far cry from the train wreck that people are making it out to be.It's aesthetically gorgeous: great costumes, excellently shot, and the CGI for the ""Noise"" is both pleasing to look at and creative even if applied a little inconsistently as a plot device. The cast is stellar in what I would consider challenging roles, given that they are reacting to both what is happening and the thoughts of others characters (but of course those effects/voiceovers have yet to be added in). And it even has a little humor, as I laughed out loud several times at appropriate times. But it's not just a pretty movie, and in fact, under the surface, it tells a rather ugly story. Because all the while it tackles some heavy topics surrounding the nature of thoughts, gender, religion, colonization, etc, and asks interesting questions about masculinity (and I can only therefore assume that the film's utilization of the female gaze and the clear criticism of toxic masculinity is factoring into the poor reception).Overall, after feeling burnt out from the long list of superhero movies, action sequels, soapy YA adaptations, and nostalgic reboots that defined Hollywood for a decade till the pandemic, this was a nice change of pace.",Chaos Walking

In the same way one cannot expect to get every element presented in the Southern Reach Trilogy by Jeff Vandermeer to appear in the stand-alone film Annihilation, Chaos Walking might seem like too much out of context. But that's just it-it's an incredibly immersive movie, and the viewer gets just enough context to understand what's going on and to remain on the knife's edge of suspense. I do not regret that this is the first movie I've seen since Pixar's Onward came to theatres in 2020, and I found it very enjoyable.

468,Cereal_Killer_,I don't know if I should laugh or cry.,3,23 May 2021,"This movie's plot made less and less sense as the story went on. The main plot twist was completely incoherent and swept away the rules that the writers tried to establish within their own universe. The death scenes of the two main villains were also particularly awful, but at that point, the movie had already lost any semblance of credibility for me anyway. Also do I even need to mention the not-so-subtle ideological undertone? Every male character is at best fundamentally flawed, at worst an evil freak. Only females are allowed to be badass, or more accurately they're meant to be. I guess. Even the main male character is shown to be brave, but still somewhat of an idiot and a loser, and even gets friendzoned. Hahaha lol, so funny right? No, it was terrible. Maybe in another context it could work, not in this one. It just doesn't. Don't tease a romantic relationship throughout the whole movie if there's none to be found at the end. It wouldn't even work in a proper comedy movie if it was executed like that.I somehow managed to watch the entire thing because I genuilely liked the visuals, even though they looked cheap for a big budget movie. I also wanted to find out more about the lore. As it turned out, there was none, as every promise of an actual, interesting science-fiction story got destroyed roughly at the same pace as coherence.I'm not even sure if I should say this is wasted potential. It felt like it, but I think this is just what Hollywood, Netflix and the likes are trying to get us used to. And it's terrible. I'm giving this a three because of the decent visuals and acting.

The end result should be the focus and nothing else.While there could've been more character development, especially Mikkelsen's, the story is still good. The concept is as unique as the movie ""Frequencies (2013)"".This probably would've been better if it was a TV show because there seem to be a ton of content and ideas to explore. But being a movie, I can appreciate whatever they could fit in.For someone who's never read the books, I liked the movie a lot. The actors do not deserve the hate they are getting by the fans. There are very few book adaptations which did the books justice, and this isn't one of them. By demoralizing and rating low, the fans are just ensuring that more newbies don't watch the movie, in turn, don't get to know that there are books, resulting in the loss of potential fandom.Rate the movie for what it is as a standalone and not what more it could've been because of the book content.Endnote: It's worth the watch.

It reminds me of the maze runner type of genre. My main problem, which most people won't care about, is the fact they had to kill the dog. I'm pissed off they killed Manchee just because the one guy wanted to be killed by the girl to be cleansed of his sins for killing the woman. Can y'all just stop killing thee animals pleas, first he had to put his horse down because it broke its leg and then he lost his dog.I would watch a second movie if it's made because I didn't think it was that bad of a movie.Honestly my complaint is just crying over Manchee.",Chaos Walking

I don't mind that, but I did watch the deleted scenes. It did seem to be a bit of a mess at times but the ending product seemed better than some of the scenes I saw that were then cut.I'm still thinking about the film a day later and wondering where the story goes.

As another viewer mentioned, this movie gives same vibes as maze runner, hunger games. It's about a new world, a new ability, heroes, villains. Good performances by Tom Holland, Nick Jonas and the girl, but... for me, what makes difference to a movie is mostly it's well developed story. And although it's story seems interesting, it could have been built much better. There were some times in the movie when this new ability became a bit annoying or the plot felt like something's missing.

The ending was very different but considering that a sequel is off the table I was very satisfied with it.It was emotional, funny and very unique. Just an overall enjoyable experience and I left with a smile on my face, definitely one to see on the big screen if you can.Tom Holland and Daisy Ridley were the perfect actors to portray Todd and Viola and they brought so much genuine emotion to the characters, particularly Tom who was incredibly believable throughout. The actors who played Ben and Cillian were also a particular stand out for me as they made a big and important emotional impact with little screentime.My only complaint is that there is still so much more in the books to explore that I would love to see but given the circumstances I am very happy with what we got.",Chaos Walking

From the opening moments through the end, I didn't notice time passing and was thoroughly caught up in the story. I'd never seen any of the actors before, although I recognized Joe Jonas right away. Who knew he could ride a horse? Speaking of horses...any person even remotely interested in horses will notice the gorgeous palomino ridden by the Mayor is switched out for a completely different horse a few times. Even our hero's horse, which he saddles and is shown in front of the family homestead is different than the one he's shown galloping away on moments later.

Tom Holland (especially good in this film) & Daisy Ridley (ok in this film, but limited by her role) give very good acting performances (although their screen chemistry lacked a bit), while Mads Mikkelsen (bad guy in Dr. Strange & dad/scientist in Rogue One) turned in a great bad guy performance.We paid $20+ to watch on Amazon.

*Contains very minor spoilers*
It simply okay and that's totally fine, cause if never tries to step out of that space this movie to me is held up by its cast Including tom Holland, daisy Ridley, mads Mikkelsen, and nick Jonas. It's about, well that's not easy to explain if I had to give it the simplest of explanation to the plot. It would be a crash to a survivor who was there to make the original where there and to let her ship know that this was a good new plant. But there is a catch she is a girl and on this planet, you can hear the thoughts of men but not the women. Our main character has to travel to find a way to communicate with the ship. And there are also aliens on this planet for some reason. But don't worry about them their only show-up like once so they aren't important. The main idea of this film of hearing everyone's thoughts is unique and interesting and provides moments of humor. Throughout my time watching it was waiting for a big( hero uses his power in a big save the world type of way) moment and we just never really got there besides the fact that it was sort of teased early on but ended up going on where. All in all I would I give this movie 5 out 10 it's perfectly average",Chaos Walking
544,paigelennox-16356,Cute Movie,3,3 November 2021,"It was a cute movie. All the character development was skipped for the sake of squishing everything into an almost 2 hour movie. Todd's pacifism, which actually plays into the plot a lot, was totally missed except one quick reference that didn't make sense, because leading up to the line about him not being a killer he had already tried to or successfully killed 3 things. I also do wish that Viola and Todd could have been played by younger actors. They were giving more hormonal teenagers running for their lives, and less actual children trying to survive on their own with only each other to lean on. All in all it was a cute movie. Would I recommend it? No. Did I hate it? Also no. It had some nice moments.",Chaos Walking
545,soloughlinmarketing,Hilariously terrible,6,20 September 2021,"I gave this movie a 6 because although it held some major flaws, I enjoyed the hell out of watching it. Let me start off by saying it's fairly paced and was interesting from start to finish so it's worth seeing if you're in need of something new to watch. Now for the good stuff, or bad I should say, SPOILERS ahead.The funniest part about Chaos walking is the fact that there are no more women left on this planet so the remaining men have turned to being gay for each other as their only other option for companionship. Makes sense sure. Until you find out that just a town over (a distance that took Tom Holland only a singular overnight trip to get to) is filled and thriving with...MORE WOMEN! Ok, so now we find out that the reason prentice town does not have any women is because the men over there had killed them all. Ouch.Included in this mass gender-cide (ha, see what I did there) was Holland's character's mom, and I'm sure other mothers were slain too such as the one of that other sad and horny teen living in prentice played by Nick Jonas. These poor blokes grew up thinking there was no option for any female action of any kind whatsoever and the older men (who literally all know that there are gals living and breathing down the street) are like, yep...anyway, butt stuff anyone? All jokes aside, I do think there's a key point of misogyny trying to be made here with the idea that these guys hate women so much they'd rather be in same sex relationships even if it goes against their true/original sexuality if they had been straight prior. BUT there's no way a bunch of women hating dirt bags could simultaneously be pro LGBTQ+. Something tells me they'd be homophobic too amiright?All in all there were just tons of plot points that made no sense. Lots of silly, silly decisions made by the writers. If you can get past the constant pressing questions that will arise in your head during your screening of this film, such as ""why? What? Huh? How? Did he just? Uh wait? Alright..?"" and so on and so forth, then you'll enjoy Chaos walking.P. S. I also love how the space chick the movie is centered on was born on her ship, that came from earth as her parents did, was sent as a second part group to meet up with other original earthlings all with American accents BUT YET she's British of course!! Funny how dialect can change around when you hire the only actor who can't just Hugh Jackman it for the cameras. None of it makes sense, absolutely. Nothing. It truly is...chaos.",Chaos Walking

It kept you on your toes, constantly guessing what was going to happen next and what different clues were telling you, only to present a better explanation than anticipated.The acting was superb all around and showcased Tom Holland's ability as a great actor. I thought the visual effect were wonderful in portraying 'the noise'. At no point did I feel like 'the noise' was silly or distracting. It was excellently written and crafted for this movie.Characters and storyline was relatable and I felt like I was in the movie. REALLY looking forward to sequels.The reviews out there about this movie are generally low, so I was really suprised when I watched this movie. It was very well done.",Chaos Walking
563,finiansaccocio,Perspective is important; Far to much hate,10,3 April 2021,"Even as someone who has read the books and knows just how engaging this world can be, I think this movie does a great job at harnessing that world and it's ideas. While constantly comparing what I saw on the big screen to the amazing source material I was never truly disappointed, I didn't expect this to reach the same level as the novels. Every time a YA novel, or any novel for that matter, gets adapted into a film people bash it for not being faithful enough to the original story or not giving them the same experience. A film that delivers all that isn't really a true film, the point of adapting a novel isn't to just copy and paste what you read onto a movie screen. Yes, this movie is flawed and the third act is rushed but it also is so much fun to watch and it makes the world it's own so it's easy to forget about those things. People have complained about the ambiguous ending but you need to remember the goal here was to set up a franchise and leave room for more films, also the books ended in an even more ambiguous fashion so that complaint isn't really valid in my opinion. While I am a fan of both the lead actors but I was annoyed when I heard they got these roles as they're both far to old and seem like actors who can't really distinguish their roles from film to film especially Tom Holland who seems to play the same person in every movie. That might be an unfair statement as I haven't seen all of their movies but regardless any issues you might've had coming in about their age or acting skills should be gone because they do an outstanding job along with the rest of the cast. I think this will end up in a similar space as the original Dune movie because the source material is so good that it will inevitably get a reboot and we might look back on this film fondly, even the people with a more cynical outlook on it.",Chaos Walking

Overall the movie was good enough to watch and I could go as far as to say i might watch it again someday, my biggest complaint honestly was the ending, it felt unfinished almost but i guess it was for the sequel bait.

We follow the story of Todd as he tries to help an alien girl that literally dropped from the sky. Some might think that this movie is drawn out or unnecessarily sad, this movie needs to be long and has to have the characters have pain throughout , because the length explains the details for the reviewers and needs to have the characters go through sadness from us to be satisfied when they are finally happy. I really enjoyed this movie. I think that the length was good for me to understand the backstory and better connect with the main character.

Really the plot is reasonable and the characters behave the way they should. There is more that I expect would be explored in a sequel with the native species on the planet, some might see this as unresolved threads but it's likely on purpose. It would pay off if they were allowed to make a sequel. The acting was really spot on, Viola and Todd are likeable and enjoyable to watch. If you liked ""a quiet place"" you might be bored with this movie as it doesn't sacrifice a tight plot for cheap idiotic thrills.",Chaos Walking
585,voxviolett,Powerful themes and underlying connotations.,10,12 June 2021,"I found the entire concept of this movie powerful. I enjoyed the underlying themes of hyper masculinity and the importance of men being able to show, regulate and communicate emotion. Thoughts are emotionally driven and manifest as ""noise"" which only affects men, these men are frequently told to ""control"" or ""hide"" this, or ""use"" this noise as a means of confrontation. You frequently see Todd (one of the lead persona's) struggle with this as his character develops.Even more interesting that the homosexual couple were a pair who lived outside of the ""town"" / ""colony"". This is the couple who raised and nurtured Todd from infancy.This is not a love story. If anything it reinforces that women do not owe men anything. Viola is the lead female persona who is helped by Todd to contact home, the storyline frequently hints of ""attraction"" from Todd towards Viola and yet she keeps clear boundaries which are respected. Todd feels he has to protect her but Viola demonstrates that she is her own person as they come up against a common enemy.The only criticism is the 'aliens', we see one short scene of Todd fighting one off but it never really occurs again and it could potentially have been left out entirely as the real plot unfolds.Many male critics here feel this story is ""sexist"" and somewhat persecutory towards males but if anything it highlights the clear issues for gender equality and the challenges that men face with regards to toxic hyper masculinity. Some have highlighted that the story tries to depict ""all men as bad"" and only capable of violent thoughts but this actually depicts the impact of societal and peer influence on men by Todd being under the influence of a dark secret. This secret isn't shown in ""the noise"" by any man and we only learn of it a few scenes in, although the film does hint to what this is. But it demonstrated the impact of ""brainwashing"" and people in power, what this can do to in terms of warping the belief systems of others. This is even touched on by the religious character, Preacher. Consumed by scripture and the misogyny entwined within it, a bible that is well documented to chastise women from as easily as Adam and Eve.Overall, the themes are powerful and I felt it was written AND directed cleverly!",Chaos Walking

590,VoxxFoxx-UK,Lacking 'Chaos' and I want to get up and go 'Walking',4,26 June 2021,"With book to big screen adaptations there are always elements from the source material that will be changed to suit the screen or be edited out. In the case of this adaptation of the best-selling book series by novelist Patrick Ness everything gripping was inherently missing.The ideas were there, and so much could have been done with it, who wouldn't want to watch a movie about men's inability to hide their thoughts. So much could be deeply explored; from the questionable thoughts which dart in and out of a person's mind with no meaning, to heartbreak or the relatively comical.Unfortunately, what was delivered were mere touches of these possibly engaging plots points almost to the point you would assume any exploration was taboo and forbidden.I kept watching in the hopes the dribs and drabs of 'what could have been' would manifest eventually. But, alas, boredom set in and the entire movie melded into one long thought of ""Is anything good actually going to happen?"".This is disappointing considering the level of, both young and seasoned, talent in the film. But a great performance from Mads Mikkelsen, as the story's antagonist, couldn't save me from the poor script writing being a repetition of short lines; most of which are the main protagonist reciting his own name over and over into oblivion. Or enough to overlook the repeated references to an ""aggressive"" alien species native to the planet, which in actuality is only shown once in a brief scene and never seen or referenced again.Coupled with the lack of engagement from Tom Holland and Daisy Ridley who, despite being talented in their own rights, had next to no chemistry at all and who's possibility of any love interest forming, despite the script hinting at the possibility of moving towards it, was more akin to someone finding and feeling sorry for an injured puppy. Or, more accurately, someone getting bluntly friend-zoned repeatedly which continuing to make frequent subtle hints at interest throughout.There is certainly some merit to be had. But, for me, where it failed and what was lacking was too obvious to overlook for me to find the film enjoyable.",Chaos Walking

This is a good film and I think both Daisy Ridley and Tom Holland are very good actors, they both make the film enjoyable, entertaining and the main reason to watch it but... it just feels like it needs more explanation to it, it's a good plot line and the whole idea of 'the noise' is good but they don't really go into detail of why there's no women, (for good reason) but it's then glanced over by an entry in a journal and that's pretty much it. A preacher that is basically mentally burning himself in hell but for no massively apparent reason until 5 mins near the end it's sort of explained. And then the aliens/natives of the new world planet, that only seem to attack men but have a weird reaction to women, Tom Holland's character attacking one and the pair also nearly walking into the alien camp, nothing else of them is explained or involved, the film makers literally didn't even need to put them in the film, they served no purpose in the entire film apart from a lame 'they attacked our village' excuse.

There has clearly been big bucks spent on visual effects in this movie, which isnt so much a bad thing however I feel that if more had been taken into consideration for the plot rather than the pure flash value of casting and visual effects then the movie wouldve been much more manageable. The actors did play their parts well considering what little they were given to work with, but as a huge fan of the original books I just believe that they were not written for screen and clearly didnt translate well, and that if you want to hear the true, good version of this story then the books are a much better option.",Chaos Walking

Let me start by saying that my husband watched without reading the books (I've read the full trilogy) and his biggest complaint was that the film was confusing and the pacing was weird.But oh man, if you read the books first, avoid this film like the plague. Similar to other Hollywood misuses of great source material, Chaos Walking followed the plot of book with maybe 70% accuracy through act one and two, and then completely abandoned any semblance of adaptation for act three. In the process, a lot of the big issues that made the book interesting (relationship with native peoples/nature, the relationship of innocence, knowledge, and evil, the inherent sexism of fear around the Noise, etc) were abandoned. This really made the character of Aaron pointless as his entire motivation was erased, so poor husband just kept saying ""What is this guy's deal?"" And there was no better explanation that he's totally nuts.Sadly Aaron was not the only character severely watered down here. Tom Holland gave a great try at heavily altered Todd, as did Mads at the classic shady bad guy who you want to trust. But the poor adapting (which makes no sense because the author co wrote the screen play so I don't even know what happened there) just didn't allow for a cohesive story. Especially when act three went rogue and somehow the entire complex story just wrapped itself up in about ten minutes.Film wise, if I can be objective, it wasn't terrible.

621,lourens-basson,Thought provoking and thoroughly enjoyable,8,5 March 2021,"I enjoyed every minute of the film from start to finish. The concept of having your every thought on display for everyone to see and unable to hide your true self is a very interesting idea. It's difficult to determine whether a world where absolute transparency is unavoidable would be chaos as the film title suggests, or if it would inspire a world where all the social barriers like sex, sexuality, race, culture etc would be broken down into a society without judgement or predisposed prejudices.Another thought provoking idea is despite the fact that humans set out to colonise other planets for the sake of preserving the species and looking for a better life, there is still conflict and war among the different colonies, which as sad as it sounds, seems all too realistic when you compare the narrative to our current state as a species on Earth.All in all a very enjoyable film full of action, mystery, drama and a hint of romance!",Chaos Walking

And they didnt understand the characters and motives, I did. I'm so glad that i didnt read the reviews first as probably wouln't have watched it. I dont care for how much it cost or how many times it was delayed, I found it an enjoyable movie, so go on and watch it :)",Chaos Walking

Not every film you watch will be amazing. The problem today is that everybody wants to be a film critic.",Chaos Walking

I thought Tom Holland and Daisy Ridley's performance was awesome. It must have been really hard to act along with the noise that wouldn't be added until post. I loved it.",Chaos Walking

That's the only positive thing to say about this movie. Could have been...So much more.Drowning a dog, on screen, was senseless. It ruined the movie for me. It wasn't the only senseless murder in the film, but it left a vile aftertaste and added nothing to the story.",Chaos Walking

630,alexcscott17,Ignore the rating!!,9,21 March 2021,I had no expectations for this movie and I've never read the book. All I will say is it kept me entertained from start to finish. Tom Holland and Daisey Ridley are great together. When I came on to review and rate the movie I couldn't believe the score. Both people I saw it with were thoroughly entertained! I 100% recommend watching this film!,Chaos Walking

632,godumbledork,"Bad movie, but helped me with my anxiety",5,5 November 2021,"The aptly-titled Chaos Walking feels a decade too late, which is probably because it was in development since 2011. At the time, Lionsgate wanted to become Hollywood's one-stop shop for YA fantasy blockbusters. Production on Hunger Games had begun, the rights to Divergent were bought, and the company was in talks to acquire Summit, the studio behind Twilight.Unfortunately for Lionsgate, the YA fantasy genre faded away in favor of capes and tights. Divergent was cancelled on a cliffhanger, and Chaos Walking cost the studio $75 million.Chaos Walking is based on ""The Knife of Never Letting Go,"" the first installment in author Patrick Ness' book series, first published in 2008. Charlie Kaufman was hired to write the first draft of the screenplay in 2012, and he was followed by a revolving door of script doctors including Ness himself. Filming finally took place in 2017.The final product was reportedly ""unreleasable,"" so reshoots were planned. They couldn't take place for another two years due to Tom Holland and Daisy Ridley's busy schedules. The reshoots cost another $15 million (rounding out the total budget to a clean $100 million) and made Holland lose the lead in 1917 and miss the premiere of Avengers: Endgame.And all of that makes perfect sense, because Chaos Walking feels like the kind of story a kid makes up while playing with action figures. It takes place in the year 2258 on a planet called New World. New World is populated solely by men, whose thoughts can be heard out loud, a phenomenon called the Noise.One day, Todd (Tom Holland) discovers a woman from Earth named Viola (Daisy Ridley), the first woman he's ever seen. There's a scary mayor (Mads Mikkelsen), a perilous quest, and some emotional bonding.The one thing that sets Chaos Walking apart is the Noise. As someone with anxiety who deals with a never-ending internal monologue, the idea of my thoughts being heard is surprisingly therapeutic.For example, there's a scene where Viola tells Todd he should question authority more, and Todd's thoughts show Viola saying ""Such an idiot, Todd."" Viola responds ""I didn't say that."" It shows that the opinions you think someone has about you probably don't exist.There's also a funny scene where Todd and Viola start kissing, but then it's revealed that was just a thought Todd had. Viola looks at him horrified.Overall, bad movie. It's got clunky dialogue, stilted acting, lame effects, and it pulls a Bright by opening with a quote from its own universe. But it has a cool concept that I related to and got me to think, so I guess that's worth something.",Chaos Walking
633,jibbi-12390,"Suprised by the bad reviews, do they get the movie?",10,25 June 2021,"I watched this movie because of Tom Holland, an amazing actor who carries out this role really well. I love it when a movie just drops you right in the plot; in the action. No boring build-up or further explanations, you have to figure out things while the movie unfolds. Maybe this is what others dislike?I think the general concept of the noise is brilliant, not annoying nor weird. It is original.Overall, a great movie. Would rate it a strong 9 but gave it a 10 here because it is worthy of a much higher overall-score :)",Chaos Walking

639,Joanna_dudu,What's with all this hate?!,10,11 April 2021,"The movie is like a 7, but there is so much useless hate in the comments so I wanted to compensate a little bit. Sure, it's not a masterpiece, it's more of an easy, enjoyable, good defeats bad movie you see in a Sunday afternoon. I like how the actors played (I ended up really hating the negative characters, especially when the dog died), I liked Holland being clumsy and dorky - portraying really good the way he was raised isolated in that village. It would have been nice to see more of the natives from the planet tho.And how some people got out of the movie that it's PC woke, is beyond me. Or now if we have a strong female character, we automatically say it's too PC? If we have a black leader, it's woke? Really? We are outraged if we see this kind of things because we can't imagine them being accurate? Or is that unbelievable those men killed all the women?Whatever. I will never understand why people expect every movie to be the best and perfect in history. Just enjoy the time.",Chaos Walking

If it wasn't for Tom, Mads, and Daisy starring in it, I would have stopped watching after the first 10 mins. It's very sloppy and the ""noise"" was so distracting I couldn't understand much of the dialogue throughout the film.

It was like editing didn't PAY ATTENTION?!! Throughout the ENTIRE film all I saw was Tom Holland acting in His Spider-Man character, the constant dialogue-banter wasn't anything of a stretch from his Spider-Man character - at some point I was expecting SPIDER-MAN to pop-up and save the day!?! Daisy's character- again, she plays the 'scavenger' role reminiscent of her Star Wars role!?! C'mon folks... really, she's fixing yet another antenna?!! Ugh!",Chaos Walking

650,kevinjbarry-09973,Unique concept terribly wasted,4,3 April 2021,"With the ""noise"" aspect, it could have been a special film. We've probably all pondered reading each other's thoughts and what that would mean for society. The acting was not the issue here - just the way the thoughts were sporadically demonstrated and displayed was unrealistic and poorly imagined. Plus anytime a dog is killed senselessly just makes it a worse movie in my opinion. It didn't even make sense for the scene it happened in.Waste of a good idea if you ask me.",Chaos Walking

653,vincecool,Worst movie ever!,1,8 March 2021,I walked out of it last night after a half hour. That's how bad this movie is. Just a strange movie. It was about Tom Holland who plays Spider-Man in the new Mcu movies and he has a dog and all you hear is his inner thoughts. Can only hear the guys inner thoughts not the girls. All of a sudden Daisy Ridley from Star Wars comes in on a spaceship and crashes and is the lone survivor and she has to run away when spotted and hide because she doesn't know where she is or how she got their. It was very laughable cuz I was like what am I watching? Nick Jonas is also in it but his character is a joke. I'm so happy I didn't sit through this one.,Chaos Walking
