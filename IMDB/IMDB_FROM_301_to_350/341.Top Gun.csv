0,MartinHafer,"I know this film made a ton of money...but it really, really is NOT a good movie.",3,31 March 2020,"A bunch of pretty Navy pilots go to the Top Gun school. Once there, the pilots spend all their time arguing and trying to one-up each other. Ultimately, the super-arrogant guy ends up impressing everyone and getting the girl...proving that at least in this film, being a know-it-all and disobeying rules is really cool and the US Navy surely approves of this.
""Top Gun"" was the biggest money-making film of 1986 and it won an Oscar for its ubiquitous song, ""Every Breath You Take"". Well, I never saw it until today....decades later...and I can only assume that it was a product of its time and I cannot see this as anything other than a very expensive and slick bad film. The film has tons of problems whenever the action sequences conclude, as the characters and dialog are god-awful. It also is a pain to watch because the film is like a 110 minute music video--with 80s tunes almost constantly playing. It makes for a slick but annoying film.Overall, a film that looks great, has some great flying scenes and it has a lot of handsome actors....and they spent about $.69 on writing...with dialog that really is cringe-worthy and characters so arrogant and annoying that finishing the film was a real chore.",Top Gun
1,bkoganbing,"""I Feel The Need, The Need For Speed""",9,9 January 2008,"Top Gun it can be argued is the perfect Reagan Era film and is is definitely the film that cemented Tom Cruise's stardom. It's probably now the film that most people will identify him with.Cruise plays Pete Mitchell aka Maverick who gets recommended for the Navy's elite Top Gun fighter pilot school. The best of the best train here at what they euphemistically call Fightertown, USA. The problem Tom has is he's the best and he knows it. That doesn't near and endear him to his fellow pilots.You can add Top Gun to a list of films that goes all the way back to Task Force where the story of the development of the aircraft carrier was told, to The Bridges at Toko-Ri which was a film that told about the first jet air war in Korea. What Gary Cooper flew in Task Force and what William Holden piloted in The Bridges at Toko-Ri are as ancient to Cruise's generation as what Eddie Rickenbacker flew in the first World War was to Holden and Cooper.One thing that has not left is that war in the air still is the glamor service because it allows a record of individual achievement. And with flying combat at the speeds they do, one has to make less than split second decisions. The men are better now than they were in the previous wars simply because they have to be.Cruise is ably assisted by such folks as Tim Rossovich, Barry Tubb, Clarence Gilyard, Whip Hubley, and Adrian Pasdar as fellow pilots at the Top Gun school. Val Kilmer turns in a nice performance as Cruise's number one rival to be number one in the class.Best in the film besides Tom is Anthony Edwards as his co-pilot and best friend. His death scene with Cruise is particularly poignant as is Edwards's wife Meg Ryan's scene with Tom as he breaks the news.Romance for Cruise is provided by Kelly McGillis who certainly had her choice of hunks to fall for, but this film doe seem to make a point that women like confidence in their men even if it can be overbearing at times to those around. McGillis is a civilian instructor so the romance does not bring Tom or her under military fraternization infractions.Top Gun is a film every bit as good as the ones I mentioned before. Tom Cruise was never more appealing on the screen. And this review is dedicated to the fighter pilots of the United States Navy, some of the best and brightest of the younger generation who are defending freedom for old codgers like me.",Top Gun
2,SnoopyStyle,Great fun 80s popcorn action movie,8,15 June 2014,"""On March 3, 1969 the United States Navy established an elite school for the top one percent of its pilots. Its purpose was to teach the lost art of aerial combat and to insure that the handful of men who graduated were the best fighter pilots in the world."" So starts this action masterpiece from director Tony Scott. Hot shot pilot Maverick (Tom Cruise) gets a chance to attend Fighter Weapons School or Top Gun in Miramar when his lead Cougar loses it in the air. He's met by cold as ice Iceman (Val Kilmer) as his calculating competition. He always has his navigator Goose (Anthony Edwards) by his side. He constantly tries to prove himself running on instinct against his father's perceived failed mission. Top Gun commanding officer is Viper (Tom Skerritt) and Jester (Michael Ironside) is an instructor. Charlie (Kelly McGillis) is a civilian instructor.The action is great. Tony Scott shoots the action like a music video and it looks amazing. He gets great access to military hardware and locations. This is not the older generation military movie. Movie star Tom Cruise is perfectly suited as Maverick. The only minor hiccup is the limited chemistry between McGillis and Cruise. It's not bad and it doesn't detract from anything. This movie just has all the fun 80s stuff. It's funny. It's fun. It's a great popcorn movie.",Top Gun
3,Hitchcoc,Fun by Forgettable,6,1 December 2016,"This is a film that just fades into the past. I sort of like Tom Cruise for all his self- importance and outrageous behavior at times. It is a throwback to those aviator movies of the forties where the guy stretches the limits of authority. He is truly invulnerable and his foibles do him well as things get serious. Of course, there's the obligatory romance with its ups and downs, the girl wondering what she is getting herself into. There's the sidekick who is going to eventually be victimized, but he's there to remind Cruise what he is truly fighting for. And things get tied up in a nice knot at some point, I guess. There is nothing terribly wrong with this movie. It is just a showplace for Cruise and his acting talents. The script is OK and when you leave the theatre, you wonder about the trailers you saw and what your next movie will be.",Top Gun
4,Horst_In_Translation,A good film with occasional flaws,6,21 September 2015,"""Top Gun"" is not only an American movie from almost 30 years ago, it is actually as American as it gets with some truly patriotic notes about people in the military. And there are other areas in this 105-minute movie that go way over the top. One would be masculinity, this is really packed with testosterone. Another area would be just how generic and predictable it is in many aspects, for example the instructor who falls in love with the main character Maverick, or the friend who dies and Maverick's brief identity crisis before he returns a better pilot than he has ever been. Another of these could be his mentor who is a great hero himself and still offers Maverick at the end to be his co-pilot. Or Val Kilmer's character, who is a bit of an antagonist early on, but in the end accepts Maverick's greatness. Or of course the final sequence with the vessel they have to save. So yeah, if you are into subtle films, this one is definitely not one to watch for you.However, as a whole it was still a solid movie I guess. Despite its flaws, it was okay to watch from start to finish because of the way the characters were written and portrayed convincingly and this comes from somebody who really is not too interested in military or war movies. Then again, this is more about one man's journey to himself and how he overcomes several obstacles on the way than really about the forces. Tom Cruise is still very young here, not an Oscar nominee yet, but you can see the star potential he possesses. Tom Skerritt is fun to watch in here as well I think and Meg Ryan plays a supporting character in the early years of her career. Quite an irony that she was going to have a much bigger career than female lead Kelly McGillis here early in her career too, who was a rising star back then after her Golden Globe nominated performance in ""Witness"". Top Gun not only won Giorgio Moroder his 3rd Academy Award, but scored 3 more nominations in the technical categories. All in all, I guess this was a decent watch, but not among the best of 1986. Probably especially patriots will enjoy this very 80s-looking movie.",Top Gun
5,classicsoncall,"""Yeah, I guess when I see something, I go right after it.""",8,9 February 2020,"I didn't care much for Tom Cruise early in his career, I guess because I equated his real life personality with those of on-screen egotistical characters like Vincent Lauria in ""The Color of Money"" and 'Maverick' Pete Mitchell in the film under consideration here. His jumping up and down on Oprah's couch while advocating for Scientology in 1990 certainly didn't win him any favors in this viewer's eyes. I really have no idea how he is in real life, so it's unfair to paint an unreasonable picture of him based on early observations. I did like him as Nathan Algren in ""The Last Samurai"", and I've enjoyed his take on the Jack Reacher character. ""Top Gun"" was a major breakout role for Cruise and you can see why. His Hollywood good looks stand out strongly and he does have charisma on screen. As a hot shot pilot tapped for advanced flight training at the Fightertown U.S.A. base in Miramar, California, 'Maverick' Mitchell joins an elite group of flyers, some of whom have an outsized ego as big as his.What follows is a fairly formulaic story that follows Maverick as he pursues his air combat maneuver training and rivalry with Iceman Mike Kazansky (Val Kilmer), not to mention a romantic tangle with civilian instructor Charlotte 'Charlie' Blackwood (Kelly McGillis). The chemistry between them didn't work for this viewer, but that might just be me. I thought the repeated strains of 'Take My Breath Away' got a little heavy handed at times, as if you couldn't tell the couple was hot for each other. But it did win Best Original Song at the Oscars, so I guess it fulfilled it's purpose. When Mitchell faces a crisis of conscience with the death of his best friend and co-pilot Goose (Anthony Edwards), he has to summon up the courage and determination to move on. Though he misses out on the Top Gun trophy at Miramar, Maverick pulls through when it really counts in well orchestrated battle action over the Indian Ocean, which re-earns him the respect and admiration of his fellow pilots and officer trainers.Seeing as how this film is over three decades old as I write this, I can appreciate how far Tom Cruise has come as an actor and I have to admit, he's not bad. He's not a favorite, but you can see he's developed his craft. What I would say in criticism of the picture is the casting of Meg Ryan as the redneck wife of Anthony Edward's character Goose. Who at the time thought that was a good idea?",Top Gun
6,gavin6942,One of the Quintessential Films of the 1980s,6,6 December 2010,"As students at the Navy's elite fighter weapons school compete to be best in the class, one daring young flyer (Tom Cruise) learns a few things from a civilian instructor (Kelly McGillis) that are not taught in the classroom. ""Top Gun"" is just one of those must-see 1980s films, very quotable, with a classic cast of Tom Cruise, Anthony Edwards, Meg Ryan and Val Kilmer, among others. It spawned the popular parody film ""Hot Shots"", and remains a hit today despite the fact it focused on a Cold War theme that no longer seems relevant.Both John Carpenter and David Cronenberg allegedly turned down the chance to direct, and we have to wonder how it would have been different. Cronenberg would have brought in a whole new audience, probably reducing the popularity while improving the style.Tony Scott is first and foremost an action director, which makes him ideal for this film. The film could have been trimmed a bit by reducing the stock footage of the military stuff. And it definitely needed a reduced use of ""Danger Zone"" and ""Take My Breath Away"" (why play the same songs repeatedly?). But overall, it is a fun, light and rather exciting film if you are into dogfights.If you have not seen ""Top Gun"", you really should. It ranks, at least for me, as one of Tom Cruise's top three most enjoyable films and is definitely at the peak of his career. A good actor he is not, but an essential part of the 1980s he was.",Top Gun
7,jboothmillard,Top Gun,6,11 April 2007,"There are many critics that call this an ultimate gay fantasy film, in some ways I can see why. From the director of Enemy of the State, Tony Scott, this is an air navy based film set almost in a cold war. Pete ""Maverick"" Mitchell (Tom Cruise, in his star-making role) is one of many aspiring fighter pilots to become the best of the best, with the help of the Top Gun Naval Flying School. There he both tries to establish himself as one of the best, has some quarrels with other pilots, particularly Tom ""Ice/Iceman"" Kazansky (Val Kilmer), and in the process of trying to gain trust and merit, falls for civilian instructor Charlotte ""Charlie"" Blackwood (Kelly McGillis). There is a point where he quits momentarily when his co-pilot Nick ""Goose"" Bradshaw (ER's Anthony Edwards), but he does get the great merit at the ending for destroying most of the Russian enemy. Also starring Alien's Tom Skerritt as Commander Mike ""Viper"" Metcalf, Total Recall's Michael Ironside as Dick ""Jester"" Wetherly, Tim Robbins as Sam ""Merlin"" Wills and Meg Ryan as Carole. It won the Oscar Best Song for ""Take My Breath Away"" (also won the Golden Globe), and it was nominated for Best Sound Effects Editing, Best Film Editing and Best Sound, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Original Score for Harold Faltermeyer. Tom Cruise was number 32 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, he was number 25 on The 100 Greatest Sex Symbols, and he was number 81 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons, the film was number 94 on 100 Years, 100 Quotes (""I feel the need - the need for speed!""), and it was number 18 on The 100 Greatest Sexy Moments. Good!",Top Gun
8,ccthemovieman-1,The Incredibly Smug & Cocky Cruise Of The '80s,3,16 June 2007,"It's movies like this that made me - and millions of others - dislike Tom Cruise for a long time. I have learned to appreciate some of his talents from about the early-to-mid-1990s on because of ""Far And Away,"" which was an excellent film. However, his 1980 movies all had him (effectively, I suppose) cast as this incredibly-smug, SOB that I just about made me puke every time I saw him. He was either typecast or he was good in the role, or both....but Cruise played one obnoxious pretty-boy character after another. This movie gave a perfect example of that cockiness.With almost 300 reviews already in print here, there is no sense going into the storyline. Tom is the hotshot military ""Top Gun"" fighter pilot and who shows everyone how cool a guy he is.....pretty much sums it up. Kelly McGillis plays a typical low-life woman Hollywood has loved to portray since the '70s, who has the hots for Tom Terrific. She's always as annoying as him.The only redeeming quality to this film is the audio. The sound-effects of the jets is fantastic, and this was a real ""demo"" for surround sound when it came out years ago. Unfortunately, the great sound, and some excellent action scenes, cannot make up for the silly script and obnoxious lead characters.",Top Gun
9,Tweekums,Classic '80s aerial drama that makes a star of the F-14 Tomcat,8,4 December 2014,"Pete ""Maverick"" Mitchell flies F-14 Tomcats for the US Navy with his Radar Intercept Officer Nick ""Goose"" Bradshaw. Maverick is a bit of a wildcard with a certain contempt for the rule but when the unit's number one pilot has a panic attack during an encounter with a pair of MiGs he finds himself sent to the prestigious 'Top Gun' school where he and Goose will train and compete with the finest pilots in the Navy. Once there he quickly ruffles a few feathers but also impresses with his flying and is one of the favourites to be top of the class. Away from the flying he gets involved with instructor Charlotte ""Charlie"" Blackwood. A tragic accident during training means he considers whether or not to quit but when a situation arises in the Indian Ocean he takes to the skies again and must put what he learnt into practice.I first watched this film in the eighties, loved it and watched it many times but having not watched it for several years I wondered how it would have aged. Thankfully it was as enjoyable as ever. The story itself is a little cliché but it is well told and the aerial scenes are some of the best in any film I've seen no CGI here. The romantic subplot does feel a little forced as the two leads don't seem to have the right chemistry the relationship between the pilots and RIOs, especially between Maverick and Goose are more interesting than the romance. When the 'tragic event' occurs it is quite a shock and genuinely emotional. The cast do a decent job and it is no surprise that this launched Tom Cruise's career as an action star however the real stars are the Grumman F-14 Tomcats. Director Tony Scott did a great job capturing the action both in the sky and on the ground. Overall I'd say this is a must see for anybody who likes modern military aircraft and those who like decent action.",Top Gun
10,moonspinner55,Air-adventure cannily designed as a rock music video...a movie for its time rather than for the ages,4,24 May 2009,"Naval aviation students dual it out in the air, romance the girls on the ground. It isn't any wonder why ""Top Gun"" was such a smash with audiences circa 1986: it puts to use the punchy, pulsating rhythms of the slickly-edited videos of MTV's peak era and wraps them up in ""Miami Vice""-styled cool. It couldn't miss--especially not without the face of then-current heartthrob Tom Cruise front and center. Still, the film more often than not resembles a hearty civil service recruitment ad (underlined with smug machismo), and is photographed and scored as such. Yes, it looks great, all expensive commercials do. Cruise doesn't act so much as he does strut, however this swagger doesn't help him much in the love-department as he is partnered with Kelly McGillis, playing a leggy, brainy instructor (she's too leggy and brainy for Tom, and seems far out of his league). The movie struck a nerve with both men and women eager to indulge in the over-scaled presentation and cocky contrivances, however today it opens itself up to parody. *1/2 from ****",Top Gun
11,paul_haakonsen,Cliché-filled classic...,6,27 December 2015,"Everyone is familiar with ""Top Gun"". Yep, it is one of those movies that everyone has seen. Perhaps it is because of Tom Cruise, or perhaps because of its cheesy and cliché filled storyline. Or perhaps it is because of the music, or even because of the beach volley scene. Whatever the reason, you just have to admit that it is one of those pseudo-classic movies.The storyline is so predictable that even a blind man sees what is coming a mile away. But despite its predictability, then there is still something enjoyable about ""Top Gun"". For me it was the dogfight scenes with the jet fighter planes.The story is about Maverick (played by Tom Cruise) a young hotshot fighter pilot student who takes on the burden of his fathers legacy as he attempts to prove his worth at the academy. Love and loss are two things that strike hard in his otherwise perfect life. When a conflict of war is at the threshold, Maverick has to make use of all his skills in order to pull through.There is a good ensemble of talents in ""Top Gun"" with Tom Cruise and Val Kilmer in the lead roles. And the likes of Anthony Edwards, Tom Skerritt, Tim Robbins, James Tolkan, Meg Ryan, Rick Rossovich and Michael Ironside really helped put ""Top Gun"" on the map.If you haven't already seen ""Top Gun"" then you are missing out on one of the most memorable movies from the mid-Eighties.",Top Gun
12,michaelRokeefe,Powerful. Macho. Action packed romantic drama.,8,23 April 2000,"The top 1% of the nation's flyers gather for fighter pilot training. Outstanding maneuvers in the sky. Great soundtrack embellishes the hi-jinks, action and drama. You walk away from this one proud and pumped. This had to be a Godsend to the military recruiters! I can watch this one again and again.Tom Cruise, in probably his best role. Kelly McGillis goes by the name of Charlie, but looks all woman to me. Wow!! Val Kilmer plays a good hard ass villain type. Anthony Edwards, Tim Robbins and John Stockwell are air jockey buddies. Tom Skerritt plays the mentor. Meg Ryan has a small, but very noticeable part; cute, funny and loud.Excellent photography and sound that will not let you snooze. Don't miss one of the best of its kind. TOP GUN is tops.",Top Gun
13,sunwarrior13,Top Gun Rocks,7,29 January 2006,"I first saw Top Gun when I was a High School freshman.After almost twenty years of viewing it regularly,I could probably write the script!!!It was a film that clearly defined what is cool in the 80's.It is about Navy jet fighter pilots or should I say arrogant Navy jet fighter pilots.It is arrogance personified!!!!Tom Cruise starred as Lt.Pete ""Maverick"" Mitchell,an extremely cocky Naval aviator who was selected to train in the prestigious Navy school called Top Gun.It is a school that provides training in dogfighting skills and air combat. The movie has all the elements to make it a great popcorn flick.It is a story about jet fighter pilots who gives a movie a macho feel and makes rock stars out of them.It has romance.It has great rivalry between two of the best pilots in class namely Maverick and Ice.It talks about friendship among these pilots especially that of Maverick and Goose.There are great memorable lines that is clearly identified with the film such as ""I feel the need,the need for speed"" and ""Your ego is writing checks your body cash.Also,there is a mysterious death of the main character Maverick's father.Also,who could forget the dogfight scenes and the aerial photography?And finally,it has great soundtrack especially with songs such as ""Highway to the Dangerzone"",which essentially describes the lifestyle of the pilots and the romantic love song ""Take my breath away"" as well as the instrumental ""Top Gun Anthem"" gives the movie its MTV feel.This is a feel good movie considering it talks about an jet fighter pilot who later loses his confidence after his friend/co- pilot dies in a dogfighting accident and how he gains it back.This film is for everyone who feels down.It is a film that helps me personally to gain confidence in life whenever I feel incapable of overcoming problems and challenges in life.Watch it and enjoy it.Or why don't you buy the DVD.Watch it to keep your confidence in check.For we will see these arrogant characters in the movies again.",Top Gun

16,hitchcockthelegend,"He's dangerous, but he can be our wingman anytime.",7,23 April 2009,"Pete ""Maverick"" Mitchell is a hot shot super jet pilot in waiting. Trouble is is that he has a disregard for authority and carries around a family burden into the bargain. Selected for training at the Top Gun school in San Diego, Mitchell must harness his ability and realise his dreams, or else face the consequence.Top Gun is a golden film, why you ask? Well it's one of those oddities that most people know is actually not very good in substance, yet it amazingly stands up as a secretly closeted treasure from an enigmatic cinematic time. Top Gun can probably lay claim to being the definition of the 80s pop picture, blaring music coupled with tremendous action sequences are oddly offset by the formulaic sub-plots happening down on the Top Gun floor. Yes the film has no substance, but director Tony Scott and scallywag producers Don Simpson and Jerry Bruckheimer merged a number of crowd pleasing elements to create a box office smash, and in the process launch one time poster boy Tom Cruise into the stratosphere of super stardom.We have a military setting, daring do training programme, buff bodies for those of any sexual persuasion, competitive edginess, and of course the obligatory love interest romance that here is as unlikely as it is actually forced. Tho to be fair to both Cruise {great and cocky} and Kelly McGillis {miscast and poor}, their love scenes are tender and comfortably raising the pulse beat in 80s cinema sensuality. Much macho posturing drips from every other frame, be it Cruise tearing around on his motorcycle or Val Kilmer {Iceman} pumping out his bare chest and smirking away. It could be said that Top Gun is an advertisement for the homo-erotic army! Yet in spite of its obvious daftness, Top Gun is very much a thrill ride. Disengage yourself from the preposterous nature of events out of the sky, and it royally entertains as an action picture of worth. Zooming jet sequences and sparky man to man beefcake exchanges more than make this a worthy revisit, especially now in this HD and booming home cinema age.It's not great for sure, and anyone really proclaiming it to be as such has been having MTV filtered into their brains for the last 20 years. But it is an entertaining film, and the people involved with it knew exactly what they was doing, and when one looks at the ream of poor imitations that have followed over the years? Well Top Gun actually holds up as one of the most quintessential 80s pictures ever made....for better or worse? 7/10",Top Gun
17,Theo Robertson,Perhaps The Most Typical Bruckheimer Production,4,28 June 2004,"You can just imagine Jerry Bruckheimer sitting at the studio offices in a totally disinterested mood as his colleagues discuss the pre planning stages of TOP GUN . Dismissing anything that vaguely resembles a good idea Jerry turns to them and says "" Forget about complicated plots and great stories . Hire me a couple of hunky actors with great teeth and write me a couple of songs for the soundtrack "" and his colleagues comply Personally speaking the above attitude seems kind of lousy if you want to make a good film but it's logical if you want to make a successful one . Tom Cruise and Val Kilmer , if the teenage girls don't rush out to the cinema to see either of these guys sure as hell every dentist in the country will , so right away you've got a ready made audience . Add to that lots of macho big boys toys ( In this case fighter jets ) which will appeal to a teenage male audience and you've got an even bigger ready made audience . Plus you can release a soundtrack which means more money and advertising for the movieYes indeed TOP GUN was a mega success at the cinema which proves Jerry Bruckheimer knows his stuff . However as many , many people have noted there's a big difference between a GOOD movie and a SUCCESSFUL movie and watching TOP GUN after almost 20 years after it came out it comes across as being shallow , thread bare and rather jingoistic . From the very first scene of fighter aircraft flying off the carrier to the closing credits director Tony Scott seems to be making something that's a cross between a recruiting film for the US Navy and a music video , there's romance for the girls , a few dog fight for the boys but much of it seems aimed for the next MTV slot . There's not a lot here that will challenge the mindI also couldn't noticing the flag waving either , in just about every scene a character proudly boasts that "" The United States has the best fighter pilots in the world "" . I'm not dissing anyone across the pond who's served their country but the undisputed kings of the sky are the Israeli airforce who manged to destroy 240 Egyptian fighters in one single day during the 1967 six day war . They also shot down 38 Syrian aircraft in dogfights , again in a single day , in June 1982 . The Israelis have no equals when it comes to fighter pilots * . I can understand Hollywood getting all nationalistic since they had such a right wing president ( A former Hollywood actor no less ) at the time but the "" God bless the United States - we're the best at everything we do "" attitude does grate very quickly especially to non Americans and a later Bruckheimer production PEARL HARBOR drowned in its patriotic fervor with an American fighter pilot almost winning The Battle Of Britain single handed A lot of people flocked to the cinema when it was first released and a lot of people bought the soundtrack too , but as a film it is rather shallow , uninvolving and if you can't remember the 1980s then you might be ever so puzzled why this film made so much money . If truth be told I'm slightly puzzled myself and I suggest you go out of your way to watch AN OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN which is a very similar movie but a far better one* For a film that strangely negates the skill of the Israeli airforce I couldn't help noticing that this movie was inspired by an article written by Ehud Yonay . I've not checked up on this guy's background but wouldn't Ehud Yonay be an Israeli name ?",Top Gun
18,preppy-3,Top crap,3,12 January 2001,"Boring, predictable groaner about a cocky Air Force cadet (or Navy or whatever the hell he is) who needs to learn a few life lessons before becoming a great pilot. Every single cliché is here--the close buddy that dies so Cruise can ""grow up""; the aeronautics instructor (or whatever Kelly McGillis played) in love with him; the booming tops 40s soundtrack; the final aerial dogfight where Cruise saves his companions---YAWN!!! Also the movie has a horrendous performance by Cruise (he's always bad but he REALLY sucks here--he grins his way through the entire performance), an even worse one by McGillis (SHE has a PhD in aeronautics???? Hah! More like one in makeup!), a total lack of sexual chemistry between them, a good ol' buddy who you know is dogmeat from frame 1 (Anthony Edwards giving the only good performance), another cocky young hothead (Val Kilmer sneering away), a tough but kind leader (Tom Skerritt, looking totally lost) and a film that is, basically, little more than a recruiting poster. Also dogfights that play like video games and the film seems to make war look like kids play. There's also a totally hysterical line when McGillis (who is about 5 inches taller than Cruise) looks DOWN at him and breathes, ""When I first saw you you were 7 feet tall!"" This movie was a HUGE hit in 1986 because it was slickly made to please audiences. It was ""safe"" and predictable and made sure that the audiences didn't have to think for one second. A total waste of time.

21,AlsExGal,"Well, a few good comic scenes, some good tunes, and well done action have to count for SOMETHING...",4,27 October 2019,"... and for me they count for 4 out of ten points. Looking for great acting individually and as an ensemble, a coherent plot, good direction? Look elsewhere. This is probably, overall, one of the worst A list films I have ever seen. Believe it or not it was the number one film at the box office in 1986. A friend of mine recommended it wholeheartedly and so I plopped down my money one Saturday afternoon. Afterwards I felt robbed. Of time, money, AND I.Q. points. I still can't do calculus like I could beforehand. But I digress.Two naval aviators played by Tom Cruise at his heart-throbbing peak and by Anthony Edwards pre-ER are picked to attend ""Top Gun"", the Naval Fighter Weapons School. So much for being disciplined for buzzing the airfield a few minutes before. From the beginning, ""Maverick"" (Cruise) is cocky, forward with an astrophysicist and instructor in a bar in such a way that actually wins him the girl (Kelly McGillis), and claiming he will get the ""Top Gun Trophy"" showing he is first in his class. I would mention the character names in this film, but just trust me that everybody has Viking nicknames and attitudes too.And then...the film just stops being about that and descends into melodrama. Viking melodrama, but all the same. It is basically about how pride comes before a fall, and teamwork and the trust of the team are more important than individual achievement. However it does close with some dynamite aerial action scenes. If this sounds like a tired MGM plot for a William Haines movie in 1930, it really is. Actually I think William Haines would have found it too silly and just walked away.What is probably most important is this film's place in popular culture. These were the Reagan years, and pride in country and in particular the military were back in style. All of this macho posturing, as long as it was for kin and country, was admired. Also, it birthed one of the funniest comedies ever made - ""Hot Shots"" which was an obvious Zucker-style parody of this film. If you ever want to see Charlie Sheen when he was young and healthy and at the top of his comic game when he had everything to look forward to, take a look at that comedy.And I don't usually recommend the use of mind altering drugs, but to get through Top Gun, you just might need them.",Top Gun
22,Uriah43,Trouble at Mach Speed,8,2 August 2020,"Troubled by accusations that his deceased father was somehow disgraced as a pilot in a fateful combat sortie during the Vietnam War, ""Pete 'Maverick"" Mitchell"" (Tom Cruise) exhibits a reckless nature while at the same time trying to be the best fighter pilot in the U.S. Navy. So when an incident disqualifies another pilot from attending the elite school known as Top Gun both he and his partner ""Nick 'Goose' Bradshaw"" (Anthony Edwards) are elated to be chosen instead. Yet as good as the two of them are, neither of them are prepared for just how grueling the competition will be to earn the honor of being top of their class. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that I thought that the selection of Tom Cruise was a perfect choice for this picture as he exuded the necessary cockiness required for this role. Not only that but his acting, along with of Val Kilmer (as ""Tom 'Iceman' Kazansky"") and Tom Skerritt (""Mike 'Viper' Metcalf"") was equally impressive as well. In short, those viewers looking for an excellent action film might want to consider this particular movie and I have rated it accordingly.",Top Gun
23,anaconda-40658,Low Gun.,4,15 June 2015,"Top Gun (1986): Dir: Tony Scott / Cast: Tom Cruise, Kelly McGillis, Val Kilmer, Anthony Edwards, Tom Skerritt: Women love this film for the romance and males love the action. For me, the best aspect is the end credits that signalled that this overrated dog show was over. It is a film about being the best you can be but unfortunately the film itself fails to live up to this expectation. Aerial photography and sky action sequences are overwhelming but story is full of clichés. Two Navy pilots compete at the Fighter Weapons School where top honors are known as Top Guns. Tony Scott is skilled at presenting action. This is a stretch from his previous film, a vampire flick called The Hunger. Tom Cruise has fun as the hotshot pilot whose father was also a fighter pilot who had disappeared. The rest of the cast are reduced to mere stereotypes. Kelly McGillis as an instructor is a dumb romantic prop. It comes to no surprise that she falls for Cruise and makes that imbecilic appearance in the conclusion just to jerk viewers around. Val Kilmer plays the ever familiar rival pilot who will come to respect him. Anthony Edwards plays the best friend who meets a tragic end. Tom Skerritt plays a commander who knew the father of the Cruise character and that is the extent of his role. Too bad the script didn't meet tragic end. Potential theme gunned down by corny romantic drivel where the top gun is the soundtrack album. Score: 4 ½ / 10",Top Gun

25,Aaron1375,It's the highway to the overrated zone!!!,4,6 April 2010,"I have never been able to watch this movie from beginning to end, so my review is probably not the best resource for a person deciding whether or not they would like to see this movie. I am also not the biggest Tom Cruise fan in the world. Not that I dislike him or anything, he just has never been able to put a movie together that I find complete. Even the ones I like a bit usually have a lot of flaws within them. This one has to many flaws for me to like, the only thing I sort of like about this movie is the 80's music that accompanies this piece. Other than that it is just like some sort of a commercial for the United States Air Force, or are they Navy? Anyways, the story is about these guys competing in some sort of academy to become the top gun and that is about all there is to it from what I have seen. I have pretty much seen all the movie, just not all at one time cause it just kind of bores me. You take away the music and you are just left with guys flying in jets and competing over a woman. It is almost a chick flick that tries to disguise itself as some over the top action movie because of the inclusion of jets in it. Val Kilmer is in this film too, and he livens things up and for some reason is considered the villain of the movie, but seriously Tom Cruise's character in this film is less likable in my opinion.",Top Gun
26,Wuchakk,"Drama on the ground, excitement in the air",7,29 November 2012,"Tony Scott's ""Top Gun"" was obviously built on the template of 1982's ""An Officer and a Gentleman"" and was a mega-hit in May/June of 1986.THE PLOT: Two hotshot Navy pilots, Maverick (Tom Cruise) and Goose (Anthony Edwards), are sent to a prestigious flight school in San Diego where they must endure the rivalry of other pilots, like Iceman (Val Kilmer). Maverick seeks a relationship with one of the school's civilian instructors (Kelly McGillis) and also faces a crisis when his cocky confidence is shaken.""Top Gun"" is basically a modern ""The Blue Max"" in that it mixes the drama on the ground with the excitement in the air. It's a good mix that keeps it from being one-dimensional.Some criticize the film as being superficial fluff but, while ""Top Gun"" is definitely a blockbuster, it actually has some credible depth. For example, the rivalry of the pilots, the mystery of Maverick's father, the grievous death of one of the main characters, and Maverick's crisis of confidence. A good example of the film's depth can be seen in the scene where Iceman confronts Maverick in the locker room after a tragedy. Iceman is sincere but walks on eggshells because he respects Maverick's unpredictable and dangerous nature. The scene rings true-to-life.Tom Skerritt is notable as one of the older instructors of the school, Viper. There's a good scene in the 2nd half where Maverick visits Viper's house on a Sunday, which features a great (funny) line from Skerritt (""I'm not going to blow sunshine"").Unfortunately, the film has been accused of being somehow ""homo-erotic."" Nonsense. In case these clueless critics didn't notice, Maverick is chasing McGillis' character throughout the film and even ""breaks into"" a Ladies Room to see her. Meanwhile Goose is happily married with children. As for the locker room scenes and the all-male volley ball game, the story takes place at a flight school where all the students are MALE. The volley ball sequence is just a fun scene, nothing more, and was likely thrown in for the ladies. Besides, notice that Maverick leaves the game prematurely to go see HIS BABE. I can't help but wonder if these criticizers are projecting their OWN ISSUES on to the film. Enough said.On the downside, there are some cringe-inducing scenes, like the aforementioned one in the Ladies Room with its awkward dialogue. A minor flaw is that the film starts to lose its drive by the final act, maybe because it drags on and should've been edited. The film runs 110 minutes, by the way.""Top Gun"" has a decent mid-80's soundtrack highlighted by Kenny Loggins' ""Danger Zone."" Speaking of the soundtrack, Judas Priest's excellent track ""Reckless"" off of TURBO was picked by the producers for the soundtrack, but the Priest boys foolishly turned down the offer because (1.) they didn't know who Tom Cruise was since he wasn't a major star until after this movie, (2.) they therefore didn't think the movie would be a hit, and (3.) if they sold the song to the movie it would've been omitted from TURBO. Big mistake because the film was a massive blockbuster and it would've rocketed Priest into superstardom. In any case, listen to ""Reckless"" on youtube sometime and you'll see that it would've fit the movie perfectly. It also would've been the heaviest song on the soundtrack by far, even though it's light by Priest's standards.BOTTOM LINE: ""Top Gun"" screams mid-80's blockbuster and deservedly so. It's a kinetic film with a nice mix of drama, fun, crisis and aircraft excitement.GRADE: B",Top Gun
27,safenoe,Goose was the lynchpin of this fine 80s movie.,8,21 October 2016,"Top Gun personifies the 80s, Reaganomics, the USA vs The Evil Empire. My guess is that if Jimmy Carter won re-election in 1980, Top Gun would be stuck in the bottom drawer of some scriptwriter, or it would have been a talky philosophical black and white movie about the constitutional right to burn the flag, or the fate of the US hostages still stuck in Iran. No doubt the re- election of Reagan in 1984 emboldened the producers to get things moving! And Harold Faltermeyer scored the movie!! Beverly Hills Cop come on down!It's interesting seeing stars being nurtured in Top Gun...Meg Ryan, Tim Robbins, Anthony Edwards. Michael Ironside added much gravitas to this top movie, and somewhat ironically or coincidentally Val Kilmer featured here - two years earlier he was excellent in the underrated Top Secret! Two Top movies for Val in two years. Top Gun is credited with a boost in air force recruitment, with every politician aspiring to be Secretary for the Air Force. Not the Secretary for Defense please, but Secretary for the Air Force.Goose's untimely death was a blow to the guts, and it was hard to take.",Top Gun
28,mm-39,Great movie but,6,15 June 2001,"This is a great movie, but it lacks something.  It was not Tom Cruse's best acting performance, or I did not like Toms character.  Well maybe, pilots act this way, but Tom was not a team player, and learned about it; Val Kilmer was a more liked person, and me with own sin should not cast the first stone because my wife tells me I got a Tom Cruse, top gun attitude so I should not judge.  The cast is good you have Michael Ironside, and Tom Skeriet, and the script is good, but not accurate of what happens at top gun, and the story has a moral about growing up along with over coming life obstacles.

29,Mr-Fusion,This movie's great for all the wrong reasons . . . or the right ones?,7,29 December 2014,"Tarantino ruined TOP GUN for me. There, I said it. Now I can't watch it without the homoerotic undertones leaping right outta the screen: the towel scenes in the locker room; the lingering shots of beach hardbodies; the extremely questionable macho dialogue; the air boss who walks around screaming, ""I WANT SOME BUTTS!"". It is absolutely hilarious, and I sincerely hope that such a brilliant subversion was no accident. This movie's way too polished for that. But in all seriousness, TOP GUN does feature some awesome planes, impressive aerial photography, and ""Mighty Wings"", a bitchin' song if ever there was one. 7/10",Top Gun
30,StevePulaski,There's something here you can't dismiss,7,9 June 2014,"From its attractive lead actor who went on to become a huge name, its producer-credit to industry legend Jerry Bruckheimer, its soundtrack composed of rock and pop hits, its inclusion of action sequences, romance, and average to mediocre displays of acting, Top Gun includes every minute detail about the classic American movie blockbuster. What's surprising, in addition, is that the film actually has credible payoff in the end, and while existing mostly as a curious piece of cinema history, it also works to be an entertaining picture on a basic level.Tom Cruise stars as a United States Naval Aviator Lieutenant by the name of Pete ""Maverick"" Mitchell, a young, hot-shot aviator who loves flying and goofing off when he really should be working. His partner-and-crime and longtime friend, whom he considers family, is Nick ""Goose"" Bradshaw (Anthony Edwards), who has a wife and kid back home, but accepts Maverick mainly because of the fact that he doesn't have much else besides him. Maverick's father was killed in Vietnam, which only leaves Maverick in denial that his dad's death was because of circumstance, rather than the actuality of the situation being a personal mistake.After one goof-off session too many, Maverick and Goose are sent to Fighter Weapons School (nicknamed ""Top Gun"") by their superior officer, who admires their talents but simply can't control them and recognizes they deserve to be placed in the elite squad of pilots. Upon arriving to Top Gun, Maverick meets a wonderful woman by the name of Charlotte Blackwood (Kelly McGillis), who he learns is his instructor during his time at the school. He also clashes with rival student Lieutenant Tom ""Iceman"" Kazanski (Val Kilmer), whom, while he detests on his competitive level, thoroughly admires him for his skill and devotion to flying.One of Top Gun's underlying strengths is how it doesn't settle for being another indistinguishable piece of action filmmaking nor a fluffy romantic piece with some disjointed shots of aerial combat thrown in as an excuse for screen writing diversity. The film also attempts to humanize the bond squadmates have with one another, and show how one comes of age when they are thrown into a group with extremely high expectations set on them. The issue here, however, is that writers Jim Cash and Jack Epps, Jr. throw those elements in the film at such an alarmingly fast rate that it's easy to miss these subtler, low-key elements that, in turn, work to make up the film.The scenes that do work and require no further contemplation are the scenes of aerial combat, which are clear, coherent, and intense thanks to Tony Scott's strong direction. With his shots and structure, Scott always strove for clarity even when it seemed that little could be established. Whether he was filming a runaway train or fighter jets circling around an area in the sky, appearing as if they were defying gravity with every nosedive and loop, Scott was clear and vivid with his direction. Give Scott some great, crystal-clear cinematography by Jeffrey L. Kimball - who worked with Scott through much of his career - and you have a visually distinct and astonishing picture.If only Kimball and Scott had better writing and acting to work with when it came down to structuring Top Gun's story. The film's story often feels too cluttered, as I said, struggling to fit so much into its one-hundred and nine minute runtime, and then on top of that, you have average acting by Cruise and McGillis, some strong work by Edwards, and some seriously mediocre and over-the-top acting by Kilmer, who throws scenes off instantly when he walks on screen. Top Gun is so structurally uneven that it is a blessing that the film has its unique visuals and strong cinematographical work going for it.Yet, there's something here I can't easily dismiss like I can with the barrage of other blockbusters I am put through every summer. Maybe it's the musical genius and simplicity of Kenny Loggins' signature song ""Danger Zone,"" which comes on about a dozen times in the film. Perhaps it's the gay subtext Quentin Tarantino's character Sid alluded to in the now famous monologue in the little-seen independent flick Sleep With Me that kept me alert and interested. Or perhaps it's just that this film is so American that is hurts at times. As difficult as it is to define and place, Top Gun can't be written off with a few words, and instead, must be given some solid care and attention as if it were an award-worthy movie rather than just a piece of summer fluff.Starring: Tom Cruise, Kelly McGillis, Anthony Edwards, and Val Kilmer.

Don Simpson and Jerry Bruckheimer (also responsible for the 1984 popular culture smash hit ""Beverly Hills Cop"") struck gold with ""Top Gun"" and it helped define what most people remember about the era - mainly cheesy soundtracks, unbelievably good-looking people playing ordinary everyday roles, stupid romantic subplots and a lot of bad action sequences.""Top Gun"" is a fun film to watch.

33,Rainey-Dawn,Fun Action,7,21 October 2014,"Top Gun was a hit when it first came out in 1986. In fact, I could not get away from it. It was shown several times on video in my first high school on days we were suppose to outside exercising but it was either rainy or to cold - so the class usually voted to watch Top Gun (again)! So I did catch a burn-out on the movie but it is still a good film in-spite of any inaccurate details within the film. - It's fun to watch.No the film is not perfect - it's just a fun movie that was never meant to be 100% accurate.

One of the students, Maverick (Tom Cruise), fights the attitudes of the other pilots and struggles to be the best pilot, all the while forming a relationship with civilian instructor Charlie Blackwood (Kelly McGillis).This is one of those movies I saw once when I was a little kid. While I don't remember much of it, I do recall finding Maverick's daring character interesting as he strives to stand out and the romance between him and Charlie to be a good piece of chemistry for this action-adventure movie. The dogfighting scenes with the F-14A Tomcats are well-choreographed and Tom Cruise is a ""go getter"" in his Maverick role. His love/hate friendship formed with his comrades provided a nice touch of sportsmanship and heartfelt drama. Actors Tom Skerritt, Val Kilmer and Meg Ryan all rounded up what is a pretty good cast of characters with some stellar acting.Overall, it's a nice piece of action drama.Grade B+",Top Gun
35,sddavis63,Lots Of Action With Little Story,5,29 September 2007,"If you like action movies simply for the sake of the action, you'll probably enjoy this movie a lot. It is full of action (and even a bit of combat). However, if you expect at least a bit of a believable story behind all the action, in the end this movie will disappoint. In essence, there are three different stories told in this movie, and all of them either lacked suspense or believability.The first takes up about the first three quarters of the film. Maverick (Tom Cruise) is a Navy Fighter Pilot sent to a special school for the Navy's elite pilots. To the extent that there's a story here it seems to revolve around whether Maverick or Iceman (Val Kilmer) will end up at the top of the class and win the Top Gun award (and essentially be declared the best of the best). The problem is that the competition really didn't interest me. The movie didn't really offer any particular reason to root for one over the other, and when Tom Skerrit (playing the commander of the school) offers a voice over (by radio to the pilots) saying that only 2 points separates Maverick and Iceman, my honest reaction was ""who really cares?"" In fairness I guess kudos have to be given to the writers for avoiding the temptation to turn Iceman into the embodiment of evil, which would have made the story even more ridiculous (even though it would have given us someone to root for.) As it is, though, watching this competition between the two was a bit like watching a World Series between the Arizona Diamondbacks and the Seattle Mariners (or substitute any two teams that you don't care a whit about.) The second storyline was about the romance between Maverick and one of his civilian instructors at the school (played by Kelly McGinnis.) The relationship wasn't sufficiently developed and just didn't strike me as believable. How did Charlie (McGillis) survive as an instructor at this school when she was so easily swept off her feet by a hot shot student (given that the only students she'd ever have at this school are hot-shots?) The final storyline was the most interesting of the three, and revolved around whether Maverick could regain his form after the accidental death of his buddy Goose (Anthony Edwards.) Again, though, there's a predictability to this. You know in the end that he'll come through. How he came around was a bit problematic to me (entertaining though it was, I admit). If the sort of thing that happened in the last little bit of the movie was really the sort of thing that might have happened during the Cold War, then it seems to me that the Cold War would have become ""hot"" pretty fast. This is clearly a plot line that worked very well in the 1980's, when Cold War-themed movies were common (think ""Red Dawn"" or even ""Rocky V"" - although ""Top Gun"" is certainly less over-the-top than those two), and that historical context might be a problem when watching such a movie almost 20 years after the end of the Cold War, when the passions just aren't there anymore.Anyway, I'd give this a 5/10. Action-lovers will love it; others might be disappointed.",Top Gun

37,Robert_duder,Eighties classic that just resonates action and sexy romance,8,1 April 2008,"Top Gun is an undisputed classic of the eighties starring an undisputed Hollywood King who was just a prince during this film Tom Cruise. Top Gun is really the perfect melding of key elements that make it the timeless classic that it is. Big gunning, action machines, dog fighting, cocky attractive males, sultry, sexy female, a pounding adrenaline rushing soundtrack...Highway to The Danger Zone is one of my favorite rock songs. The film (as proved on the DVD) can be advertised as a romance, an action film, a patriotism film...it has a little of everything. This was really the film that put director Tony Scott on the map and it's perfect for his style and desire of direction. I admit I'm not particularly a huge fan of Scott's direction. I have found a lot of his films very choppy and chaotic and it happens to be that his music video style of direction works very well for Top Gun. Scott certainly knows action and knows how to tell a story and has proved it with great films from the eighties in particular. He has a gritty style that makes you feel the film and a pulse pounding rhythm and he gives that style to Top Gun in every aspect of it.Tom Cruise is a heavy weight now and even then. Coming from Risky Business he was the hottest commodity in Hollywood and he further proved his stardom in Top Gun. Cruise just has a quality...I mean he is very talented which definitely helps and his performance as Maverick is quite emotional at times and he plays the cocky smart talking pilot very well. But besides all that he is just simply a star that lights up the screen. Kelly McGillis plays Cruise's love interest Charlie. McGillis does a decent job although I don't feel that she really holds her own against some of the more powerful actors in the film like Cruise. She also doesn't really fit the eighties hot girl formula. She looks kind of old actually. I mean when the film was made she was only 29 (which was still 5 years older than star Cruise) but she is over make-up'd, and kind of boring. Fortunately her scenes with Cruise work and he seems to bring out the best in the romance aspect. Anthony Edwards is really terrific as Maverick's cautious smart talking partner. His role isn't huge, it's mostly to support Cruise but he is terrific and they have great chemistry together. Val Kilmer as Ice is usually considered the nemesis. Really he isn't but more of a competitive adversary for Cruise's Maverick. Kilmer is decent but doesn't really top any acting peaks or anything. He's kind of a withdrawn quiet character but he's good for his purpose in the film. Tom Skerritt and Michael Ironside are the senior members of the cast as the Top Gun instructors. They are decent but don't really hold a flame to the younger cast. Also watch for a young Meg Ryan as Goose (Edwards') wife.Considerably Top Gun's budget wasn't much. In a way it does show with the flight effects because I think they used the same material over and over again and yet you don't care and hardly notice because there is just something really great about this film. I think it's a combination of the cast and the director and just a classic eighties mood to it. It just doesn't matter what you like out of a film Top Gun has a little of everything making it the ultimate date movie and making it a true classic!! A must see!! 8/10",Top Gun
38,Lejink,High Fliers,7,4 September 2021,"For years, practically everyone on my wife's side of the family has been chiding me for never watching ""Top Gun"". They've all watched it loads of times and can sing every song and quite whole lines of dialogue from it, but I hated ""You Take My Breath Away"" when it topped the charts and never understood the references to having a ""wing man"" made by guys as they ventured into town on a Saturday night, or even the wearing of patched leather jackets at the time. Well, finally my wife won me round and set up a Friday night movie experience to watch it, with nachos, hot dogs and cokes, although I think it's really just that she's always fancied Tom Cruise...And make no mistake, this film is all about Tom. Even before he got his teeth fixed, that famous smile is never far away while the scene where he's effectively standing around in his underwear in the men's room while his chief is giving him a pep-talk had me wondering what was the female equivalent term for chauvinistic.The plot is just what I'd expect, right from the opening credits, a clichéd, idealised picture of handsome, young gung-ho American airmen (and noticeably no women) being put through their paces at a sort of finishing school for pilots under the tough-love tutelage of grizzled veteran C. O,'s Tom Skerrit and Michael Ironside. Into this hothouse environment cruises Tom's Maverick character and his lifetime buddy, navigator co-pilot Goose. Straight away Mav's in competition with Val Kilmer's Ice for the Top Gun prize as well as chasing Kelly McGillis's glamorous flight instructor and trying to either live down or live up to whatever mysterious mission claimed the life of his adored jet-fighter dad who died in action in the 60's.What follows are numerous exciting flying sequences, while on the ground, there's romance, tragedy and eventually redemption for the blue-eyed boy, all to a soundtrack sometimes as loud as a jet engine passing overhead.I'm not going to say this was a deep or emotional viewing experience, but I can definitely see why my in-laws like it so much and in the wider picture also why the film was such a huge commercial success, even to the extent of eventually engendering a soon-come follow-up some 35 years later.Still hate that Berlin song though....",Top Gun
39,ThomasDrufke,Flying Against a Ghost,7,9 May 2015,"There are few movies that are considered classics that I have yet to see, but Top Gun was one of them. I was pretty tired of hearing the endless references and not understanding them, so I decided to finally sit down and give it a shot. It's enjoyable, but I think it was more of a product of it's time. It's better appreciated as an 80's film than a film in general. Now I don't mean that the effects don't hold up, because they do. I just feel like it had all the fruit at the right time, where as now some of them might be expired or just not as popular. Whether it was 'Take My Breath Away', a smash hit at the time, or Tom Cruise, a blossoming superstar actor, Top Gun is a good movie that was definitely considered great back in the day.Maverick, one of the most famous film characters of all time, learns to become not just a better Navy pilot, but a more well rounded man. Tom Cruise has been better for sure but he has some fun with this role. But when you look at Collateral and even last years Edge of Tomorrow, Cruise is a legitimate actor, but I think at this point in his career he was just trying to make it big. He's extremely cocky and not particularly fond of anybody trying to tell him what to do. He needs wisdom and a life altering event that humbles him. Well he definitely gets both of those. But his cockiness is why the character became so famous. It's one of the main reasons why I think a sequel could be both great and potentially unnecessary. We go on a journey with Maverick throughout the film. A journey that changes his character quite a bit, so I'm not sure a second look at his character works. On the other-hand, knowing where his character ends up, it can be an interesting passing of the torch story if you will.What I think was missing here was more of a back story with Maverick. We get a little bit with his father and a quick remark about his mother, but I would have liked to see more of how he became so cocky and conceded. I did enjoy the romance between Cruise and Kelly McGinnis, who has some of the most stunning eyes you will ever see. You can tell she was one of the few people that could get to him and help him through all the troubles he ends up going through.+Effects hold up +Kilmer and McGinnis' performance +Music -Needed more back story -Too much of an 80's product 7.0/10",Top Gun

Val Kilmer also was great as Cruise's rival.The soundtrack is awesome. I love the songs ""Danger Zone"" and ""Take my Breath Away."" Overall, this is a good movie but nothing special.

44,The-Sarkologist,The only good thing about this movie are the jets,7,21 December 2013,"The only reason that I give this movie a seven is because it is about jet fighters and dogfighting them. There are not many dogfights in this movie though and the plot is almost non-existence. It is basically about a hot shot pilot who goes to an elite naval pilot school (Top Gun) and trains to be even better. He then goes for the top pilot trophy, but has an accident and must overcome his loss and get back into the field.I guess this movie is then a human drama, though it takes a while for the death of Maverick's friend, Goose, to happen, and by then three-quarters of the movie is over and there is little time for him to reconcile with himself. I guess the movie builds up to this spot to create a huge fall, but it would have been far better if the death of Goose occur closer to the beginning and then spent the rest of the movie trying to overcome the guilt and the sorrow of this death. As it is, it is a romp through fighter school with a little drama at the end.What I can applaud the movie is the brilliant cinematography, which comes close to that of The Rock and Bad Boys. It is produced by the same people, but it is directed by one of the Scott family. It is an okay movie, but not something that I am going to waste my time drawing out as it is quite empty beyond the jets.",Top Gun

46,tomgillespie2002,Good and bad in equal measures,5,18 December 2012,"Following his shocking suicide earlier this year, director Tony Scott's legend was cemented, with actors and fellow directors flooding to pay tribute to the man that delivered the likes of The Last Boy Scout (1991) and Crimson Tide (1995). Personally, with the greatest respect, I feel his death has overshadowed what was a relatively average career, in which his finest achievement, the Tarantino-scripted True Romance (1993), was possibly his most low-octane film, given that he is most fondly remembered for his work in the action field. Therefore, it seemed the perfect time to re-visit his most popular film, Top Gun, the high- fiving homoerotica-fest that cemented the careers of both Scott and star Tom Cruise, a film that they are still, 26 years later, best remembered for.With top fighter pilot Cougar (John Stockwell) losing his nerve during a dogfight and dropping out of the Air Force, hot-shot pilot Pete 'Maverick' Mitchell is offered the chance to join the Top Gun flight school. Fancying himself as the best of the best, Maverick, along with his RIO lieutenant Goose (Anthony Edwards), sets about establishing a name for himself with grand stunts and a cocky attitude, almost coming to blows with his fellow elite students, namely Iceman (Val Kilmer). He even finds time to romance instructor Charlie Blackwood (Kelly McGillis). But when a tragic accident occurs, Maverick must do a bit of soul-searching, and question his ability to live up to the legend of his father.For a film that remains so immensely popular, Top Gun is shockingly bad. The almost unbearable swagger of the now slightly creepy Scientology dwarf Tom Cruise leads to many moments of teeth-grinding anger- inducement, with the much-imitated You've Got That Lovin' Feeling karaoke moment being simply embarrassing. But with most square-jawed, Reagan-era 1980's action films comes much hilarity, with the best- selling soundtrack proving to be the king of synthesised cheddar, and the near-constant homoeroticism questioning the era's view of a 'man's man'. The volleyball scene is especially jaw-dropping, with slow-motion arse-slapping and greased-up torso's aplenty, playing out like a pre-sex ritual by Cruise and Kilmer.The film is real justification of Tony Scott's reputation as a great action director. The dogfight scenes are filmed beautifully, with rapid editing and spectacular framing generating real excitement between all the crud (especially impressive given the cost of flying these machines and the heavily-restricted time-frames in which the crew had to shoot within). Yet whenever the film is in danger of getting quite good, it delves into another cliché or shifts the focus back to the uninvolving romance between Maverick and Charlie, with scenes involving Maverick's inner-demon fighting especially causing the fists to clench. With a film having the ability to be so bad and rather good in equal measures, it's hard to really justify it's massive fan-base and endless imitations, yet it's also difficult to deny.",Top Gun
47,zkonedog,"Yes, It's Corny, But That Is The Whole Point",7,17 January 2020,"Generally, I tend to watch films filled with deep themes and complex characters. As such, watching ""Top Gun"" never really appealed to me all that much, despite its 80s-classic status. While it is true that the movie is almost devoid of plot, what I found is that it ends up not mattering as much as I would have thought. Director Tony Scott simply leans into the pomp, circumstance, and machismo instead of justifying it, and the result is just too much fun not to enjoy.For a basic overview, ""Top Gun"" focuses on the best fighter pilots in the United States all training together at the prestigious Top Gun Naval Academy. Maverick (Tom Cruise) is trying to outrun the demons of his late father, while at the same time romancing program instructor Charlie (Kelly McGillis). His partner, Goose (Anthony Edwards), is a loyal friend with a wife (played by Meg Ryan) and a son he's flying for. Their main competition for bragging rights in the Top Gun program? The mustache-twirling Ice Man (Val Kilmer), who is as snobbish as they come.As previously mentioned, ""Top Gun"" is a little strange as a film in the sense that it contains almost no compelling plot whatsoever. The competition for the top prize is contrived (and really quite meaningless in the end), while any conflict between the U.S. Navy and enemy combatants is strictly boilerplate stuff. For this reason, and just considering the way I usually watch movies, I'll never put ""Top Gun"" on any all-time, best-of lists.That being said, almost everything else in the film is just so much fun that it entertained me far more than I thought it would. The key decision here, I think, is that the filmmakers know this and expressly set out to create a sensory extravaganza as opposed to anything incredibly deep. The appeal here is the almost visceral sound/feeling of the fighter jets dogfighting to Kenny Loggins' ""Danger Zone"", the hilarious camaraderie/machismo of the male pilots, and even the sheer ridiculousness of those shirtless guys playing a game of beach volleyball. Everything in ""Top Gun"" is made to stimulate the senses, and it basically all works to that effect.Because all of those antics put viewers in such an emotionally-charged state, the character moments really work too. For example, Maverick and Goose trying to woo Charlie with ""You've Lost That Lovin' Feeling"" or pounding out ""Great Balls of Fire"" on the piano make it all the more devastating when tragedy befalls Goose and his family and the effect it has on Maverick. Viewers are drawn into these characters not from a perspective of carefully-created depth, but from a simpler place of ""these people are fun and now I'm invested in them"".A special shout-out must also be given to Cruise, who practically steals the show here. Sure, he was already known to cinema-goers from ""Risky Business"" a few years before, but there's absolutely no way you can watch his performance here and not think ""this guy is going to be a huge Hollywood star"", which is course exactly what transpired. His mischievous smirks and intense emotional reactions are the stuff most actors can only dream of conjuring up.So, overall I enjoyed ""Top Gun"" much more than I thought I would. As long as you view it as pure 80s-era fun, there is a lot to like here. Not high-brow cinema by a long shot, but a great thrill ride from start to finish.",Top Gun
48,Floated2,Quite boring and overhyped,2,2 July 2018,"Having not seen Top Gun before but of course knowing of the film and the significance it had upon Tom Cruise's career path, knowing how raved and praised it has become in today's day and age, one decided in watching for the first time. Having somewhat high expectations based on the fact that the film seems to be universally praise from fanboys, Top Gun was a letdown.We seen a very young Tom Cruise, as well as a young Val Kilmer and they are both decent but overall the film doesn't offer much and is actually quite boring. There are the typical drama that occur but in general nothing too much that grabs the attention. Also the film offers several cringe and corny moments, but that appears to be a major reason as to why it is so loved?Also it was very clear they had to have a character killed off (in this case being Goose) to build upon sympathy and have another motor, but his death really wasn't as heartwarming as imagined. His character came off as somewhat of a joke anyway so the death didn't leave much of an impression. Furthermore, Top Gun isn't nearly as good as it has been praised for, and once can't understand the constant hype it has received. The fact that they are making a sequel over 30 years later, shows that people really love this movie. But will it be a mistake? How much hype will that have? We know once that roll out comes out and the sequel in near on its way, a lot of people will start reviewing and rewatching (or watching for the first time Top Gun).

50,digitalbeachbum,"Doesn't hold up over time, Bottom Gun",1,25 March 2017,"This movie is a time vault of 80's nostalgia. It is Miami Vice on military grade steroids with its catch phrases, male macho orgasms and Hollywood myths. It is every thing John Wayne represented in the 40's and 50's on westerns and war movies, but set in the 80's.Top Gun is a movie about a character named Maverick and is played by a young Tom Cruise. Maverick is a loose cannon who causes lots of problems, including a death of a friend. He doesn't like following rules or being a team player. Hence the name, Maverick.While the casting is perfect for this movie, the direction and the script is filled with too many factual errors. There is also the problem with stereotypical representation of women and Russians. It is 100% pro-American and anti-everything not American.I saw this movie in 1989 when I was at Parris Island. My platoon had just won the rifle range and our SDI promised us a day off on Sunday. That morning he rolled in a cart with a small screened television and a VCR. In popped a pirated copy of an unknown movie. We huddled around the television with the opening scenes. We all cheered, hooted and hollered. It was a grand moment for us.However after 27 years I watched it again and could not bear even a few minutes of the movie. I could see all types of visual flaws in the movie, such as the opening statement which uses the word ""insure"" rather than ""ensure"". facepalm.This movie does not stand the test of time.

51,Movie_Muse_Reviews,Impossible to NOT like,6,22 April 2008,"As much as you want to dismiss ""Top Gun"" as one of the cheesiest movies ever, it simply cannot be done. There might not be a lot to love about the film, but I challenge anyone to find something to hate about it.The story of Pete ""Maverick"" Mitchell (Cruise) and his partner ""Goose"" (Edwards) as they are selected to attend the Navy's top air academy for dogfighting is classically structured. There are so many archetypes (the mission gone wrong, the rebellious pilot, the instructor-student romance) that ""Top Gun"" has both an eye-rolling quality and yet a comfortably familiar quality. It's so easy to follow that you get bored through most of it, but you never once stop rooting for Maverick and Goose and you laugh at the completely implausible yet successful courting tactics employed by Maverick on his love interest, ""Charlie.""Another thing that can make a movie fun that ""Top Gun"" has plenty of is music. A rockin 80s soundtrack that can't be beat, from ""Danger Zone"" to ""Take My Breath Away,"" the film is partially as lovable as it is because even if what you're watching is boring, what you're listening to is fun.""Top Gun"" could be a totally forgettable film, but it is that innocent, charming quality that lets it get away with the fact that everyone's who hasn't seen it thinks it is one of the best films of the 80s, when it is by no stretch of the mind in that category.",Top Gun

53,Anonymous_Maxine,"Top Gun may have been blown a little bit out of proportion, but the performances are so good that it doesn't matter.",9,30 January 2001,"Top Gun is a fighter pilot training facility designed to pick out the best fighter pilots and turn them into The Best Of The Best - in particular, to teach them to `dogfight,' a skill which seems to have been largely lost due to the convenience of missiles and locking mechanisms. It is clearly a formula film in the now-typical Jerry Bruckheimer fashion, but the performances are excellent, as are the majority of the aerial flight sequences. Even the obligatory romantic subplot is fairly believable due to the quality acting, as well as an excellent 80s soundtrack (oh, admit it).Tom Cruise stars as Maverick Mitchell, a superb fighter pilot with a semi-subconscious and potentially dangerous need to live up to the skill of his father, who mysteriously died in battle. The best scenes in the film, needless to say, are those in the air, both in the training sequences as well as the surprisingly effective final battle. Some of those scenes were a little overdone, though, such as the scene with the inverted mid-flight Polaroid. I realize that they were not exactly flying bi-planes, but I still doubt that those fighter planes could be maneuvered to the point where two of them could literally fly a couple of feet apart like that. However, despite that, I think that the scene achieved its desired effect.The main thing that I did not like about Top Gun was its predictability, which is why I'm not sure if what I am about to say could really qualify as a spoiler. But just in case, here's the obligatory notice - (spoilers ahead). First of all, it's a formula film, so you know that Maverick is going to get the girl (in a scene that nearly ruined the otherwise good ending). But there were other, subtler but not much less obvious things. For example, the film starts off with a training sequence in which a pilot referred to as Cougar freezes up in the plane and nearly kills himself and his co-pilot. Maverick (of course) goes back to fly him back to the aircraft carrier on his wing, despite the fact that he was nearly out of fuel. Cougar's near-death experience inspires him to quit so he doesn't get killed and leave his wife and kid fatherless and husbandless. After this scene, it's pretty obvious that Maverick would find himself in a similar situation later in the film. Even more predictable than that was the death of Goose, Maverick's long time friend and co-pilot. As soon as you see him with his wife and kid (particularly the slow-motion shot of him hugging his son), it is so clear that he's going to die that they might as well have put it right into the dialogue - `You know Goose, I'm really gonna miss you when you get killed in the next Act.'Despite the predictability, I still really liked Top Gun because of the acting as well as the cinematography. Tom Cruise and Val Kilmer, as Maverick and Iceman, work so well on screen that you could almost compare them to Martin Riggs and Roger Murtaugh. Besides that, ironically, enough, the romantic subplot actually works here. I'm always complaining about this, but the romance in Bruckheimer films almost never works because it's always so manipulative and awkwardly thrown in. But there was actually some thought put into that element of Top Gun. The imagery and atmosphere, for example, greatly enhanced the relationship between Maverick and Charlie, his female instructor. The romance in Bruckheimer films is usually added for the obvious purpose of widening the audience by appealing to women, but the quality of that part of this film overshadows its inherent purpose, so Bravo, Jerry, the romance didn't suck. But wait, then they throw in a scene with the sweaty pilots all playing shirtless volleyball, occasionally flexing for the passing camera. For shame, Jerry (yeah you too, Tony), you canceled out your good romance scene with THAT little addition. On the other hand, there was also some good comic relief, although some of it may have gone a little too far, such as the `buzzing the tower' scenes. I would think that a stunt like that would precipitate some serious disciplinary action from Maverick's superiors, but I have to admit that it was funny. I particularly liked it when the guy in the tower who spilled coffee on himself goes out into the hallway and runs into a young guy carrying a tray of coffee mugs (`God DAMN it, that's twice!').Adding to this better than average film is a pretty good ending, except for the final scene between Maverick and Charlie, which was just dumb. I liked the way that the rivalry between Maverick and Iceman was eliminated by the final battle scene, rather than having one of them (it would have been Maverick, of course) come out as the winner as the other sulks away in defeat. That final battle scene was probably the best part of the film, by the way, especially the extremely skilled editing. Despite the fact that Maverick threw Goose's dog tags into the ocean at the end of the film (a ridiculous move comparable to when the old Rose stupidly threw that jewel in the ocean at the end of Titanic, severely limiting the already limited satisfaction delivered by that film), Top Gun still manages to come off as a quality action film.",Top Gun
54,videorama-759-859391,"86 blockbuster hit, not a film that comes up tops",6,28 August 2016,"You know the movie, you remember those moments, etc, skimming past the air tower, coffee splutter scene, dolly shot with Tom Cruise on his bike, arriving at new fighter pilot school, and of course all those great songs. Some memorable moments, they've parodied in later movies, even that Bogie line, that you couldn't resist using in later spoofs, the one of course, you know which I'm referring. Although this a very entertaining and well made film, it isn't a good one, where beneath all those well staged and brilliantly filmed flying sequences, great classy songs, and those moments, tragic, and humorous, is a film that keeps dropping down to a case of ordinary, or unexceptional. Maverick (Cruise) and Goose (Edwards), love the names, are sent up with the best of the best, to the naval school of Top Gun. Of course, we have an ace 'hot sh.t' pilot there, already, Iceman (Kilmer) who him and Cruise, encounter a few stare offs, in discreetly smooth and mocking ways and near butt heads occasionally. Cocky Cruise, also falls for new female instructor (McGillis) where as Cruise says, ""Things could get difficult"", and they do. Performance wise, many actors are better than Cruise, Kilmer and McGillis, for starters, but really Cruise just has to give off his pretty boy smile, and sport his handsome looks and cockiness, which he does well, and you feel that's all the part asks for, and by that token, he's done splendid. His history, is that he lost his father as a kid, and was orphaned by Goose, his only family. May'be if he put more of that history into that performance, it would of come off better. Top Gun, is very neatly, cleanly shot, and richly in picture quality. I haven't seen a neater shot film. That tragic moment, where Cruise lost one of his own, came off really well, and was effective. Top Gun is not a plot driven movie, and just one of situations, which could be the downfall. It's No 'Right Stuff' or other type movies, just an entertaining, engaging, and in part, thrilling watch from a guy, not with us now, of course, who made many better films, and other successors.

And yet it still didn't really interest me. In fact if there wasn't a sequel coming out for it soon I may never have gotten around to watching it. It always seemed to me, from the little I knew about it, that it was a plotless movie. And having seen it that was a correct assessment. The movie isn't really about anything. The only thing that saves it from being a complete dumpster fire is the charisma of the characters.It's funny to watch a movie so old that the line 'I could tell you, but then I'd have to kill you"" is still included and even gets a laugh from the other characters. The film hasn't really aged that well in a lot of ways. The way the action sequences are filmed can make them quite hard to watch. This is something I hope they do far better in the sequel. I certainly enjoyed the characters interacting on land far more than the often quite lengthy action sequences in the air.The film has some memorable quotes which have aged very well.

It was a macho film for people who are interested in the military and military tech - although some people have said it has a homo-erotic subtext.The issue with Top Gun is the story is thin. It was simply about characters training at an elite flight school. The character work was decent enough, Maverick and Goose's friendship was believable and whilst Iceman was made out to be an antagionist, he did rise some valid points.I didn't find the air combat that interesting.

The script is wonderful, loaded with clever lines with double-meanings that are perfectly delivered by the cast. Val Kylmer is great in this movie. The action scenes have to be among the most spectacular ever filmed, and without special effects. The character of Maverick is heroic and flawed. He does goofy things but regardless he is a positive figure. Anthony Edwards is perfect as Maverick's navigator, friend and confidant.

Its testosterone-driven story of a young hotshot navy pilot named Maverick (Tom Cruise), who is sent with his co-pilot Goose (Anthony Edwards) to ""Top Gun,"" a school for the top 1% pilots in the world, took a backseat to relentless, daring action, and a cheesy romance subplot between Maverick and his civilian instructor (Kelly McGillis) that only seemed to fuel the story.""Top Gun"" was directed skillfully by Tony Scott (younger brother of Ridley), who threw in a number of elements that would eventually become cliché and worn out by the countless imitators over the years and up until today, in 2004.I was only a year old when ""Top Gun"" was released in 1986, and I've seen it over a hundred times since then.

Regardless of all other considerations, I just could not get past the casting of Tom Cruise, who plays ""Maverick"", a hotshot fighter pilot who competes with other young pilot dudes in tough, daring aerial competition at an elite pilot school to see who can be the best.Cruise swaggers and smirks his way through the plot, all decked out in heavy-duty flight suit and shades, his boyish face, short stature, and immaturity in deportment making a mockery of what the film no doubt had intended. I found his presence in this film rather nauseating. Instead of portraying the ""top gun"", his character comes across more as the top jerk.In plot and dialogue, the film could be described as a popcorn flick for kids, with lots of ""action"", as fighter jets blast off, roar and soar, topsy-turvy like, showing off the daring-do of their annoyingly smug aviators.The dialogue is just as sophomoric as the plot. In one dogfight scene, a couple of pilots converse. ""Okay man, let's turn and burn ... We're going ballistic man, go get 'em ... it's time to buzz the tower"" ... kinda like a video game ... man.Further, the film seems permanently time-bound in the 1980s, partly because of Tom Cruise, but also because the film's theme of jingoistic American patriotism, while cogent then, is far less cogent now.The film does present some good visuals.

64,Catherine_Grace_Zeh,What a ride!,9,18 November 2005,"Wow! The main thing that I can say about TOP GUN is, ""What a ride!"" Mitchell (Tom Cruise), in my opinion, was a very courageous soldier. His partner, Bradshaw (Anthony Edwards), was the same way, too. When they sang ""You've Lost That Lovin' Feelin',"" I thought they sounded good. Also, I was taken aback by the airplane stunts! They were totally breathtaking and intriguing. To me, Charlie (Kelly McGillis) looked very pretty in the dressy outfits she wore when she taught at the academy. I liked the fact that she was very strict and business-like. In conclusion, I highly recommend this smash hit to all you people who are fans of Tom Cruise or like a good action/drama with a little romance and lots of plane stunts in it.",Top Gun

So Scott does the smart thing, and keeps his camera sharply focused on his beautiful players.

I know people that LOVE this movie and we're outraged I hadn't seen it and now that I have I don't really see what the big deal is. Well, aside from the fact that Tom Cruise doesn't age the same way as us humans, but I already knew that.Top Gun is absolutely an embodiment of its time. It's big, loud, popcorn fare that is both dumb and smart at the same time. I bet this was a blast to see in theaters. Thing is, it also feels like an adolescent fantasy run rampant and I couldn't stop rolling my eyes at times. He's a brash, reckless fighter pilot that goes by his own rules, goofs off and has a very weird relationship with his teacher.That said, there's also some serious weight at times. This came out over 30 years ago and back then they weren't afraid to hit you and get a little dark. Despite all the signs that were there, I was not expecting this to get as heavy as it did and I applaud it for that. Also, that song is still incredible and gave me goosebumps when it kicked in.All in all, this is a fun little chunk of nostalgia. I love that it wasn't afraid to get its hands dirty, I just wish it would've grown up a little along the way. I could see my stance on this improving down the line as the hype machine fades for me but it's still an enjoyable enough experience worth checking out.",Top Gun

68,Spleen,"Rather boring in 1986, unendurable today",5,14 July 1999,"Every time planes take off from an aircraft carrier - almost every time we step outdoors - the skies are obscured by a heavy tobacco graduated filter. Sooner or later we forget what real skies look like.  It's a Simpson/Buckheimer trademark.  It tells us, I suppose, how important it all is, how something of moment will be, is being, has been decided in this small theatre of human affairs ...  It's not just filters: an air of self-conscious importance and cheap grandeur pervades their whole corpus. And, hey, sometimes it works.  It depends chiefly on whether something of moment really IS being decided.  ""Crimson Tide"" is enjoyable because we end up getting the kind of confrontation we were promised in a context where the outcome really matters.  Here, a mission simply arrives out of the blue for the Top Gun jet fighters.  The military tells us that the outcome is important, but I don't believe that for a second.  Even if the military is right it's all incidental to what the rest of the movie is about.  All the portentous hints earlier on were about Maverick's emotional life and personal skill.  Had he died and the mission been successful due to someone else's efforts, we wouldn't have thought, ""Well, at least the Americans prevented the Russians from doing whatever it is everyone was so worried about.""  No: we didn't give a toss about the Russian/American conflict. It's hard to give a toss about the emotional life of Maverick, either, but that's for other reasons: the whole situation was hard to swallow, and no-one did anything to hide the fact that it was artificially sustained. It could so easily have been prevented by diverting the trillions of dollars of public money that went into the private chariot races, towards - I don't know - a better script, perhaps.",Top Gun

The writers just made a good job showing that for a macho team they HAVE to be very close friends to do their best.

70,PredragReviews,"""Tower, this is Ghostrider, requesting a fly-by...""",9,6 April 2017,"For anyone who loves gadgets, flying, or even dreams of being a pilot, this movie is pure unadulterated pleasure! I don't think Top Gun has even been equalled, in producing some enthralling aerial cinematography that never looks amateurish or unrealistic. If you consider that back in the 1980's the CGI option did not exist, so all the live action sequences had to film real F14's flying; the technical challenges in filming supersonic craft and doing so (and getting decent footage) are considerable. For this feat alone, Top Gun is a classic that has never been equalled before or since. Watching this movie, it's easy to see why Tom Cruise became the mega-star he did. His clean-cut, good ol' American guy image and toothy grin appealled not only to US audiences, but to the wider world at the time. This part isn't much of an acting challenge for Cruise, since there isn't much depth to the character, but on the other hand, he plays the part of a maverick pilot so convincingly, that you never doubt for a moment you are watching anything other than a top Navy pilot. The cinematography is superb, the music is just so thrilling it gave me tears in my eyes with happiness.' The scenes of Iceman Interacting with maverick and Goose is just great to watch. The soundtrack has its ups and downs, nice in taking some classic romantic numbers, but failing when loud bursts of American rock signal that Maverick is either in danger or has successfully shot down a plane and 'going home'. That being said this is still a highly enjoyable film, and while the attitude may be a little annoying at times, it can still be genuinely enjoyed as a good, in your face, bit of fun.

It's difficult not to recommend this film for its style, visual photography (the awe of the fighter jet spectacle), blistering sound design, and winning soundtrack. The audience may feel spatially disoriented with the aerial scenes, but the fighter pilot lives in a world of 360-degree turns and the movie gives us a good secondhand sense of what it might be like to be in a dogfight.

Unfortunately, every so often, somebody plays the old ""Take my Breath Away"" song, which evokes memories of this cinematic torture.The story is utterly pointless and goes nowhere; it's just a few lumped together clichés. A little bratty crybaby that throws temper tantrums somehow earns a ticket to an elite training center for top-notch pilots. The fly-boy in question is Tom Cruise with that same old obnoxious pixie grin. He looks more like he's doing a designer jeans commercial than playing a hot-shot pilot, and his lines sound like a robotic voice-mail greeting. Then there's the obligatory rivalry to be the best pilot in the group where he and others compete to come up with the most banal dialogue you'll ever hear--cornball ""boasting"" rhymes that could have been written by Barney the Dinosaur.Then that romance. We're supposed to believe a female instructor would fall for this twerpy little creep. They look ridiculous together; like two Cabbage Patch dolls, but with less chemistry. ""Take my Breath Away?"" More like: ""Make me Lose my Lunch."" The aerial dogfight scenes are pretty impressive, well devised and executed. These are the only saving graces of the movie, but to have Tom in the cockpit looking more like a Ken doll with a fixed stare than a breathing human with facial expressions somewhat ruins the effect.It's never clear why any of this is happening or why you should care.

Indisputably, the film's slick, macho posturing is now legendarily lampooned/revered as a classic of unintentional(?) homoerotic camp, and more lampooned than revered for its glibly brazen patriotism, militarism, and daftly monolithic cold war politics. Nonetheless, there is a moment, after the deluge of plane-porn, shirtless, oily volleyball romps, curiously lizard-like makeout sessions, repetitive musical cues that appear blatantly designed for comedy, and endless discussion of ""hard-ons"", where even the most sophisticatedly distanciated viewer is likely to have the gall to stop and think, ""Gee whiz – this movie is actually kind of fun. Like, fun-fun, not just 'I'm-laughing-because-it's-so- ridiculously-hyperbolic' fun. What is happening? Tom Cruise, how have you bewitched me so with your voodoo magic and dazzling, Cheshire-cat grin?!"" This, surely, is the 'danger zone' Kenny Loggins keeps so helpfully cautioning us against. Yes – begrudgingly as it may be, the Simpson/Bruckheimer mystique is infectious, greasy-beer-ad-reminiscent as it may be. Even nearly thirty years on, the film's MTV-flashiness is energizing, the flying sequences remain exciting, and even the ra-ra-military propaganda throughout is somewhat cute in its hokiness (bear in mind how unironic an enlistment tool the film served as to return to the solemn world of pooh-pooh-hood). And, despite spawning decades of jeering, patriarchal frat-boy morons and lazy Halloween costumes alike, it's virtually impossible not to be won over by The Cruiser's million-dollar grin, so hypnotically charismatic that even his smarmy swagger starts to (fairly disturbingly) become strangely seductive. Bonus points to Val Kilmer to somehow cobbling an iconic codename (I've lost count of how many ICEMANs have bested me at laser tag through the years) out of a lazy, moralizing drawl, Kelly McGillis for somehow remaining sassy instead of sappy, Meg Ryan for somehow remaining on the right side of annoying, and Anthony Edwards for stealing all the best (unironic) lines as adorably subservient perennial wingman Goose. Also, playing 'spot- the-Tim-Robbins' is always good for a lark. Yes, Top Gun will 'take your breath away', whether from laughing, genuine enrapture, or a bashful mix of both. If nothing else, the film remains an essential piece of cinema history for evidently discouraging Sir Cruisealot from taking part in a movie musical after his cringeworthy karaoke bout here (at least until Rock of Ages, which is loathsome for reasons far beyond him).

77,TheUnknown837-1,a highly entertaining--but not high-class--guilty pleasure matinée,7,24 November 2009,"""Top Gun"" is not a movie that I wholeheartedly defend with my approval rating or with the fact that I enjoyed it. I acknowledged that although I liked the movie—mind you as a guilty pleasure—it is not a particularly good motion picture. It's a no-brainer; the perfect kind of movie for people who don't look for logic in their films. It's a quintessential Saturday matinée. It's also the movie responsible for the kickoff of Tom Cruise's career. And it's been the target for many spoofs, rip-offs, and parodies such as the hit comedy ""Hot Shots!"" (1991) with Charlie Sheen. So although ""Top Gun"" is not a good movie, it is a decidedly influential movie and it is guilty pleasure entertainment at its best.Tom Cruise plays 'Maverick' a hot shot fighter pilot who becomes selected to take part in Top Gun, an elite school for flying aces. He's got a lot of pride and a brain full of recklessness, but he's also a very good pilot. Yeah, we know the type. Amidst and in his schooling, he faces competition from another hotshot played by Val Kilmer and a romantic attachment from one of his instructors, played by Kelly McGillis.What really saves this movie from sinking (or pummeling from the sky, I guess we should say) is not the harebrained script, but the performances. After all, Tom Cruise's career launched off not merely because he was in a hit movie, but because he played, like Harrison Ford in his kickoff, a cocky character that the audience went for. Cruise, with his schmuck hotshot attitude and chirpy grin is precisely the sort of protagonist that a no-brainer audience goes for. He started off playing cocky characters and he played them well. Kelly McGillis, although having no character depth, does also manage to pull off a very interesting performance and that is why, for me anyway, the relationship between her and Cruise remains a little interesting even though this love subplot, like many, is completely unnecessary.But the high point for me was a very spectacular action scene toward the end of the picture where Cruise and others engage with enemy fighters while flying over the ocean. This scene was explosive, kinetic, fast-moving, and yet stretched a great length of time and was just the jarring motion we needed after the middle of the movie really began to run slow.""Top Gun"" is one of those movies that is hard to praise for a long time, because there's a lot more to complain about than there is to praise. In the end, I enjoyed the picture because of some sweet action scenes, strong performances, and just a kind of steady guilty pleasure atmosphere that surrounded the whole ordeal. Now if your brain refuses to let down its sophisticated guards at any time, this will not be the picture to suit your day. It's a harebrained story with harebrained characters. But if you drop your standards for just a little while, kick back, relax, and try not to take it too seriously, you will find some primal low-key entertainment.",Top Gun

80,hnt_dnl,Pure guilty pleasure!,9,27 June 2014,"Over the years, I've gone back and forth on whether TOP GUN (1986) was in reality a good movie or a bad movie. A huge hit when it first came out in 1986, I, like most others, were thoroughly entertained by the fast pace, catchy soundtrack, and exciting aerial dogfight scenes. Still am to this day. But there was actually a time when, with perspective, I realized that Top Gun was in reality not truly a ""good"" film, but more of a guilty pleasure type movie. The dialogue is pretty standard, the tale very linear and one-note, the acting nothing to write home about. Yet, somehow this movie is very iconic due to the aforementioned positives as well as a few memorable one-liners/moments.Top Gun tells the tale of naval aviator Lt. Pete Mitchell, AKA ""Maverick"", an brash, cocky, uninhibited fighter pilot who plays by his own rules. Maverick is essayed by the great Tom Cruise in one of his most infamous roles. No matter how many great performances he gives in other more noteworthy films/roles, he may forever be branded by this one, the role that really made him a household name. Cruise's trademark cockiness is on full display here, as the role of Maverick requires not much more than mugging. Certainly not even close to his more challenging roles. But still Cruise carries the proceedings excellently with a persuasive, energetic performance full of bravado.While Cruise provides the screen presence, the supporting cast helps to fill out the story. Kelly McGillis plays ""Charlie"", the beautiful, leggy civilian flight instructor who is the requisite love interest. Val Kilmer is Lt. ""Iceman"", the equally cocky and cool #1 rival for Maverick at flight school. Scene-stealing Anthony Edwards is Lt. ""Goose"", Maverick's RIO and wisecracking best friend. Always-reliable Michael Ironside is Lt.Comm. ""Jester"", the grumpy field flight trainer. And, last but not least, stalwart veteran Tom Skerrit is school Comm. ""Viper"", who HAPPENED to have flown with Mav's father, who died in Vietnam on a classified mission. Also notable are then-newcomers Meg Ryan, in an entertaining cameo role as Goose's wife, and Tim Robbins as RIO ""Merlin"", who probably has one of the most oft-quoted lines/moments from this movie. Although the story is standard, this talented cast does a good job of making it sing.The real star of Top Gun is the late, great director Tony Scott, who unapologetically tells this rah-rah, gung-ho tale with stylistic flair. The aerial flight scenes are, to this day, eye-popping and energetic, and underscored with a brilliant soundtrack. The song ""Take My Breath Away"" actually took home the Best Song Oscar for 1986! This film is one of the first examples of ""music video"" style filmmaking, where the movie itself was a long sequence of quickly edited scenes, with many scenes punctuated with music, most notably the aerial scenes and the shirtless beach volleyball scene! Another huge plus of this movie is the tense Maverick-Ice relationship (many people say that Cruise had more chemistry with Kilmer than he did with McGillis!LOL). With stars Cruise and Kilmer, who both certainly went onto do much better things than this movie, it's a lot of fun watching their characters snipe at each other throughout until the infamous climax where they make all friendly with each other. Cruise, in particular, has gone onto MUCH bigger and better things since this infamous, iconic movie for which he ironically may mostly be remembered for.",Top Gun
81,classicalsteve,Descent Cruise Vehicle That's Not Quite An Officer and a Gentleman,7,14 May 2016,"""Top Gun"" is in some respects a sequel to ""An Officer and a Gentleman"". In ""Officer"", the trainees have to endure naval boot camp before they will even be considered for pilot-training school. In ""Top Gun"", now the officers are at the fighter pilot school and competing against each other to decide who is ""top dog"". The film itself became the ""top dog"" of 1986, being the highest grossing film of its year, and its lead, Tom Cruise, became a superstar. Although it's a decent film, ""Top Gun"" never quite surpasses it's own confines. It becomes a little deeper in the last third, but much of it relies on tried-and-true formulas in which much of what happens is predictable.The premise is relatively straight-forward. The ""rock stars"" of naval pilots are competing for top honors at ""Top Gun"", a naval pilot training school for the best and most ambitious pilots. In real life, the United States Navy Strike Fighter Tactics Instructor program, or TOPGUN as it is popularly known, teaches potential fighter pilots in air tactics. The school was established as a result of a study which determined that failed air fighter missions in Vietnam were largely the result of inadequate crew training. The findings led to the establishment of TOPGUN which began north of San Diego (which is where much of the film was shot) before being relocated to Nevada.Tom Cruise plays LT Pete ""Maverick"" Mitchell, a fighter pilot nearing the end of his training who lives up to his name. While his instructors and colleagues concede he's one of the best, he's also a loose cannon. One of his favorite tricks is to ""fly by"" the air control center without notice, thereby causing standby's to inadvertently lose their beverages before consumption. At the beginning of the film, he's on a training mission, and the top pilot in his school ""freezes"" up, and turns in his wings as a result. This gives Maverick and his wing man LTJG Nick ""Goose"" Bradshaw (Anthony Edwards) the chance to enter Top Gun. While Cruise is flamboyant and unpredictable, his partner Goose is down-to-earth and pragmatic, which makes for a good team.When they come to the flight school, they meet their competition, LT Tom ""Iceman"" Kazanski (Val Kilmer), who is just as haughty and cocky as Maverick. The only difference: Iceman plays it safe while Maverick takes risks, which makes him the more dangerous of the two. Not only does Maverick's risky flight maneuvering make the other pilots twitch, he jeopardizes his relationships with the other pilots. Then Maverick meets a beautiful woman (Kelly McGillis) at a local bar to whom he flirts with mixed results, engaging in a ""dog fight"" of words and looks. The next day, he learns she's a top instructor at the school whose job is to evaluate the different pilots. Also, we gradually become aware of a mystery surrounding Maverick's father who was also a pilot.The casting is excellent. Cruise makes the perfect rock star pilot, unfazed by the criticism of his commanding officers. Kilmer is memorable as the unlikable rival, probably the only actor of the time who could keep up with Cruise's perceived cockiness and haughtiness. McGillis makes a good love interest although her character needed much more development, and Anthony Edwards as Goose is a good straight man to the other two pilots. Tom Skerrit has a supporting role as CDR Mike ""Viper"" Metcalf, the former polite-turned-educator in charge of the school. Meg Ryan has a small role as Goose's wife.I think the main weakness of this film is exactly why a lot of high school and college-age viewers liked it. The contrived love story between McGillis and Cruise involves a lot of scenes with the two of them either on his motorcycle or in her bed with the song ""Take My Breath Away"" in the background. However, the dog fight between McGillis and Cruise when they first meet quickly ends in favor of a Cruise conquest as if the writers wanted us to get to the juicy scenes as quickly as possible, lest the 14-to-24 crowd might get bored. I think it would have been more effective if McGillis and Cruise had sparred a bit longer and Cruise had to fight for her like one of his training missions. Maybe a dose of ""boy loses girl"" might have been more interesting, but that's Hollywood.Also, because of the screen time devoted to the love interest, we the audience didn't learn a lot about the flight school and what they are trying to accomplish. Granted we learn a little bit, but it's not up to its potential. We are told they fly two missions a day and take classes, but I wanted to know more about what classes they are taking, and the kinds of simulated missions they engage. In ""An Officer and a Gentleman"", we learn about what the tough sergeant is up to, and why he feels compelled to use unfair methods to get the best out of the trainees, but the leadership is much more in the background for much of ""Top Gun"". Not until tragedy strikes does the film become slightly deeper, and the mystery of Maverick's father comes to light. It's one of those films with which critics had problems but the box office was the main point of reference to determine whether the movie was successful. I think it's a good film but not a great one. Similarly contrived films starring Cruise such as ""Cocktail"" and ""Days of Thunder"" did not fair as well at the box office. At this writing, ""Top Gun 2"" with Cruise and Kilmer reprising their roles is slated for a release in 2017.",Top Gun

83,vip_ebriega,Good? Sure. Great? Uhh...,6,15 July 2008,"My Take: A good look, but not as good as its box-office status made it look. One of the highest-grossing films of the 80's. The film which gave name to Tom Cruise a ""Superstar"". It also features one of the most exciting aerial sequences ever lensed. So, is Tony Scott's 1986 popular blockbuster TOP GUN worth all the attention? Judging by action, star power and breathtaking aerial photography, it does. TOP GUN is grandeur of sound and fury, but once it settles down, it turns rather slow and weak. While he blows us away with top-notch energy, director Scott and ""Kaboom"" producers Don Simpson and Jerry Bruckheimer can't find much more to offer when aerial action and top-notch photography rest backstage. The romance subplot between Cruise Maverick and his flight schoolteacher (Kelly McGillis) is fairly competent, but other plot elements fall on a flat note. But TOP GUN has pretty much more elements that get us going and, for a mission that only wants to bring us a big-budget star-vehicle for a well-named cast list, TOP GUN still has enough juice to keep us quenched until the end credits.Rating: *** out of 5.",Top Gun
84,Stampsfightclub,Pulsating action with cool Cruise to light up any guy's day,9,15 July 2009,"Radical air pilot Maverick (Cruise) and his friend Goose (Edwards) are sent to Top Gun, the toughest challenge for the pair who compete to be the best.Tony Scott's pulsating actioner is remembered today for those terrific jet sequences, the swift introduction of the then fastest motorbike in the world, and perhaps significant in today's modern culture, Tom Cruise's macho bravado smile.Over 20 years have passed and the lead star and director have certainly moved up in the world. Cruise receiving three Oscar nominations and Scott winning a Primetime Emmy. And this is where it pretty much all started for the pair, and what an introduction.Top Gun opens with Cruise's Maverick disregarding a direct order to help out a fellow pilot, getting told off before getting his just desserts, a reward to go to the most famous academy, Top Gun, and herein lies the action, the drama and even some exquisitely handled comedy.Above all, this Scott picture is an out and out action drama that spices up the situations with that cheeky comedy only somebody called Tom Cruise can bring. Maverick is the catalyst of sharp intake and a bravado icon that would make any guy instantly jealous of his quick thinking and constant confidence. Not to mention his friendship with Goose is a wonderful addition to slow down the motives of the continuous action.There are fist brawls, fighter jets, boats, fighter jets, motorbikes and fighter jets. Yes, it is targeted towards the type of guy who enjoys a Tom Clancy novel. Even the romance sequences seem more masculine as if to fill out every guy's fantasy. The ongoing rivalry and competitiveness in the service is spicy and intriguing with a few twists thrown in. The use of the motorbike was well executed, especially going over the blind hill but this film is undoubtedly recalled for the fighter jet sequences. The perfect synchronization of the planes in motion is pure adrenaline soaked talent that must have been a real challenge to film and direct. Nevertheless there is some friction with these plane inclusions. The camera is moving so fast and frequently it is hard to justify what is happening on screen. The mumbled dialogue does not help matters, not to mention the preferred lexis in talking code will strike a few people out of the game.But, looking at it from an enjoyment point of view, what is happening on screen is transfixed and you cannot tear away should the phone ring or the footy game starting.Cruise, as already mentioned, lights up the screen with that sharp white smile and his smart timing and cockiness helps achieve the strong lead role necessary for the action soaked script.The training and pushing to be the best inevitably lands Goose and Maverick in trouble and some friction generates from The Ice Man, giving the film a spicy drama, along with one of the most sad twists for friendship to ever hit our screens. A must see",Top Gun
85,gab-14712,"A ""Danger Zone"" for Coolness!",8,5 August 2020,"Even though 1986's Top Gun received mixed reviews from critics upon release, it is one of those feel-good movies that is fun, fun, and even more fun. Imagine it is 2010 and you are in the midst of watching a Michael Bay movie. A movie with striking cinematography, expertly crafted action scenes, but middling human character development. Yeah, this film is one of the precursors to Bay-directed movies, but this film definitely works. Some people may complain about the film's machismo or pro-military stance, but I always been told it is one of those required viewings for any male. It definitely was in my household. Even though the characters are middling and not fully developed, they are really memorable. After all, the film launched Tom Cruise's Hollywood career. The action sequences, more specifically, the aerial dogfights are incredible. They are expertly shot, and it made you feel like you were a part of the action.The film received its humble beginning from a magazine article in a 1983 edition of California, which was written by Ehud Yonay. His article went into detail about the life of fighter pilots on a Naval Air Base in San Diego. Producing partners Jerry Bruckheimer and Don Simpson were very interested in the content, which featured some outstanding aerial views. They hired Jim Cash and Jack Epps Jr. to write the first draft. They hired Tony Scott as the film's director. Yes, that is Ridley's younger brother. Scott impressed the producers with his commercial featuring a turbo racing a fighter jet. It is impressive that the producers made this big-budget film Scott's first film. In terms of action, Scott definitely delivered.Pete Mitchell codenamed ""Maverick"" (Tom Cruise) is a very talented pilot who is accepted in the nation's top school, known as ""Top Gun."" Maverick has to compete with the best of the very best in order to earn top honors. He meets a possible romantic partner in his astrophysics professor, Charlie (Kelly McGillis). Also, he meets his rival from the get-go, the intelligent and studious Iceman (Val Kilmer). Also dealing with the people associated with his school, he is also haunted by his father's death and legend, which may or may not seem as heroic. Maverick wants to be the very best. Will he reach that status?The film is at its best when the jets are in the air. But we cannot forget the film does have human characters. The screenplay does not give much time to develop the characters. The relationships with one another are paper thin. Do not get me started on the relationship between Maverick and Charlie. It was ludicrous. With all that said...I had a great time watching these characters because the performances are solid. Cruise has always been great playing the cocky womanizer and continues that sort of character here. Too bad he couldn't show much chemistry with Kelly McGillis who previously exceled with Harrison Ford in 1985's Witness. I did like the chemistry between Cruise and best friend, Goose (played by Anthony Edwards). Val Kilmer as Iceman makes a great antagonist for Cruise. I did like Tom Skerritt who played Viper, a father figure for Cruise.The soundtrack! I really enjoyed it. Kenny Loggins contributed with his rendition of ""Danger Zone"", a high-octane song! The song that won the Oscar was Berlin's ""Take My Breath Away."" That song introduced them to the music world and it really is a good song. Those two songs are some of the reasons why I enjoyed this movie. Alas, we cannot forget the scene where Maverick and Goose sings the Righteous Brothers.Personally, I found Top Gun to be excellent entertainment. I know some people think the film is hot garbage because it does not have a credible script and the characters are poorly developed. But come on, there is an awesome volleyball scene! That has to count for something, right? Despite the characters, at least the performances were on point. The aerial sequences were something else. When the airplanes are in the air, that is when to keep your eyes peeled. The studio shelled thousands of dollars to use these planes so they made it worth the high bill. The movie was the highest grossing film of 1986. It gave people new reasons to be ""cool.""My Grade: B+",Top Gun
86,rzajac,Interesting to see this long after release as a kind of artifact,6,23 August 2003,"Very interesting.  A sort of romance-tinged shill for the military-industrial complex!  Quite ""period"" and Reaganesque.Pardon if you think I'm a spoilsport by not falling over backward to let the love story just sort of wash over me, but I can't help but think this movie was designed ""to specifications"" to rewire our emotion response centers, teaching us to confuse romantic boy-girl love with machine love.  Top Gun is a sort of guy flick disguised as a chick flick:  It has the sexy 30-million dollar weapon systems--really the ultimate tech orgasm--with a sexy girl Pentagon weapon systems analyst injected into the story.  The sparks fly and both the gals and guys in the audience get all hot and bothered, while thinking that the other is getting hot and bothered for the same reason they are.  Little do they know!Some good writing, some good deliveries.  The cinematography and editing is astonishing!I highly recommend this movie in conjunction with reflections about the period in which it was released.  Star Wars (SDI, not the movie) was still being debated, The USSR was still a few years from dissolution, and U.S. power desperately needed it's ""citizens"" to be emotionally attached to the idea that global power issues would continue to require increasingly rarified hardware solutions, rather than political, social, or philosophical ones.  If you think about these things while viewing, it will highlight the role of the supposedly ""liberal"" media in forwarding strangely antiprogressive agendas as they unabashedly stoop to melding these messages with deep feelings of sexual response, bringing the demands of power disturbingly (criminally?) close to home indeed.It reminds me of something an acting teacher told our class:  If you want to get out of jury duty, tell them you're an actor.  If these very talented people can willingly take money to expertly deliver these kinds of messages to us, they can tell us anything--as long as the price is right.Top Gun is the quintessential period piece from the late-20th century United States.  Don't miss it, and I'm not really being facetious.  If you've seen it before, check it out again with new eyes.",Top Gun
87,Angry_Arguer,Ego-Maniac,2,17 July 2003,"Murphy's Law was written for movies like this.  It's obvious that Jerry Bruckheimer and Tom Cruise were trying to pawn off to the almighty dollar in their creation of this abyssmal flick.  Thankfully, Platoon and ALIENS kicked its butt at the Oscars, if not the box office.  Then again, the Oscars are a moot point.Top Gun wants to be patriotic, but winds up being an embarrasment and waste of time.  The plot has enough holes to be an imitation Swiss cheese substitute and the acting is horrendous.  Tom Cruise proves he can be a total twit without ability.  Thank God for Rain Man.  Fighter jock wannabes (oh, I'm sorry, the navy calls them ""aviators"") take note: you can't fly if you are the height of Tom Cruise.  Here endeth the lesson.  Even the editing is atrocious.  What a sloppy production!  You'll find yourself hating the music either on the spot or down the road.  Believe me.Overall, a movie I saw once and don't want to see again.

89,BroadswordCallinDannyBoy,Classic boys own flick,8,2 October 2006,"Maverick is a young hotshot Navy aviator who gets his chance to go to Top Gun, the most prestigious Aerial Combat school in the US Military. Soon rivalries, friendships, and romance take hold along with really cool aerial sequences.This isn't really a plot movie as there is barely none. Maverick and Co. go to school, learn their thing and fly around while looking slick and cool. While providing an entertaining movie that is obviously fueled by Reagan era politics as much as it is by jet fuel and testosterone. However, the coolness here works out as Tom Cruise is certainly cool and this film essentially guaranteed him super-stardom and his current position in the movie world. The aerial sequences and climatic combat scene are just as fun as they ever were despite not having computer effects, which most people take completely for granted now.So take this film as a boys own romp and you'll enjoy it, because that is just what is was meant to be. 8/10Rated PG for occasional profanity",Top Gun
90,bellino-angelo2014,After 33 years it still stands the test of time and it truly deserves its cult status,10,29 December 2019,"Despite TOP GUN is considered by many (both folks that grew up in the 1980s and fans of Tom Cruise) a classic and a cult movie, I hadn't seen it until few months ago when one day with a friend of mine that is a huge fan of Cruise I went at the local library and I bought it on DVD. Well, I am glad to him that I bought this DVD because it was well worth the buying and I have re-watched it various times until today.Since there are already many reviews for this movie I wouldn't talk that much about the plot. The movie follows Lt. Pete Mitchell ''Maverick'' (Cruise)'s training at the United States Navy Fighter Weapons School (abbreviated in Top Gun). During his period of training there are three stories interwined whitin the movie. The first is his love story with Charlotte ''Charlie'' Blackwood (Kelly McGillis), a civilian instructor that works at the Top Gun. The second is his interacting with the other jet pilots. In particular his friendship with Goose Bradshaw (Anthony Edwards) and his rivalry with Iceman Kazinski (Val Kilmer) and Jester (Michael Ironside). The third story is his returning to Top Gun after dealing with the pain for the loss of his friend Goose during a flight but after a while he proves to still be the best one at flight.Let's talk about what I liked. The film was very slickly made and I really enjoyed it. The cinematography is good and the aerial shots were great for 1986. The soundtrack was good, and it filled like a glove the things that happened in the movie. The acting is great by everyone and the performances are all best-of from the actors' careers. I am not a huge fan of Tom Cruise but I have to admit it, he gives one of his best performances ever since his character never surrenders despite even the loss of his best friend. I felt very moved by his performance at some points. Anthony Edwards gives great support as Goose and Kelly McGillis is great along with being lovely. Val Kilmer gives his first best performance despite he looks a bit annoying and Tom Skerritt is both dashing and tough as always. Also in this movie in bit roles, before they became famous, Tim Robbins as Merlin, another pilot, Meg Ryan as Carol Bradshaw (Goose's wife) and Clarence Giliard jr (before his WALKER TEXAS RANGER days) as co-pilot Sundown.I have no complaints about the film since it kept me very entertained from the beginning until the very end. Final verdict: A timeless classic from the 1980s that every movie buff should watch at least once. And if you ever met someone who doesn't like it, I'll suggest you to change friends istantly... it's THAT great! Great cinematography (very ahead of its time in the aerial shots), nice soundtrack and great performances all around by one of the best all-star casts you will find in a movie of this genre, all this makes for a timeless classic that one would re-watch after a while with pleasure.On July 2021 it will come out the sequel TOP GUN MAVERICK. I have seen the trailer and it looks good. I really hope that the sequel is good just like the original despite only Tom Cruise and Val Kilmer will return of all the cast members of the original.",Top Gun

92,Maziun,It's a classic - deal with it,7,25 September 2012,"""Top Gun"" is one of the most famous movies of the 80's and all time . It's the best known Tony Scott (RIP) movie . It's also probably the best movie with flying machines.The story in ""Top Gun"" is a well known story that appears in many movies. Young hero wants to fulfill his dream . He has friends and enemies . He will meet the love of his life . He will have some kind of crisis , but in the end everything will work out for him . Screenplay here isn't surprising , but does a good job portraying the characters. I liked the rivalry between Maverick and Iceman , friendship between Maverick and Goose and the love between Maverick and Charlotte . Many people seem to complain that love story was fake to them , but I don't agree. I've seen better love stories , but also a lot more unbelievable (""Batman"").""Top Gun"" is wonderfully photographed . It also has a great soundtrack with such memorable songs like ""Take my breath away"" (Berlin) and ""Danger zone"" (Kenny Loggins). The movie is funny (great on-going joke with coffee). It's even funnier when you watch it as a movie about homosexuals (Quentin Tarantino). Some people complain that this movie is very pro-military , but I don't mind that . It's good to see one movie where the military isn't portrayed in negative light.Tom Cruise fits the role of Maverick very well . He's charming , no bulls**t and risky attitude makes him a likable and memorable character. This movie includes all - star cast : Tom Cruise (at the beginning of his career) , Val Kilmer (""Tombstone"") , Kelly McGillis (""The Accused"") , Meg Ryan (""When Harry met Sally""), Tom Skerrick (""Alien"") and Anthony Edwards (""Revenge of the nerds""). Everyone does a good job , with the exception of McGillis. She's hardly anything but eye candy . I especially liked Edwards as Goose and Kilmer as Iceman.The success of ""Top Gun"" spawned ""Iron Eagle"" - a much weaker movie , made for kids but still watchable. ""Top Gun"" is superior to that one. It's a good entertainment and a classic.I give it 7/10.",Top Gun
93,LeRoyMarko,80's icon,7,12 February 2006,"This movie worked back when it came out. It had all the ingredient to be a success at the box office. But that doesn't make it a good movie. Far from it. You could say it's a tribute to machismo. And of course, there's that cheesy romantic fling between Tom Cruise and Kelly McGillis. You could probably say that the romance was better between the guys and their plane. The action scenes are good, even though you're not always sure what's going on up there.

It doesn't get much more Tom Cruise than that, but this is the deluxe Tom movie. Here he plays a tough, cool and charming pilot that simply takes her breath away with his charm and flying, his name is Maverick. Kelly McGillis plays the girl and the sort of ""against Maverick"" guy is played by Val Kilmer, although he is also a good-guy. The movie is a absolute classic, its fantastic to watch too!

95,manitobaman81,Good,7,30 August 2014,"What I like most about Top Gun is how it really puts you in Tom Cruise's shoes. If you enjoyed the old propaganda movies about the underground resistance in Nazi-occupied Europe, you'll probably like this one. As students at the Navy's elite fighter weapons school compete to be best in the class, one daring young flyer learns a few things from a civilian instructor that are not taught in the classroom. The airplane they use is so advanced that it seems like it can read minds. Top Gun is not by any means a classic; it is, however, a nice snap-shot of a society. The plot is fairly generic, but the buildup has enough suspense to make the whole movie worth a watch.

He also manages to fall in love with the gorgeous Kelly McGillis although he was a confirmed bachelor's before meeting her. The film holds together fairly well. The fact that there are lots of F-14 scenes makes it even better, in my opinion. The acting is OK, but nothing to get all excited about.

Turns out it's not. For all the accolades this film received over the years it has a shocking rating on IMDb and it does not shock me in the least. The Only thing that shocks me is the fact so many people talk about Top Gun being a great movie.The whole movie seemed like a major stretch and pointless. Just a bunch of guys who got together to play with their toys. I usually am not bothered by technical inaccuracies as I think movies do need to take artistic licence with their work, but Top Gun was ridiculous. There is no way the Navy would let it's trainees behave like this. And the characters are a bunch of arrogant conceded pigs.

99,sashank_kini-1,"Quintessential movies of the 80s: no-brainer plot, impressive special effects, cheesy lines and an undeniable, mellow charm",7,3 July 2011,"Top Gun Maverick (Tom Cruise) and his fellas are manning the world's best jets adroitly, inventing their own moves and taking snapshots. Later, they train to get into the elite 'Top Gun' squad, and fight off those 'blasted enemies'. In all these sequences, the audience can hear a ubiquitous peppy Beverly Hills Cop-like pop number in the background that's quite sucky to be frank. Otherwise, the movie is a breezer, not a strain-on-the-brain but ain't too witty too. The story well, is like Lady Gaga's 'Judas' music video, cartoonish and flippant, not to forget abundant with clichés. The dialogs range from pleasers like ""I feel the need, the need for Speed' to random throwaways like Val's 'Tom and Goose are ladies' joke. Maverick, for a complex, larger than life man isn't just quite so, since the only thing arcane about him is the story of his father. Tom Cruise can make  Maverick sound laughable at moments ( he doesn't have that strong, bellowing grunt that an air commander has) but does it reasonably well in other scenes which require more of his 'boy-next-door' charm. Kelly McGillis does her job fine, but the chemistry between Tom and Gillis is weird, because at times it seems like a teenage-romance when it's not. That's where the director and writer are to be blamed for having the silly elevator-all- smiling-scene. Age-factor is inconsistent throughout since all the characters can't be less than 25 but act in some shots like 'Grease' kids. Take for example the inane rivalry between Tom and Val. The latter calling Tom dangerous is fine but the locker room sequence where both face each other, snarling and giving cocky bitch looks is cheesy. I mean come on guys isn't it enough to see the young army guys cheering for Jersey Shore that the cream of the crop pilots relegate to such sappy rivalries. The flight sequences are engaging, but I really wanted the characters to drop F-bombs in such arbitrary situations. Of course,PG appeals to a wider audience but these guys come off a bit to clean for the situations they're thrown in. Eg. Tom Cruise crash landing in a twirl should make him go 'I'm f***ing' losing it' or 'Oh f***, man!'. Roger Ebert was right when he said ' Movies like TG are hard to review because the good parts are so good while the bad ones are so relentless'.

I have seen it quite a few times now, but I felt that I had to introduce my daughter to the classic now she has turned 12.The movie is about a group of fighter pilots who are the best in the world that are trained as the elite of the elite.I really like the film. It has great action scenes and an actual story. Unfortunately it is a love story. A love story between a student and one of the instructors.Tom Cruise is the main character. He is a reckless pilot who likes to mess around and joke about in the air, which gets him in trouble from time to time but he is one of the best. Tom did a good job, but he is a very good actor anyway so this is no surprise. This was one of his earlier roles and it is easy to see how he has had such a huge career after this. His partner in the air is played by Anthony Edwards. I remember watching Anthony in E.R. a lot and was shocked to be reminded that he was in Top Gun. But he did a great job. Other cast members are Val Kilmer, Kelly McGillis, Tom Skerritt, Michael Ironside, Tim Robbins, James Tolkan & Meg Ryan. The casting is great and they all work very well together.The action scenes in the air were very well done and there were some great fighting scenes. There was some funny moments in the film, sad moments and exhilarating moments. This film was very well put together and was an emotional ride.The film has a great soundtrack too some classic songs from the 80s which never gets old. Yes, some of the songs are super cheesy, but that is what makes this film a classic.There are so many great quotes that come out of this film. It is well known for the singing scene in the bar. Possibly the worst chat up line ever!I will give this film 7 out of 10.It is a classic, but nowhere near as good as some of the other movies to come out of the 80s.

108,nickenchuggets,America wins again,6,7 August 2021,"Top Gun is very similar to the movie Predator starring Arnold Schwarzenegger in many respects. When I say that, I mean both of them are pretty mindless movies that basically just serve as popcorn entertainment instead of something that is going to make viewers think intelligently. There's nothing really wrong with this, it just means you shouldn't expect to find some hidden, deeper meaning to this film because you won't find one. At the very least, these types of movies are good solely because of the amount of action scenes put in them which are sure to keep people watching. It's a double edged sword though, because I always feel like the more movies like this I see, the faster my attention span will fade when I watch something more slow-paced. The story of the movie revolves around a pilot in the US Navy, Lieutenant ""Maverick"" Mitchell (Tom Cruise) and the challenges that come with being a part of the world's most powerful military. As a pilot in the US navy in the 1980s, he is assigned to fly the Grumman f-14 Tomcat interceptor, a highly advanced jet fighter originally designed to provide cover for aircraft carriers by shooting down soviet bombers with extremely long ranged missiles. Right off the bat, there is action in this movie, but no real explanation as to why. Enemy MiG 28 jets (not a real aircraft) have been spotted close to the carrier, and Maverick is sent to stop them. One of his wingmen, Cougar, is too stricken with PTSD to land his plane, causing Maverick to disobey orders and fly after him. He walks him through the landing process, and once back onboard the ship, Cougar resigns. Maverick's superior officer then sends him to the navy weapons school in california, named top gun. Once the class begins, Maverick manages to beat one of his instructors in a mock dogfight, but uses dishonest tactics to do so. This leads to him getting scolded by commander ""Viper"" Metcalf. Meanwhile, another pilot called Iceman does not view Maverick in a positive light, and considers him foolish and reckless due to his tendency to ignore orders and fight aggressively. Later on, Maverick is shown not to be as tough as he appears to be, since Viper manages to bait him into a move that puts an enemy pilot on his tail. This demonstrates how important it is to stay with your team when you're in a combat situation. During a similar mission that pits Maverick against Iceman, Maverick's f-14 flies through the jet wash of Iceman's plane, causing both his engines to stall. This was a real life (potentially fatal) flaw in the early f-14 models since the pratt and whitney engines were not designed to have their airflows interrupted. Maverick's plane goes into an unrecoverable spin, and his radar intercept officer Goose is killed after the ejection seat smashes his head against the plane's windscreen. Maverick initially has the death of his friend pinned on him, but is later said to be not guilty. Still, the death of his friend makes him perform worse in the air, and although he still graduates, he loses the top gun competition to Iceman. At the end of the film, Maverick and his fellow pilots are called upon once again to shoot down more migs that are threatening a ship. After being in the heat of battle with both their lives at stake, Maverick and Iceman gain respect for each other, and Maverick returns to top gun to teach new pilots. Much like tons of other movies made in the 80s, Top Gun in many ways is full of problems. Even if you choose to overlook the fact that has basically no story outside of the action scenes, the action scenes themselves are not done particularly well and get old fast. The footage of the f-14s flying around is probably all stock, and when all the characters are out of their planes, the plot just falters. Maverick does get a love interest later in the movie, but there really isn't any point. Nobody watching this cares about that, and only wants to see things explode. The movie is also hilariously unrealistic at times, most notably during the very beginning when it shows an aircraft carrier in non-american waters completely alone. Everyone knows carriers are the most important type of naval warship in today's world due to their ability to project airpower basically anywhere on earth. The sight of one traveling with no escort whatsoever is ludicrous. There's also the scene that involves Maverick's plane having its engines die because of a disruption in airflow, when this was remedied by Grumman in the new f-14 models by replacing the pratt and whitney turbofans with ones made by general electric. Only the early versions of the plane used the former engine, and because this is the mid 80s, I find it hard to believe they're still flying the old version. In general, movies like this are hard to talk about because almost the whole story is centered on action and not much else. Cruise is in a lot of movies like this that don't require much thought and can be explained pretty easily, but Top Gun launched it into the mainstream. Of course, you can't ignore the fact that america coming out of any fight on top is a hallmark of these movies. The only reason I watched this is for the plane scenes, and I think the majority of people will say the same.",Top Gun
109,funtasticfour,Why is this so revered?,6,29 April 2020,"Tom Cruise has definitely gotten better with age. He is okay here, but still learning. The story is also okay, and the plane sequences still hold up pretty well. So why don't I love this movie like so many my age? I saw it as a kid, and rewatching it now, maybe I saw it for what it is. A love story, with a tiny bit of action. The music is iconic from this movie, but I didn't realize how much they play the same annoying music over and over in almost every scene. I rewatched this alone in anticipation of the sequel because my wife had no interest, and honestly, I'm not sure about the sequel either at this point, though at the least it should look very cool 30 years later. So why do people go crazy for this movie, and I don't? Maybe because I'm Canadian, and the military doesn't get me pumped up.",Top Gun
110,Angeneer,It was a landmark for the 80's teens,5,24 August 1999,"I saw this film when I was 12 years old. We were just entering high school and it was the talk of the year. We kept dancing the whole soundtrack (which is by far the best thing this movie has to give), the boys loved the plane scenes and Kelly McGillis and the girls loved Tom Cruise. That sums it up. The plot is of course awful and naive and if someone would like to find something deeper, it depicts the Cold War militaristic way of thought in the USA. But this is way too deep for this film. It's just a flick of 80's teenexploitation (early teens that is!).",Top Gun
111,chrisbrown6453,Not to be considered a love movie,8,7 October 2000,"Top Gun is your typical love story mixed with 30,000 pounds of thrust behind it.  Tom Cruise unleashes a powerful performance as Maverick Mitchell, a Navy pilot sent to the Navy's prestigious fighter weapons school known as Top Gun.  The sheer heart-pounding combination of action, music, and incredible aerial photography makes Top Gun a great movie. Kelly McGillis plays Charlotte Blackwood, the love interest of Maverick. The age difference was a little hard to believe, but other than that, her performance was believable, and perfectly played.  She grew from the hard-nosed bitch who's only thrill out of life is teaching pilots about new enemy intelligence, to a woman interested in teaching Maverick how to maneuver around her body.  There are many scenes between her and Maverick that are lacking in feeling, but I guess that's not what I watched this movie for.  I did, however, like the karaoke scene in the bar where Maverick and Goose (Anthony Edwards), are singing to her. Top Gun delivers with an all-star cast including Val Kilmer, Tom Skerritt, and Michael Ironside.  Jerry Brukheimer picked all of the actors chosen for this movie personally. Now, I do not make it a habit to read all of the goofs that are listed in the IMDb database before writing my reviews, however having known that this particular movie is full of errors, I had no idea just how many.  That will definitely have an impact on my final score of this movie. While Top Gun set the standard for the `fighter plane' genre, keep in mind that Iron Eagle I and it's only worthy sequel, part II are the only other movies you could put into the category.  All in all, Top Gun takes you on a thrill ride from zero to excitement in 109 min.",Top Gun
112,AvidClimber,See what an 80s pop movie looked like without the quirks,6,5 July 2013,"Top Gun is a 80s classic.The good. Interesting academy rivalry. Nice choice of music and score. Great footage of fighter planes. Beautiful San Diego photography. Funny scenes.The actors. Tom Cruise plays the hothead excellently. Val Kilmer as his ice cool competitor is just perfect. However, the best and smoothest work is done by Meg Ryan. On the other hand, Kelly McGillis is unfortunately performed poorly and wasn't given much to work with. The rest of the cast does a pretty solid job. I'll just mention the better ones: Anthony Edwards, Tom Skerritt, and Michael Ironside. We can also see a small cameo by Tim Robbins.The bad. Easy dialogs. Poor romance plot with lots of cliché and a weak female lead. A few continuity problems. Cockpit filming, lighting conditions mainly, doesn't correspond to fighter plane footage.The ugly. Very awkward stick handling that looks ridiculous.The result. A classic, mainly for those interested in seeing what really launched Cruise's career.",Top Gun
113,Rautus,Fun 80's flick,10,13 November 2007,"This movie is a cheesy 80's flick that is great fun to watch, the shots of the F-14's are stunning and really well filmed, the music is very 80's with the song ""Danger Zone"" and ""Take my Breath away"", the acting is great and the action is cool. Top Gun is directed by Tony Scott (Ridley Scott's brother), Top Gun is a blend of action, drama and romance and it's done pretty good, the script is good and the dialogue is fine.Top Gun does have some cheesy moments but that doesn't matter because it's a fun movie that doesn't disappoint with the action of the F-14's, the drama between the characters and the romance between Maverick (Tom Cruise)and Charlie (Kelly McGillis), if you love 80's flicks then check Top Gun out. 10/10",Top Gun
114,SkullScreamerReturns,Underwhelming drama with tiresome flight scenes,4,3 December 2020,"Top Gun's poster image has been familiar to me since my childhood. Anywhere there were rental vhs tapes, there was Top Gun. But I never saw the actual film, and it's a small wonder that I have not even accidentally seen it during past 30 years. Recently I came across a blu-ray in a local library so I had to finally check it out.The movie is pretty much what I expected it to be, though maybe a bit more boring. There are flying scenes that have cool landscapes but the action itself makes me lose my attention. The pilots talking in oxygene equipment end up looking like a still image, and in my mind it doesn't entirely connect to the outside views. There's a lot going on with planes flying and pilots struggling but somehow I'm just not there.
Clearly a lot of effort has gone to filming all this fighter plane stuff so I give a little respect to that.When the characters are not in the air, there's the drama element. The actors aren't bad, and I think there's some of Tom Cruise's best acting. Other than that I didn't really care about much of the stuff that is going on. The whole movie was pretty much boring to me, except some interesting moments.The soundtrack is good cheesy 80's music but doesn't save the whole movie.I wish I could give more praise to this famous pop culture icon but to me it appears as ""less than the sum of its parts"".",Top Gun
115,stevenrotherforth,I feel the need for Top Gun in 4K!,9,12 June 2020,"Top gun 4KFinally after a countless number of DVD re-releases the Tom Cruise career defining blockbuster gets a worthy restoration.
From the opening shot there's an abundance of film grain left intact reassuring that this 4K upgrade hasn't been given the DNR treatment.
However as the movie progresses the uptake in detail becomes unmistakably noticeable with sweaty closeups all in high resolution glory.
This 4K Blu-ray is definitely worth the purchase.Tony Scott's 80's classic soars onto the UHD format with Dolby Vision and this really does elevate the image.
Sunsets are more orange, the sea is more blue and tanned skin is even more tanned.
The 35mm characteristics still remain but every element of the picture quality has been improved.For anyone who hasn't seen this pop culture icon (seriously where have you been?) this is the best Top Gun has ever looked.
Millennials may find the dialogue too cheesy and the story too cliched but for all of us that grew up in the 80's, this is pure cinematic gold.
Chock full of iconic one liners (I feel the need for speed anyone?)Tom Cruise is at his best here as fighter pilot Maverick.
Support from Val Kilmer is ice cool and Kelly McGillis is down right sexy as Charlie the love interest and Top Gun flight instructor.
There's many stars on the horizon here in supporting roles. Meg Ryan being one to stand out.
Top Gun certainly is all the things that made the 80's great. From the classic soundtrack to the outrageous fashion and hairstyles. This movie is a nice slice of nostalgia.With a measly budget of $15 million Top Gun is a film that punches above its weight in terms of filmmaking.
They actually used real jets for the ariel combat scenes.
No CGI here folks!
Even now this film still looks spectacular.
Top Gun is a product of its time but what a time it was. Only hopes that the forthcoming sequel can hold a candle to the original.If the movie is great and the 4K restoration is superb what about the newly improved sound mix?
For this 2020 rerelease we get an all new Dolby Atmos mix and it's bloody fantastic.
Old movies rarely sound as good as new releases but the work gone into this Atmos track is jaw dropping. This is one of my favourite 4K Blu-ray's in terms of sound quality.
I would go as far to say it's demo worthy.
Mainly because this is a thirty four year old movie that sounds as good if not better than a production that was made yesterday.
Height effects are constantly used with jets and missiles flying from speaker to speaker.
The scene where Maverick and Goose crash sounds absolutely amazing.
Bass is thunderous with after burners and explosions rumbling the LFE channel within an inch of its life.
Anyone who has been disappointed with Dolby Atmos in past are in for a real treat here. Those ceiling speakers or upfiring modules will work overtime with this splendid sound mix.To round up this review.
Top Gun has always been a great movie.
Now with this new 4K release it soars once more like never before.",Top Gun
116,iamjamalwhite,Classic - one of the best,10,15 July 2020,"As a pilot, I love this movie. I am shocked at some people giving it low ratings. This is a rock show from the opening scene to the closing music. Maverick is a Top Gun Navy pilot whose best friend and co-pilot Goose is dating Meg Ryan! Kelly McGennis plays the instructor that is his love interest. He rides a motorcycle. What is not to like? See this classic before the new one comes out in Dec 2020.",Top Gun
117,roghache,Entertaining macho tale of airborne acrobatics and dogfight daredeviltry,7,4 June 2006,"Maybe this is something of a U.S. military naval recruitment film but if taken not too seriously, this testosterone laced movie actually makes for quite entertaining viewing. The jet maneuvers shown are both impressive & exciting and might tend to increase the viewer's respect (as it certainly did mine) for the amazing skill and incredible nerve of real life fighter pilots. The story revolves around a bold, daring, and overconfident navy fighter pilot, Lieutenant Pete Mitchell (call name 'Maverick'), who is sent to the Top Gun Naval Flying School along with his close pal, Goose. Maverick strives to prove himself the best pilot in this demanding course, but faces both stiff competition from a fellow pilot named Iceman as well as personal conflict dealing with his own haunting demons following the mysterious death of his father, also an air ace pilot. Meanwhile, he falls for a lovely civilian astrophysics instructor, Charlotte (Charlie) Blackwood.Tom Cruise is well cast in the role of the hotshot pilot...the cocky, audacious, fearless, but ultimately conflicted and anguished Maverick. Kelly McGillis portrays his often antagonistic love interest, Charlie, who's as smart as she is pretty. Other stars include Tom Skerrit as a real top gun flight instructor, Commander Metcalf (Viper), who proves to be both a skilled and professional pilot but also a compassionate individual. Meg Ryan appears in her screen debut as Goose's perky, fun loving young wife, Carole Bradshaw, a minor role and one which I personally found rather irritating.I half expected that I'd find this movie just all too macho, but it's actually quite engaging to watch. Maverick's personal story, his inner strife, and his romance with Charlie prove less riveting than the incredible airborne stunts with these jets. Yes, they have to be among the best aerial shots ever. This film was made during the Cold War era with its USSR enmity so there are appearances by enemy Russian MiG fighters, naturally cast as the intrusive villains of the piece. The film also does a great job at depicting all the male bonding between these pilots...the camaraderie, rivalry, banter, inter dependency, and genuine close friendship.Maverick is a fighter pilot who, according to Charlie, is only happy when he's 'going Mach Two with his hair on fire'. He's heard to remark just prior to climbing into the cockpit, 'I feel the need for speed'. He also takes great delight in unexpected and forbidden fly byes next to the control tower, scaring the living daylights out of his colleagues and causing them to spill their coffee. I love the little paper airplane touch with Charlie! Guess how Maverick transports himself around the city while on the ground...that's right, zipping about on a motorcycle!The movie features highly effective cinematography of these jets taking off from the aircraft carrier, all accompanied by a fabulous racy musical soundtrack. The romantic scenes are of course to the Oscar winning song 'Take My Breath Away'. Although it certainly features its sad moments, Top Gun is on the whole simply a lively and fun movie to watch.",Top Gun
118,maria2023,An 80's Iconic Film Marked Great Aerial Scenes And Footages,7,1 November 2015,"After the release of Risky Business which became a box office hit,Tom Cruise became a superstar playing the role of Joel Goodsen.Then Top Gun was released.This iconic film back in the 80's catapulted Cruise into becoming a world-famous movie megastar.This 80's iconic film is about U.S.Navy fighter jet pilots studying in a top-notch Navy Aviation school commonly known as Top Gun.It centers on a cocky and highly-skilled pilot Lt.Pete ""Maverick"" Mitchell.It tells his story on how his arrogance and confidence as well as his unorthodox way of flying on air were questioned when his friend and co-pilot Goose was killed in an accident.This also resulted in him losing the top honors to his rival Iceman.Added to that,we also get to witness Maverick's romantic interlude with his flight instructor Charlie.Finally,we also get to witness how Maverick regained his confidence back especially when the U.S. Navy fighter jet pilots won the battle against the so-called ""visitors"" (Russians)in the South China Sea. No question that this was one iconic film back in the 80's.The great aerial scenes and footages were shot extremely well by the late director Tony Scott.The role of Maverick definitely suits Cruise's persona which clearly defined his movie career as well as the future roles for which he is extremely effective for many years to come.The supporting cast consists of many talented actors and actresses that became future stars themselves such as Tim Robbins,Meg Ryan,Anthony Edwards and Val Kilmer.Too bad that despite of the many great things the movie has had,it definitely has its low points.We definitely have a clichéd and predictable script particularly Maverick's character development.Also,the romance between Charlie and Maverick was far from believable and there was something lacking between them.That was highlighted especially as time went on considering Cruise and Kelly McGillis in real life were known to be different from each other.It was evident that it does not hold up at present after it was released almost 30 years ago.It was definitely an 80's film and it would probably stay there for years to come.Definitely,Cruise can do something about it with Top Gun 2 and make it a great update with its release in the future.",Top Gun
119,Rammstein-2,For the boys,6,24 January 2000,"This film is to boys what Dirty Dancing is to girls: the number one adolescence film of all time. The romance and the action in this film are both pretty lame - but there's something about it that moves it from the grotesquely inane to the absurdly interesting. I for one love to see the dogfights despite the enormous amount of factual errors that occur at every single turn. As for the romance between the two main characters, well... it's not that bad, really . Just some lines that feel tremendously corny and some bad acting here and there.I just have one question: how come the F-14s, when they get hit, just lose an engine or experience lighter stability problems, while the little boogeys are blown to smithereens?",Top Gun
120,alainenglish,Enjoyable lightweight Eighties flick (spoilers),8,5 March 2007,"Well known as the picture that turned Tom Cruise into an international icon and coming with one of the great memorable soundtracks, ""Top Gun"" is an enjoyable first-rate Eighties movie.Maverick (Cruise) and his best friend Goose (Anthony Edwards) are two cocky, talented pilots working in the US Navy. After they succeed in rescuing a fellow pilot who nearly died in mid-air combat, their commanding officer Stinger (James Tolkan) decides to send them to Top Gun, a top flying school that trains the best of the best of the US Navy's fighter pilots...The plot is in some ways a parallel to ""An Officer and a Gentlemen"", which was made much earlier in the decade. Both movies are set inside a flight school, both have a troubled central character (in that movie it was Richard Gere, here it's Tom Cruise) who must confront their past and negotiate a romance in the course of the movie. The main character in both movies has a best friend who comes to a tragic end, and both movies feature a very memorable romantic theme song.In terms of plot and characters, ""Top Gun"" is ever so slightly inferior to the earlier movie. The main strength in the cast is Cruise, who holds the movie up with likable charm and strong inner intensity. Kelly McGillis is slightly stilted as his love interest. She performs the role well, but she cannot really compete with Cruise. Because of this, the romance holds no real frisson and it is only the soundtrack playing in the background of their love scenes that allows the relationship to generate any chemistry.Anthony Edwards does well in the role of Goose, but his character is too underdeveloped that when he eventually meets his tragic fate it lacks the impact that it should. Tom Skerrit, Micheal Ironside and James Tolkan are fine as the flight school commanders and Val Kilmer is enjoyable arrogant as Maverick's rival Iceman.The brilliantly shot dogfight sequences give a stirring and disorienting realistic feel of real-life airborne combat, and these combined with the searingly memorable title track ""Take My Breath Away"" are the picture's technical highlights.",Top Gun
121,akshatmahajan,Had more potential,6,17 October 2020,"Top Gun had a story which had a lot of potential. The plot is as cheesy as any movie. After you watch the movie for a while, the story will fade but the feel and the mode of the movie is what keeps you interacted. The soundtrack was nice and aircraft scenes were nicely shot. The negative thing about the movie was it's story. It was too simple and over-stretched. It could have been made much better. This is movie which you may enjoy at cinema but not that at home.Overall, you should give this movie a try especially those who love airforce.",Top Gun

123,jayjaycee,Will you stay on the ground or fly back up?,8,5 July 2020,"""Top Gun"" is a 1986 action drama directed by Tony Scott starring Tom Cruise and Kelly MacGillis. Over the years and against my own expectations, Tom Cruise has by now become one of my favourite actors of all time. While Jake Gyllenhaal still wears the crown and will forever defend the top spot, Cruise is very close behind him and comes second place. Even though many people complain that he isn't quite the most versatile and talented actor in the business, I still got to say that he has an incredible acting range and makes a variety of films that are all extremely enjoyable to me. From his undying, action orientated role as Ethan Hunt in the ""Mission Impossible"" franchise over his dramatic performances in films such as ""Interview With The Vampire"" or ""Magnolia"" to his fairly underrated ability as a comedy actor, as seen in ""Tropic Thunder"", the man is more talented and versatile than people declare him to be. That's why I love him as an artist, he has the skills, is charismatic as hell and always a joy to see on screen. By now, every single film of him I have seen so far has been at least entertaining, and on the fifty-eighth birthday of this apparently immortal legend I have tackled probably his most iconic film of all time. To my utter astonishment, the flick wasn't even as well-received as I thought it was, from what I have heard before, the film is generally located in the airspace of mediocrity. Is it really that unbearable, though? I got down to the bottom of this question and I have personally drawn the conclusion that I understand both sides and all the points of criticism, but boy, I unexpectedly loved it so much. In this film that basically depicts the competition of students at the flight school for extremely gifted pilots, we get everything a well-balanced pop corn flick from the mid-eighties needs. The focus of course lies on the glamour boy Peter ""Maverick"" Mitchell, charmingly portrayed by the twenty-four-year-old Cruise, and how he wants to be the very best (like no one ever was) in the naval aviator business. I definitely cannot speak on the behalf of everyone, but his character is utterly likable and someone I immediately could find a connection to. As if it was done purposely, he lives up to his own name and is quite an idiosyncratic personality. Regardless of his apparently god given talents as a pilot, he is extremely reckless, arrogant, cocky and a true daredevil writ large. Despite all of those rather negative traits and being a tremendous danger for himself and everyone around, he still manages to bring the audience on his side with his sheer charisma and, most importantly, by the other side of his overall pretentious nature. Against my own expectations, beneath all his outward coolness, also a severe turmoil of a haunted soul lies dormant. As the son of the myth-enshrouded pilot Duke Mitchell who mysteriously vanished on his last mission, he tries to follow in his own father's footsteps and always wants to be the best to both make his father proud and make up for the lack of acknowledgement of a father figure that has never been there for him. Yes, behind this overconfident and smug smile hides a disturbed boy who still struggles to cope with the unresolved death of his dad, and hence does all he does in an extreme manner, just to come as close to him as possible. It is only a minimal undertone, but if you are aware of it, it gives every breath-taking scene in the sky a subliminally saddening meaning. As one of his fellow pilots remarks, he is indeed always flying against a ghost as soon as he is in the air. This tragic effect increases even more after the devastating death of his co-pilot and best friend Goose, the man he claims to be his own family he has left, and even though his passing seems to not bother him that much on the outside, you can see it in Mav's eyes and by Cruise's acting that he is extremely tortured by the fact that he has no one left in his life, except for maybe one. Speaking of relationships, another aspect that made me fall in love with this film is how it establishes its individuals and its overall character constellation. What Mav and Goose have is another prime example of friendship goals, his rivalry with Iceman is defined by subtle aversion and yet full of professional respect and his relationship to love interest and instructor Charlie feels pleasantly genuine. In terms of romance, amity and enmity the film has done everything right and I liked every single iconic character here. Even if they without a doubt contribute a lot to the film's reputation of being a classic, it is not the critical factor for its status. The scenes that take place in the air deserve this honour. I am not sure if its true, but I have the feeling that this kind of cinematography must have been ground-breaking in eighty-six. The camera work and visual effects (if there are any) are undoubtedly breath-taking and simply stunning to look at. As if the dogfights in the beginning that are part of the training are not already utterly exciting enough, the film steps up its game in the final act when the newly graduated students have to go into their first serious combat, and this is also the moment when the inner conflict of Maverick concludes. Once again, on the outside it is still a serious mission and an extreme danger to the rookie aviators, but it also functions as a confrontation for Mav, the perfect opportunity to face and leave behind his past. Still reminded of his own mortality and vulnerability after the tragic incident, he is still traumatized and not confident enough, but as soon as his mates need him he brings himself to overcome what haunts him the most and do what is necessary: fly like a maverick. Of course, the film has a happy ending, but it was the only proper way to let this personal catharsis end. All in all, this iconic flick manages the balancing act between awesome and stunning action and touching and profound drama, between airborne excitement and grounded greatness. It works as both, a pop corn flick to shut your brains off to and a subliminal character drama, and thanks to likeable characters, a talented cast and a decent leading performance by Cruise, it becomes something that conjures a smile on my face. Of course, it isn't flawless and has some minor issues, as it is rushed at times and confusingly edited, but it has enough other factors that make up for it. On top of that, it is surprisingly metaphorical, as it also deals with serious question that its protagonist asks himself throughout: Will you stay on the ground or will you fly back up? It is an uplifting tale about overcoming grief and loss, and yet it is popcorn cinema that also knows to entertain in a straightforward way. It cannot be denied that it is cheesy, but like a wheel of Cheddar, it isn't only good-looking but also utterly delicious and simply too good to pass on. It has a phenomenal soundtrack, a packing and touching atmosphere and is extremely enjoyable. This isn't only a film to watch and forget, it is the feeling of a generation, a movie that elevated itself in the list of favourite films of cinephiles around the world. Even if I am a professed admirer of Tom Cruise and it might appear a little overrated to some, this film is without a doubt one you must have seen at least once in your lifetime.",Top Gun

125,happipuppi13,Top Gun : Blasted.,1,24 August 2006,"When it comes to Tom Cruise movies first of all,I can take them or leave them. When he's doing really good drama like ""Rain Man"" or ""Born On the Fourth Of July"",I can take them because he's playing a role outside himself and presenting a really great story worth viewing.When it comes to the likes of this and ""Days Of Thunder"" & ""Cocktail"",I just roll my eyes in utter disbelief! Granted,""Days OF Thunder"" is much worse but I can't like ""Top Gun"" either. A mindless,overblown,,practically plot less film about fly-boys in the Navy and their lives. I watched and watched and could find nothing in which I could care about,in either the characters or the situations. It was sad when Cruise's buddy gets killed but the rest is just pointless to me. Then again,I know,all films are not for all people's tastes. I think he's been more entertaining lately when jumping on Oprah's sofa. At least in that moment he was real. If I were that much in love,I'd hop all over the place too!As for the movie's soundtrack and the songs included. They're just as empty as the movie. ""Danger Zone"" and ""Playing With The Boys"" are the worst Kenny Loggins songs ever. (Well,maybe ""Nobody's Fool"" from ""Caddyshack 2"".)""Take My Breath Away"" by Berlin is the kind of song that gets on your nerves after a few listens and is their unfortunate 80's sell-out song,that took them away from their greater earlier works. Loverboy's,""Heaven In Your Eyes"" is just lame as an 80s love song can get.

127,mnpollio,"Spectacular looking, but emotionally lifeless and intellectually vacant",2,21 June 2011,"There were a number of great films that came out in the 1980s, but Top Gun nearly single-handedly stigmatized that era as being one of utter crap. Released in 1986, the film was a massive blockbuster, but aside from marveling over its technicalities and surface glitz, it is a near indefensible film, even as far as popcorn summer flicks go.The plot – if one chooses to lavish such a description on it – basically focuses on a group of crème de la crème aerial fighter pilots who attend an elite flight school in California and compete to see who will be Top Gun.So much for the plot! The focal character is a cocky, swaggering air jockey named Maverick, played with exuberant arrogance by Tom Cruise. All of the pilots spend their days either doing absurdly risky aerial acrobatics or preening around like peacocks displaying their plumage. Maverick functions as a veritable checklist of clichés for the modern action hero. His dead father was a pilot legend, but with a cloud hanging over him, which gives Maverick major daddy issues. The new adviser at the school just happens to be Kelly McGillis, the sexy woman that Maverick tried to pick up at the local bar the evening before with an embarrassing Righteous Brothers serenade (only the film seems to think it is charming!). Maverick's best friend is a pre-ER Anthony Edwards, who is a funny and sensitive family man married to ditzy Meg Ryan. And given that he is stuck with the nickname of Goose when all the other guys have coy macho nicknames like Iceman, Wolfman and Viper, you get the correct impression that this will be the film's sacrificial lamb to give Maverick his crisis in swaggering. Maverick also has a rivalry with another flyer, played by Val Kilmer, but since that plot thread is forgotten almost as soon as it is introduced, it seems pointless to comment on it.The film has been rightfully accused of heralding in the era of ADHD-action filmmaking, drowning in jingoism, featuring blatant homoeroticism and being little more than a feature length music video. The fact that there is some truth to all of those accusations may make the film seem like great dumb fun or a guilty pleasure, but that overlooks the fact that it is mind-deadeningly tedious.Director Tony Scott provides slick direction and the cinematography is spectacular, but nothing can detract from the fact that the film is emotionally lifeless and intellectually vacant. There are literally entire passages that seem to be nothing more than extended music videos. The film is bookended by aerial dogfights against faceless unknown enemies. Who are they and what are their nefarious plans? The film doesn't care. This may well be the first action film ever that fails to feature either a villain or any identifiable central conflict. Which pilot will become Top Gun at the flight school? The film could also care less about that since it is treated as irrelevant. In fact, precious few things seem to matter in this morass of noise than the next flashing light, billowing flag or whizzing plane.Bad film aficionados can laugh over the film's introduction of McGillis as our country's foremost expert aerial tactician, who has never set foot in a cockpit. Cruise and McGillis have a nonexistent sexual chemistry and spend the duration of the film lobbing their lines at each other like grenades and staring with such intensity that one fears a detached retina. Truthfully, there is nothing wrong with McGillis's acting here, but she is included in the film for only two cynical reasons. First, every action film must have ""the girl"". Second, because her character attests to the red-blooded heterosexuality of our leading man.The second is apparently important because Scott often depicts the hunky pilots as sex objects. They are often parading around in tighty-whities or precariously balanced towels fresh from the shower trying to out-macho each other and filmed with the blatant sexuality of a Calvin Klein perfume commercial. One lengthy sequence depicting a volleyball game is completely pointless to the film unless it is needed to pad the time out or the film wishes to showcase the sweaty bodies of the guys in tiny shorts – you be the judge. Of course, since the film refuses to step outside of PG-rated territory lest they lose their target audience of intellectually stunted adolescents, there is no actual nudity. In truth, while all of the displays of male skin are initially enticing, like the film itself, it becomes an annoyingly empty tease after a while.Although many have forgotten it, Cruise has demonstrated some great acting. While he is ideally iconic and definitely at his sexiest as Maverick, it becomes a thundering bore to watch him reduced to repeatedly strut across the screen with a smarmy grin plastered to his face and offer little else. Edwards turns in the film's best performance as Goose, largely because he is allowed to be affable and appealing without being saddled with the obnoxious posturing of some of the other characters. Tom Skerritt is on hand to provide a bit of maturity as a semi-mentor, but the remainder of the cast including Kilmer, John Stockwell, Tim Robbins, have literally nothing to do but function as scenery.Arguably the film's greatest weakness is that we have no rooting interest in anything that transpires on screen. Nothing seems credible, threatening or of any urgency. The film seems placidly laid-back about everything – including its action sequences, which will fail to lift the pulse of the most non-demanding viewer. Although this has been elevated as a somewhat dubious icon of 1980s filmmaking, this may well be the first hit action film with a complete lack of humor and a dearth of any real action.",Top Gun

It felt slow otherwise.If you want a good Tom Cruise movie, watch Magnolia, A Few Good Men, Rain Man, or Jerry Maguire for a start.But I just can't recommend Top Gun.

131,The_Core,Rare example of...,9,1 December 1999,"... a film that defines pop culture rather than reflecting it. ""Top Gun"" certainly epitomizes everything ""1980's,"" and yet in certain ways it helped to define the decade rather than merely reflecting it. Probably why it's still so popular, and why such obvious ""trash"" is loved by so many (even those who were too young to see its original release).The film has an undeniable power and appeal, if you're willing to discard your brain entirely while viewing. Since it also has a great deal of 'cheese', it requires you to leave the cynicism at the door as well. Isn't that one reason why people enjoy films like this? We secretly hate carrying the burden of irony and cynicism imposed on us by post-1980s society, and movies like this require us to drop it (albeit only for two hours). In this age of terrorist threats and such, how rare is it that we can just relax and honestly enjoy something anymore? Exciting, adventurous and appealing eye candy, as well as an 80's time capsule of sorts. Without a doubt among my top 25 favorite films.",Top Gun
132,jerekra,"Not great, good though.",6,8 May 2009,"Top Gun is a classic film from the eighties that most regard as a good or great film. I think it was good, not great and that may be due to my opinions towards a few of the aspects of this film.Basically it is about a few pilots, Maverick and Goose, who get into TOp GUn, which is a program for the best pilots. There they fly against the best and compete to see who actually is the best.Tom Cruise never was one of my more favorite actors, and his character in this film is kind of annoying. Completely arrogant and also a bit of a know it all. It is funny how Val Kilmers character is portrayed in a negative way most of the film and also arrogant while Tom Cruis is every bit, if not more, arrogant than Val Kilmer is.The love story in this film is a little lame in my opinion. It does not seem that they actually are in love despite claiming to be. Maverick just meets her in a bar, she turns out to be his instructor, she is really interested in his knowledge of MIGs, but somehow they develop a relationship because of all this. Odd love story and one that seemed very lame.I really like the flying sequences and they show a lot of good footage of jets taking off. There also is a lot of technical air force terms used and this is good and makes it seem real, however there was a lot of stuff that I did not comprehend as easily and was confusing. But it seemed like a real group of guys involved in flying jets.It seemed that at times this film dragged and there is a lot of odd parts. Like a lot of singing. Also there are a lot of parts that seemed a little ""homosexual"" to me. If you have seen this film, you know what parts I am talking about.The music is awesome though. Great selection of eighties music in this one.So, not a great film, but pretty good. I recommend seeing it if you never have seen it.",Top Gun
133,antagonist117,"Not original, not smart, but about as entertaining as bad karaoke",5,25 November 2014,"The look of the dogfight sequences in ""Top Gun"" are no doubt inspired by the X-Wing sequence that ends ""Star Wars,"" but the movie's characters are more derivative of ""The Breakfast Club"" than the Rebel Alliance. The chatter of the fighter pilots, their personality-revealing nicknames, even the out-of-place 1970s 'stache on one of them are all straight out of the attack on the Death Star. Most brazenly, at a crucial moment the hero gets inspiration from a dead friend while the people in the control room wonder what the hell he's doing; it isn't called ""the Force"" in ""Top Gun,"" but it might as well be. There are only so many ways to squeeze a camera into a cockpit, so some visual similarities are unavoidable, but the closeups of faceless, black-gloved enemies squeezing their triggers are unnecessarily familiar. What ""Top Gun""'s action scenes aren't able to replicate from the 1977 space opera are the exterior shots. Using B-roll of actual fighter planes instead of models limits the amount of dangerous stunts and explosions that can be used, and director Tony Scott has to cut creatively to give the illusion of combat. He is not particularly successful at this admittedly difficult task; the footage of the planes isn't very helpful in making sense of the action or in ascertaining who's doing what and why. The dialogue has to carry that load, but unfortunately it's not up to the task either. It's embarrassingly clunky, not only in the planes where the fighters speak of their ""hard-on""s, but during the drama on the ground. The pilots are written to be juvenile, which is arguably appropriate for the frat-like atmosphere of a fighter pilot school, but it's a stupid kind of juvenile that isn't as endearing as writers Jim Cash and Jack Epps might have hoped. If the Top Gun academy that the most skilled pilots attend were Hogwarts, almost every character in this movie would be Draco Malfoy: preening, cocky, impotent, witless. Even Tom Cruise's Maverick, who has a potboiler character arc involving a dead father, is an insufferable, grinning ape, and the extent to which he becomes sympathetic is directly proportional to the extent to which he drops that act.Though I mentioned ""The Breakfast Club,"" the comparison is unfair; the kids in that movie were all intelligent and sensitive. Their similarity to ""Top Gun""'s kids is only on the surface, in the way the fresh- faced pilots posture to cover up what must be deep insecurities. Only Maverick's are seriously examined, and his slow acquisition of humility is an appealing if largely predictable thread. But Val Kilmer's Iceman is never given clear motivations, despite his strong screen presence —it is much stronger, in fact, than that of Maverick's love interest played by ""Witness""'s Kelly McGillis. Meg Ryan outperforms the cast's many other household names in an unfortunately minor role.In lieu of a smart script and appealing visuals, our cue that something emotional or exciting is happening in ""Top Gun"" is a soundtrack in which the same three songs (all cheesy, but all catchy and well- chosen) are used at least twice each. The film is entertaining like bad karaoke is entertaining, which is to say that it's good for a few laughs if you don't mind the cringing, and it is probably best enjoyed with alcohol.",Top Gun

136,monkeysgalore,Stylish But Overrated Military Drama,6,13 April 2020,"Never understood what all the hype was about. I upped my rating to six stars to be generous, and for Tom Cruise. I don't think it's the best military action drama film out there, and I think the 80s had lots of way cooler movies (think Lethal Weapon (1987) and Beverly Hills Cop (1984)). It's entertaining enough, even if it is slightly boring towards the middle.The performances are good, so that's a plus. Tom Cruise is charismatic, and attacks his role, and you can just see him desperately wanting to move on to the other more popular movies in his future, which he could obviously see. Val Kilmer is good, if a little weird, and Kelly McGillis is good as the love interest, though I thought she was way better in Witness (1985). Only just now realizing that Tim Robbins was in this. He's one of those actors you see in a movie and like, then forget he was in it, then like him in another movie, and then eventually you have that moment where you realize all the movies he's actually done.Tony Scott's direction, while undeniably more restrained than in his future works, is very nice, and it has his usual cool, glossy look. Scott was still finding his style at the time, but this is definitely a Tony Scott film. He's all over it, and it's one of the movie's high points.It's a bit of a stretch to call this an action movie. It's more of a military drama. There's a training scene with the fighter jets in the beginning, but the only real action scene is a dogfight in the skies near the end, which is pretty cool, though it doesn't have anything on The Last Starfighter (1984) (kidding).I really don't have much else to say about this. It's one of Cruise's best performances arguably, though I still believe Collateral (2004) to be his all-time best. It's a very 80s movie, and if you want to see a classic that is maybe a little overhyped, then go ahead. It's worth seeing once, just to see what everyone's talking about.",Top Gun
137,heisenberg12,80's Action Classic That is Memorizable Start to Finish,8,27 October 2018,"From the magnificent soundtrack packed with several 80's hits and chart toppers to a notoriously memorizable script start to finish, Top Gun epitomized blockbuster movie making in the 80s. Tom Cruise's stardom took off because every boy or guy for that matter wanted to be as cool as Maverick and get the girl (Kelly McGillis) while flying mock 10 with their hair on fire and getting caught up in 4G inverted dives with mig-28's while keeping up foreign relations by giving them the bird (Yes, we know it's the finger, Goose).Meg Ryan makes one of her earliest if not first major roles as Goose's wild wife. Goose is played by a young Anthony Edwards (ER) and was a lovable character whose fate leaves no one with dry eyes. The star studded cast also included Val Kilmer and Tom Skerrit.This is a movie that welcomes cheesiness for all the right reasons, and it redefined what a summer blockbuster could be and what audiences liked in an action film. Newcomers and younger generations will find this hard to believe, but people who grew up in the 80s understand that the movie doesn't have just one, two, or three memorable lines and dialogue; nope- the whole entire movie can be memorized- that is, every single line from beginning to end. It's one of those movies that will never get old. Like many, I probably have seen it over 200 times since 1986. It had to be one of the most rented and shown on TV films from the late 80s to 90s on both basic cable and cable, and it is always a fun watch. Just pure entertainment that never lets up.8/10",Top Gun
138,buzznzipp1995,Da Fly-boys....,4,13 February 2007,"""I feel the need, the need for speed!"" Wow! With such powerful script writing and acting that could only be rivaled by Franco Columbu or some of the contestants on American Idol, it's no wonder this little flying-ace gem, hasn't aged well. I saw this in the theater, when it came out in 86' and had fun with it then, it was either that or ""Platoon"" and we wanted to kind of have fun too, so anyway. It had been about ten or eleven years since I had seen this one and I ended up buying it on VHS and viewing it again. Boy what a difference, I had remembered this being a more dynamic story that was faster paced with great musical accompaniment, although I had enjoyed Val Kilmer's performance a whole lot more than originally, since this man's talent (Kilmer) far exceeds Cruises, I mean, let's be real about it now. At any speed, I had sold the movie and then rented the DVD to see the clearest aspect of picture and some other special features, this was only a short time ago. Frankly speaking, I was shocked at how bad this feature had been and grown to be over the rest of the years!! Everybody was hyped about this movie when it hit the box office! I swear, I heard all different types of people quoting lines from the movie etc and now....I am watching, with a smirk on my face and an embarrassed after though. Cheeze-whiz, this is. I just marveled. I had bought the original soundtrack that was remastered to digital with extra tracks and truly it was as sharp as I recalled, with better audio sound now. From Cheap trick to Kenny Loggins, it was right on the money! The only problem was that the music had outgrown the movie. Sometimes this happens. Some do well again later, some fall tragically short.Not recommended unless there is nothing else to watch, like Clint Eastwoods, ""Heartbreak Ridge"" there's a solid military film, that is based on the conflict in the Faulklin Islands, back in 1983. At this point, I will say for me this with everything in it, receives a '4',out of ten stars, and thats really just the music and Val Kilmer's part. (**)",Top Gun

It touches our intellect level by showing how important school (classroom) is in learning to be a good fighter pilot. It touches our heart by the romance between Tom Cruise and Meg Ryan. It touches our need for adventure and competition with the air flights and competition between pilots. However, it is competition and adventure with a purpose, to give the knowledge to survive. Top gun may even be an inspiring film to get people to enroll in the US Military as fight pilots or support air staff. Top Gun is entertaining as well.

Also, I really like some of the military-characters in the movie. Especially ""Viper"". Tom Skerrit does a really good job with him. There are also lots of cool action in the movie. The last scene is the best. Unfortunately, there's a rather long drama-part in the middle of the movie that destroys the great action-feeling a bit, but everything gets OK as soon as it ends.

143,dkncd,The danger zone,7,5 October 2007,"""Top Gun"" is about a group of United States pilots that attend a school for top pilots, remarkably called the ""Top Gun"" school. The pilots engage in various training exercises and occasionally engage in combat with ""commie"" MiGs.Tom Cruise leads the cast as the pilot codenamed ""Maverick"". Cruise is suited to playing a pilot that's brash and arrogant. Maverick's rival for top honors at the flight school, ""Ice"", is played by Val Kilmer, who is appropriate to play a character that is, well, brash and arrogant. Kelly McGillis also gives a fine performance as ""Charlie"", an instructor at the school and a love interest for Maverick. However, Anthony Edwards' and Meg Ryan's performances as ""Goose"" and Carole weren't notable.The officers of the film, however, are perfectly cast. The first officer we see is played by James Tolkan, who practically reprises his role as Mr. Strickland from ""Back to the Future"" (1985). The role suits him well, and I half expected him to say, ""Slackers!"" or ""You've got a real attitude problem!"" Michael Ironside and Tom Skerritt are also cast as officers and bring the right air of authority to their roles.This film appropriately features captivating aerial training and combat. The flight sequences were consistently well-paced and backed up by an appropriate rock soundtrack. Where this film isn't as consistent is when the pilots are on the ground. The film maintains a consistent pace and is never boring. There are some decent dramatic moments and the relationship between Maverick and Charlie was reasonably developed. However, quite a lot of the dialogue and situations created in this film are juvenile. I suppose this film wanted to portray immature yet driven pilots, but it becomes tiresome quickly. Scenes like the volleyball scene really weren't necessary. Overall ""Top Gun"" is primarily notable for its impressive fighter sequences.",Top Gun
144,Benjamin_Cox,Fails on take off - 49%,5,2 April 2007,"Few films provoke more feelings of nostalgia than this one. Arguably the film that launched Tom Cruise into the stratosphere, it is exactly what you'd expect from a Simpson/Bruckheimer production - it's loud, macho and utterly predictable but somehow, people have fallen in love with this film including my Better Half. In fact, I had to watch it by myself because she began quoting the dialogue word-for-word! Frankly, it never really appealed to me and to be honest, I feel slightly vindicated. This is not a film that is easy to take seriously (even if you hadn't seen ""Hot Shots"") but while it does some things very well, it's far from being the polished Eighties icon I was expecting. Yes, expecting - this is the first time I'd watched it...Cruise plays Pete Mitchell, an aggressive Air Force pilot who goes by the name of ""Maverick"". Specialising in being unconventional and rebellious, Maverick and his co-pilot Goose (Anthony ""ER"" Edwards, of all people!) find themselves dispatched to the Navy's Top Gun flight school in order to become the best. But Maverick's attitude, combined with the disgrace of his father, puts him at odds with his fellow students and especially Ice (an uncomfortable looking Val Kilmer). Distracted by civilian instructor Charlie (Kelly McGillis), can Maverick tame his inner demons and the skies in order to be the best?Almost everyone is aware of this film in some capacity, whether its due to the frequent action scenes or its undeniable homo-eroticism - it's impossible to watch the volleyball scene with a straight face! Cruise is easily the best of the actors although Tom Skerritt almost betters Cruise as the veteran Viper. But the real stars are the planes as they fly, spin and twist their way around each other. Problem I had was that once you lose track of who is in what plane, the action becomes very confusing. For example, when Maverick talks about flying in an inverse double-barrelled somersault with two twists and a tuck, I didn't know if he was flying or Olympic board diving! You can't follow the action whereas the plot is so simple, it's damn-near insulting. The only surprise for me was that there was no flash-back scene but Hell, Tony Scott has some standards. Kilmer looks very uneasy about the whole thing but the most ironic casting was vocal anti-war critic Tim Robbins as fellow fighter pilot Merlin. Made me chuckle, anyway.I'm sure that waaay back in the day, when ""Top Gun"" was cutting edge and before it was spoofed, this would have been great. Just the tonic for an America in the dying days of the Cold War. Now, post 9/11, it looks horribly dated and excessively patriotic. Cruise has gone on to bigger things, Kilmer seems to have ignored it altogether on his CV and McGillis vanished into thin air. Personally, it never really stirred me until the famous volleyball scene where I couldn't contain my laughter any more. In short, this film is excessively noisy and woefully unimaginative. It's a very basic, mass-appeal Boys-Own adventure that had about 10 seconds of though behind it and a director obsessed with filming lots of shots of planes flying past. If that's what you're looking for, or if you fancy seeing why everyone got very excited 21 years ago, then give it a try.

147,toqtaqiya2,"""I feel the need - the need for speed!""",6,1 August 2010,"Top Gun is a big piece of 1980s cheese. Definitely a Hollywood product, it was however very successful at the box office. The success is mostly due to the action and to Tom Cruise and his winning smile. The aerial combat shown in Top Gun is exciting, but it's not always logical or consistent (shooting down Soviet fighter planes would result in war in real life). What makes it better is the film's soundtrack. Catchy upbeat rock & pop songs back the action and the romance on screen. That's pretty much the film's appeal. There are plenty of faults, but in the end it's entertaining and makes one feel good. The fighter pilot life seems so appealing in Top Gun that registrations to join the navy in the USA went up significantly after the film was released. According to the film in order to become one of the top fighter pilots in America you have to be a) a male b) have an attitude c) be good-looking d) be a good fighter pilot. Oh, and you have to believe that America is always on the side of good. Come to think of it, was there even a brunette in the film? It seemed to me like all the women were blondes. Yeah, but at least the dogfights are some of the best in film history. There's no Top Gun program in reality though. Still, while you're there ""playing with the boys"" you feel cool and like you belong. Val Kilmer makes an impression, but it turns out he didn't want to be in the film. He had to play the role of Tom ""Iceman"" Kazansky because of contract obligations. Top Gun is not a bad film. Even if everything in it is by the numbers it's still a notable 1980s flick (in my opinion ""Take My Breath Away"" is an annoying and corny song). The film is bright, it's action-packed, it's sometimes touching, it's at times funny. I recommend it.",Top Gun

I can't tell why, I just missed any opportunity to watch it before. Well, today I had a look at it. Overall I thought it was amusing, it felt very typical and the cheesiness was really over the top. It's not a movie you can take seriously. It would probably have been a blast if I was younger and I understand a lot of people have nostalgia for it. It didn't do much for me unfortunately. It was difficult to see past all the clichés and silly moments.The soundtrack is nice, no faults there. I loved the camera filters they used. The whole movie is highly saturated and it seems like the entire thing was filmed at golden hour. All the flight scenes are pretty spectacular. Must have been difficult to film them. The characters are stereotypical and corny. Every other scene it's like someone's gonna say ""Oh, you!"" or something similar. The story goes through all the typical beats. You can easily guess what's gonna happen. So, it's not a movie you should go to if you are looking for depth. I've always admired Jerry Bruckheimer as a producer, he is actually my favorite movie producer. I haven't seen much of Tony Scott's work. I enjoy his visual style the most of what I've seen so farIt's an 80's time capsule and it's typical, cheesy and clichéd, I know. But, it was still decent fun. You can turn your brain off and be entertained. So, that's OK. Maybe I expected too much from it.",Top Gun
150,stp43,US Navy Aerial Dogfight Soap Opera,8,12 June 2003,"Top Gun was the ""king of cool"" in the 1980s thanks to the self-satisfied performance of Tom Cruise as hotshot ""jock"" pilot Peter ""Maverick"" Mitchell. The film revels in Mitchell's arrogant disregard for rules (he is a walking Section Eight), from his absurd guidance of a terrified comrade onto the deck of the USS Enterprise (this despite the fact Maverick's F-14 lacks the fuel to land itself) through the remarkably weak punishments he gets for breaking such rules as hitting on his DoD instructor (Kelly McGuiness) to getting his radar intercept officer ""Goose"" Bradshaw (ER's Anthony Edwards) killed in a thoroughly stupid contest with Tim ""Iceman"" Kazansky (Val Kilmer) over who will be first to ""kill"" the enemy plane late in the Navy's Top Gun dogfighting exercises; the film wimps out badly when, in this incident, Maverick's flying through Iceman's jetwash (thus killing his own engines and leading to the ejection punch-out where Goose slams into the cockpit canopy and severs his windpipe) is more accidental than anything; the scene should have been clearly 100% the fault of Maverick, since he practically sticks his F-14's nose into Iceman's thrusters.But if it were thus portrayed accurately, then the film comes to an end, with Maverick grounded or even dishonorably discharged, thus underlining the weakness of playing up Maverick as incapable of discipline.  Throughout the film Maverick acts in thoroughly unprofessional manner (any pilot who performed a close-in flyby on a tower would be court-martialed) and never is called on it except in the most perfunctory and insincere fashion, not even when Goose Bradshaw pleads with him early on that he, Goose, can't afford to blow the opportunity presented to him.Cruise and McGuiness are not worth investing the time needed to watch the film; the real stars are the supporting cast - Tom Skerritt, Michael Ironside, Anthony Edwards, Val Kilmer, and Rick Rossovich - and the superb aerial dogfight footage; the use of F-5s as Soviet MiGs is a bit distracting, since the F-5s don't look at all like Soviet warplanes.  Also annoying is the lack of role of the backseaters, who do more than just read radar screens in the F-14's cockpit.  Kenny Loggins' famous theme song is a treat, but not really appropriate for the film.If you can overlook the weak leads and focus on the supporting cast and the aerial footage, you're in for an entertaining dogfighting spectacle.",Top Gun
151,T-ZER0,Highway to the Danger Zone Indeed!!,8,1 June 2020,"Top Gun. A classic 80s movie I meant to see for years. It had super familiar music like ""Danger Zone"" and ""Take my Breath Away"". I heard that they were making a sequel to the film, and I made it a mission to see the original first. I checked it out from the local library and watched in on my PS4. Unfortunately for me, when I saw it the first time, I didn't like it. I think that was because I had just come back from a long exhausting day and I couldn't dive into the movie.However, I saw it again and my opinion changed. This is a classic feel-good 80s movie. For example, so much epic ness for me when the opening scene starts and they start playing ""Danger Zone"" by Kenny Loggins. I literally geek out everytime!This is also Tom Cruises signature film, and he does great on his role. Even though my favorite character is Iceman. Because he's just so cool.There is an amount of cheesiness in this film, some cringeworthy. Heck, I always cringe when they say ""Take me to bed or lose me forever."" But luckily, I can mute that audio so I don't have to hear it. When Maverick and Goose say: ""I feel the need. THE NEED FOR SPEED!"" That I like. Also, you gotta love the way Slider yells during the volleyball game. So cheesy, but so fun at the same time. I think that's mainly because it feels like he's saying ""Yes"" to the song and to the game.The love story is a bit out there, but it's easily watchable. It's not altogether cringeworthy. But there are some moments.I don't know if this is with actual pilots. But I love the fact that everyone has a call-sign. From ""Maverick"", ""Goose"", ""Iceman"", ""Jester"", ""Slider"", ""Cougar"", ""Hollywood"", ""Viper"". All sound epic in their own way. Let's not forget, the jet scenes are amazing.I guess I can also relate this film to my own life a tiny bit. Mainly when Goose says: ""I just hope we graduate"". I say the same thing about me and College. It's also very sad, that Goose died. Because he had a family, and he was Maverick's best friend. (P.S. Did they base Guile from Street Fighter off of Iceman? There's a striking resemblance!)I didn't hesitate to return this to the library and buy the Blu-Ray before the quarantine.Now I can enjoy it anytime. What's really funny, a little off topic here. Is that my parents love the 80s, yet they didn't like this movie at all, I guess I'm more of an 80s kid than they are. 😏",Top Gun

Right off the bet we are sent to admire a film work up in the sky that is not a fantasy but a real life that takes your breath away.The intensity jumps up and down, appliances tick and your heart keeps their tempo. Every exciting moment doubles on your side of the screen and all of them are so swift that it all seems natural and they all glide to the 'iconic' corner of the mind.Music is a perfect fit that boosts the danger and tempers the romance. If you go again from the start with something different as a background, the feeling of emptiness will hit you without hesitation. But another trick is that there are so many practical effects that create enjoyment just with listening to the revs of an engine and sound of rockets flying by.The cast here is an ultimate cocktail of testosterone and beauty. Tom Cruise and Val Kilmer are the duo that performs dangerous but a passionate dance. Kelly McGillis breaks the action for an instant just enough to spice it up and present in another extraordinary way.In under two hours you experience a rush of a century and the wish to risk and live is at the breaking point.

Cruise and McGillis have great chemistry, but the best scenes involve the ongoing confrontation between Cruise and Val Kilmer, as one of Cruise's flight opponents.

These movies use themes and plotlines that have been done over in countless movies.But Top Gun is 15 years old!  Like Star Wars, it wasn't following the tried, stale plot cliches; it was SETTING them and writing them:  The daredevil, insubordinate pilot.  The grizzled teacher who used to fly with the hero's ""old man.""  The old man himself, who was thought to die dishonorably, but was actually a hero as well.  The wingman who dies and weighs heavily on the hero's conscious.Yes, it's all old and played out... NOW, 15 years later.  Top Gun was one of the first to combine these elements into one plot.  It is story telling at its best.  That is why so many movies and shows have tried to imitate it over the past two decades.",Top Gun

160,quiqueperezsoler,"Michael Bay's biggest inspiration. A romantic, stylish, cheesy and over the top 80s nostalgia film with an eye candy Tom Cruise. A cult classic indeed.",7,9 October 2020,"I like this movie, really. I think it is one of the biggest pieces of 80s navy/military nostalgia out there. Its saturated colors, disregard for technical accuracy and the over the top personalities of every character reminds us why the 80s were so great. The extravagantic flashy and superficially clear emotions evoqued in this movie are enough to convince people it has a story.I have only seen these movie elements in Michael Bay movies. Movies like Armageddon (1998) or the first Transformers one. And I don't mean it in a bad way, I actually understand the appeal of such a movie. For some it'd be a ""flight/pilot-porn movie"", for others an eye candy piece of young Tom Cruise seeing there's a shirtless volleyball scene; and for others, like me, is brainless entertainment.Surprisingly enough, I never thought this movie was cliche or cheesy. If this movie is cheesy, then every other movie from the 80s is also cheesy and with that logic none of them are. Because this is the sort of feel and personality the movies had back then. The difference is, the cliched and cheesy parts make the movies endearing because they add a unique personality to the already well-crafted stories.And this movie would have been a heartbreaking story with a positive outcome but the story is just too bland even for the time. I love 80s movies, I have watched a lot of them, but this one unfortunately falls for me in some story aspects. It never tries anything new than the most stereotypical route for every single character to a point of even being able to predict the turn of events.IN CONCLUSION; it is a fun, entertaining and plain dumb romantic-drama (not action drama as there's very little action, just long pilot flight scenes). Of course I have my problems with it (like the fact that I have no idea who is talking most of the times in the flight scenes because everybody sounds the same when shouting and they are all wearing helmets) but I realised that wasn't the reason this movie is a cult classic. Thanks to Tom Cruise's grin and the incredible energy and charisma he brings to the movie, he delivers an incredible performance that would cement his career as an action hero. The romance is amazingly well done and the soundtrack is an 80s nostalgia trip. A great movie to pass the time and not reflect upon or no take-away.",Top Gun

162,DVR_Brale,Top Gun is fallacy of composition counterexample: average elements cleverly put together can make an extraordinary movie,8,28 August 2016,"When I was a little boy I discovered a box full of VHS tapes my parents had back in the early 2000s. The Independence Day and Top Gun where inside the box as well. I played Top Gun over and over and over. I fell in love with flying and planes. To this very day Maverick (Tom Cruise) remains my all-time hero and the coolest movie character ever.So what's so great about Top Gun anyway? Nothing particular. This movie really doesn't have anything special besides having a spectacular soundtrack. Other movies have a better story, better acting, better special effects etc. Where other movies land short behind Top Gun is in blending everything together. I'm usually not in favor for emphasizing a romantic side story in action movies but Top Gun has room for both action and romance. I think that's due to focusing on Maverick (Tom Cruise) as a par exelans aviator. Tom Cruise's performance is just unbelievably and equally slick be it flying a plane or getting down with a lady.Let me comment on soundtrack for a few lines. I'm pretty sure that nobody who had seen Top Gun didn't forget Harold Faltermeyer's Top Gun Anthem. That's action soundtrack along with Kenny Login's Danger Zone. Berlin's Take My Breath Away and The Righteou's Brothers You've Lost That Love Feeling are romantic songs both of which immediately take me back to Kelly McGillis and a famous bar scene. Action and romance are pretty much separated throughout the whole movie: first we enjoy epic air combat and then romance each having it's own amazing soundtrack.Air combat by itself is nothing spectacular seen from 2016. standpoint. What makes it spectacular are pilots. All of them represent elite aviators. Maverick and Goose, Iceman, Viper, Jester, Cougar, Hollywood and others have their own helmet which enables you to recognize them when they're flying. Their air-mode communication style is very entertaining as well. Some people call Maverick's and Iceman's rivalry the greatest bromance of all time. Yes, they're both macho, usually having only towel on when in conversation.So to conclude: I'm never gonna loose that lovin' feelin' for Top Gun since this movie takes all traditional movie elements, which by themselves don't have anything special and are pretty much average, and makes a special movie, very cool movie with unforgettable characters.",Top Gun
163,e-m-hobo,"It has toys, boys, and girls. It's actually quite critical. I didn't see it.",9,28 July 2021,"This movie has everything that attracted me as a young boy growing up and it used to be one of my favorites. I decided to watch it again and I get why. In terms of popcorn fluff it ranks all the way up there with Transformers. Same formula, but a little less sci-fi.The entire movie without exception is shot with the most beautiful iconic imagery laden with a surefire emotion trigger soundtrack that doesn't miss a single time. Everything is spot on, you know exactly where it is going to go next, and when you know you're going to get your candy, you want it.The Top Gun movie teaches us it's all about showing balls, they lure you in by giving you the impression that most of the time there is no real fighting, just taunting that you have to withstand, it's not really a real war, but when it does get real in the end, yeah, you're the best of the best, that's how you were trained.I took notes watching it again and it's sort of funny that it's one of those movies that's thus formulaic that yes, you can actually check your watch for the Syd Field ten minute line. You're not supposed to be able to do that, but it's as tight as a Highlander television episode. (Don't forget about ALL of that formula if you would like to write your own immortals movie. They can't have kids, but that's another story.)The logic of what happens in the movie is sort of strange in that there are things pilots don't like and fear they cause problems, and they do but they also don't. Essentially, when the movie needs it, their fears become reality, and when it needs it not to be, they pull through and succeed. All of the fears are essentially based on fictional rules that you only stick to when it comes in handy and otherwise you don't.Well, logic. First of all, the co-pilot can also land, so if one pilot panics, the other normally takes over. Not in this movie. Officially, if a character like Cougar, who had a nervous breakdown over nothing, was the best of the best, all Top Gun pilots suck. It's a movie, I get it, but really?All of the pilots are dumb and formulaic: it's like college with airplanes and just like in college, almost none of the students entering into college bother to graduate high school first. It's all boys and girls in a playground. The use of pickup lines to pick up women is dumb and cringeworthy... And stupid. And dumb. The entire movie is like a flying frat-party.Then there's the MIG. It didn't do an inverted dive. These pilots are so dumb they don't even get that they're the ones upside down? And there was no dive. And that there was is their witness testimony when they have to appear when they have to explain their actions? They might be courtmartialed for that.Mmm. The actors also seem to make clear that it's a commercial. When Charlie catches Maverick in the hallway after he told her he saw the inverted dive, she seems to break the fourth wall looking into the camera during one shot. Subtle, but I think it was there.Then there's more inconsistencies. For instance, during a Top Gun training Maverick identifies a missile lock as having killed his opponent even though there's still room to evade the missile for the opponent. Technology has its limits. A nose dive screw driver just before the missile would hit makes it miss. ""Lock"" isn't the same as ""dead.""Sometimes it's me not getting where they come up with rules like that you're not allowed to shoot below a certain altitude. If there are no citizens there, you just shoot the enemy. It's war. Also the constant sticking to a method in the way they fight would make them highly predictable and them saying what they are about to do on the radio doesn't help either.It's all superficial nonsense: you have to have this attitude, in this situation act like this, in that situation act like that. Having a hard time? Try the hip lock aristocrat walk. These kinds of people at first may come off as nice and charming when you're not used to it, but they all feel it's in the game, about being top dog, also at the expense of you. They are one hundred percent egocentric.Then there's what they teach you about values. They don't discuss dying, but the expenses of losing an airplane. They don't care about their pilots. They don't care about anyone dying. That's what everyone shows. It's all about the game. You win some, you lose some. That's the only attitude they display.So, Maverick is the best of the best? I mean, he keeps closing his eyes while flying. How do you fly with your eyes closed? You're more likely to hit another airplane flying into it that way than Goose dying with the cover being long gone. Where's the spin and all that now? In reality it would have long cleared.So, you hit jet-wash and it shuts down your engine? Restart it. And if you only have one engine, it doesn't cause spin. You just keep on flying like they show later on in the movie.Then to get him back in the game, they don't get him therapy after Goose died, which would have been appropriate, no, they decide to make it easy on him. They make it easy on a Top Gun pilot to boost his confidence instead of letting him abseil face forward. That's how you get the best trained sheep.Charlie sits down to have a talk with him and get him back in the game after Goose died. First it wasn't his fault, then she says we all make mistakes, so it was his fault the way she sees it? They have no sense of logic whatsoever.Should I reiterate that no one cares about Goose dying? His wife cries a little bit, but it's like, well, he's gone, I'm just going to move on. Bye and don't forget to fly, Maverick.Ice-Man also, seriously, he sticks to the protocol in terms of what you have to say when someone dies, but it was acted out 100% accurately that it didn't move him. He even keeps smiling, really. Just check the graduation ceremony, all colorful, champaign, and no remembrance plaque for Goose (Did they call his son Duck in the sequel?) and no time spent on consoling his wife and child. Just smiles everywhere.They're all acting like inbreds: don't really fight most of the time, don't understand purpose, goal, or tactics, just have their one signature move which makes them predictable and gives them something to brag about. They're really all bark and no bite and don't go for the kill. If you're not going to fight, just stay on the ground. It's all taunt, taunt, taunt. Try using a phone to sort out your differences.Well, it has to have a dog fight, so the final scene does give us one and they send Maverick up even though they have a whole ship of pilots and he's still not had any therapy. They lose an airplane, are shot at more, and now engage. They communicate all of their tactics over the radio so the enemy may hear. Real smart. All of the problems of before suddenly aren't a problem anymore.We get to see the losers that now get to be winners, the small turnaround of Maverick sticking to his wingman without a display of how this benefits them tactically, but merely means to teach that as a dog you're supposed to be loyal. And then there are the running gags with there always being a cup of coffee in the right place.And then Maverick decides to become a Top Gun instructor even though the way I remember it, Ice-Man won the trophy, which means that he's the only one that's eligible. Well... You have to call horse **** as you see it, and this movie does that every bit of the way. You just have to have an integral view of reality to see it.",Top Gun

167,thescholar22,The Need For Speed!,6,30 October 2019,"Finally watching this because of the sequel coming soon to theaters as well. I tired to watch this movie on TV but I didn't pay attention because some stuff is censored. I watched this also with my parents since dad like the jets and dogfights in this movie too. So lets get to the movie.The movie starts with some text about ace pilots starting out and calling the program Top Gun. Then there's these jet pilots doing some tests, like if you are locked on by an enemy jet and told not to fire unless the enemy does. This also introduces Maverick and Goose, played by Tom Cruise and Anthony Edwards. Maverick is basically the risk taking hot shoot and Goose is his co pilot. After one of the guys, Cougar, quits since he couldn't handle the lock on test.Maverick and Goose then go to some bar and Goose tries to get Maverick to hit on some girl in the bar. He gets shot down and later find out she works for Top Gun as well. There's also this gag where this other guy drinks coffee and Maverick does a fly by near him and he spills it. There's also this other guy, Iceman, played by Val Kimmer and he's okay in this. Then there's this other test where the jets try and stick together but Maverick tries to shot down a fighter. Even though the enemy might just pick you down one by one if you do that.There's also this love story between Maverick and that girl in the bar, but we skipped that not only because the girl is a lesbian in real life, the love story kind of feels forced as well. Along the way Maverick and Goose end up burning too much fuel during a test and Goose actives the eject button. Goose ends up hitting his head on the canopy and dies, Maverick is told it wasn't his or Gooses fault but Maverick feels responsible.Maverick ends up quitting and then after a bit joins up with Top Gun again. Then the pilots end up going on a mission and along this dog fight Maverick saves Iceman. At the end Maverick ends up want to be an instructor for Top Gun and the movie ends.This movie felt okay from what people have today now and I hope the sequel does well, hopefully. Just because after Tom Cruise did The Mummy remake for this Dark Universe franchise I don't know about how he will do now. Watch this yourself if you feel nostalgic or something like that.",Top Gun

Tom cruse is at the height of his career and this movie sets him up in a iconic role as the lead character Maverick and his flying partner Goose played by Anthony Edwards was Mavericks friend but also someone who he can put his problems on and they have a unique relationship Kelly Mcgillis is Charlie the love interest of Maverick and a instructor at the top gun academy and they have such a great relationship which is shown on screen.

173,asd29,Most women love this film.,7,25 July 2019,"Ive always regarded this 1986 movie as a vehicle for a female audience , the chics love it- obviously because tom cruise is just at the beginning of his pomp all buff playing volleyball in skinny tight jeans with his co pilots , the plot of the film is fairly thin about NAS jet fighter pilots who enroll in ""TOP GUN "" academy to sort the men from the boys , theres love interest from a beautiful instructor (kelly mcgillis) who is a little bland in this but her sexy looks make up for her overall performance, anthony edwards is good as cruises co pilot , while val kilmer just looks bored and annoyed in his role theres also support from micheal ironside, tom skerrit and meg ryan in her early role when she was hot , the picture isnt brilliant it never has been its just a routine actioner but the jet fighter footage is excellent , the script could be worse the music pumps you up , its good but not that good ! but as i pointed out at the beginning of my review its more eye candy for the ladies 6.5",Top Gun

Along with his co-pilot Goose they enter and compete in the navy's top flight training program and competitions simply known as Top Gun. It is there he meets Charlie a beautiful flight instructor, romance follows as does emotional heartbreak as Mavericks recklessness finally catches up to him.One of the most successful movies of the 1980's with its blend of action, romance, comedy and drama makes it still to this day a great film. Some of the finest aerial action ever caught on film you will almost feel as though you are up in the sky with the pilots. Beloved by many film goers and perhaps one of Tom Cruise's most beloved characters. The play off between Cruise and Edwards is perfection and is evident from the first five mins of the film. Notable recognition should as well go to Val Kilmer who plays Cruises rival, Iceman. The soundtrack to this film is perfect and beloved by many fans of the film and fans of music from the 80s. Top Gun is a must see for any film fan of any age, as it still to this day is considered a classic. So if you have the need for speed, Top Gun is a must watch.",Top Gun

I say that Top Gun is the best one of the few Tom Cruse movies that were done right and make some bit of sense. I love the movie, you can pretty much call Top Gun the center of my childhood. I have probably seen this movie more than a thousand times. When I was little I used to watch it several times every week and dream day after day about taking a career in the air force. I've talked with other people that used to watch it all the time too. Of course I don't watch it that much now, but I usually watch Top Gun at least when I find it playing on TV. The best part of Top Gun is that it certainly has a good variety of just about everything in a great movie: action, romance, drama, and one of the best movie soundtracks ever made. Only if the movie's soundtrack CD's they make have had more of the movie's music on it, things like the opening theme song along with the longer opening beat to danger zone.The homophobic people talking about Maverick and Iceman having some secret gay relationship and whining about the volleyball game, just need to get a life.

179,hypersonic8999,"Chick flick for the girlfriend, action for the boyfriend",2,30 January 2012,"Well, where do we start? All the clichés in every war movie ever were crammed into a single film (except the only black guy dies first thing, that was not in it, because for some reason, all the smart, top-class jet fighter pilots in the US are white). Basically, as the title portrays, the film contains a sensual romance going down between Tom Cruise (Maverick) and Kelly McGillis (Charlie), (who by the way is a civilian instructor in a top fighter pilot school in matters of strategy etc, which is kinda weird, cause the post of strategy instructor is usually reserved for majors, captains, colonels etc. as a recognition of their combat records, but enough of that), while Maverick is being trained by her to become a super awesome all powerful ""Rambo of the skies"" jet fighter pilot. We get random talks about his dad being in the Vietnam war and serving as a fighter pilot there and either making a mistake that cost a lot of lives or doing something heroic that saved a lot of lives (I'm not really sure, because it's also top secret stuff for some reason and no one is really allowed to talk about it, we only get hints).The rest of the film is filled with Tom Cruise riding his motorcycle, Tom Cruise having wild sex, Tom Cruise throwing smart lines at everyone who is not Tom Cruise, Tom Cruise smiling at the camera and flirting with anything that has a pair of boobs, Tom Cruise playing bitch-volley and winning and occasionally Tom Cruise piloting his F-14 jet fighter, which is the only good part of the film for two reasons: a) we don't get to see Tom Cruise's smirk because he is wearing a breathing mask/radio and helmet and b) the flying sequences and the final dog fight are actually pretty well done and filled with action, so that the boyfriend will not get bored while his girlfriend is watching her chick flick plot. (That's why this review gets a 2/10 instead of a round 0). Oh wait, actually the flying sequences were not made by the film creators, they were actual footage from Navy and Air Force military exercises and missile tests.(btw, I have nothing against Tom Cruise, he can be a good actor sometimes, but when a film relies solely on an actor's smiling and flirting capabilities, it has to be pointed out)The American patriotism Hollywood feeling is brimming throughout every sequence and apparently the russians and the Americans are at war because the last scene is a giant dog-fight with Russian MiG28s and American F14s blasting each other. Well, I'll say that the action was very decent in that scene, but come on, 2 nuclear super powers are meeting in the weekends for aerial team-deathmatches? Was there a war? If there was, why doesn't anyone really care about it back in the US? Does Russia provide the US with real-living pilots to serve as target practice after the graduation party from the Top Gun School? Does that arrangement work both ways? Anyway, the film was partially produced by the US military (they actually changed the script from Maverick falling in love with a Navy officer, to fall in love with a civilian instructor, because of the military's policy of not allowing personnel to have relationships with each other) and that is why the propaganda is brimming through every plot hole in the movie. It was partially done to show to the American public that the secret Russian aircraft Mig28, which was considered by NATO to be the best jet fighter in the world at the time, was not a big deal and also serves as a recruiting video for the US Navy.The good parts of the film? Well, as I said, it's got awesome action in it (since most of it is real) and there's good attention to detail considering scenery, costumes etc. You might have fun with it if you just relax and go along. Also, the soundtrack is pretty solid. However, most of the people who reviewed this movie is girls. Especially, if they watched it for the first time as teenagers and at a time that Tom Cruise was considered the hottest guy in the business. Nothing against them, but please don't just like a film just because of an actor being hot. That's how we got this Justin Bieber thing in our hands (hehe i made a funny)Apparently, the film is scheduled for a 3D re-release and that's why I am writing this review.

He is also falling in love with his instructor, played by Kelly McGillis.This film is nice and stylish, with some good aircraft training sequences, some good acting performances from Tom Cruise and most supporting roles, a lot of energy, and some fairly average romance.

This movie was my favorite movie for a long time, it is still in my top 3 movies. In fact, this movie was responsible for Tom cruise's stardom. I heard in that year 1986, a lot of guys wanted to be pilots just because of this movie.Top Gun is a story of pilot Pete Mitchell code name Maverick who is regarded dangerous pilot by the navy. Pete's father disappears in 1965 Vietnam war. So, his father was considered reckless pilot by everyone. Maverick knows his father was a great pilot and he didn't screw up. But still there's a stigma attached to his family name. So, Maverick always tries to endeavor very hard when he flies.Top Gun is a film about emotion, passion and most importantly ego of Maverick. Top Gun shows all the flavors of emotions. It shows desperation of Maverick not to be second. Maverick has only one friend Goose. Goose is his family. Nobody likes Maverick, but Goose. Maverick doesn't want to risk Goose's job, by doing some unnecessary stints in the sky, but his desperation and ego to be better than others due what happened to his father, never listens to him.Tom Cruise pulls off performance of his life in this movie. He is well complimented by Kelly Mcgillis (Charley), Val Kilmer (Iceman) and Anthony Edwards (Goose). My fad for Top Gun is such that I had Maverick as my username on my email id for years.

It has been described as the film that defines the 1980's. This doesn't surprise me, as it is cheesy and is covered with 80's music. Much of it is not bad - I like the song 'Danger Zone' and of course, the action scenes were plentiful and very well-shot from different angles, which is really want you want out of this sort of film. Thanks to the action scenes, it does provide decent entertainment. This doesn't make Top Gun a perfect film - far from it. The acting is a mixed bag: Tom Cruise's acting varies between good and bad, depending on the scene. Val Kilmer is good as the icy villain. Unfortunately, in contrast to what the box says, Kelly McGillis does NOT 'sizzle' as the civilian instructor: much of what comes out of her mouth is bulls*** (there is no such thing as a MiG-28) and her romance with Cruise is weak and pointless, feeling completely tacked on. Apparently, there are homosexual overtones and indeed, Top Gun does have a 'macho man' feel to it. In the end, Top Gun, much like Team America (see that review for more) is worth a look for it's technical attributes, in this case, it's very well-shot action cinematography sequences. As a film, it is decent; it does provide entertainment (read: action scenes) but is bogged down by the aforementioned romance and 'macho' feel. If you're a casual moviegoer, it is worth seeing once or twice.I'm giving to round my overall mark from two marks, which will give you a clearer view on my overall thoughts on Top Gun: Technical quality: 5/5 Entertainment quality: 3/5 Overall: 3.5/5 stars (rounded down)",Top Gun

Every scene of real and drill kind of dogfight looks so much real and original that you must appreciate the genius of producer jerry bruckhiemer. I had a desire to be a fighter pilot and after watching this i would definitely like to jump into the cockpit of an F-14 or F-16. In this film i happened to see actor Tom cruise for the 1st time and also guys like Val kilmer and Anthony Edwards. This film also produced one of the most marvelous sound track. At the deck of USS Enterpirse this film delivers more than you could expect. This film is the inspiration why the actor tom cruise developed a passion for flying and own his own private jets and it also motivates others like to develop a passion to soar into the skies.

I enjoyed them.  But after seeing so many of them, we were due for a new type, and here comes ""Top Gun"" at mach 2!Unlike some of the other movies released before Top Gun, this one had the full cooperation of the Department of Defense and the U. S. Navy, and as a result, more realistic military action.Of course the producers and the writers took artistic license, otherwise what we would've gotten was a plotless two hour documentary.  But the writers and producers mixed Hollywood imagination and Naval Aviation real well.I was 14 when ""Top Gun"" came out and was awestruck by it.

189,Lt_Coffey_182,Entertaining no brainer,6,3 November 2005,"Top Gun is a high quality, visually stunning film that does all it can to take your breath away. It is the excellently choreographed dog fights that remain in the mind longer than anything as they are high octane, dazzling bursts of excitement which bring the film to life. However, fighter jet sequences do not make a film and it is the plot where Top Gun has some occasional problems.Parts of the story are overly cheesy and clichéd. The proud to be American theme is dire, repetitive and anyone who dislikes over patriotism in films will despise this. The story line involving Tom Cruise and Tom Skerrit approaches boredom and is the pinnacle of Top Gun's cheese. 'Cheese' is OK, as long as it is not serious and that is where that specific story line falls flat. The fun cheesy parts are some of the films best moments. The volleyball scene is truly a classic and the four actors involved are genuinely enjoying themselves. The relationship between Tom Cruise and Anthony Edwards is also very moving at times and the dynamic they have makes for great viewing.The acting is what saves Top Gun from being Tinsel town garbage. Tom Cruise launched his career with this film. His cocky smile makes him perfect for this role and Cruise does fantastically at portraying a determined, passionate character. It is the emotional scenes where Cruise really sets himself apart from his peers. Cruise provides the few scenes where the audience are made to feel any emotion and he carries out his responsibility creditably. Anthony Edwards as Goose is also effective as the man who takes second spot to Cruise's Maverick. He is instantly popular with the audience with his wit, humour and charm. Val Kilmer and Rick Rossovich are great as the rivals. They play off each other really well and do a fantastic job to personify arrogance. Michael Ironside does what he does best and once again, manages to go through a whole film without smiling.The story between Cruise and Kelly McGillis is very romantic and sensual. The heat between them is conveyed very well on screen and it is this that sets Top Gun above films such as Iron Eagle and Chuck Norris films.Berlin's 'Take My Breath Away' is a song that still gets a good deal of airplay and suits this film to perfection; it's cheesy and its 80s. The music is very effective at setting the mood and complements the feel of the film.Top Gun is a film that achieves its objectives, to entertain. If you're looking for intelligent writing or mass thought provocation, this film isn't for you. Top Gun is best suited to those who desire to switch off their brain and enjoy.",Top Gun

The enemy has no name, MIG-28 is a fictional aircraft, (see Wipipedia) most of the acrobatic maneuvers of planes were, at the time, impossible.Also I do not believe that pilots (US or otherwise) are allowed to place family photos on the cockpits. They would obscure the instrumentation. In the movie they induce a case of ""cowardice"" in the pilot that does this.It was produced by Hollywood, but could have been by the Pentagon.

191,Time Tripper,"Good, yet flawed, fun movie.",6,4 August 2000,"Was ""Top Gun"" an exciting joyride or macho b.s.?  Whether or not you'll like ""Top Gun"" will depend entirely on rather or not you can manage to shut off your brain long enough to stand: (a) an extremely predictable story, (b) a rather idiotic love story, and (c) lots of crappy Ken Loggins/mid-80's music.  The extremely predictable story is actually the easiest of the three flaws to overlook.  Why?  Because we grow to like all the characters in the movie.  Maverick (Tom Cruise) is cool.  Goose (Anthony Edwards) is the best buddy we all wish we had.  Viper (Tom Skerritt) is the tough, yet fair, instructor.  We even like Ice Man (Val Kilmer) by the end of the movie (the character's disdain for Maverick isn't because Ice Man's a jerk, but because he's concerned that Maverick is too unsafe).  The stupid love story is a little harder to swallow.  Kelly McGillis couldn't act her way out of a paper bag.  Supposedly she has a Ph.D. in astrophysics (!), but somehow I doubt it.  There's NO chemistry between the two characters.  They profess to be in love, but the way it's portrayed in the movie, you get they feeling it's just about physical attraction (but, then again, who can blame them). Oh, and yes, the music in this movie sucks.  Even the main non-Loggins score.  Horrible. So what was good about ""Top Gun""?  Well, besides the cool characters (except Charlie), this movie has a lot of exciting flight sequences.  This movie's not boring.  Very, very fun to watch.

192,rtrnt,"Good fun, as long as you check your brain at the door and keep thinking to yourself ""1986""",6,10 August 2020,"I am thirty-four years late to the party in terms of finally seeing this cult classic. Here's what I have to say. It certainly carves out a niche among gung-ho, jingoistic action films of the Reagan era. In that regard, it is a time capsule. It might be many, many years before we see Hollywood revert to this type of genre again with the same unironic spirit of patriotism, especially given the wealth of events that has taken place in the decades that followed (even the Iran contra scandal lay ahead when this film came out).Watching this from a 1986 perspective was probably quite the rush. I would have walked out of the theater amped up, ready to enlist and sign up for my first flight lessons. Watching this film from a more current point of view, you notice several aspects that have aged worse than ""Birth of a Nation"", like the relentlessly dated soundtrack. And there are uncomfortably absurd moments that would make you sweat almost as much as everyone in this film, except Kelly McGillis who does an admirably mature job here with the bubble gum material. But I also think this film's total lack of cynicism suggests a more innocent era, one in which we truly believed in our country without question and in those who were in power. In that regard, this film's optimism and trust are sorely missed in the world we live in now. Recommended for sheer nostalgia.",Top Gun

Directed by Tony Scott (brother of Ridley) who does a really good job in creating a well made movie.After main character Lt. Pete Mitchell or Maverick (Cruise) saves the life of Cougar (John Stockwell) and Merlin (Tim Robbins) he and his flying partner Goose played by Anthony Edwards (who does a really good in the role) are given a chance to go to the US Navy's elite fighter school. Once there the egos are huge and all students are eager to show who the best of the bunch is. After Cruise fails to bed a beautiful lady named Charlotte (Kelly McGillis) he soon learns that she is in fact a teacher at the school he is attending. Makes me recall an old Oil of Olay commercial with Miss Fitzhenry, which was certainly inspired by this film.Film also has a really good soundtrack including 'Danger Zone' by Kenny Loggins and the Oscar-winning song 'Take My Breath Away' by Berlin. If you like 80s music you will enjoy that aspect of the film.I must say though that the romance between McGillis and Cruise though wasn't 100% believable and they didn't seem to have much passion between them. I do compare it to WITNESS that McGillis had done just a year prior and I did find her and Harrison Ford did seem to have more chemistry. Don't let that hold you back though.Has a great supporting cast as well as also starring Val Kilmer as Iceman, Tom Skerritt as Viper, Michael Ironside as Jester and Meg Ryan as Goose's wife Carole (who sadly I feel doesn't get enough screen time).I must say though that after seeing this film if you like a good laugh watch HOT SHOTS as it does a wonderful job in parodying this film.",Top Gun

203,Quackle,"Not for airplane enthusiasts, mind...",7,18 June 2005,"If you are into airplanes, or airplane films in general - I don't think this film is for you. Why? It's drama. OK, it's drama with comedy and glory, but it's still drama. You will find no references/jargon to technicalities of aircraft that are real.As for the film itself, it's art. I can appreciate the film, I'm sure you could too - Acting's pulled off pretty well, perhaps glorifying the United States a bit too much, however.The problem with this film is the fact that in reality, the pilots going up there would be young men risking their life; the fact that in this film, enthusiasm is so high, really cuts away the realism. However, the battle scenes are full of adrenalin, even for the viewer, and the drama is unpredictable.7/10.",Top Gun
204,jack_malvern,Your ego's writing cheques your body can't cash,10,21 September 2005,"Ah, Top Gun, the movie equivalent of the power chord. Although it was never designed to be anything more than an action-packed blockbuster it has gained classic status because it exemplifies everything that is good about the genre.Its brash, might-is-right ethos is as rooted in the 1980s as square-shouldered women and Anita Dobson's hair, but the film still has a timeless feel despite the obvious anachronism that the Cold War has ended.It is remarkable that nearly 20 years after its release it remains the best air-combat flick. Firebirds (aka Wings of the Apache) showed that helicopters weren't as exciting as jets, and Iron Eagle and its increasingly dire sequels were just too silly. Part of me suspects that getting workable footage of military jets is too tall an order for most filmmakers, but I like to believe that would-be directors realise that Top Gun is definitive.Cheesy moments are plentiful, but they work partly because they are justified by the drama and partly because the silly macho scenes are knowingly undermined by being peculiarly homoerotic.Tom Cruise perfected his jaw-wobblingly intense brand of acting for this film and, when needed, delivers a surprisingly subtle performance. I could go on about how well-paced the drama is, but all you really need to know is that the flying scenes are gripping and the music is as exciting as finding the treasure of Sierra Madre down the back of your sofa.I'd also say that Top Gun is one of the most quotable films I've ever seen, although I've seen it so many times that it could just be familiarity. Either way, Top Gun is the most modern classic I can think of.",Top Gun
205,j30bell,Dated US Navy Recruitment Flick,1,20 December 2004,"Made when Ridley Scott still made good films and Tony Scott made, well, Tony Scott films - this one is based on the premise that a rampantly jingoistic aeroplane flick won't need add-on extras like a plot, characterisation or good dialogue.Having dated rather less well than Michael Douglas in Fatal Attraction, Top Gun remains problematic. Well toned, well oiled men wander semi-naked around the set while Jeffrey Kimball's camera lingers with lascivious attention on every protruding pectoral. Men like Goose and Slider sit behind Maverick and Iceman. Was the, presumably bored, scriptwriter having a laugh at the expense of a homophobic US military? I'm an optimist; I like to think so.The ""plot"" centres on a pilot, scarred by the shabby treatment his father received at the hands of the military. Logically he would become an investigative journalist or something; try to clear his old pa's name. But then this is a Tony Scott film, a medium which logic has traditionally given a wide berth. Instead he becomes (surprise) a pilot, and tries to prove the old boy's innocence in a kind of modernist's trial by ordeal. During this quest he loses his tail gunner (ahem, navigator), forms a new and lasting relationship and even experiments briefly with heterosexuality.The dialogue uses a device common to many modern books/films (c.f. Outbreak, John Grisham novels) - the guttural gruntings of the characters being liberally interspersed with technical jargon, thus relieving the writer of anything more challenging than regurgitating a textbook. Happily this also removes any feeling of nagging unease the audience could feel if confronted with long words they might be expected to know.Nice flight sequences though, and rather like Microsoft Word, which has just tried to replace my use of ""less well"" with ""fewer wells"" - Top Gun can be, at times, unintentionally hilarious.",Top Gun

Kelly McGillis was the perfect choice to play the intelligent love interest, Val Kilmer played his best role to date as the rival Ice Man and Tom Skerrit was well chosen to play the warm hearted mentor.It is not usually my cup of tea, but the romance side of it was not as bad as I expected because it for once had a realistic approach.What let the film down for me was the stupid musical numbers, such as ""you've lost that loving feeling"" and ""goodness gracious great balls of fire"". As not only did it make the actors look stupid, but they were also unrealistic, how many times do you see that in real life?

It is too repetitive, with a ton of unnecessary actions and moments done by the movie, feels like a homosexual navy ad, and blows the can off overused songs. Seriously, Danger Zone and Take my Breath Away were used so many times it feels like they're joking with the audience. Another thing the acting. Their poses and facial expressions make me feel like they're going to kiss each other, every time the 18/20 male characters put their faces 1/2 inch away from each other. And the line delivery was so cheesy and over-played, I could have made a cheese factory from the first piece of dialouge. This movie also thinks itself to be Albert Einstein with having its late 80's movie actors repeat again and again complicated aviation terms like they actually knew what they we're talking about. What amazes me, is how the movie put itself in such a homoerotic position, that if it wasn't 2/20 female characters, I would have thought this movie was in the Homosexual area of netflix. I have nothing against homosexuality, only that if the director of this movie knows this movie is over the top-homoerotic, and that the only way to fix that is instead of changing 50% of the script, adding 2 female characters and a love story to its half-assed plot.

218,stephen_thanabalan_fans,Best Pilot and Jets Movie ever!,10,19 September 2005,"Top Gun is a, correction, WAS a trend setting action flick not just because it launched the at the time 'nouveaux' ""action flick"" formula (e.g. yada yada rookie-training-sex interest-emotional drop-loss-fanfare ending) as well as the Scott and Bruckheimer coalition, but purely because of the fact that since 1960s' war movie, Mayday, it has etched itself in as the best fighter jet and pilots movie ever. It still holds this accolade as far as my boyfriend is concerned, and we were only six or seven when we watched it. Even though I can't pretend to be one of those millions of testosterone driven males who idolized Tom Cruise (whose career as leading man/heartthrob/icon/sex symbol in Hollywood was cemented after this film) and wanted to be fly-boy pilots of F14s that wore slick ray-bans and donned black naval patched leather jackets on a race bike (complete with chisel jawed chew down expressions), before signing up to the concept of US military glamor (the oxymoron...). Even though I can't deny this film plied no holds barred propaganda to breed interest in US Defence (aka the recruitment campaigns and the role Hollywood played in stirring up such patriotic pro-Military sentiment - such that Cruise had to cancel this role with his performance in a certain Oliver Stone film 4 years later...), nonetheless, in my opinion, even after watching it nearly 20 years on, the film still oozes X-factor sharp crispness.This kind of factor only comes from a well edited, well oiled, and well directed and generally superbly well assembled film which till today always has to have either a), a charismatically attractive cast (check- look at all the future big names like Meg Ryan, Val Kilmer and Tim Robbins who had a cameo through this film albeit the Kelly McGillis tragedy), b) powerhouse effects ahead of its time (check), or most importantly, c), that something unique. In this movie's case, that something unique that could stand as its competitive advantage (thereby also spinning a million 1980s to early 90s copycats from 'Iron Eagle' to TV Series' like 'Super Carrier') came from the Cinematography of flight sequences. R.A Rondell's stunts are amazing while the input by the actual real life pilots (all attributed accordingly in the credits) is invaluably reflected in the film somehow, and this lends it an air of class above its ensuing counterfeits. Furthermore, the film, albeit not infallible with plot holes and factual errors (e.g. non literal 'turning in of wings' by John Stockwell's Cougar character; F5 jets being touted off as MIGs), is nonetheless a great milestone in action cinematography and one of the pioneering formulaic action films that defined the genre (or perhaps even engendered one) for the 1980s onwards and set some real stylistics for the ensuing decades.",Top Gun
219,alfCycle,Painfully cheesy macho machismo mixed with corny romance,4,24 May 2017,"Man, this movie is painfully cheesy and lame. Over the top macho machismo mixed with godawful corny romance. The worst of both worlds! I'm all for cheesy 80's movies. I love Roadhouse for it's over the top ridiculousness, but Top Gun is just painful to watch at times. This movie is clearly aimed at immature teenagers of the 80's. Since I was an immature teenager of the 90's, I can't really relate to this movie. I'm sure people that were 80's teens probably have a nostalgic tie to this movie, much like I have to some 90's movies. However, judging this purely as a film, I'd have to say Top Gun is not something I would recommend to anyone looking for a quality movie to watch.

While some of the flying stunts are not believable and the dogfights rarely take place like shown, it is still the best picture ever made about the most dangerous, yet most romanticized professions of all times; fighter flying.

222,SilentJerry,Boring military garbage.,2,30 September 2006,"I'd recommend this movie only if you're gonna spend time listening to the audio commentary from the actual Navy pilots and technical advisers. Those guys have some very interesting things to say about the military and aviation. I wish there was just a commentary by them. I'm not a big fan of the US military, especially the stuff that's going on in the middle east right now, but on the DVD, they're the only ones with interesting stuff to say.It's a damn shame though, that we're stuck watching this boring, pointless and completely routine action movie. So at the beginning of the movie Maverick (Tom Cruise) and Goose (that guy from ER) are sent to the Top Gun flight school and are taught to be even better pilots than they are already. While there, Maverick seems to spend large amounts of time trying to bed a civilian employee (Kelly McGillis) and badly singing Righteous Brothers and Jerry Lee Lewis songs. Learning to be better pilots requires spending time looking hunky in towels/white underwear and playing shirtless Volleyball, One day, Maverick is up flying around (like in most of the movie) when suddenly there's a big problem and Goose is killed. Of course he spends a huge chunk of movie time feeling bad and thinking of quitting and all that.Then suddenly they graduate from Top Gun school and the writer decided that now it's time for a war. So suddenly Maverick has to ""grow-up"" and fight the bad guys, save some good guys, hang out with Val Kilmer and just plain save the day. He comes back to the aircraft carrier and is told that his stupid name is on the front page of every English language paper in the world and he's now all happy again. He goes back to become an instructor and meets up with Kelly McGillis so that he can jam his tongue down her throat again, probably because she lost that loving feeling.I'd say that in this move Tom Cruise solidifies the kind of role that will define his career. In almost every single Tom Cruise movie, he starts out as a young cocky guy who thinks he knows everything and is completely full of himself. In almost every case, he'll keep on being cocky until about 3/4 of the way through the movie either a friend dies or he become paralyzed or he finds out that the girl he nailed in the bahamas is pregnant, etc. Then he'll become mature and he'll prove himself to the rest of the world, or at least the people watching it. After a while, one Tom Cruise movie is just like another. Eventually Tom Cruise should find another role because after 20+ years, it's getting old.The movie itself is a blatant propaganda piece, meant to entice young men to join the military and young women to find shirtless guys playing volleyball. Much like Saving Private Ryan or Pearl Harbor, it's meant to get you all proud about the US military and maybe have you play some Born in the USA while raising the flag in your front yard. It's a feel good movie that ignores more serious problems of bad foreign policy and over spending on the military.

And later I played the video game Tom Clancy's H.A.W.X, and it kinda feel like a later modern version of Top Gun. Plus, I find the opening background music loop, ""Ready Aurora"", seriously suitable for the opening sequence of Top Gun, from Paramount logo to debrief back on the Carrier. Honest Trailer fired on the fact that they used Kenny Loggins' Danger Zone three times... well, figure they'll have one less spot to hit if they dubbed the first part with looping Ready Aurora. Too bad Tom Salsa didn't compose that for Top Gun in 1986, that would have been epic. I tried that, by the way, and it was good. The story was great as well, even though the closing scene would look really better with a kiss.

Everything in this movie is just so cool and awesome: the characters, the story, the stunts, the dialogues...everything. (Though I would admit the dialogues are slightly over the top in some places, but then again, you don't have those memorable quotes for nothing.)Pete ""Maverick"" Mitchell(Tom Cruise) is one of the best fighter pilots in the navy, and aspires to be the Top Gun. Often performing dangerous stunts, almost nothing in the world can affect the undaunted and reckless lad. What I absolutely loved about Maverick is his attitude. Whether it be daredevil flying, trying to impress a girl by singing, quoting cheesy dialogues,riding a motorcycle, playing volleyball,being unruffled by rivals, or showing loyalty towards his friends. He shines throughout. Goose(Anthony Edwards) shows true faithfulness till the end. And that is a rare thing to see. Iceman(Val Kilmer) and Slider(Rick Rossovich) just elevate the movie by being the perfect rivals. And nonetheless, the unforgettable chemistry between Charlie(Kelly McGilles) and Maverick.It has some astounding fighter pilot combat stunts with some stunning visuals.

Muscular, toned guys, check.Story-wise though, there were a few moments-not going to spoil anything-that are supposedly important to Pete Mitchell, but it's not worked in sensitively and deeply such that the audience can also empathize with. In fact, this movie perplexed my parents (aged 49-54 years old) at times; if they didn't catch a single line about something, they wouldn't understand a character's motivation.Okay, you might say, chill out it ain't that deep. But there was also a scene that lacked explanation (one character's only piece of dialogue near the end of movie). In addition to that, the movie felt kind of predictable. The main plot developments in the movie were nothing exciting and new. Honestly, it felt like checking off boxes.I watched this movie, because the rest of my family had only seen Tom Cruise in Mission Impossible movies (known to us as mostly action, less varied acting), but I did enjoy Risky Business, so I had hoped to see another dimension of Tom Cruise here.This quote from critic Roger Egert sums it up best: ""Movies like Top Gun are hard to review because the good parts are so good and the bad parts are so relentless.

Top Gun is an action film / Romance story. Although he has fallen in love, he still has his duties and wants to become the best of the best, a 'Top Gun' pilot. The flying sequences are great, and the real jets that are used make it more realistic-no poor CGI is used like today. And even for the tougher scenes to film, models were used to create the ultra-realistic effects. When watched, this can become very much a feel good film. Its not complicated, and its got laughs too, combined with some sad moments and gripping jet fight scenes. The music is also great-Berlin's 'Take my breath away' is very good, and so is 'Dangerzone'.

Well I sure agree with both of them. It is dumb. Really dumb. I mean like, it's hilariously bad. But that's also what makes this movie ""cool"" per se. But the said ""cool"" only appeals to a very specific audience nowadays. Chances are if you grew up watching late 90s and pretty much all movies after 2000, you'll find Top Gun an all out cringe-fest. But that's just the average viewer. For a bit older audience and for people who grew up with 80s movies, I can see this being a very entertaining watch for them. I mean how else this movie gained a cult status over the years?That said, when reviewing the movie itself you can pretty much sum it all up calling it a ""high budget commercial"". Well a good one at that. It's not a good movie. It's just a good looking movie. There are not many movies in this category out there so competition-wise, Top Gun easily takes the cake. So obviously a lot of people are going to like it. It's like the same situation with the Fast and Furious movies. Little to no competition, great timing and most importantly giving the people what they want. This is the perfect recipe for a cult favourite movie no matter how good or bad the movie's going to be.However Top Gun is not a complete waste of time either. It can keep you entertained. I myself only thought of watching this because of the love I have for aircrafts and that's most likely going to be the reason you're going to watch too. See what I mean about having no competition? That's Top Gun. There's nothing to learn from it. Nothing to look up to nor no deep moral lessons to decipher. You just watch it on a Sunday night and enjoy it. Next morning you probably won't even remember watching it.",Top Gun
236,Radi_on_off,Typical old action movie,6,15 August 2021,"Worse than Tom Cruise's acting, only incredibly strange musical accompaniment.",Top Gun
237,glassorange,Easily one of the worst films I've ever seen.,1,29 January 2002,"""Top Gun"" is simply one of the dumbest stories ever submitted to film. The movie lacks each and every characteristic of real entertainment that I can think of.  The characters are unimaginably dull and dim-witted, the story is typical war movie crap played as a backdrop to a bunch of typical romantic crap, and the dialogue is sub-human.  Tom Cruise and Kelly McGillis have about as much romantic chemistry on screen as Jay and Silent Bob.  None of the actors act the way real people act or talk the way real people talk.The one thing that really killed me about ""Top Gun"" was the fact that the capabilities of its actors were so underestimated by director Tony Scott. Tom Cruise has easily proven himself to be one of the great American Actors of modern times, starring in ""Born on the Fourth of July,"" ""Jerry Maguire,"" and ""Magnolia,"" for which he was awarded the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor.  Meg Ryan has proven herself in ""Sleepless in Seattle"" and ""When Harry Met Sally. . .,"" one of the best romantic comedies ever made.  Val Kilmer didn't even want to do this movie, and who could blame him?  He's done much better work in films like ""Heat,"" ""True Romance,"" and ""Tombstone,"" in which he played an untouchable Doc Holliday.  These are good actors trapped in a horrid film.  This is typical, however, of producer Jerry Bruckheimer, who brought us other cinematic duds such as ""Pearl Harbor"" and ""Armageddon.""",Top Gun
238,critony,nice movie,9,28 December 2019,As an 80's teeneger i enjoyed watching this movie and remember me my wonderfull youth,Top Gun
239,sweetlittlepie,"Incredibly cheesy, but still great 80's fun",7,24 April 2009,"They just don't make films like they did in the 80's. The hairdos, the attitudes, the cheesiness, the realism...I love Top Gun despite the fact that the movie is outdated for todays fast paced CGI loving audiences, the plot is a little too simple for my liking, some of the acting is over the top and stereotypical *cough* Tom Cruise and Kelly McGillis *cough*.But I still love it because it represents it's decade so well. From the very beginning, the music, the yellow lit back round, the aircrafts being maneuvered around the hanger (I'm a chick so I'm not sure if that's what it's called, but whatever). It screams 80's, and that's why it's so good. It's one of those staple films of it's decade along with other classics like Risky Business(which also starts Tom Cruise), Beverly Hills Cop, Die Hard, Lethal Weapon and other great flicks.But the cheese ain't the only other fault in this movie. Though I'm a big fan of Top Gun the movie does have it's flaws. One, too cliché...From beginning to the end the film is filled with stereotypical clichés maybe that's what makes it so cheesy. Another flaw too much music...Again the film is just jam packed with classic 80's tracks which gets a bit annoying after awhile. The third flaw no chemistry between McGillis and Cruise. Every time I watched Kelly McGillis trying to woo Tom Criuse I cringed. I found these scenes to be boring and a waste of good time. Fourth flaw, the movie drags on in a few scenes. Apart from a few flaws the movie is a great popcorn flick and a lot fun. It should be regarded for what it is a true classic and one of Tom Cruise's best films to date.Another I have to point out is the fact that the film is subconsciously homoerotic. I know you have all heard this before but it's the truth. Of course this little known fact was made known to the otherwise ignorant masses by none other than Quentin Tarantino in the 90's flick Sleep With Me, and after you watch his famous monologue in that movie you have to admit it does make a lot of sense. As watching the movie recently on TV, and I decided to rent for further inspection. The scenes with Val Kilmer and Tom Cruise are filled with sexual tension most of all the ""dangerous"" scene. Awkward...Also what the hell was that volleyball scene about anyway. It seemed to make no sense what so ever. But at the end of the day, the cheesiness, the over-the-top acting, the homoerotic subtext, the stereotypical and almost forced in love story make it the great film that it is. Actually I think it's the flaws that make this film so much fun to watch and so enjoyable. Also the incredible fighter-jets sequences are amazing. The fact that this movie was done before CGI became the big thing in Hollywood makes it so real because you know those aircrafts are real. The danger those stunt men where in when flying those fighter-squadrons is real. You can't fake stuff like that.The realism of the action sequences is I think a reason why the film remains so popular today. Another thing about this movie is that it introduced us to a lot of actors that weren't that well known back them like Michael Ironside (from earlier Scanners' fame), Anthony Edwards, who went on to do ER, Meg Ryan, Val Kilmer and of course how can we forget Tim Robbins' infamous cameo, he's literally on the screen for like five minutes or less on only two scenes in that entire movie.Not only did it make these no name actors house hold names, but it also made it's two main stars leading 80's stars. Kelly McGillis most well known role before Top Gun was that of Rachel Lapp in Witness opposite Harrison Ford, but this was the movie that made her a leading lady. She would go on to start in other 80's flicks like Made in Heaven and The Accused. And then there's Tom Cruise who rose to the limelight with another 80's classic Risky Business, but this is the film that propelled him to real stardom and made him a huge box office attraction. After this he went off to start in other classics like The Color of Money, Rain Man, Days of Thunder, A Few Good Men, Interview with a Vampire, Mission Impossible, Jerry Maguire, and Magnolia just to name a few.I must say that recently when I was watching this movie and Goose dies I actually began to tear up right when Maverick (Tom Cruise) is holding his body in the middle of the ocean and when he goes to Goose's house to pick some of his personal items from the navy and he shuts the door just before he sees Meg Ryan's character and starts to cry. I thought that apart from his typical badass performance throughout the whole film this scene in particular is some of Cruise's best acting to date. Say what you will about the guy, but he can act, and if you doubt his acting ability even after seeing that scene watch A Few Good Men, Magnolia, Interview with a Vampire and Collateral, I personally think those are his best performances.Overrall this is a great movie for people who love 80's flicks. It's also a movie that makes you smile, laugh and possibly cry as well. If you haven't seen it then watch it. Trust me is better than some of the garbage we are forced to watch these days.",Top Gun
240,BobStage,A movie for the ego,6,28 January 2008,"War. Pride. Speed. Tom Cruise. Enough said. This is a movie either for girls that love Val Kilmer and Tom Cruise, or it is for guys that love action over a storyline.Tom Cruise plays Maverick, the fastest and most daring pilot in the Navy. He is selected to go to the Top Gun Academy, where the best of the best are trained, to graduate. Coming with him is his trusty sidekick Goose, a likable family man who loves flying.At the Academy, Maverick meets Viper, one of the training coaches that motivates him throughout the film, Charlie, a cute girl to catch his eye, and Iceman, the rival pilot who is both friend and foe at the same time. The story focuses around Cruise as he goes through the Top Gun Academy.The storyline is not as strong as one would think. The makers of this film replaced it with scenes of intense flying, volleyball scenes between Kilmer and Cruise, or scenes of romance between Charlie and Maverick. While the airplane sequences are good, I look for more than just that in a movie.The acting from Tom Cruise is all smiles or pouty frowns. It is Val that provides the talented acting, and he of all people did not even want to be in this film. He was forced to go along with it, and it didn't hurt him, but he is a much more talented actor than Cruise.I will say this; the music was great. Kenny Loggins made a classic with ""Danger Zone"". Should have got an Oscar nomination to be honest with you, it's a great song to listen to. It helped create the scenes well.There were scenes that make me hesitate to criticize it, but there are also the disappointments of this film. It's a Tom Cruise film, one where he can be loved, supported, and admired by his legion of fans. Despite its box office, it does not match with his better quality films like ""Eyes Wide Shut"" and ""Born on the Fourth of July"". These films make him famous as a serious actor, while this film is food for his ego and image on screen.In truth, the film isn't that bad, but there are so many better choices than this film.",Top Gun

242,Cathz,Not the bomb I expected,7,22 February 2002,"For a few years now I have kept telling myself I'll have to watch 'Top Gun' sometime.  That is, until today, when I finally found a couple of hours to waste.  To be honest, this film really didn't work for me - by no means is it bad, just an average popcorn action movie with many obvious flaws.  My reason for seeing it in the first place was, quite simply, Val Kilmer, so you can imagine how disappointed I was to find his part cut down to a minimum.Tom Cruise is the all-American, perfect-teeth good guy who wants to prove himself.  Val Kilmer is the cocky, sometimes arrogant, win-all-the-medals bad guy (for most of the movie at least).  I may be biassed of course, but I found Kilmer's character, as the unflinching ""Ice Man"" to be much more interesting than Cruise's ""Maverick"", who for much of the film raced about on a motorbike or smiled as cheesily as possible in Kelly McGillis' direction.  The love scenes were, for me, tedious to say the least.  I would have given the film a much higher rating if only the unnecessary and shallow romance was edited out.  I have a great deal of respect for Kelly McGillis in other films, such as the brilliant 'Witness', but every time she appeared in this I loathed the sight of her.The dogfight scenes towards the end, and other flying scenes throughout, were one of the few positive aspects for me.  I may be mistaken, but I do think it was an attempt to re-enact the climactic end to 'Star Wars', when Luke Skywalker and the rebels set up their assault on the Death Star.  Only here, I found it a major annoyance to my viewing that I could not at all tell who was flying which plane.  Once I'd figured out the colours of Cruise and Kilmer's helmets, the film was over and it was time for the corniest ending I have ever seen.I suppose if you have ever flown a jet, or take a great interest in flying schools and such like, you may find some merit in this movie.  If you want some cheap entertainment and don't mind sitting through some very amateurish humour and bad dialogue along the way, then you might as well give it a go. It's the type of film everyone should see just once - after all, everyone's heard of ""Top Gun"" so it's good to satisfy your curiosity.
I found it ironic that at the end of the day, Val Kilmer was the real Top Gun.  Tom Cruise was simply a flashy fly-boy.  It could have been excellent with two such leading actors.  But for me, the only real highlight was seeing Val Kilmer emerge from the shower with only a towel on... That and the topless volleyball are, I think, all I got out of it.  Tom Cruise fans, see 'Mission:Impossible' instead.  Kilmer fans, go rent 'Tombstone'. McGillis fans, watch 'Witness'.  That's just my advice anyway.6/10.",Top Gun

245,max_tony,Twenty Years On....,6,1 October 2008,"1986's ""Top Gun"" had a lot going for it: a first rate production staff featuring the action partnership of Don Simpson and Jerry Bruckheimer, direction by Tony Scott, and lead acting by a young Tom Cruise and a still youthful Kelly McGillis, backed by a solid supporting cast that included Val Kilmer, Anthony Edwards, Tom Skerrit, Michael Ironside and, in cameos, Meg Ryan and Tim Robbins. Couple this horsepower with a superb popular music score, lots of action sequences featuring the Navy's hot F-14 fighter aircraft, and hijinks and angst among young naval aviators, and you have a great action movie that spent months in the theaters. The storyline centers around Navy LT Pete ""Maverick"" Mitchell (Tom Cruise), a brash, immature, but gifted flier. In a close encounter with enemy Migs over the Persian Gulf, Maverick saves his wingman and earns a slot at the prestigious Fighter Weapons School for himself and his backseater, ""Goose"" (played with everyman humility by Anthony Edwards). At the school, Maverick quickly develops a rivalry with his chief competitor, Iceman (played with suitable demeanor by Val Kilmer) and a romance with one of his instructors, ""Charlie"" (Kelly McGillis). However, Maverick's willingness to push the flying envelope gets him and Goose into an horrific flying accident. The accident robs Maverick of his self-confidence and threatens to take him out of the cockpit altogether. Some gentle mentoring by one of his flight instructors (Tom Skerrit) gets Maverick back out to his carrier, right in the middle of an confrontation with the bad guys. In a vicious aerial dogfight involving an outnumbered Maverick and Iceman, Maverick must finally grow up and become a team player. An absolutely terrific music score and action sequences involving dog-fighting F-14's and ""Red team"" aircraft (cutting edge at the time) tend to mask a sometimes incoherent script. The romance between Maverick and Charlie gets worked in around the flying sequences, as does a rather obscure sub-plot involving Maverick's MIA father. The jumpy editing causes supporting cast to sometimes wander in and out of scenes without real introduction or explanation. Minor flaws aside, ""Top Gun"" continues to hold up well as a highly enjoyable action movie twenty years on.",Top Gun
246,iloveUGA123,This movie was really good!! And Tom Cruise was so HOT!!,8,28 January 2012,"This movie was surprisingly good, and I thought that it was a really good movie about Top Gun. There really is a Top Gun, and it is the best of the best, and this movie really showed the viewers that it was! I liked how there was a little bit of romance included in the movie because it made it a little bit better. Tom Cruise was the HOTTEST in this movie!!! Today he is still good looking for his age, but in this movie, there are no words to describe him!! The movie was really good, but the one thing that made it amazing was him in it!! In this movie, to me, he is hotter than Shia LaBoeuf and Alex Pettyfer (they are still really hot)! Even though he made the movie even better, overall the movie its self I would give and 8 out of 10 with or without him in it.

Great flight scenes without CGI, great actors. I have seen it probably more than 50 times, starting at the movies when I was based in Germany in the 1980s, then VHS, laser disc, DVD and Blue Ray Dolby Digital. I never get tired of it.But the script bothers me as I get older. Maverick loses his comrade in an accident, and then has a major confidence problem to carry on with his job. Won't fight. Now translate this back to the 1940s to the Battle Of Britain. All the guys who are now in their 80s and 90s, flying Spitfires defending Britain against the Luftwaffe, lost a friend EVERY DAY, somebody who they knew and had downed a few beers with. Every single day, they returned to base and found out that this and that guy did not make it back. Yet, they found the resolve to GO ON, CARRY ON FIGHTING.

Very few from the 80's generation don't get their heart racing when they hear about the ""danger zone"".

These guys are just like military guys I met when I was young; dedicated to their profession, but always ready for a thrill.

However watching it when I finally got the DVD off here today was an unfortunate anti-climax.The flight scenes were the best bit and the romance and soundtrack were OK, but the plot and characterisation didn't cut it as well as I hoped it would. It seems so weak and badly written in that respect, as I watch it, unable to really grasp the lead of the film as I do with a good one. Perhaps it just has to be seen as a light movie that satisfies different interests and tastes rather than anything too deep and in that respect it has aged well as a classic action/love/war thriller.

I must have seen it a dozen times. It gets the adrenalin going, I know every line, every cliché, and I look forward to hearing and seeing them all over again.

The acting is one of the reasons: Tom Cruise hits the spot perfectly, the chemistry with Kelly McGillis is electric (and surely she has never looked more stunning!), the heart warms to Anthony Edwards and Meg Ryan, while Val Kilmer, Tom Skerritt, Michael Ironside and the others do just what they're good at without ever distracting from the central characters.And Tony Scott's direction is surely much underestimated: with perhaps the sole exception of that love scene (presumably just a vehicle for the backing track ""You Take My Breatb Away""), the action is tight, superbly cut, and the action sequences unequalled of their kind. He surely made a star of Tom Cruise, bringing the best out of him after a number of merely promising earlier performances (a feat he sadly failed to repeat 4 years later with ""Days of Thunder"").I watched ""Top Gun"" again tonight, over a quarter of a century after its release, in memory of that great British director who has just been so tragically lost to us.

269,rthibes,Playing with the boys,9,6 February 2004,"Top Gun had never been considered a good film, but with the years passing by it has become a kind of cult movie. It's quite impressive: the screenplay is filled with cliches, the actors are bad, the visual and the songs are the most memorable parts of the whole movie. So, why so many people still like it?Maybe, because it is the first major movie with the star Tom Cruise. Maybe, because it has marked its place in childhood memories of a whole generation. Maybe, because it has memorable quotes that people like to repeat, like the classic ""talk to me Goose"" or ""she's lost that loving feeling"". Or maybe it's just because the great songs remains in our memories after all these years, like ""Take my breath away"" or ""You've lost that loving feeling"".I don't know the exactly answer, but I guess it's because it all. ""Top Gun"" is a pop movie and, rather you like it or not, has its place in the history of the 80's movies. Remember ""Meet the Parents"", with Ben Stiller playing volley with his fiancee and calling each other the Top Gun nicknames, and you will know what I'm talking about.",Top Gun

I cannot believe I have actually seen guys walking around with a ""Top Gun"" patch from this movie on their jackets-usually blue jean jackets.Except for the opening shots of carrier operations and some of the flying sequences the story was pure grade school; full of trite one-liners (if I tell ya, I'll have ta kill ya). And I hate it when the producers always use a well known Western a/c in an attempt at DACT. The F-20s painted black just did not cut it as MiGs.the 1 V 4 ending was quite cheesy as well.

Maverick and his friend goose are sent for training in TOP GUN where the best of the best pilots come out and are ready for real action in wars. Maverick is not an ordinary pilot, he doesn't follow rules but has some skills which makes him noticeable by instructors. The movie goes normal till his friend dies during training and maverick feels responsible for it and wants to quit.But in the end he joins the team and gets into real action.Tom cruise gives the right performance for the role. The main drawback for the movie is that the story is predictable. The first half feels normal and nothing is special in it. In the second half, aircraft fights and action keep audience alive. Apart from the story, screenplay is simple and good. Overall the movie keeps you both bored with a simple story line and also gives some nail biting action sequences for action lovers.",Top Gun
272,Samtheshrikker,A true 80s classic...,8,4 August 2014,"Top Gun is pure quality for many reasons, be it the hard hitting ballad soundtrack, the magnificent camera work or the great pace of the film. Many fans of aviation and aspiring pilots were made purely through watching this classic as children, and after you've watched it, it's easy to see why...Tom Cruise stars as Maverick, with his youth and charm flawlessly suiting the hotshot protagonist of the film. Cruise strikes the perfect balance in presenting Maverick as a pilot who lives life on the edge, but isn't totally out of control. Kelly McGillis does a good job too, yet her lack of any truly memorable scenes gives her the appearance of being in Cruise's shadow somewhat. The movie's pace is poised well, with quieter, slower scenes slotting in between the more intense action sequences. This neatly brings us onto the camera work, which is simply out of this world. The F14s are shot in splendid aerial sequences where they perform all manner of crazy manoeuvres and stunts in summery locations. The scenes involving Maverick's bike in particular seem to evoke the strong sense of youth found throughout the film. The soundtrack is marvellous and remains famous to this day, with vintage classics by artists such as The Righteous Brothers intermixed with 80s rock ballads and quieter melodies for the more sombre scenes. Unlike many modern action films, Tony Scott gives Maverick genuine obstacles and tribulations to overcome, which invokes a much greater sense of fulfilment and maturity by the picture's conclusion. Top Gun has inspired future pilots all around the world and continues to do so. It's a film of passion, energy and youth, but also of learning and coming of age. Those born after the film's era may find themselves wishing they'd been alive through it, as not many films capture the vibrancy of the 80s, or the excitement of being a pilot, like Top Gun does.",Top Gun

I have absolutely zero interest in fighter jets so the movie really kept my attention with the story line, pacing, acting, script, great music. Tom Cruise was amazingly handsome in this film. Val Kilmer as well. In fact, all of the stars of the film are surprisingly gorgeous on screen. The only thing I disliked is that it is basically propaganda for the military. I can't even imagine how many young men watched this movie as young boys and dreamed of becoming fighter pilots (a dream many boys share, apparently, but very hard to do. I was horrified at the very thought of trying to fly over obstacles (mountains in Nevada in the film) while trying to evade another aircraft, all while being subjected to extreme G force at over 800 miles an hour) so I must say this film did increase my respect of the men (and a couple of women) who are able to accomplish this feat.

277,vmoreno2007,air high thriller,10,4 February 2010,"One of my favorite movies. It was big hit back in the 80s, I loved it then, I love it now. I love Tom Cruise because of this movie, what teenage girl didn't back then. It's a story about the ultimate pilots with a mission to defend and kill. Maverick has the ghost of his dad's air fighting past on his shoulder as he wears his heart on his air-fighting sleeve. His flying is erratic, dangerous and genius. It is filled with the usual high testosterone filled airmen enter Val Kilmer, the handsome arch rival. There is the inevitable conflicted romance between pilot and beautiful blonde air instructor featuring the unforgettable, romantic hit sleeper Take My Breath Away and the much remembered scene when he first serenades her in the bar with You've Lost That Loving Feeling. Maverick dazzles with his air fighting skills and genius but because of his troubled past he remains number two. There is the predictable loss of life when his wingman Goose dies during practice in jet wash causing Maverck to doubt his confidence and unnaturally skilled air fighting talent. He finds our from his superior that his father died a hero and he has nothing to be ashamed of. The last fighting scene shows Tom Cruise kicking butt in the air as he saves Val Kilmer, showing incredible skill at dogfighting. He proceeds to show daring maneuvers untested by pilots which in the end saves the day. He reunites with Kelly McGillis in the end. Tom Cruise plays the cocky arrogant Maverick with all the charm oozing out of every pore. This movie appeals to men because of the air fight scenes and to women because of the hot romance. An all time favorite that will stand the test of time. There is one famous line, Val Kilmer says to Cruise you can be my wingman anytime, while Cruise cockily grins and says bulls--t, you can be mine, and the crowd cheers.",Top Gun

You may think I'm exaggerating here, but in my opinion this is one of the most overrated piles of garbage ever filmed. This film has one saving grace- the plane sequences. Honestly, buy a DVD player, a big screen TV, some really nice surround sound and then skip all the scenes featuring any attempts at plot, because in all honesty they don't try very hard. The acting is just bad. Wooden, and without any emotion whatsoever. There is absolutely no chemistry in the romance, and the plot is, in short, rubbish.

And from my perspective, Top Gun is an average popcorn flick. The plot is as cheesy as any movie. After you watch the movie for a while, the story will fade but something else will stick with you. That thing is what forced me to give this movie a 9/10. What is that thing? Well, the feel of the movie, the mode. The 80s fresh air. And the beautiful soundtrack. These things overcome all the flaws in this all-flawed movie. This is the weirdest review I have ever wrote, but it's true. You will like and detest this movie at the same time. The question is: what feeling will you choose? To conclude, this is a really terrible movie but one of my favorites. Give it a chance (on a big screen) and you won't be disappointed or will you?",Top Gun
280,paulappleyard17,"Superb visuals, superb music, cheese ridden dialogue, classic movie.",10,4 November 2017,"I am giving Top Gun a full 10/10, partly to try and boost its overall rating (6.2 at the time of writing) which is far too low IMO.Far too many people rip on this movie for its lack of accuracy, its shallow characters and cheesy dialogue.However, whilst this is all true, the overall movie is incredibly well paced, acted, scripted and directed. It is a masterpiece of action movie making, and Tony Scott made a number of high quality movies.The positives that stand out for me, that far outweigh the negatives:1) The superb cinematography and action sequences. Some of the shots of F-14s launching and landing on the carrier at sunset are the best you will ever see in any military movie. The dog fighting scenes are incredible, and no CGI. To shoot in the F-14 cockpits Scott used the Super-35 35mm format to get widescreen cameras in the tight spaces without anamorphic lenses. As the movie was made with the Navy's blessing, full access to military assets and aid was provided, including the F-5s playing the role of Migs.All the pedants who rip on this movie for lack of accuracy should just chill, and enjoy the stunning photography of F-14s lighting up their after-burners on take-off. The cinematography throughout the whole movie is gorgeous. Just make sure you watch it on Blu-Ray!2) Incredible pacing and direction. Whilst the story is 1D and comic book simple, the movie is a master class of direction. Tony Scott's finest movie IMO. The movement between action, fun, romance, depression, elation is just perfectly done for a feel good action movie. There is not a single scene, or second of the movie, that is out of place. IMO the direction is as good as any of the classics from Coppola, Scorcesse, Spielberg, R Scott etc.3) Music. Harold Faltemeyer's soundtrack is brilliant. His Top Gun theme duet with Steve Stevens on guitar just superb. Songs such as Danger Zone, Mighty Wings, and Take My Breath Away have become iconic as part of this film.4) Acting. The actors don't really have much to work with, but ooze screen charisma. The sexual tension between Cruise and McGillis is palpable. The supporting cast are superb, Skerrit, Kilmer, Edwards, Ironside etc. put in great performances.5) Cheesy Dialogue. The worst thing about the movie, is also one of the the best things about this movie! Who hasn't felt the 'need for speed'?I am a fan of military jets, but not for one moment did I think Top Gun was supposed to be a documentary of Navy aviation. Judge it on what it's supposed to be, a feel good action movie with some basis in reality.Climb into the cockpit with Maverick and Goose and enjoy the ride....!",Top Gun

To watch the main star of the picture, beautiful Grumman F-14A Tomcat is just worth repeating it at last once a week!! By the way this movie created the fad of building miniature plastic scale models of the Tomcat. Several manufacturers like Monogram and Revell started selling kits like hot cakes and they couldn't keep up with demand. Card models were also offered. The Tomcat became an overnight movie star!!!

Hollywood veterans Michael Ironside and Tom Skeritt also star as instructors at the Top Gun academy - and also the guy who played the Headmaster in Back to the Future, he one who called McFly a slacker, he's there too. So its a good cast all round, but Val Kilmer steals the show as Iceman with his wooden acting... Another plus point is the use of the word ""Johnson"" instead of penis, to add a bit of comedy as well. Its a shame there wasn't more dog fighting in the movie, if Cruise didn't spend so much time fooling around with his lady friend it would have been better.

286,TimG-2,How silly can a movie be?,2,26 March 2001,"It took almost fifteen years until I watched Top Gun for the first time. I clearly remember that this movie was very popular when it ran in the German theatres in 1987 and I heard a lot about this mixture of action, adventure and romance. I never expected Top Gun to be a masterpiece. However, I always thought that I had missed something, not having seen it. But when I actually watched this movie one week ago it occured to me that I was wrong. Action and adventure? A bunch of guys that want to be heros doing nothing but cracking stupid jokes and flying around in jets all the time, finally fighting (and of course winning) against a nameless enemy (i.e. the Soviet Union). No thrill at all. No explanation of the Cold War background at all. Dialogues as silly as can be, leaving me helpless whether to laugh or cry. Romance? Tom Cruise and Kelly McGillis in something that is meant to be a love story but fails to convey the slightest touch of romance. Acting? Cruise and Kilmer in their ridiculous ""Who gets to perform the broadest grin/the ugliest sneer?""-competition. The single funny aspect is the music score, a synthesizer sound emerging from the deepest depths of the 1980s, this very strange decade.Let's face it: Top Gun is nothing but a commercial for the US Navy (just think of the jets starting from and landing on the carrier in the warm, red light of sunrise or sunset) and a perfect example of the hyper-patriotism of the Reagan era. The movie depicts some sort of unreflected militarism that is not my cup of tea.Only in terms of technique (cinematography, editing ) this work is quite all right. So Top Gun isn't exactly one of the worst but surely one of the silliest movies I have ever seen: 2 out of 10 - period.",Top Gun

290,chrisq28,Non-stop Action and Homoeroticism,4,18 March 2005,"I hated ""Top Gun"" before I even watched it. That doesn't sound very fair, but it's true. I hate the way that people reference it, I hate the way it's become a cult favorite among people who aren't smart or interesting. And with only a few exceptions, I hate the work of Jerry Bruckheimer (who produced this movie).Now, to be fair, I know a lot of those stupid and uninteresting people enjoy the movie ironically. But even when looking at it that way, I couldn't help but find it more annoying than silly. I mean, it's not Journey's ""Separate Ways"" video or anything.Where to begin? Should I start with the egregious and unnecessary homosexual undertones? The awkward dialogue? The intense love story that seems to appear as if from nowhere? The stereotypical and flat characters? The bad attempts at theme? The enormous plot holes? I'll just pick at the things that bugged me the most. First, the shockingly obvious and strange homosexual undercurrent that exists between nearly every male character in the movie. From the minute that Goose and Maverick enter Top Gun, there are encouraging glances, knowing looks, and even arms around each other that left me puzzled. Why was that ""intense"" scene between Iceman and Maverick shot in such a way that it looks like they may kiss at any moment? Maybe you have to fly a jet to understand it. ""I want some butts!"" one of the flight commanders yells in frustration after Maverick does a tower fly-by. And don't even get me started with the volleyball scene.If I had to create an idealized version of this movie in my mind, a version that was actually decent, it would probably involve a love story. In fact, the love story might even involve the same characters that the movie uses--but the way it's done is puzzling, and time just doesn't seem to be a factor in the way Maverick and Kelly McGillis' character get to know each other. What exactly do they have in common besides the fact that Maverick is extremely arrogant and she apparently likes arrogant men? ""Top Gun"" was one of the most financially successful films of 1986. It seems puzzling to me, because it truly is terrible, in almost every way. But if you break it down, it's easy to figure out. Does the film have: - Things blowing up? Yes, lots of airplanes.Tom Cruise with his shirt off? Yes, along with everyone else but the less-endowed Goose, in that volleyball scene.Memorable scenes, even if they are awkwardly placed? How about where Maverick and Goose sing The Righteous Brothers' ""You've Lost That Lovin' Feeling?"" to Kelly McGillis in the bar? - A high-five that everyone will remember and attempt to perfect for the next century? Yes, in that damned volleyball scene.A trite emotional scenario? Goose dies a never-explained death (I think he hit his head on the roof of the cockpit when they ejected); there is absolutely no depth to this occurrence, it just happens, and as a result, Tom Cruise can't fly properly. Also the whole sub-plot with Maverick's father being a pilot who crashed in 'Nam.A feel-good triumphant climax? Of course, when it all hits the fan, Maverick is back up on top and we're happy that he blows up the bad guys and returns home.A soundtrack that features Kenny Loggins? Yes. Oh god, yes.I get that people like this movie because it's silly. I also get that others like this movie because they look at it as the prototype for high-adrenaline action/romance movies. But the film isn't silly, and it isn't one of those ""so bad it's good"" movies, either. It's just bad. That place between bad-bad and funny-bad is where most films lie, and Top Gun is right there with them.3.40/10.00 for Top Gun.",Top Gun

Maverick has authority issues and must be cool if his name is Maverick. He falls in love with his flight instructor who surprisingly is a woman because Tom Cruise is super gay.

He plays the fighter jockey so well, and so realistic. I should know, my best friend is an Air Force pilot. The stress these men go through to defend our country is so intense, seeing as how they have the most dangerous job in the entire military industry. Being a pilot for the Navy is more dangerous than being one for the Air Force, as you base off of an aircraft carrier.

The ""enemy"" has used our own passenger aircraft as suicidal missiles to crash into the World Trade Center. We are in 2 wars for oil where the weapons of choice are Improvised Explosive Devices (IED's) and 4000 Americans have died to protect oil company holdings.

Many movies since have tried to match it (Iron Eagle anyone?), but none has come close.Since then, I've seen it countless times on video and cable, and it never gets stale.  It has everything for everybody: action, romance, humor, tragedy, and a happy ending. Oh, and Tom Cruise, in the role that branded him a Superstar.If you buy a home theater system with Surround Sound, this is the first movie you should watch.

The only part I didn't like was the intensly mushy part but that's ok. It just didn't seem to go so well with the rest of the film. Or maybe it went too well. Hmmm...may have to think a bit more about that one. Anyway, for a film made in the 1980's it's the best. I'm 17 and I love it above all other moves (though ID4 comes easy 2nd.) Go watch it.

Then again, adding it to my collection was a must, after all it is one of the best movies of all time.The hype about movie being technically wrong in so many parts is not a factor when you are enjoying it. You can always understand what is going on during dogfights and where is the actual story progressing.A story of a young fighter pilot who goes on to join the fighter school for top 1% pilots in the American Navy, and during it falls for the instructor. A very well portrayed movie, great acting and even Meg Ryan did a great job. Tom Cruise in his early days made a great impact whereas Val Kilmer also gained recognition. You want love story, you want drama, you want a great movie, go ahead...watch it. A certain must for my collection, great movies of all time.",Top Gun

On your tail!"".Look at the list of ""best ever"" films on IMDB's, or anyone else's list. Only Scorcese was consistently excellent in the period. The eighties were a black hole.

The one high point is the performance of a very young Meg Ryan. Ryan is fresh and exciting in her small role and is the only one worth watching.

311,weberwhit,"Good Movie, Evocative of an Era",7,14 November 2005,"It is hard to be too critical of Top Gun because the main purpose of the movie is to provide two hours of mindless entertainment, and it succeeds in that effort. This isn't a simplistic movie masquerading as an insightful one. It is pretty obvious what the aim of all of those involved in this movie was - to put rear ends in the seats. That being said, I thought there were some nice touches in Top Gun. First, Tom Cruise, whose acting I have always considered good but not great, is perfect as Maverick. He did cocksure well back then. Second, the Kelly McGillis character, Charlie, is a tough, ambitious woman, and has a natural beauty that is missing from today's pop-tart leading ladies. Back then, directors actually cast leading ladies who looked like women we all know and could, gasp, act! Third, it is a perfect time capsule of the mid 80's, the good, the bad , and the ugly. Whatever you think of that decade (I thought the pop culture back then was more fun and a lot less mean than it is today) this film captures the rah-rah patriotism and the growing self-assuredness of America in the Reagan era perfectly. All in all, a good movie that captures a specific era very well and succeeds in doing exactly what is was intended to do - entertain.",Top Gun

It feels almost as I were in the film myself talking to Kelly... It´s real weird, and I've only felt like that in Tom Cruise-scenes. These comment weren't supposed to be about Cruise´s brilliant acting but the brilliant film. It has awesome action-scenes with the planes and so on...Tony Scott has talent for this and he's shown us that several occasions after Top Gun.I really like this movie because it is what we call a cinema-movie with great success at the cinemas throughout the world. The love-scenes with Kelly MacGillis and Tom Cruise in it are well-made, and along with Cruise´s brilliance it's real emotional too.

The movie is shot well and has some intense dogfighting action but is hardly a great cinematic achievement.  Production values are high and the simple themes, trite dialogue, and iconic characters won't tax the brain, making it an ideal action movie for the average American and a fair way to spend a couple of hours.6 of 10 stars.",Top Gun

Action scenes are well filmed and believable. At the end of the day, a nice feel good movie and one that can be recommended to families (with kids above 12 years old?)

Oh for heaven's sake... we had to resort to such tactics when we made Reach for the Sky back in the 50s, surely we don't have to do it now. Having flown in the Royal Air Force for forty years, I can vouch for the fact that the average USAF jock's aircraft recognition skills can be suspect at times - to say the least!

Though the movie seems to go by fast, every second gets trapped in my heart forever. It's also amazing, how there is more than one plot, but they all connect, and really change the movie in a certain way.

While at the flight school, three storylines develop: one is a romance, one is the fight to be the best, and the final is a tragic storyline.  Each storyline ""thread"" only makes the movie better, by fleshing out the characters in the movie.One of the best parts of the movie is the end, but I won't give it away.

It's epic like the Goonies is still epic, chock full of predictable, over the top scenes and corny music that somehow becomes unforgettable. The whole montage with ""take my breathe away"" is just visual poetry. This is what a movie should be, it's not over the top with grand theatrics and the weighty import of deep philosophical questions. It's sublimely shallow and borderline hilarious (in a bad way), but the sum is greater than the parts, it all works to make an entertaining film.OK, yeah, there is romance in this movie, whatever, I actually like the romance in this movie I find it hilarious and somewhat weird yet very real. Yes, there is supposed gayness, well, why is seeing a man with his shirt off necessarily gay? So what? It's hilarious that society deems men with shirts off as gay, but women with shirts off is not gay... Are gay women not turned on by women with shirts off?

He has no problem with the film, despite its inaccuracies from a military standpoint, so neither do I.Fun film. If this was 1986 right now, I'd say its a truly great film.

340,MongoOnion,"I feel the need, the need for sleep",5,5 January 2013,"I have to admit, I was really looking forward to this. After how good I've heard this was, I went into this expecting Die Hard or Commando with jets. I couldn't have been more wrong. Top Gun is about this super cool guy named Maverick, played by Tom Cruise. He and Goose, his funny-best-friend-with-a-family-and-a-little-boy- and who's-death-you-could-predict-within-the-first-two-minutes are at the top of their class in flight school. They go to the big boy's league where Maverick meets and fall in love with his teacher, Charolette, played by Kelly McGillis, and the two of them have about as much chemistry between them as Cruise has had successful marriages. It's pretty funny how there's much more sexual tension and chemistry between Maverick and Goose and Maverick and his rival Iceman, who's the antagonist because the film tells us he is; however his only crime for ¾ of the film is being the only character who tells Maverick he puts his squad in danger without kissing his butt in the same sentence. This film basically winds up being a really dull romance between Maverick and Charolette, with the actual plot nowhere to be seen as nothing ever really happens. Finally something does, in fact, happen, and there is some drama but by then it's too little too late. Some Russians show up in the last ten minutes so some explosions can get squeezed in at the end. Questions such as did this act of aggression lead to World War 3 are never answered. I also wonder why Russia's first move would be to shoot at two jets of trainees in the middle of nowhere. Move over, Pearl Harbor. There are some bright sides to the film, to be fair. They have some beautiful shots and stunts of the planes. The soundtrack is very ""love it"" or ""hate it"", with 'Take My Breathe Away' and the ever classic 'Danger Zone'.

347,MagicMan-9,A film that holds a special place in my heart.,9,30 May 2005,"The following is an excerpt from a non-fiction story I wrote entitled ""Eighteen Years from Olean."" Copyright 2004. All Rights Reserved.The set up is that I'm 18 years old, and about one week after my graduation from High School. I've been having a one year, long distance romance with a girl named Tammy. I've driven 500 miles to surprise her, and here's what we did the first night I arrived Chapter 11 The Castle Cinema; Olean, New York; Summer 1986 We came back to her place, had dinner with her momI don't remember anyone else being thereand Tammy suggested that we see a movie. There was a new film playing in town that she really wanted to see and asked me if I would take her. Of course I would.The local two screen cinema was called The Castle, and my memory tells me that it wasnot surprisinglybuilt like a castle, with spires, and uneven brick around the top like Jack-O-Lantern teeth. She told me the name of the movie and I distinctly remember thinking what a stupid title. It sounded like a cheesy cowboy movie. I had not heard of itit was very newand was certain that it was going to suck. I despised westerns. But I would try to suffer through this horrible movie for her sake, knowing full and well that I would hate it.The film was Top Gun.Boy was I wrong.Top Gun was the paradigm of 80's cinema. By that I mean it was a high-octane action/adventure film with a script filled with campy dialog, and a thin, formulaic plot that was driven by a kick-ass soundtrack. It was common of the motion pictures during that decade for the music to be the star; one long rock video, like the ones we watched on that new network MTV (back when they actually played videos).I'm only a little embarrassed to tell you that Top Gun changed my life. I had already started skydiving by then and the visuals of aviation and the attitude of the pilots drew me in. I saw that movie not less than ten times while it was still playing in theaters, and countless times since on video and DVD. Even now I know every line by heart. It was the script for my generation, introducing such phrases as ""Talk to me Goose,"" ""It's time to buzz the tower"", ""Let's turn and burn"", ""call the ball"" and ""I feel the needthe need for speed."" Obviously I wasn't the only one infatuated with this movie. Top Gun was the winner of the People's Choice Award for 1986, nominated for four Academy Awards (winning one), catapulting six of its songs to Billboard's Top 10, and, oh yeah, it grossed three-hundred million dollars world-wide. It was a popular film. On a practical note, my repeated viewings of Top Gun in theaters taught me an invaluable lesson about performance.Throughout my time in theater, mostly plays, we were always told that there is no bad audience, only a bad performance. That's a lie.A film doesn't change from performance to performance. Every line is delivered exactly the same way, with the same timing and the same inflection. The performance give by the actors is identical each time it's viewed; exactly as it was the instant it was captured on film. Yet, I noticed that each time I saw Top Gun in a cinema, the audience reacted differently.Sometimes they would laugh at the humorous parts, other times not. A few times they cheered when Maverick shot the last MIG, and once or twice they actually chuckled when Goose hit his head on the canopy, breaking his neck. The live people in the audience never, in fact, responded the same way at any two showings of the film. Now since the movie changed not one iota, I came to the conclusion that there are indeed bad audiences.On occasion, when I have a show that tanks, I reminded myself of the Top Gun rule, and it brings me comfort.Sometimes.",Top Gun
348,scott.west,Beautifully fake,9,30 May 2000,"There is a school of thought that says all movies should be compared on an absolute scale.  It would say that movies must have a high level of credibility or familiarity in order to be ""good"" movies.  People who fall into this category simply should not watch Top Gun.  They won't enjoy it. Other people take the opposite, but no more valid approach of looking a each movie individually, disregarding all else but the movie.  For these people, no outside reality or credibility is important, because for them, a movie exists to entertain in whatever way it chooses to.  These people would enjoy Top Gun very much.  It is extremely doubtful that the producers ever even considered making Top Gun as a portrait of a fighter pilot's life, and this is why it is entertaining.  It is a rare type of movie, one that no one dares to make today, one that not only transcends reality, but wears it as a mask into the world of fantasy.  Everything from the wild dogfights to the fake love to the over the top glamorized (or should I say canonized) characters lets you know that this is a good old American hero drama.  That is why it is a horrible and fraudulent portrait of reality, and that is why I love it.",Top Gun

Top gun was THE BIGGEST WASTE OF TIME!!! the movie is nothing more then a glorified romance! I can honestly say that whoever decided to make this movie should be castrated with rusty kitchen scissors. I could have handled the fake missiles, and the F-5's serving as Mig's, as long as there wasn't any romance.

And since ""Maveric"" has done this more than once, it is a repeated offense. The scene where they eject out of the spinning F-14 Grumman Tomcat is also ludicrous as they would have blacked-out or red-outed in that kind of uncontrolled spin. Another thing, you cant just paint F5e- Tigers black with a red star, and say they have similar capabilities to a supersonic MiG. This is a direct insult to the MiG as well as to the Tiger.",Top Gun

Goose and Maverick. They manage to get their way to Miamar when Cougar ""looses his wings and turns his back"" their training doesnt start without trouble since the first night they get into a quackpack with Slider and Iceman.Forward into the training, Maverick experiences not just love but a horrible loss. A canopy turns to be Goose's fate and Maverick can't blame nothing but himself of the accident.

As a 'real' veteran of the Navy, I can confirm that the heroics portrayed in this film are not accurate. Life in the Navy is hard, and seldom glorious. Optimism & ""luck"" dominate the themes of this film. Future Navy recruits, DO NOT consider this an accurate reference to your future profession. Instead, I suggest that you contact individual Naval personnel, in the service at present, to confirm or deny your individual ideas as to the real nature of military service. Any doubts at all?

But guys, don't be put off by that, it is still a cool film to watch!!!Tom Cruise pulls off the part of ""Maverick"" perfectly and his co-star Kelly McGillis (""Charlie"") is a perfect supporting actress.This film has one of the best storylines i've even encountered and it ranks highly in my Top 50 films of all time.

No Carrier in a ""Situation area"" would be that defenseless. The Captain of that ship would NEVER make Admiral!

363,contact-18-751612,"If you feel the need, the need for speed, Top Gun is what you need!",10,1 January 2016,"A Legend in it's own time.Timeless classic.Really does get better with age.Yep, all of the above are true and many more platitudes that are bandied about or discussed when this film is mentioned. I struggle to grasp why this has a sub 7 rating on here, especially considering some of the dire films that have been rated 9 or above on IMDb, this film deserves a much higher rating.It's a great night in with ""pizza and popcorn"" movie, more fun if everyone has seen it before so you can play the Top Gun quote game. I'd love to see this on the big screen with the full sound system to hear the big adrenaline rush that comes with hearing the jets screaming around and the music pumping. Even though I happily watch it at home of a 40 inch TV with a 5.1 PC audio system which isn't exactly lacking in power or effect...It's a fun if somewhat cheesy 80's film that is of course a formula film that was repeated several times (Especially with Tom Cruise starring in them!) with a soundtrack that is still as good today as it was in the late 80's when this film came out. The plot may be paper thin but the action, the music and the quotability and great fun of the film is what makes it so much fun to watch and gives it massive replay value.It's fast paced action sequences and aerial cinematography are top notch, simply breathtaking and stunning for the most. The drama of the shooting is the backbone of this film, the adrenaline it can induce is spectacular and some of the shots are simply haunting.The humour is laugh out loud funny and it featured some bloody good looking men and great looking women so the eye candy is never far away. The film has very few lulls and the action is never far away. It has emotion and feeling but always gets back into the Danger Zone pretty quick with characters that are likable and fun to watch. The casting was very well done and you can sense that the cast and crew must have had a riot while making this film (With The exception of Iceman/Val Kilmer, who actually kept himself apart from the crew for the most to allow for his character to be felt as a true outsider.)As may be apparent I'm a Top Gun fan, have been since I first watched this film, I was gripped from the opening chimes of the epic Top Gun theme followed by that big haired 80's guitar riff and the initial sounds of engines winding up as the steam drifts across the deck of the aircraft carrier. I'm a firm believer that if this film doesn't get your stuff going at some point, your stuff is broken. It's not a film to be taken seriously, it's meant to be enjoyed with friends and laughed along with. The film may have a few plot holes, there are about a million goofs, it spawned more than a handful of web sites to point out all the goofs and flaws in the film, dialogue and all other things Top Gun related but it's got a fan base the size of a massive army and for a reason, it's just a good movie because of all that.The soundtrack and aerial footage really are the stars of this film, even though the cast was pretty huge, the Director Tony Scott really went all in and made a huge effort with Top Gun (Even at his own personal expense considering he ended up hiring a US Aircraft carrier to get a shot just how he wanted!)It's just one of those films if you like it, whenever it is on, you can sit down and watch it no matter where you walked in, or turned over and found it was on. It's like a really comfortable pair of slippers that always feel good to slip on when you get the chance. I often wish I could turn back the clock to being a teenager again to watch it for the first time all over again and get the chills down my spine as each action sequence gears up; the rush as the roar of the F-14 engines scream and howl. I envy the people who have not seen this film as they have experience the roller-coaster ride that this film can offer.It's funny as I was inspired to come write this review after meeting someone the other week who had not seen Top Gun, which for me has been a rare experience. In fact I don't know many people who do not own either a copy if the VHS or a DVD of Top Gun, and most of my friends have the OST in their music collection or the larger part of it as Singles/MP3's.If you have not seen it, get on ebay or Amazon or wherever, spend a few quid and buy a copy, get some friends around for the night, snag some beer, popcorn, pizza or tofu if that floats your boat and have a great night in. If you don't take it too seriously you should have a good night.If you have seen it and enjoyed it, get on here and give it some love and vote it up, if only to get it ranked above a lot of the rubbish ranked highly.It's also worth watching the DVD extras/Making of Top Gun if you liked the film as it's pretty interesting stuff and very funny in parts, as some of the trivia about the film is fascinating.",Top Gun
364,cute_butrandom,Yes and No,9,25 January 2005,"Alright the script is useless, despite containing a few great lines ""i crack myself up"" etc but it is a film i.e not real some scripts especially a while ago were in-keeping with what people liked to hear at the time, emotions were plainly stated and illustrated because that was the way it was. Also, the corny script notwithstanding, anyone who can see this film and not have their breath taken away by the stunning flying is either a liar or inbred; despite having a father who flies telling you whether a particular film-pilot almost lost that stunt or not. The quality of this movie is not judged by the script, thank god, but by its undeniable ability to capture its audience and take it right through the movie; ""King Arthur""'s (2004) script again was not really amazing but it doesn't detract too much from the film, and sound-track. However much you try to pick faults with this movie (if you try saying one thing about Goose....)there is one thing you can't deny, this film is a classic and the amount of references ad line-dropping it has created over the years only further serves to prove this fact.

He crashes an airplane ""wow maverick you're the man!"", he farts ""wow man THAT was a sonic boom!"", he breaks the rules ""no no you shouldn't have done that"", but then ""hey man i couldn't tell you but u are the best"", i mean come on lol.And he has the regular uglier sidekick who also does nothing else in the airplane than telling ""wow maverick you're great"" all the time.And what a poor excuse kelly mcgillis comes up with to get laid with maverick. ""I just want more info on the mig's"" well lady why don't u invite goose at home since he even has a photo of a mig? :DAnyway this movie is so 80's. Action scene for you - boring love scene for your girlfriend - action scene again - boring kelly mcgillis scene again - and so on.If it was me i'd have cut all the love scenes and i'd have kept just the scenes with maverick and viper (the ""senior top gun"") as intermissions.

There was just that very deep platonic love between Maverick and Goose. Overall, I really liked the movie, though it was so cliché.

It gives me a small feeling of freedom.Although I mentioned above that none of the actors performances were exceptional, I would like to give Mr. Cruise a lot of credit, I don't think anyone could have played the part like he did.Micheal Ironside is also doing a great job as ""Jester"", unfortunately, he's not as much on screen as one could have hoped.On the weak side of performances, we have Val Kilmer, he does an absolutely horrible job, as the confident and cocky fighter-pilot ""Iceman"". It's early in his career, sure, but a horrible performance none the less.

The performance of Tom Cruise is impressive. The guy is a manual on how to be cool. I dare say that the aerial scenes are the best that cinema has given us.

Even though he has no blame for his friends death yet still goes around like he just killed a man and is trying to hide it. If he actually would have been to blame for Gooses death the movie would have meaning but as it is, it has no emotional value at ALL and even Gooses wife is pretty chill with her husbands death.

It's my favorite film because of the F-14 Tomcat. The air combat scenes are by far the best of any jet fighter film. They are great because no shots were computer images! There was trick photography in some shots, like using models that shot missiles and the one scene where 'Maverick' and 'Goose' did the inverted dive and flipped-off the MiG pilot was made by splicing two pieces of film together.The aerial shots in ""Flight of the Intruder"" were great as well, but some shots, such as the night shots, were computer generated. Even the TV show ""JAG"" uses F-14 scenes from ""Top Gun"" and computer generates them.

389,alexwilkes,Top Gun = Top Film,10,25 April 2006,"Top Gun was the top film of 1986 - the same year I was born. The film begins when Maverick and Goose are informed by their fiery tempered boss Stinger that they are going to Top Gun, the air base which trains its fighter pilots to be the best in the world. Stinger was going to send Cougar, but he lost confidence in his ability and dropped out of the Navy.Maverick and Goose arrive at Top Gun and meet two of the senior instructors - Viper (first winner of the Top Gun trophy in 1969) and Jester. They also meet Iceman - current holder of the Top Gun trophy and rated as the best fighter pilot in the Navy -, Slider, Wolfman and Hollywood.On their first night at Top Gun, Maverick and Goose go to a local nightclub and Maverick's attention is drawn to an attractive woman called Charlie (Charlotte). He starts to sing You've Lost That Loving Feeling and the rest of his colleagues join in. When they are back at Top Gun, the pilots are introduced to a female civilian doctor and it turns out to be Charlie. She asks Maverick around her house for dinner and during their conversation he tells her about his father, who was shot down in Vietnam in 1965 and never seen again.When Maverick and Goose fly for the first time, they defeat Jester and Maverick celebrates with a circus stunt flyby which soaks the control tower radio operator with coffee. Viper then reprimands Maverick for breaking the Top Gun rules - The Top Gun rules exist for your safety. They are not flexible and neither am I. Maverick is leaving a lesson at Top Gun when Charlie follows him out of the school and tries to explain that she saw genius in his flying, but he speeds off on his motorbike. Charlie follows him in her Porsche Spyder and when he eventually stops she admits to loving him.Maverick and Goose are flying in another training exercise when their aeroplane goes into a jet spin and when Maverick finally manages to eject, Goose hits his head on the canopy and they both parachute down into the sea. It is obvious that Goose has been badly injured and when Maverick is in the washrooms at the military hospital, Viper informs him that Goose is dead.An official enquiry confirms clears Maverick of any responsibility for the crash which claimed Goose's life, but he is still racked with guilt and decides to quit the Navy. Viper persuades Maverick to change his mind and he shows up the next day to graduate with the rest of his Top Gun class.During the graduation, Maverick and his colleagues are informed that they must leave as soon as possible because of a crisis in the Indian ocean. Maverick's brilliance ensures that the majority of the enemy m.i.g's are quickly eliminated and that the remaining ones back out. He wins the Top Gun trophy and returns to Fightertown u.s.a after accepting Stinger's offer of a flight instructor's role.In the closing scene, Charlie appears at the local pub and informs Maverick that she decided to stay at Top Gun because the best of the best were there.",Top Gun
390,pzgordon,Classic 80s,8,5 August 2019,Love this movie not for its cinematic power but for the memories it brings back when I watch it. Great entertainment and lines to quote!,Top Gun
391,bwconklin,Cool when I was kid,3,17 May 2006,"I loved this movie when it first came out in theaters. I went with my uncle and I was so pumped afterwords it was crazy. Then again, I was 9 years old. Since then, myself and this movie have aged 20 years. I saw it again earlier this year, and was not surprised to see this movie did not hold up well through my experience, movie-going and otherwise.I think you can enjoy this movie if you take it for what it is. The standard bearer for Rah-Rah America, Reagan-era, 80's cheeze. It's from Bruckheimer, who practically invented the dumb, formula, action blockbuster. Wow was America great right? The Soviets were a threat, Gorby was still stumping, Rambo III was out, Reagan was pumping out the sunshine every day. Now the movie seems hopelessly dumb, corny, and irrelevant. The sad thing is, how many went and joined the military because of this unrealistic, phony piece of schmaltz? I shudder at the thought.The plot, well there is no plot. If there is one to be seen, it's so full of clichés it's not really worth discussing. The action scenes, though completely contrived and not all realistic, are the one saving grace. The acting is an abomination and the volleyball scene is as corny and gay as advertised.This movie was made for the standard movie growing crowd in 1986. We were high on ""America is the greatest"" propaganda patriotism. We hadn't been bogged down in Iraq yet or been force fed cheezy action blockbuster after another for two decades, although those movies still deliver at the box-office to this day. In that context, one can see why this movie was so popular. Bottom line, defining moment in 80's cinema, whether or not you think that is a good thing is up to you..",Top Gun
392,motoole22,A fantastic thrill ride that shoots down all the bogies!,10,4 March 2002,"Frankly, Top Gun is one of the finest movies of all time.  It has five elements which make it so.  Its a great action movie, its a great date movie, it has great music, and it has some of the finest movie quotes ever written.First off the actors. Tom Cruise plays Maverick, the fantastic heart throb of the film.  He pulls off the roll of a naval aviator quite well. He later appeared in the movie Days of Thunder, a version of Top Gun in race cars. Kelly Mcgillis appears in the film as Charlie, the object of Maverick's affection.  I think that back cover of the film puts it best when it says ""Kelly McGillis sizzles as the civilian instructor.""  I say that this along with Witness were the high points of her career, she went on the star in Storm Chasers II: Revenge of the Twister.  Val Kilmer pulls off the part of Ice Man better than any other actor could have done.  He is also one of the major factors that attract so many women to the movie.  This was Anthony Edwards' second major film, his first being Revenge of the Nerds, we could obviously see he was already moving up in the world.  Tom Skerritt played the part of the strict yet forgiving commanding officer very well.  Some other minor characters that greatly contributed to the film were Tim Robins as Merlin, Meg Ryan as Goose's Wife, Carole Bradshaw, and Admiral TJ Cassidy making his first and last cameo in a film.Now on to the action, the dog fighting scenes in this movie were THE best ever caught on film.  Very few special effects were used, it was all real naval aviators piloting real F-14s.  Many movies have tried to match the excellence of these scenes but none have made it, in fact Paramount regularly liscenes dog fight footage from the film to other movies so they can fill their inadequacies.  The number of spin-offs attribute to the excellent action of Top Gun, as i mentioned above Days of Thunder, Fire Birds starring Nicholas Cage was simply Top Gun in helicopters, and Hot Shots was a parody of Top Gun.Top Gun is quite obviously a great date movie.  The movie features two main parts, the dog fighting and the motorcycles for the guys and the many chick flick aspects which the girls enjoy. Throughout the movie their are scenes of half-naked men, personally I think there could have been less of this, but it is a big help when trying to convince girls to watch the movie when you tell them it features Val Kilmer and Tom Cruise walking around in towels.  One of the main attractions to girls is the pointless volley ball scene, showing sweaty Tom Cruise, Val Kilmer and Tim Robins with out shirts and Anthony Edwards fully clothed. If the film had subtracted the love aspect and added more of the dog fighting aspect I would have been happy, however it is yet another way of attracting females.  It starts off with Tom Cruise romantically singing to Kelly McGillis, she plays hard to get, they have sex, and Cruise goes off to war.A key aspect of the movie was the music.  ""Highway to the Dangerzone"" makes the dog fights much more intense.  Berlin's ""Take My Breath Away"" does the same for the love scenes. And like any good movie it has some great sing-alongs, ""You've lost that lovin' feeling"" and ""Great balls of fire.""Topping off a great film are some of the finest lines written for film during the 80's.  I personally believe that it is possible to lead a normal life speaking only in lines from Top Gun.  Here are some of the best of the best: ""You're everyone's problem, every time you fly you're unsafe, I don't like you because you're dangerous.""  ""You screw up just this much and you'll be flying cargo planes full of Rubber Dog S*** out of Hong Kong."" ""I'm hanging on too tight, I've lost the edge sir, I'm sorry."" ""You can be my wingman anytime.""  And, my personal favorite ""I was inverted.""This hip heart-pounding combination of action, music, romance, and incredible aerial photography helped make Top Gun the blockbuster hit of 1986 and a timeless classic.  The only thing that could have possibly made this a better film was if Heratio Sanz was to have has even the smallest of parts.",Top Gun

394,michaelsussman,Top Gun will knock your socks off; well at least your shoes.,9,6 July 2006,"Two young aircraft pilots are sent to Top Gun after saving their fellow buddy from crashing his aircraft. Top Gun is a school that trains the top one percent of pilots in the United States. Maverick is an expert pilot who flies with Goose, a great friend and a great pilot. Maverick fights against his rival Iceman and they battle for a trophy for best pilot. The outstanding actor in the movie was Tom Cruise who played Maverick. He acted like a dangerous bad boy with no limits. He had a fearless attitude towards everything, and Cruise nailed his role perfectly. Others actors such as Anthony Edwards (Goose) and Kelly McGillis (Charlie) acted well but didn't stand out as much as Cruise. Top Gun is a fun movie, but it's nothing more than a blockbuster rental. Adults will like the movie more than kids. The 110 minute movie might be too long for children and could bore them, and adults would appreciate the romance scenes more.",Top Gun

That still can't save Tom Cruise from being completely unlikeable as "" Maverick "" , a mouse faced dude who thinks he's the best pilot ever. The worst scenes are with him and Kelly Mcgillis as "" Charlie"" , a hot blonde astrophysicist who could honestly do so much better than Maverick, but still tongue kisses him in The GROSSEST scene ever with music that reminds me of my moms first divorce.

I tried a search on the topic, but don't think it has been noted before.Top Gun is a great movie, and of all the blockbusters like it in its era, it is surprising that it never had a sequel.

It contains adrenaline surges, and high points, as well as superbly crafted disaster which leads to depression and confidence loss in the main character Maverick (Tom Cruise).  The film appears to be taking the line of- 2 good guys are behind for the whole film but will win in the end- but this is cut short with the death of Goose (Anthony Edwards) in a training accident.  I think that the relationship between Maverick and Goose is portraied very well, and for those who find a gay theme- your wrong.  The relationship is just one of freindship and comitment, which I have certainly felt for other men- I'm not Gay- i have a girlfriend and feel that for those who point out such themes you are finding something in nothing.
It is a very fitting ending, but i feel could have been made better if Maverick died in the final battle, saving Iceman (Val Kilmer) as his father had done, a generation before.  A great film, which will carry on entertaining for generations to come.",Top Gun

But it's the overall feel of the movie, the utterly 80s touch and not least Kelly McGillis' Charlie that does this for me. Not to mention Maverick himself...I was 15 when this movie came out and it still has one of the best soundtracks (Top Gun Anthem).Top Gun is simply one of my top three favorites of all times, and I cannot recommend this highly enough...although if people haven't seen this then they are either too old or too young.

This movie can make you laugh, it can make you cry; when Maverick re-engages and takes down his first kill you just feel like jumping up with joy as a smile hits your face.  When Maverick finally lets go and throws Goose's dog tags into ocean you feels your eyes getting heavier as a tear rolls down your face.  The action and suspense is incredible, there are quotes in this movie that I will never forget, and smiles that won't ever leave my mind.  Also, can you believe the surround sound with this movie?  This movie was filmed in 1986 but, when you play it even on VHS using surround sound, you can almost feel and hear the jet flying right over you as they go by the air cameras.  One of the best parts of the movie is the fact that all of the stunts are actually done by real pilots, it is all real, don't believe me? Just take a look at all of the credits at the end of the movie, all of the Naval Pilots and commanders.  There is also, I regret to inform all of those who were unaware of this, but during the filming, one man died doing a stunt on camera; this man was Art Scholl, credited as the dedication of the movie. He was flying one of the stunts as they were fighting in training and his plane flew through the Jet-Wash of another plane, thus taking the plane out of control and killing him; this is where a change in script took place and the idea of how they left Goose to die. I dedicate this review in Art Scholl's loving memory, you can read more about him by searching his name on IMDB or on Yahoo!",Top Gun
414,kirtzorion60,A largely mediocre movie,3,8 July 2009,"Having recently read a book called ""The Game"" by Neil Strauss, where he makes numerous references to Top Gun, Magnolia and Jerry Maguire, I decided to watch this movie. It sure is difficult to imagine that a movie could be so polar. Without a doubt, the movie was ridden with bad acting.Tom Cruise, though not terribly bad in his portrayal of Lt. Pete ""Maverick"" Mitchell, was still largely amateurish. Kelly McGillis (Charlotte ""Charlie"" Blackwood) put on a SPECTACULARLY terrible performance through the entire 110-odd minutes. Moreover, the cinematography was quite poor, and video editing was quite appalling. And don't even get me started on characterization and plot. But diametrically, the movie was a great treat too. The music and original score was terrific (rightfully earning an Academy Award) The visual effects were amazing and Val Kilmer was his usual charismatic and professional self.Overall, the movie would have been worse than trash without the awesome dogfights and the great audio.",Top Gun
415,ritter07,"Adrenaline, attitude, and a little bit of plot",8,1 May 2011,"Top Gun is a testosterone charged movie, with a blend of fighter jets and machismo, with a bit of love story thrown in for good measure. There is a little tragedy thrown in, and a little triumph as well. The film appeals a bit to everyone, with a simple plot, with some of the typical elements thrown in for good measure.The film starts off with a fighter jet dogfight, in which Maverick (Tom Cruise) and Goose (Anthony Edwards) are flying a mission, and encounter a pair of enemy planes, that no one has seen before. The pair are not allowed to fire, so instead, they showboat a little, and chase off the enemy. Once they land, they find out they are going to an elite fighter pilot's school, nicknamed Top Gun, but not before ruffling some feathers by ""buzzing the tower"" with a high speed flyby.Once at Top Gun, they meet Iceman (Val Kilmer) who is their main competition at the school, and Maverick, on a dare from Goose, proceeds to hit on Charlie (Kelly McGillis). While in class, they find out Charlie is a civilian instructor at the school. While on one of the flights, Iceman's plane cuts in front of Maverick's, which stalls the engines, a crash ensues, and Goose will never fly with Maverick again.Charlie, once Maverick has hit on her, wants to know more about the encounter with the enemy jets. This leads to a relationship, and they fall in love. Charlie supports Maverick after the crash, but Maverick doesn't know if he can ever really fly in combat again. During his struggle to fly in simulated combat, Maverick learns that his father was actually a hero, and saved lives, instead of being at fault and getting himself killed. This knowledge convinces Maverick to stay in Top Gun, and graduate, and at graduation, a situation arises, and Iceman and Maverick get called into combat, and Maverick's dogfighting ability is no longer questioned.There are many scenes that contribute to the adrenaline and machismo of the film. There is a scene in which the fighter jocks are playing volleyball, with sweat and grit. There are several shots of Maverick on his motorcycle. There are several confrontations, where the stubbornness and cockiness of the fighter jocks is evident, as they butt heads, similar to animals in the wild. Some scenes are boosted by confusing camera angles, and jostling around, to help the viewer understand the rigors and disorientation of air combat. The music at times gets intense, and there is some radio chatter type dialogue that adds to the intensity of the pilots.This is a quality film, and is very entertaining, with appeal to most people, but has some other similar films. These movies are entertaining; however don't expect to be deep in thought at the credits.If you are looking for adrenaline, excitement, and a healthy dose of cockiness, Top Gun is worth checking out. Maverick's words sum it up pretty well, ""I feel the need The need, for speed!""",Top Gun

It has everything, action, comedy, sadness, seriousness, great music, feel good factor, great effects, and a great main character. I must have seen this over 300 times own the special edition DVD and soundtrack. Know it word for word and cannot speak of it highly enough. Bit weary of the possible sequel as I find it hard to imagine that this can ever be topped.This film sums up the feel good 80's an era that was wonderful for both film and music. Where nothing was taken to seriously and was viewed and listened to for the mere pleasure. Today action films need bigger and better stunts, and crazy story lines. I don't buy that, this is the stuff great films are made of, enjoy it embrace it.",Top Gun

Not only that it was well directed and captured, but it also gives motivation to the youth about Aeronautics, team behavior. I myself was a kid when the movie was released and I remember how much I enjoyed watching it.I was inspired by the movie and in fact I later carried forward the inspiration in my career goal. Years later, I applied for commission in Air Force in my country. The movie also gave me idea like how we work in teams, and to organize ourselves towards a coordinate effort and mutual goals. It was also a good learning for me to know about rival groups and that how should we strive for victory, while working in teams.I still like the movie and I do watch it whenever I have time.The concept of friendship with teach, though, was new to me :)Baber",Top Gun

What a great classic film. It defiantly gets my vote. Tom Cruse is a great actor and really plays a perfect part in this film. This is also the only fighter pilot film i know of with good/intense action scenes and a good romance story to back it up with. It also contains humour and a sense of 'ahh thats so cool' feeling, wishing you too could be a fighter pilot.

428,ian-stone73,Capitalist Homoerotic Tosh,6,8 January 2005,"This film, when viewed in retrospect, is symptomatic of the 1980's yuppie culture. When Mavrick's best friend dies his girlfriend virtually disowns him and only takes him back when he has some earning potential again (when he regains his Mojo, so to speak).In fact, the phallus plays a crucial role in the film, from it's embodiment in the physical shape of the airplane all the way through to Cruise playing with his stout beer bottle in the final scene. And why is it that you have semi-naked men playing beach volleyball hugging one another as often as they possibly can? Probably to keep Julian Clary (and Graham Norton (if you are American and do not know who Julian Clary is)) happy....Still, saying that, if you take your brain out of gear and marvel at the production values rather than the script then it's an OK way to pass a couple of hours of your life.

This movie, although does not depict the ""true life"" of a pilot nor the schooling, is very good because it is twisted to show a ""hollywood / Rock-N-Roll"" image of the Navy pilot. It is a good patriotic film without showing a defined enemy which means people around the world can enjoy the film no matter what country they are from. There is a lot of growing and dealing with life's problems which relates to everyone. Everyone should enjoy the music and the action without looking at it with a documentary frame of mind.

Stick to the 1st edition DVD(blue cover), NOT the 2nd Collector's ed.The Collector's Edition picture is darkened, I suppose to give a more theater feel.Its to the extreme where I thought my TV's color was giving out(but its perfect). Now about the the sound.Hummmm lets see, go for a theater look but lets skip the improved sound.At least they could have kept it the same.On the Collector's Ed. it seemed muffled. And I do mean like you had ear muffs on.Those jet engines should have kicked..But didn't. I found on my system that its sound seemed to be 50% better on the 1st edition. Now how about the picture size.I do love a anamorphic Wide Screen(my TV is not though)best of all. BUT here is whats offered. The the 1st Ed.(blue cover) had pan&scan(full screen-in case you didn't know) AND letterbox ratio=1.85( letterbox=Black lines added over the picture to give a theater feel). The Collectors Wide Screen is letterbox ratio=2.35(covered even more). **Note**Yes there is a full screen Collectors Edition, but I can't comment on that, because I would never buy a full screen over a wide screen and haven't seen it to compare",Top Gun

The characters have more depth and connect with the audience. Richard Gere is hot and Winger and Gossett and hell the entire cast are fantastic. The story line is stronger and I can watch this movie hundreds of times and it still keeps my attention.It's theme song is about ten times better than Berlin's ""Take My Breathe Away"" in Top Gun.I've never been a Tom Crusie fan and his character in this film is just annoying. The love interest has a personality of the ball point pen and the audience is suppose to buy their love story.

439,jmadsen-4,"No, I wasn't on a mind altering drug when writing this review!",10,19 June 2005,"Ah, ""Top Gun"", what can I say. This is my favorite action film of all time. Kind of a cult movie for my group of friends and I. When the movie came out in 1986, it was definitely good timing as I had just been dumped by my girlfriend and it was the ultimate feel good movie that I needed. The movie had such an impact on my friends and me that a year later, when we were on as cruise to Mexico, the movie was a topic of discussion amongst our shipmates. My friends and I entered a talent contest and sang ""You've lost that loving feeling' and actually won. The less than stellar performance didn't quite have the same effect of the females as did Tom Cruise's performance did on Kelly McGillis but it still was a lot of fun. I loved the one liners and the camaraderie that was very evident in the film. At the time, the special effects of the dogfighting was outstanding, and the soundtrack was unequaled. The on and off love affair between Cruise and McGillis was electric. I was so awed by Cruise jamming on his motorcycle at Mirimar Naval Air station, that I went out and bought my own ""rice-rocket"", proudly wearing my ""Top Gun"" baseball cap. Remember, motorcycle helmets were not required back then! So many actors and actresses seemingly got their big break in the movie. It's always fun to see the credits and hear people that haven't quite seen the movie as much as I have say ""wow, I had no idea that he or she was in the movie"". I've seen the movie probably a hundred times, and it gets better each time!",Top Gun
440,delete13,Without a mistake,10,8 September 2015,"Would hardly be accused of clichés, as it is more a source of them. This movie is the very definition of coolness, because what will a driver of a Ferrari or a sports car be left to say when comparing to a naval aviator sitting in an elegant piece of metal propelled by two turbofan sources of pure power with 111kN of thrust each?Sweat, skin, volleyball and boys playing too gay? Well, it is disputable, but if you're afraid of it, then you can't call yourself a man, can you?The story ignores the politics, the usual patriotic bullshit and is pleasantly satisfied with silent Stars and Stripes in the background. To the better, because there is only space for superlatives: who will be the best of the best five percent. It's a way of life. Even on the ground won't the main protagonist accept nothing else but the hardest of challenges and aims directly at the highest flying target, an older very feminine civil instructor.The competition and points were the movie's invention, but only because, as the military adviser said, there would be no survivor claiming the prize. Such are the amounts of testosterone in the air.To the amazing quality of the flying footage contributes the most the fact, that it is closer to reality than fiction. Filmed under patronage of U.S Navy and also sending the whole film crew to actually experience all the ""g's"".I would never dare to admit that a movie I praise so much has absolutely no intellectual essence. It is modest enough to focus on what it is best at, and at that with passion. Same as Top gun pilots, the crew aimed at nothing but the best, because they knew, the list for second places hangs in the female toilet.",Top Gun
441,jacobbailey-27108,"Great Movie, Fun Ride.",7,9 October 2015,"Top Gun is an action drama film directed by Tony Scott. Its a story about a rebellious ace fighter pilot Maverick, played by Tom Cruise, going to an elite school for the best fighter pilots in the world. There he meets and falls for a female instructor as he competes to become the top of his class. Top Gun is a classic and a must see for everyone. Its incredibly memorable and has found itself remembered in movie history. Top Gun is an iconic and fun ride from beginning to end. The movie is very well remembered for its iconic acting, scenes, quotes, shots, look, and soundtrack. Maverick is an true American boy. He's cocky, dangerous, competitive, flirtatious and he doesn't play by the rules. He's remembered for his likable screen presence and fun acting. We like Maverick and want to see him succeed. The scenes of him bantering with the other pilots or flirting with his love interest are all ones that stick out in your mind. Tom Cruise looks like the movie star he is in his jeans white t shirt combo while riding his motorcycle. Its all these things that give the movie its own iconic identity and when someone sees a cool bomber jacket they think Top Gun. The soundtrack is probably the most iconic part of the film. Danger Zone pounds through the movie leaving it oozing with intense coolness. Playing with the Boys has inspired many rumors and theories. And of course Take My Breath Away plays over and over until your sick of it. The plot is great and brings the audience right in. The idea of having a elite school of pilots all competing shows people things they wouldn't normally ever see. The drama, while not amazing, is very endearing. We want Maverick to be the best and get the girl, and his rivalry with Iceman, played by Val Kilmer, is very fun to watch. The script does a great part of really sinking the audience in the film. The cocky banter, the aviation lingo, and the confidence of the characters all come across as genuine. The most important thing about the film, is that its just a really fun watch. Its just the right kind of cheesy. Sure The script is a little much in terms of characters saying some pretty goofy stuff, but the lines still feel very real. The Character of Iceman is very one dimensional in that he's the jerk rival who cant appreciate the hero's free spirited ways. Take My Breath Away playing every time Tom Cruise and Kelly McGillis are on screen is also really goofy. All the hammy lines and awkward 80s romance have a charm to them though. The best part about Top Gun however, is the action scenes in the fighter jets. Real expert maneuvers are shot expertly and every angle of the planes brings on the action. Overall Top Gun is a must see for all. Its very ""of it's time"" and is an iconic part of movie history. While it might not have the most intricate and beautifully crafted script, its still a lot of fun to watch.",Top Gun

The special edition ""Top Gun"" DVD that came out last year is very informative, as you can listen to the feature commentary from the director, one of the writers, and the technical adviser. My favorite scene is the very beginning when the F-14's are getting ready to launch and you see the blast deflector raise up from the deck, then the signal is given to go to full afterburner and you see both engines open up and start glowing red. Then the signal to shoot em is given and the plane roars down the flight deck. The footage combined with ""Danger Zone"" lets the viewer know they are in for one hell of a ride.",Top Gun

Honestly the romance to me was unnecessary, it was put in their to appease the romance fans, to bring more audience members, it wasn't needed. Leave out the whole ""I think I'm falling in love with you"" bit out, it was totally stupid and cringe. Now when I say its cliché I'm meaning that a lot of romance movies have the same plot, there's this bad boy guy who likes this girl but she doesn't like him back, plays hard to get, but then suddenly she learns to love him after he shows his true self to her they date have a fight break up then get back together in the end yay.

448,ripcord23,A great film,10,9 December 2005,"I like Top Gun because it's about my favorite airplane the F-14 Tomcat. The flight sequences are pretty cool. I like the music, it's so '80s. However, the movie lacks ground attack scenes, but I don't blame 'em, because at the time the F-14 was not able to do ground attacks. Also, the F-14 cannot do a dive like in the beginning of the movie because of problems with the TF-30 engine, even though it was the best part of the movie. Top Gun teaches you a lot about the training that modern US pilots have. I find it very cool that the movie has a large number of F-14s on one air-craft carrier. If you looked at air-craft carriers today you would see more F-18 Hornets rather than Tomcats. And, I thought it was cool that they had A-7s taking off. If you want to see fighter-planes, then Top Gun is the movie for you.",Top Gun

Actually TOP GUN is more than a movie,it's a good ""state of mind"".It was in my early childhood when I saw it for the first time with my dad,who's a pilot and who enjoys it as much as I do.You may say I'm emotionally involved,but...come on, the movie has everything: action,love,great actors,drama,truth,the best soundtrack...And as corny and superficial as this might sound, I must say I hardly think I'll ever see a more handsome man than Tom Cruise in TOP GUN (especially in the beginning when he recognizes his ""teacher"" and puts on his famous sunglasses:) Of course the ""pretty boy"" is doubled by a fantastic actor,very ambitious and talented, capable of inducing the feelings of his character to the audience (even at the dawn of his acting career).He's done a perfect job there! I like the other actors too.Goose is one of a kind,Iceman as well (see the summary:) As a conclusion,I guess one can best judge a movie by the number of famous quotes and scenes from it(motorcycles,planes,sunglasses,volleyball:)..

452,nzbiljic-09948,Top Gun is Top of its Class,9,16 January 2019,"Top Gun directed by the late Tony Scott is a great movie that shows how to overcome challenges and adversity set on oneself and it's one of the best films that makes American watchers proud to be an American.
The plot is very well put together on how in the beginning of the film, Maverick and Goose are flying with Cougar and Merlin and they encounter a MiG-28. The scene where Cougar loses his edge is well put together. It shows his sweaty face and how he just froze and reflects on his life and his wife and kid. It really shows how hard and stressful it is to be in military aviation especially in a very high class. When Cougar gives up his wings, Maverick and Goose are given the nod to go to Top Gun. When they arrive they are not greeted in a nice way. Other soldiers at Top Gun see them as replacements of Cougar and Merlin and make that well known. In the early stages of the film it's also clear that Maverick develops a clear rivalry with Ice Man. The way Maverick and Goose are brought into Top Gun strikes them with a lot on their shoulders establishing a theme focusing on overcoming challenges/adversity that makes for a interesting script and rest of the film.
Each actor has been picked perfectly to play their role. The age, looks, and personality of all the actors are good fits with their respective role. For example: the ego of Maverick is perfectly played out by Tom Cruise with his age, looks and his overall ""swagger"" at this time in 1986. In an action movie like Top Gun it's important to have good editing for the watchers to not be able tell the transitions among scenes. Chris Lebenzon and Billy Weber (the editors of Top Gun) do a great job making the transitions unnoticed. It's especially impressing that the transitions among the scenes during dog fights are so smooth it makes the watchers feel as if they are up in the skies with the fighter jet pilots. Just as important as acting and editing is the sound/soundtrack. The way they capture the sound of jets flying around and firing missiles is astonishing. In addition to that, the music they use in specific points of the film fits perfectly and adds to the experience of watching the scenes especially during patriotic moments.
Even though Top Gun has a tremendous amount of strengths, every movie has some flaws. In Top Gun, one big flaw is Maverick's Trial about crashing the $30 million aircraft which also includes the death of another Top Gun aviator. The watchers are supposed to believe that the whole process of the trail happens over the course of a weekend whereas in reality this would take months to complete.
In Saving Private Ryan, the watchers see how harsh D-Day was and how these soldiers put their lives on the line to fight for the American people. This makes American watchers proud to be American just like Top Gun does. A scene that particularly shows patriotism is when Maverick and Goose are set to face a MiG-28 early on in the film. In the midst of the dog fight, Maverick goes inverted to ""have a little fun"" with the MiG pilot because he doesn't have orders to shoot him. He positions his inverted jet over the MiG and then proceeds to give him the middle finger to keep up foreign relations for the sake of America. As this scene is going on, some nice heroic music is played and just fits with the situation of the scene and the patriotic feeling the watchers get while they feel as if they are experiencing it up in the jet with Maverick and Goose.
The way Top Gun portrays a theme of overcoming challenges and adversity while at the same time using the characters of Maverick, Goose and other Top Gun aviators to show patriotism is something you don't find in other films which makes this one unique and top rated. A special relationship is developed by the characters throughout the film that makes the watchers connect emotionally to certain characters that makes the film just that much better and certainly one to watch numerous times.",Top Gun
