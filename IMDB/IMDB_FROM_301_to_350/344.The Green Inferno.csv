0,Leofwine_draca,Cannibal carnage from Eli Roth,4,2 October 2016,"THE GREEN INFERNO is the second Chilean film made involving Eli Roth, the first being the earthquake-horror AFTERSHOCK which also starred Roth's real-life wife, Chilean model Lorenza Izzo. This one is a pure pastiche of the Italian cannibal sub-genre of film-making, and made by Roth as a tribute to a series of films he obviously loves. Sadly, as with many pastiches, although Roth's heart is obviously in it, the end result is disappointing, a familiar re-run of themes and ideas that viewers will already be well-versed in.The characters are an annoying bunch of liberals who decide to jet off to South America to protest against some loggers threatening a tribal village. After an inordinately long introduction the main characters survive a plane crash and are subsequently imprisoned by a cannibal tribe. Roth delivers one outrageously gory scene of mutilation and murder for gore fans, but the rest of the story feels a little weak.It's spoilt by needless toilet humour and general bad acting on the part of former SPY KIDS star Daryl Sabara and, yes, Izzo herself, who fails to make her lead in any way sympathetic. Although the special effects are very good, there's a cheap and cheesy feel to the movie which means it comes closer to being laughable than genuinely horrifying. I'm afraid that Roth's best work is still the genuinely shocking HOSTEL, a film which hasn't lost any of its scuzzy impact in the decade since it came out.",The Green Inferno
1,SnoopyStyle,brutal skewering of leftist activism,6,23 February 2017,"Justine is a college freshman who starts taking an interest in social justice. Her professor talks about female circumcision. She follows a group led by Alejandro to protest logging in Peru. They destroy a bulldozer and upload videos of their protest. They are taken by security and flown out. Their plane crashes. The survivors are attacked by tribal locals. Alejandro, Justine, and others are captured alive but then the cannibals start eating.This is undeniably blood-splattering grotesque. It is a throwback to the gruesome third world cannibal adventures. There is a skewering of the college leftist activists. It has some bite but it needs a few tweaks to make it cleaner. This is definitely not for everyone and will probably annoy some people.",The Green Inferno
2,claudio_carvalho,Unoriginal and Stupid,5,3 December 2015,"In New York, the college student Justine (Lorenza Izzo) joins a group of activists led by Alejandro (Ariel Levy) and he invites her to travel to Peru to protest against a timber industry that is destroying the Amazon rain forest. The group uses their cellphones to film the destruction and send the footages through Internet. Alejandro uses Justine that is almost killed by one security guard to succeed in his intent of calling attention of audiences. When the group is returning to civilization, the plane blows-up and crashes into the forest. Soon the survivors discover that they are not alone and they are abduct by a tribe of Indians. But their nightmare becomes worse when they realize that the Indians are cannibals. ""The Green Inferno"" is an unoriginal and stupid film of cannibals by Eli Roth. The story is not well-written and Justine joining the group of activists is totally unconvincing. The conclusion is awful. There are at least two better movies about cannibals: ""Cannibal Holocaust"" is extremely realistic, disturbing, cruel and sick, and Eli Roth did not dare to depict such violence; and ""Cannibal Ferox"" that is also realistic and cruel. My vote is five.Title (Brazil): ""Canibais"" (""Cannibals"")",The Green Inferno
3,nogodnomasters,Guess who's coming for dinner?,6,31 January 2018,"Justine (Lorenza Izzo ) is the daughter of a UN attorney who enjoys privilege and wealth. She joins an activist group to save an indigenous rain forest tribe from developers and the leader of the group has a cult appeal. It also helps her ""middle class Jewish guilt."" After a ""successful"" tree chaining, they fly back and run into plane trouble. They crash into the rain forest and the tribe they just saved, thanks them by inviting them to dinner....fat guy first.Yes, this is another fine young cannibal film with severed limbs and a paint the virgin white Bo Derek scene that wasn't as good. Lorenzo Izzo is no Bo Derek, but she can act. There is some interaction in the group, and some nonsense 9-11conspiracy theory stuff thrown in. Haven't seen a good Mondo cannibal film in a while. This one was a bit watered down with a message that misses the mark. I loved the ending.Guide: F-bomb. Brief nudity. Was that Lorenza Izzo or a body double?",The Green Inferno
4,kosmasp,Evenly uneven,6,5 August 2014,"As another reviewer stated, Eli Roth hits us with an uneven movie. Not uneven when it comes to gore. Not even uneven, when it comes to some of the characters (there are still twists to be found here, that are nice, especially if you consider the whole romance angle that is mostly played out in movies, not only horror movies).So the environment is something we should protect right? Even if we have ""sacrifice"" a bit for it (no puns intended). The story rolls on and might only take off (again, no pun intended), when there is an unplanned ""event"" happening. Our characters have to face that what they thought they were protecting. More than that would be spoiling the little story there is. Unfortunately the ending might spoil it for you too ... if it wasn't spoiled before ... Not great by any means, but decent enough for one watch",The Green Inferno
5,Sleepin_Dragon,Why the fast forward button was invented.,3,17 January 2016,"I should have known after being made to sit through Knock Knock what I was in for, Eli Roth is an interesting character, he seems to want to make films that are different and challenging, the trouble is he just seems to miss the mark wildly.The Green Inferno starts off quite brightly, it's sunny, cheerful, with lots of upbeat music, it isn't long before carnage descends, a group of student activists protesting at the culling of the Rainforest meet the locals....At times the acting is bad, it is like as if the cast are larking about and not taking it overly seriously. Some of the effects were shaky to say the least, and the makeup of a few people was a bit naff.Classed as a horror film, I don't really get why, grim as opposed to scary.Do something more exciting with your life, like a crossword or wash the dishes, a much better way to spend ninety minutes of your life.I'll rate it 3 instead of 1 as some of the locations are breathtaking. Overall though it is a terrible film. 3/10",The Green Inferno
6,BA_Harrison,It's Roth's film-making that is primitive.,4,27 December 2015,"College girl Justine (Lorenza Izzo) joins a group of obnoxious college eco-warriors on a trip to the Amazon to protest the development of the rain-forest; after their plane crashes in the jungle, the young activists find themselves captured by a tribe of savage cannibals who mistakenly hold them responsible for the destruction of their surroundings.Eli Roth continues his quest to be Hollywood's most 'hardcore' horror director, but once again fails big time. With The Green Inferno, contemporary mainstream horror's biggest hack tackles the jungle cannibal genre, which gained much notoriety in the '70s thanks to gruelling, gory classics such as Cannibal Holocaust, Jungle Holocaust and Cannibal Ferox.As expected, the film delivers lots of gruesome gore (dismemberment, eye-gouging and decapitation aplenty), the effects provided by the ever reliable KNB effects group, but with a diabolical script, uneven tone (Roth can't seem to decide whether his film is a parody or serious), poorly paced direction (the first half an hour is a real test of patience), and terrible performances all round, the film loses any power that it might have had to shock the viewer.4.5/10 for the gore, rounded down to 4 for the out-of-place toilet humour (the 'explosive diarrhoea' scene and the 'tarantula attack while peeing'), the cringe-worthy dialogue ('They have the munchies') and the 'friendly' native child who helps his dinner escape.",The Green Inferno
7,paul_haakonsen,"Great movie, but the ending was an abomination...",6,23 May 2017,"Oddly enough I never got around to watch Eli Roth's ""The Green Inferno"" movie before 2017, although that I had been told that it was a rather good movie. I had watched the late 1970 and 1980's numerous cannibal movies, so I was no stranger to the genre.""The Green Inferno"" starts out rather slow paced, in terms of establishing characters and plot. But despite a rather mundane start, ""The Green Inferno"" does quickly pick up pace and becomes rather entertaining.Eli Roth is indeed known for his somewhat brutal movie if you take a look at his director credits, and ""The Green Inferno"" definitely makes an entry onto that list.The effects in the movie were quite good and believable, and there was a sense of authenticity to it all. And on that account, I really must applaud the special effects team for their accomplishment. Especially for a cannibal movie, then having proper and realistic effects are very important.The characters in the movie were also well established and fleshed out, pardon the pun, as the story was brought to life on the screen. There are characters that you instantly come to like and also instantly come to dislike.I must admit that I was more than genuinely entertained by this movie, right up to the ending. Then it just totally lost momentum and became a flaccid farce. That ending of the movie was just a slap in the face with a cold, dead fish. And as such, then I am forced to settle for a 6 out of 10 rating, whereas the movie was set up for a 7. But that ending was just ridiculously bad and cheesy. Why Eli Roth opted for that ending is just beyond my comprehension, because it was a severe disappointment to an otherwise great film.All in all, ""The Green Inferno"" is a good movie and an entertaining one. And if you haven't already seen it, and if you like the cannibal genre, then you should definitely take the time to watch this.",The Green Inferno
8,Coventry,Roth does cannibalism; Italian style!,7,25 March 2016,"The films of Eli Roth are an acquired taste, or at least for me personally they were. It's not because Quentin Tarantino proclaims that Roth is the future of the horror genre, simply based on having seen ""Cabin Fever"" that the rest of us genre fanatics obediently have to agree. It took me two viewings before I could remotely appreciate ""Cabin Fever"" and both ""Hostel"" movies are quite heavily flawed as well. But there's one thing you really can't deny and that is that Eli Roth is an avid and obsessive lover of the genre and that clearly shows in every film he delivers. ""The Green Inferno"" is a giant homage – love letter, even – to the temporarily popular trend of Italian cannibal movies from the late 70s & early 80s. This very secluded horror niche contains relatively few titles, but each and every single one is a notorious and bona fide cult classic. The most infamous and influential one is, of course, Ruggero Deodato's ""Cannibal Holocaust"", but there are several more beauties out there and Eli Roth refers to all of them here, like ""Deep River Savages"", ""Cannibal Ferox"", ""Mountain of the Cannibal God"", ""Jungle Holocaust"" and ""Cannibal Apocalypse"". In case ""The Green Inferno"" triggered your appetite – so to speak – make sure that you track down all these controversial but hugely fascinating films. The beautiful and ambitious freshman student Justine joins an environmentalist activist group led by the charismatic Alejandro, as they are about to travel to Peru in order to protest against the deforestation of the Amazonian rain forest. After a successful, but for Justine very traumatizing confrontation with the deconstruction workers and their bulldozers, the group's ramshackle old plane crashes down in the jungle. Many of the group members die instantly in the crash or in freaky accidents, but the fate of the survivors is even worse as they are promptly surrounded by a tribe of red-colored cannibals. During their captivity in a cage, fear and desperation takes the upper hand while some of the group members – most notably Alejandro – show their true cowardly and repulsive nature. Jungle and cannibal exploitation movies are associated with extreme gore, shockingly explicit ritual killings and copious amounts of bloodshed. Eli Roth certainly doesn't cut back on grotesque violence, as I hoped and expected, but he was wise enough not to include or refer to any real animal killing sequences which made ""Cannibal Holocaust"" so controversial. ""The Green Inferno"" evidently isn't suitable for viewers with weak stomachs or sensitive nerves, as several characters are torn to pieces, impaled, beheaded or eaten alive. Although nicely disguised and face-painted (particularly the headhunter and the Elder lady) the extras playing the cannibal tribe members don't come across as too menacing or bloodthirsty, at least not in comparison to the old Italian movies. In a movie handling about primitive tribes and straightforward massacres, you obviously can't expect too much underlying tension or intelligent plot twists, but Roth and his co-writer Guillermo Amoedo nevertheless tried their hardest to provide the characters with some depth and the script with some political insights. Another thing they do rather well is bring variety and surprise in the order the group members are picked off. Some of the characters' deaths come unexpected and quicker/later than I thought. Unfortunately, however, it does remain an Eli Roth film and he continues to make annoying mistakes over and over again I'm referring to an overlong first half hour in which practically nothing happens except for a lot of blah blah (although it's not as bad as in ""Hostel""), the use of infantile toilet humor (the tarantula sequence or the ridiculous diarrhea moment) and downright idiotic stuff (like getting an entire cannibal tribe stoned by hiding a little bag of weed in a corpse about to be cooked). But hey, although flawed and badly acted most of the time, it's definitely my favorite Eli Roth film! Oh, and apparently Mr. Roth is also married to the incredibly cute (and 17 years younger than him) lead actress Lorena Izzo. Way to go, Eli!",The Green Inferno
9,michaelRokeefe,For Eli Roth fans. Gore and more...,5,17 March 2017,"No surprise for fans of director Eli Roth; well, hold it...does he get better or worse? Does he offer more or less? THE GREEN INFERNO probably originated with no intent on serious social conscience, let alone something redeeming. Mr. Roth succeeds in providing strong R rated slicing and dicing as a group of good-minded, helpful spirited college students take a trip to the Amazon to help the Yajes tribe of people from being pushed from their dwellings by corporate and political interests.The repulsive gore, gruesome situations with sounds and scenes hard to erase commence when the group's small plane crashes in the jungle and the very people they have come to save get the wrong impression and a cannibal fest begins. Not without suspense, but this one gets kind of sloppy and slow. For some not their cup of tea; but for a lot...just their size of bucket of blood. Grisly, graphic and violent. Leading the cast is Lorenza Izzo (Mrs. Roth), whose character you finally care about. Other players include: Ariel Levy, Aaron Burns, Sky Ferreria, Kirby Bliss Blanton, Nicolas Martinez, Daryl Sabara, Magna Apanowicz and Antonieta Pari, as the Village Elder.",The Green Inferno
10,Hey_Sweden,"If you mostly just care about gore, you'll be content.",7,20 January 2016,"Co-writer & director Eli Roth does his bit in paying homage to the jungle adventure and cannibal horror films popularized in the 1970s and 1980s by Italian filmmakers. Among the best known are the notorious ""Cannibal Holocaust"" and ""Cannibal Ferox"". His film really is no better or worse than an average entry into this genre. It's exquisitely shot in colour and widescreen, and the flesh munching antagonists themselves are a literally colourful bunch. The victims, by and large, are not overtly sympathetic, but this was always the intention, so we end up rooting for the cannibals to eat everybody.Roth criticizes certain kinds of activism in this tale about Justine (played by the super sexy Lorenza Izzo, a.k.a. Mrs. Eli Roth), a college student who ends up wanting to prove herself to a team of do-gooders. So she travels with them to South America, to protest the demolition of the jungle and potential annihilation of a local tribe, the Yajes. To nobody's great surprise, the tribe believes our misguided ""heroes"" to be among those who are destroying the region for profit, and end up doing what they do best.Veteran effects maestros Gregory Nicotero and Howard Berger create the gore, and it's pretty good if not as over the top in its brutality as one might expect from Roth.Comedic elements aren't particularly funny for this viewer, and most of the characters are uninvolving caricatures (like the dude who wants to score some weed). Ariel Levy is stuck with a ridiculous part as team leader Alejandro. The infamous scene with the ants wasn't really a bother, though.Hurt the most by its unsatisfying, obligatory ""set up a potential sequel"" ending - inserted into the closing credits, no less.Seven out of 10.",The Green Inferno
11,LeonLouisRicci,What One Expects from the DirectorA Perverse Picture,2,5 February 2016,"Once it is known that Director Eli Roth's Favorite Film is Cannibal Holocaust (1980), there should be No Doubt that He is one Sick Puppy.That's a Scary thing, given the amount of Attention, not to mention Money, that He is given. This is the Typical result. Along with His other Films that strain for Mediocrity and are mostly just Bad, this is one more Mastuabatroy, Self-Indulgent, display. Perverse Pictures is what He Makes, and while Perversions of all sorts can certainly be found if one looks, But who's Looking. Most well Adjusted, well meaning, Folks with any modicum of Civility and Compassion try and Avoid Abnormalities at all cost.But just in Case You are too Lazy to look, Eli Roth will Deliver it to Your door, so You too can Wallow in His Perverse World. Yum Yum.To be kind, the Movie looks great and the Color Scheme is Stunning. There is also some kind of Message Hidden somewhere in there about Activism and being Green.",The Green Inferno
12,grantss,"Weak, no matter which genre you prefer or think it is",3,2 November 2017,"A group of idealistic college students set head off to the Peruvian jungle. Their aim is to make an ecological statement by hindering the operations of a logging company, and streaming this live to YouTube. They succeed in this but on the way back their plane crashes. The survivors now have to deal with the cannibalistic tribe that lives in those parts...Pretty weak, and doesn't work as any sort of movie. Seeing as it is directed by Eli Roth, you figure it will be a gory horror-type movie. There is gore, but it is pretty conventional and not that shocking by modern standards.I thought this may be some of 70s-like cannibal-exploitation movie, in the vein of Cannibal Holocaust or Cannibal Ferox. No, it is far too tame for that, and quite unnaturally so (which is odd - Roth must have known this was going to get an MA or R rating, for the gore, yet he toned down the exploitation scenes. Once you've hit the top restrictions, no need to pull your punches).The movie had potential as a survival movie, but instead of developing that for a spell, Roth went straight to the captives-of- cannibals plot.There's also a greenie vibe, that Roth alternately extols and mocks, both equally half-heartedly.Just as a pure drama it's pretty bad: basic script, unimaginative direction, lacklustre performances.So, won't work for anyone, no matter what they are in to. Focusing on one theme, and turning it up to the max would at least kept one group happy. Instead we have a hodge-podge of half-baked, diluted themes and genres.",The Green Inferno
13,oscaralbert,The Amazon's rain forests MUST be cut by 2016 . . .,9,28 September 2015,". . . director Eli Roth argues in THE GREEN INFERNO. Otherwise, when the Civilized Peoples of the World fly to Brazil to watch water athletes compete for the first time in raw sewage lagoons, these fliers will be at risk of being eaten alive. Female plane crash survivors will undergo involuntary FGM, as a half-blind tribal witch leader gobbles up their detached private parts, Roth documents. Unlike Sweden, Germany, and America, Amazon countries such as Brazil and Peru have let their Indigenous Problem fester, until it is now threatening the World's Premier Sporting Event, GREEN INFERNO spotlights. (This flick proves that not all cultures are worth preserving; the Nazi society was outlawed world wide in the 1900s.) While clear-cutting and bull-dozing the Amazon most likely will peeve a handful of Bleeding Heart Liberals and perhaps inadvertently eliminate a few species unlikely to be missed, it's the ONLY WAY to eradicate the Cannibal Threat, Roth demonstrates here. The next time a Malaysian or other jumbo jet is MIA, passengers' relatives should NOT have to wonder whether their loved ones are being eaten alive, or sexually mutilated. As THE GREEN INFERNO commands, bull-doze the Amazon NOW!!",The Green Inferno

Horror maven Eli Roth's out-of-chest bloody valentine to grind house 'cannibal' films of '70s yore delivers all the gory goods (and more) in this 21st century upgrade: a group of eco-minded college students take to the Peruvian jungles in a viral protest but get far more than they bargained for when they wind up in the midst of a primitive tribe of blood-thirsty cannibals. Shot on location with some amazing footage thanks to cinematographer Antonio Quercia in vivid clarity and nauseating (juuuuust right) make-up special effects by Greg Nicotero/Howard Berger's fantastic crew makes up for some lame dialogue and fair acting (kudos to lead babe, Izzo who goes from naive hipster to survival-at- any-cost heroine) the film more than delivers the visceral churning goods and some sly satire at Generation I-Me!

Their plane crashes, and the survivors fall foul of a cannibal tribe.Splatter lover Eli Roth revisits the Cannibal Holocaust genre of video nasties. After a rather too long preamble, our audience-identification girl and a group of miscellaneous anybodies and their obnoxious leader are captured and caged while the chubby one is graphically dismembered in front of them. This is obviously the fate which awaits them all. Will our girl survive? Will the obnoxious one be next to lasr?Who cares, quite frankly. They only have the sketchiest of characters, so it hardly matters as they suffer varying degrees of violent unpleasantness. One of the girls has explosive diarrhoea in the cage and is embarrassed and humiliated. I think it's supposed to be funny. It isn't.Roth has some ability to put graphic nastiness on screen. This film is a vehicle for precisely that and, as such, it succeeds, albeit after a poorly executed preamble. But there is no point to it other than to display Roth's base tastes.",The Green Inferno
16,AlsExGal,-Writer-director Eli Roth's homage to the Italian cannibal movies...,4,24 November 2019,"...Of the 70's and early 80's. A group of college students travel to a remote Peruvian location to protest a natural gas company's encroachment on an isolated, primitive native village. The students initial efforts are a success, but when their plane out crashes into the jungle, the natives aren't exactly thankful for the Americans' good deeds, preferring to butcher them and eat them.Roth skewers Western do-good-ism and liberal interference with foreign cultures, showing that even the best intentions can (literally) come back to bite them. The lead performance from Lorenza Izzo is good as the freshman student whose naivete is shattered in more ways than one. The rest of the cast just has to scream a lot. The violence is extreme, the blood copious, and the gore plentiful, but it becomes just a bunch of latex and Karo syrup after a while. I realized watching this that Roth seems to have specialized in the fear of the traveler in foreign lands, whether it's city folk in the deep country (Cabin Fever), Americans in Eastern Europe (the Hostel films), or South America (Aftershock and this movie). I would have given this a higher rating if it weren't for the nonsensical ending.",The Green Inferno
17,FlashCallahan,The jungle is a dangerous place.......,6,29 October 2015,"New York college student Justine, a lawyer's daughter, meets a student activist named Alejandro, when he goes on a hunger strike on behalf of underpaid janitors. Smitten, Justine agrees to help Alejandro undertake his next project: to save the Amazon. She soon learns to regret her decision when their plane crashes in the Peruvian jungle and she and the rest of their group are taken captive by a tribe of hungry cannibals.....When a film has been held back for reasons that are pretty unclear, it has a lot of hype to live up to. Most notable films that this has happened to in the past few years were the godawful remake of Red Dawn, and the decidedly disappointing Cabin In The Woods. But I always wonder if the latter was disappointing because I was waiting for the film for almost three years?This has pretty much the same problem, I am a huge. Fan of horror, and all of its sub- genres, and for all his shortcomings, Roth can have a decent eye for body horror, after all the man spawned the sub-genre known as 'Gorenography', and after the disappointing Knock Knock, I was looking forward to his homage of 'Cannibal Holocaust' and him getting back to basics.And the result is predictably hit and miss. For gore hounds, it's a must. There are some really despicable acts depicted on screen, and the fact there is a breakdown in communication between the protagonists and the antagonists, only adds to the tension that the film has on the odd occasion.But what the film lacks is the much missed humour that Cabin Fever and Hostel had, and the decidedly good build up seen in acts one and two, are let down by an absurd final act that is completely incoherent with the films narrative.Cast wise, there's nothing to shout home about, the our little group of activists spend the film looking panicked and despair riddled, and very little else, whilst the natives of the film look exactly what they are, first timers.But there are flashes of genius in the film, the scene featuring a corpse and some 'special Golden Virginia' is a classic scene, and the title is pretty genius too.But for the length of time horror enthusiasts have been waiting for a potential return to form for the auteur, it's a bit of an anti-climax.But worth seeing if you are a gore hound.",The Green Inferno
18,trashgang,an ode to the heydays of Italian cannibal flicks,8,29 October 2015,"I still remember when I heard that Eli Roth would make a flick about cannibals going berserk on visitors of the Amazon. Guess most have been years ago. So I was looking forward to finally see it and when Fangoria announced that it would be released around Halloween 2015 I immediately went for it. Eli Roth is known for delivering gory flicks but this must took him to the edge of it all. Face it, Cannibal Holocaust (1980) is the flick that is still the best and after seeing The Green Inferno it still is but this isn't bad at all. I must say that for me the only problem was the fact that it took 40 minutes before the gore comes in. before that we do have our lesson in destroying the world by tearing down the Amazon. Maybe it's a statement or maybe not but after that cheesy moment things go rather wrong. And it's from that point that this flick turns into a gorefest. It could gave been a 10 out of 10 wasn't it for the fact that it do has a few over the top moments that made it a bit funny. Intended, I don't know? For example the seat crashing down when the plane explodes or the caged girl having diarrhea. But don't let that turn you away, I can guarantee that for those never seen a cannibal flick they will turn it off or the easily offended will be shocked. And don't let you be fooled by the brown guy being killed first. It was done that way back in the seventies and eighties. It was worth the wait, comes straight on the must see list after Cannibal Holocaust and Cannibal Ferox (1981). Gore 5/5 Nudity 0,5/5 Effects 4/5 Story 3/5 Comedy 0/5",The Green Inferno
19,deloudelouvain,A bit more suspense and horror feeling would have been better to score better,6,26 April 2016,"If you are expecting to be thrilled or scared while watching The Green Inferno then you will be disappointed. But if you like gore and things like that then you will probably like it because there are enough scenes like that. To me it was not the worst gore movie I saw. You have in that genre a ton of really bad B-movies. In The Green Inferno the actors are not as bad as in other slasher/gore movies. They are not the greatest actors either but certainly not the worst. If the story would have been a bit more entertaining then the movie would probably score more, but the lack of pursuits, hiding and waiting to be caught and things like that were not really present in this movie and so it loses in intensity. Now it's just a movie about cannibalism, with good gore moments, but with not enough suspense. They immediately get caught, eaten, and that's about it. The gore special effects are good, too bad we don't have more scenes like escaping and pursuits like in Texas Chainsaw Massacre. There it was also about cannibalism but you really had a horror feeling while in The Green Inferno it's just about the gore. All in all for gore fans The Green Inferno will score okay but for horror movie freaks it will be sadly not good enough.",The Green Inferno
20,StevePulaski,A bloodsoaked satire and uncommonly fun cannibal film,8,25 September 2015,"In September 2014, our theaters and favorite video-on-demand platforms were supposed to be graced by Eli Roth's heavily hyped cannibal film ""The Green Inferno."" The film was said to be an homage to the genre-classic ""Cannibal Holocaust,"" guided by the same man who brought us the bloodbath ""Cabin Fever"" and the torture porn-pioneer ""Hostel."" Everything was set to go until weeks before the cross-platform release, the production company Worldview Entertainment, a company that has produced everything from ""Birdman"" to ""The Sacrament,"" reported financial difficulties and had Open Road Films pull the plug on the release date and delay the project's release indefinitely. This put the fate of the film and its planned sequel in a bout of uncertainty, with no clear plan of when or if the film would ever see the light of day.What I fully expected to happen with ""The Green Inferno"" was the unfortunate circumstance that has happened to a lot of films that get delayed indefinitely; they receive a low-key release directly to DVD or video-on-demand to little buzz and, regardless of quality, come and go with barely a whimper. However, when I saw an muscled ad campaign for the film over the summer, including various trailers in the theater, TV spots, and billboards, I was quite proud. Let the marketing guys and production companies for ""Green Inferno"" be commended for not letting a project simply die when the future seemed grim; this is how you promote a film that looked to be down and out.With that, ""The Green Inferno"" is a nasty, downright sick film, heavily reminiscent of the 1970's Italian gorefests that found their ways into seamy grindhouse theaters and drive-ins. It's such a bleak and uncommonly gory picture that the way it demands your attention is almost narcissistic. As wretched as it was, as bloodsoaked as it got, and as downright horrifying as it progressed, I simply couldn't shake the entire experience and probably won't for the remainder of the weekend.The film concerns a group of college activists, led by the bossy Alejandro (Ariel Levy), who travel from New York City to the Amazon to save a native tribe that is rapidly growing extinct. They plan to attack a construction company looking to bulldoze over the natives' land by assembling a protest before everyone on social media, launching their organization's popularity and message virally. Justine (Lorenza Izzo) gets wind of this plan and impulsively decides to attend. When the group is traveling over the Amazon, their small plane crashes and plunges deep into a jungle, populated by violent, cannibalistic natives that take them hostage in their small village.A film like this can't entirely rely on the violence of the cannibals to carry itself, which is why it's nice to see Eli Roth and Guillermo Amoedo pen some characters that are equal parts amusing and satirical. Roth and Amoedo more-or-less make these characters thinly draw caricatures of your run-of-the-mill, liberal collegiates that think their presence alone, protesting actions that they think are morally wrong, will change the actions of corporations, natives, and a million dollar operation. The two poke fun at this notion by making these characters wise, but cutely naive, at one moment speaking about their willingness to do good, and another moment, having one character proclaim she will make her next tattoo a new animal she discovers. The result is a genial nudge-in-the-hip to those who feel that everyone in the world would be better off if they just followed their own set of rules.The characters here, with the exception of one, are all likable in their own way. We have Aaron Burns' well-meaning, affable Jonah character, who tries to relax Justine when a situation goes awry and even Daryl Sabara of ""Spy Kids"" fame playing a goofy stoner, who's problems start and end at where to score potent Peruvian marijuana.The real attraction, however, is the gore, and there's plenty of it, so much so that I feel people who have grown accustomed to largely bloodless paranormal affairs will wince and grow nauseous at the liberal display of blood here. This is a brutally violent film, capitalizing off of the ability to go from calm to immediately bloody (consider the scene when a certain character's fate is finally revealed and how another character responds to it) in the same twenty seconds. This makes ""The Green Inferno"" incredibly unsettling and suspenseful, as it relies on these momentary instances that could completely alter a characters' fate as a method of grabbing you in and taking you for a ride.Admittedly, ""The Green Inferno"" is marketed as a bloodbath, and on that note, it does what it sets out to accomplish; it's a nasty, unrelenting piece of horror, made to make you squirm and uncomfortable at nearly every turn. All things considered, it holds up and makes for a great piece of late-night entertainment; Eli Roth throws caution to the wind here and makes one of the goriest mainstream American films since the remake of ""Evil Dead,"" and, surprisingly enough, succeeds at making this film interesting on more levels than just the bloodshed.",The Green Inferno
21,Red-Barracuda,Eli Roth returns with an uneven cannibal flick,5,21 June 2014,"Eli Roth is a director whose fame certainly goes before him. These days you don't really get many directors unashamedly dedicated to the horror genre like you did in years gone by. I like Eli Roth for this reason and I do find him a somewhat engaging, funny and entertaining guy. On the flip side I would have to say that I have found his output to be somewhat patchy and uneven. And frustratingly sparse at that. The Green Inferno is his first feature film as director since Hostel: Part II from way back in 2007! It's a long time to be out of the game. The question would have to be has he came back in a good way? Well, despite the undoubted promise of the central idea, it's a film that is kind of as frustrating as most of his other work.The basic idea here is to bring back a type of movie that only really existed briefly over thirty years ago. The cannibal film was a particularly notorious sub-genre. Most of the films got banned here in the UK; some still remain so to this day in their uncut forms. Their combination of graphic violence, sexual assault and real animal killing made them real bad boys of the horror genre. Cannibal Holocaust (1980) is the one film that Roth has mentioned in particular as an influence and for this viewer it is easily one of the most disturbing films I have ever seen. Its docudrama, found footage style mixed with a proper mean-spiritedness made it a pretty gruelling film but very well made. The Green Inferno takes a decidedly different approach to its material and it's not always a successful one. Where Holocaust was relentlessly confrontational, Roth's film is often quite jokey. This approach means that the tone overall fluctuates wildly but it definitely dissipates the overall threat posed by the cannibals. The choice of protagonists points to the change immediately in that it centres on a group of eco aware students who travel into the middle of the Amazonian rain-forest to stage a viral protest against some environment destroying workers, needless to say things take a bad turn and they wind up captive by a tribe of cannibals. The very fact that the film centres on a group of students makes this film surely the first cannibal film that doubles up as a teen movie! It's an awkward combination with a pretty ropey script and – the main girl played by Lorenzo Izzo aside - unlikable characters. The social commentary is not so unexpected for this type of movie, as Cannibal Holocaust had that too but it is modernised considerably here – the target is after all viral warriors who are more interested in being famous than for doing the right thing.So how does it work simply as a horror movie? Well, it certainly has its fair share of gory violence. But it has less impact than it should because of the silly jokey tone that permeates it, even once the students have been captured. Because they aren't taking their situation seriously enough, it's hard for us in the audience to either unfortunately. The on-location photography certainly adds a fair bit it has to be said and the cannibals themselves are quite distinctive too, in particular the more prominent members of the tribe were somewhat creepy. I can't help feeling though that if Roth had reigned in the silly stuff and went full-on with this material with a more disciplined approach then it would have made for a far better film. It feels slightly like a missed opportunity and I am sad to say this as I was really on this one's side and had quite a bit of optimism for it.",The Green Inferno
22,KineticSeoul,Eli Roth's dream project,3,17 October 2015,"If your a fan of Eli Roth and like super violent exploitation films from the 70's. With some awful acting and super crude humor that isn't really funny. You just might like this movie. When it comes to the main drive of this movie. It's basically violence revolving around activists that wants to protect the rain forest getting tortured and eaten by a tribe of cannibals. The first half is the build up of how the group plans and ends up in a area full of cannibals. And the other half is just people getting sliced up and tortured. Now when it comes to the characters it's just poorly done to the point you probably won't care. Yeah, that may sound a bit cold. But the characters seemed so fake...I think Eli Roth intentionally puts bad acting into his movie. It also has that formula of having a jerk in a group that messes everything up or you just can't help but detest. And the jerk in this movie is the ultimate jerk. Overall, if your an audience member that enjoy violent movies where the main point is people getting decapitated. This might be for you, although it's not as violent as other gruesome exploitation films from the 70's.3/10",The Green Inferno
23,Hellmant,Pretty horrific and memorable.,9,28 September 2015,"'THE GREEN INFERNO': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)The new horror flick from director Eli Roth (the man behind such popular slasher classics as 'CABIN FEVER' and 'HOSTEL'). It was written by Roth and Guillermo Amoedo (who also co-wrote 'AFTER SHOCK' and the upcoming 'KNOCK KNOCK', with Roth and Nicolas Lopez). The film is about a group of college activists, who are attacked by cannibals in the Amazon rainforest. It stars Lorenza Izzo (Roth's wife), Ariel Levy, Daryl Sabara (of 'SPY KIDS' fame), Aaron Burns, Nicolas Martinez and Sky Ferreira. The movie was inspired by notorious Italian cannibal flicks, from the 70s and 80s, like 'CANNIBAL HOLOCAUST' and 'CANNIBAL FEROX'. It's not quite as good as those, but it is a nice throwback. Justine (Izzo) is a New York City college student, who becomes fascinated by a campus activist group; and it's leader, Alejandro (Levy). She's invited to join the group, by a member named Jonah (Burns), and she reluctantly accepts. Alejandro has a plan to enter the Amazon rainforest, to stop a logging company from destroying all the land there, and thereby killing an ancient tribe. Once there, they become endangered by the people they went there to protect. The movie is pretty slow-paced, at first, during all of the story and character development. These scenes are also really poorly acted and cheesy; but I wonder how much of that is the director's intent, and how much is unintentional. The second half of the movie delivers all of the promised shock and gore. It's maybe not quite as disturbing, as all of the hype promised it would be, but it's pretty close. It's also full of dark comedy (like all of Roth's films) and it's a great tribute to exploitation cannibal movies of the past. It's not as good as 'CABIN FEVER', 'HOSTEL' or 'CANNIBAL HOLOCAUST', but it's still pretty horrific and memorable. There's also some kind of a message, hidden in there, about misguided activism, and big business destroying everything; but it's not what the movie is really about.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/553rKMZCAwE",The Green Inferno
24,Robert_duder,The sort of film I would expect from Eli Roth and I mean that in a good way,8,23 March 2016,"Eli Roth seems to have this fan base and this reputation of being a King of Horror and I get that he sort of set a genre with Hostel and Cabin Fever but what else has he done really worthwhile that people seem to look forward to his movies? Aftershock which he wrote was an awful awful movie. But I did like the idea behind The Green Inferno so I was hopeful as it has been a long time since I watched a horror/exploitation film. The Green Inferno definitely filled that void. It was essentially exactly what anyone could expect from the film reading the concept. It is creepy, gory, disturbing, twisted and best of all feels like it could happen. The key behind Roth's best work is that it makes you feel like this is the worst possible circumstance to a situation that is completely believable and The Green Inferno definitely captures that perfectly. You are dropped into this world and its terrifying and the fact that Roth uses real tribes people only makes the experience more terrifying.The cast is also quite good which helps as well. Lorenza Izzo is our scream queen and she is excellent. She is very believable and the perfect lead for the film and you will root for her survival. Ariel Levy is the guy she follows mostly blind into the jungle thinking she is doing what is right. Levy is underused mostly but he fits the role well and is good balance to Izzo's character. The best thing that can be said about the rest of the cast who get very, very little development is that they are believable...they are real so even if they are in place as fodder, you definitely connect with them as characters so that is enough. Ramón Llao, Antonieta Pari and Tatiana Panaifo are absolutely mesmerizing as three of the main tribes people in the film. They are so believable in their role that you'll wonder if they are even actors.Eli Roth doesn't just go for the throat in this film. Its not all about shock and awe and actually immerses you in this world of this tribe. I would even go so far as to say he creates the illusion that this tribe is only doing what they do. It isn't like they are evil or specifically villainous but literally doing what is natural for them. The jungle-scape is used perfectly and shot in Chile so the beautiful scenery helps build the disturbing climax. Fans of Roth can revel in this very well made and twisted horror thriller with plenty of gore and some definitively twisted moments. 8/10",The Green Inferno
25,bowmanblue,Cannibal Holocaust – the remake,6,8 June 2017,"Two questions: have you seen 'Cannibal Holocaust?' and 'Have you heard of Eli Roth?' Well, 'Cannibal Holocaust' is a disturbingly realistic film which many people forget almost single-handedly started the 'found footage' genre and Eli Roth is a modern horror writer/director. Put the two together and you get one hell of a grim bloodbath! So, as with 'Cannibal Holocaust' a group of youngsters end up deep within one of those jungles as yet unexplored by our iphone-wielding generation. In 'Cannibal Holocaust' they were making a documentary (hence the 'found footage' aspect), whereas here they're protesting for some socially just cause and end up crashing their plane. Once in this uncharted wilderness they encounter a bunch of locals who take quite a shine to them, i.e. they think these youngsters would look great with some fava beans and a nice chianti. Therefore, our hapless heroes quickly find themselves at the wrong end of a knife and fork and have to figure out a way of escaping before they're served up for brunch.Now, Eli Roth has had a bit of a 'spotted' career when it comes to his films. And, when I say 'spotted' I basically mean he made one awesome movie which everyone loved ('Cabin Fever') and since then almost every one of his films has been met with a certain level of distain. As a bit of a horror buff, I do tend to watch every movie which has his name on, as I'm certain that one day he'll recapture his former mojo and prove he wasn't just a one-hit wonder.It's hardly an inspiring plot, but then if you're reading this far then you're not probably not really into deep and meaningful character development or high-concept plot arcs. You want to know about the blood and guts. Trust me – you shouldn't be disappointed there. It's fair to say that it's not that much of a spoiler to say that not all the characters live long and happy lives after leaving the jungle and, when they go, they go in style (and by 'style' I mean in the most unspeakably gruesome way possible). You have the good characters, the bad characters and the scared characters, but – ultimately – all the characters share one trait – you probably won't really remember any of their names. If you've seen more than a couple of horror movies then you'll have a pretty good idea which ones are going to live the longest. Most are just here to end up on the wrong end of a fork! So, is 'The Green Inferno' the film that does this? No, not really. 'Cabin Fever' was witty, different and – of course – bloodthirsty. It's a horror classic that still stands up to this day. 'The Green Inferno' is simple, nicely disgusting, but nothing that hasn't really been done before. I actually kind of enjoyed it (what does that say about me?!) as it's one of those films where if you're into the subject material then it's going to entertain you for an hour and a half. It's hardly going to be remembered in the future (like 'Cannibal Holocaust') or set any new records for gore, but it's horror –plain and simple – and if you're as sick of the found footage genre, or those Japanese ghost-type films which seem to be infesting the genre these days, it makes a pleasant (if bloodthirsty) change from what else is out there. Maybe Roth was just a one-hit wonder, but he can still entertain a bit as well.",The Green Inferno
26,westsideschl,Hungry,7,29 February 2016,"If you were hooked (pun, ha ha) on the SAW movies then this film will be a good after meal snack. Yes, it was way overboard meal preparation and surprisingly realistic body snacks (in most cheap slasher/slice/dice films the prosthetics look artificial). Filming and acting were better than expected and sold me. Part of the reason the acting was somewhat capturing was the reality of a tropical Peruvian forest and the gusto in which the novice tribal people took to their roles. End result is nobody (including the eco provocateurs, tribes peoples, deforesters) came away smelling like roses, in fact, I would not have been displeased if, in the end, they were all munched upon by the resident leopard, vanquisher of evil. A couple of picky points that lowered the rating. First, every tribal member (no matter the age) was totally painted in red clay like pigment - all the time; not realistic given the humid conditions and time they would have needed to apply said substance. Second, all the women (and young girls) wore tops to cover their breasts which as we all know about tropical tribes - that just doesn't happen. Third, why would the village attack the construction armed mercenaries in a clearing given their stealth in a forest. Fourth, a lot of gaps foremost was Samantha's escape then we hear nothing more. Supposedly we are suppose to pay attention to tattoos. Suggestion: Watch again, afterwards, with cast commentary as it's more interesting than the film.",The Green Inferno
27,ironhorse_iv,"This cannibal movie did serve the audience something to chew over, but it was a bit of a gory cold shoulder",5,29 October 2015,"Inspired by Italian cannibal films of the late 1970s and early '80s, including the 1980's Cannibal Holocaust. This Mondo horror film from director Eli Roth, had a troublesome production since it was filmed in the deep jungles of Peru. Actors almost died, there, due to yellow fever, venomous snakes, and flooding. Things got more delay, when money issues arise, with the production company, Worldview Entertainment. While, the movie was made for a 2013 release date. It wasn't until fall 2015, that the movie got shown to audiences. That's really a bad sign. It didn't help that the general emphasis of this film focuses on various forms of shocking, often graphic acts of violence such as torture, rape, and cruelty mutilated. Many of this dark subject matter was often, a turn-off to the general audiences. So it was no surprise that this movie kinda went, under the radar to most people. I just happen to saw it, on a dime. The movie tells the story of a group of student activists travels to the Amazon to save an ancient native tribe from being wipe out. Only to find themselves, being fed to them, when they're mistaken for the enemy. Without spoiling the movie, too much; my opinion on it, is the same as the other films in the genre. I like, how the movie has themes of anti-imperialism and third world oppression. However, I found, bits of the film discussion, a bit annoying. I really didn't care, for a most of Eli Roth was trying to spill. A lot of the things, he was trying to make, a statement for or against; didn't make sense. Honestly, how does the small group of college students go from being a social activism organization for worker rights in the United States to environmentalism and protecting Indigenous peoples in South America? That's a large jump! I don't think, that's how social activism groups work. Also, its takes forever for the film to establish them, in Peru. Did we really need to spent, so much, time to see if the main actor, Justine (Lorenza Izzo) would join or not? Also, if Justine, only join to the organization to stop female genital mutilation in other countries; why could she care for a tribe that practice such rituals? It gets worst, toward the end of the film, when she still, has no problem, against the tribe, even after, they kill, nearly all her friends! Honestly, this doesn't make, much sense! Also, it's really hard to believe, that anybody would, follow, the leader of the group, Alejandro (Ariel Levy) to such extremes. He wasn't charismatic, or seem smart at all. Honorably, everything, he says, doesn't make a lick of sense. A good example is when he compare their fraudulent to an inside job, during 9/11. Wow, that's sound really jarring. I know, the movie wants to make him, as unlikeable as possible, but gees, scenes like, where is jerking himself off, or preventing their escape; really does seem out of character, even for him. The actor that played him, was horrible as well. I can barely understand, what he's saying, under his thick atrocious Latin American accent. The rest of the cast, while, mostly likable and well-acted, are still paper-thin stereotypes or caricatures. They are made to fit certain archetypes, such as the virgin, the whore, the stoner, the smart guy and last, the token black guy who dies first. They were somewhat impressive, but greatly misused. The cannibalism tribe, in the film was also, memorable. They were a real ingenious tribe in Peru that Eli Roth and crew met, while location scouting. They only agree to star as extras, when Eli Roth and the crew, agree to offer them, free food & supplies. Despite most of them had no concept of what a movie was, or how to act. For the most part, the non-cannibal tribe, did, their best. After all, Eli Roth did show them, a few cannibalism movies as example. The film is often criticism for its racial depiction of indigenous tribes, but in my opinion, is that just what exploitation films like this, does, best. After all, it's not a movie made for a political correction. While, the movie is bit, notorious for its violence. It's somewhat tamer than the older cannibalism movies. Yes, the movie starts out somewhat scary with its brutality sacrifice gory scene. However, the film get really, somewhat cheesy and clumsy, toward the middle, when the film felt like it, needed to lighten up. It starts to show, more, off-screen kills and more gimmicky, non-bloody deaths. It also started to get, really dumb. Scenes like where the tribe get super-baked, people getting cartoony done- explosive diarrhea, and out of place, dream-like jump screams were really stupid. It really took me, out of the film, due to how unrealistic, it was. At least, there wasn't any real animals being killed here, like Cannibal Holocaust. The film's links to Cannibal Holocaust are numerous. In addition to being one of Eli Roth's favorite horror films and the one that inspired his directing career. ""The Green Inferno"" title was actually the working title for Ruggero Deodato. However, this movie can't match the films that it paying homage to. Overall: This movie is a hard to chew film that most people will most likely, not like. For the very few, it might be worth-watching, but for me, it's wasn't that entertaining. It's not worth, looking at the Amazon, for.",The Green Inferno

29,Reno-Rangan,Their worst fear came from outside of their protest.,4,24 June 2017,"I have enjoyed the Eli Roth's films, even though in some cases I've rated them lower than average rating it had received. But this is not what I was looking for. This is a terror-horror, not actual horror with supernatural or sci-fi viruses. I've learnt the storyline before the watch, but the film was too violent. Even for most of the grown ups. Usually I won't feel a thing for film tortures, because 'fake' is the word always pops up in my mind whenever I see gore.Anyway, these days, killings in the films are considered entertainment. There is a separate group of fans who follow this kind of theme. But for me, the cannibalism was the one most disturbed. I have no issue with killings, but cannibalism brings totally uneasy. The story was decent, but intentional. You would guess most of the parts. But this film was not about that, just to make you go off of your seat with discomfortable and it succeeds on that.It was totally opposite to 'Embrace of the Serpent'. It was inspired by the 80s Italian film with the similar storyline. The film was about fighting for the survival of passengers after their plane got crashed in the Amazon forest who are now hunted by Amazon tribes. There's already a sequel on making titled 'Beyond the Green Inferno'. I don't think so, it is a recommendable film, but some are doing that for fun, and some to challenge their friends. Overall, a decent production, with casting, locations and visuals. But I won't favour it.4/10",The Green Inferno
30,sol-,Towering Inferno,7,6 March 2016,"Having flown to Peru to protest deforestation, a group of students are captured by a cannibalistic local tribe when their plane crashes in this gory horror film with some nods to 'Cannibal Holocaust'. The movie is primarily propelled by the irony of the students thinking that they are protecting the locals when in fact the locals are well equipped to fend off any threat, and there is something pointed in how they do not distinguish between the students and the lopping company workers. There is more than just that to the film though; it also attacks the naivety of idealistic students. Live video streaming is a further curious element as the leader of the group claims that their iPhones ""are our guns"" since the company will (hopefully) not hurt them if they are being recorded. There are also some thought-provoking plot twists. Whether the onslaught of grisly violence is necessary is another question though; it soon becomes a repetitive (how many ways can a human body be pulled apart?) and considering that the horror angle does not ignite until 40 minutes in, 'The Green Inferno' may have been more effective as a compact short film. It is certainly nowhere near as powerful as 'Cannibal Holocaust', but then again, it is decidedly different. In 'Holocaust', the characters bring their slaughter upon themselves, whereas here (almost) all the victims have the best of intentions. This in turn makes 'The Green Inferno' more chilling, if not necessarily better, as the cannibals clearly do not realise their inhumanity. Flawed but interesting stuff overall, though not for the faint of heart.",The Green Inferno
31,tomgillespie2002,Just gets on your nerves,3,5 July 2016,"Ever since writer/director/producer/actor Eli Roth made audiences squirm with unimpressive yet popular horror sequel Hostel: Part II and directed arguably the best of the three faux-trailers shown in between Robert Rodriguez's Planet Terror and Quentin Tarantino's Death Proof in their failed experiment Grindhouse back in 2007, the once-horror prodigy has fallen under the radar. For his big comeback, he turned to a long-dead sub-genre for inspiration - the cannibal flick. These blood-spattered, animal-torturing movies churned out in Italy during the 1970's and early 80's are clearly movies Roth holds dearly, especially Cannibal Holocaust (1980). But the main issue with taking heavy inspiration from what are generally appalling movies - Ruggero Deodato's masterpiece aside - is that you're going to end up with another appalling movie.Justine (Lorenza Izzo), a freshman at Columbia University, starts to involve herself with the on-campus social activism after her eye is caught by the group's hunky leader Alejandro (Ariel Levy). Soon enough, Justine, Alejandro and the rest of the bearded, bead-wearing hipster types that make up the group are heading to the Amazon rainforest to highlight and hopefully stop an evil corporation who are tearing down chunks of a United Nations-protected area and massacring the native tribes in the process. When their plane crashes and poisoned darts start to fly into their necks, the group discover that the local tribe would rather be feasting on their flesh or mutilating their genitals.Visually, The Green Inferno looks rather splendid with cinematographer Antonio Quercia nicely capturing both the lushness and the natural brutality of the Amazon. There are also some very convincing effects work done during the scenes of dismemberment and eye-gouging, with plenty to satisfy gore-hounds. But aside from the technical aspects, there is little else positive to say about the film. Izzo is the only one who convinced me that she was a professional actor, with the rest a bunch of extremely annoying lambs for the slaughter, struggling with an awkward script. While I didn't care much for either Cabin Fever (2002) or the Hostel movies, there was enough there to established Roth as a film-maker of promise. Here, it seems he's lost his way, fumbling around from one scene of gore to the next and managing to defy all sense of logic at the same time. Where Cannibal Holocaust got under your skin, The Green Inferno just gets on your nerves.",The Green Inferno
32,TheMovieDiorama,The Green Inferno sets the activism world ablaze with Roth's juvenile and insufferable approach.,3,7 October 2019,"He needs to get over himself, as it's tarnishing fairly decent material that could've been so much more. Apparently paying homage to Italian cannibal features such as 'Cannibal Holocaust', yet clearly misunderstanding their original purpose. Social commentary on modern civilisation by comparing Western society to that of the indigenous ""savages"". Exploiting every aspect of sensationalism to explore a new culture. Time has passed though. Nearly three decades in fact. Deforestation threatens these tribes, wiping them out. Yet Roth, not one to shy away from controversy, depicts these ""savages"" in such a one-dimensional approach that the film evolves into a harmful message in neo-colonialism. Not to mention its technically inept. A group of social-activists set out to Peru to stop lumbering companies from destroying the Amazon, only to be then taken by a tribe of cannibals to which they must try and escape.Roth's filmography has always revolved around gore. 'Cabin Fever', 'Hostel' and even 'Thanksgiving' to a certain extent. The man has an eye for blood, and exploits it particularly well in this. Limbs ripped apart. Eyes gouged out. Spears piercing through necks. Enough to keep the squeamish looking away, but weaker than strawberry jam for mature audiences. And that's primarily due to the woeful acting. Diabolical. Not a single acceptable performance. The screams of pain were disingenuous. The general conversations were stilted. The expressions non-existent. Laughable. Never thought I'd see a cannibalistic comedy. What doesn't assist in Roth's screenplay? All characters were unlikeable. Detestable even. The students, the indigenous tribe, the private militia and the petrochemical company. Heck, even Justine's father was depicted as a pompous UN official. Absurdly ostentatious. When characters say such fruitful lines of dialogue such as ""activism is gay"", well you're about to unleash this beast.The entire purpose of this exploitative mess was misguided, commentating on nothing. Roth's involvement only further descended this conflagration into the realms of immaturity. Puerility. Unsophistication. ""Yeah I wanted to the film to look like a Werner Herzog or Terrence Malick film"". Firstly, don't even compare yourself to those acclaimed masters. Secondly, they use subtlety. Where's the nuance here Eli? The satirical aura is instantly diminished when you force characters to masturbate over savaged peers and explode their guts whilst profusely apologising. Something tells me that scene hits more notes thematically than anything else shown. Asinine it its purest form.The conclusive one-sided battle exhumes the wrong message, with a consequential taped interview falsifying the entire ordeal. As if Roth was forced to implement a positive result on social-activism. Foreshadowed right from the initial journey to Peru. Not only that, but the credits include the Twitter handles of the cast and crew whilst also setting up a potential sequel. Never questioned life so much.Despite the homage to gory flicks of old, enveloped in gloriously green cinematography, The Green Inferno infuriates more than it entertains. Cumbersome, predictable and incredibly weak. With its infantile narrative exposure, Roth cements himself as a director who is self-important as much as he is amateurish.",The Green Inferno

I'm waiting for something, that will really blow my away from this guy, if you discount the gory brilliant horror shocker, Hostel, which was the pinnacle of his movie making. It's the one, which stands out, among the rest of his credits. TGI isn't that something. I will say this, about The Green Inferno, It's truly a standalone, impressive, original, but is impressive, in it's originality. While also from my point of view, I'm at a curiousness, as to why he wrote this story. If still remembering the film, for it's in your face, and disgusting violence, it isn't a badly made film, for which you pretty much know how the fate of our young activist, environmental group, led by a selfish, callous hearted male hottie, who sexually entices the vulnerable led beauty/antagonist, Izzo, to take a trip, will ensue. As with these films, there are those cliche's of young 17+ characters, we've grown to accept and loathe, and cliche's of story. Characters like, fatty over homonic guy, stupid vulnerable girl, seedy unshaven host, bright, sensitive mature girl, etc.. The fatty guy character I liked, before ending on the cannibalistic villages menu, Roth again, using innocent kids to do despicable things. The film is quite terrifying, as in it's shock story/subject, and it succeeds in it's ability to shock and terrify, with some impactful moments of cruel violence, as in the plane crash. Roth, like Tarantino, indulges, in their homage to some movie titles. Richard Burgi (Hostel 2), a too gooder actor is wasted in this as Izzo's father. Overall, TGI, really adds up to a semi achievement, of exploitive and shock violence, a nasty little shocker, but that's it, and the Sid Haig looking guy/cannibalistic villager, with the world's largest metal ring through his head, bares a colorful body painted wardrobe, you won't forget.",The Green Inferno

37,subxerogravity,Feels like an old Homage to the Cannibal films of the 80s combine with Torture porn,6,26 September 2015,"There is a message in the movie, but it's feels like more an ironic slap to the face for American society than any thing else.One of the masters of the Torture porn movement, Eli Roth uses the Green Inferno to bring back a genre most of the mainstream public my not be aware exist and makes it art by taking out most of the exploitation elements and replaces it with a view on environmental rights.A group of white kids(Actually, they are Spanish kids with thick accents) head to the rain Forrest to radically stop bulldozers from tearing it down, only to get captured by a native tribe that seems to love white meat.Best part of this semi-horror film was watching the natives eat human flesh like it's no different from a pig(and you'll notice the village is littered with pigs). Just causally cooking a feast that consist of the extremely stuck up liberals with a side order of the privileged princesses. Roth has given me a strange indulgence as I could not wait for all of them to die. It was an ensemble of college kids I could not wait to see killed.If you like cannibal films at all you should check out the Green Inferno, it ups the whole genre thanks to the use of modern day special effects.At the same time if you ever wanted to punch an obnoxious hipster in his face than you should use this movie as therapy.",The Green Inferno
38,jtindahouse,Brutal but lacking the memorability of 'Hostel',8,18 October 2015,"It just so happens that this was my second Eli Roth (and also his wife Lorenza Izzo) film in the last week with 'Knock Knock' being the other. The films couldn't be more different however. If you told someone unfamiliar that they were made by the same man they'd think you were crazy. 'The Green Inferno' is more in line with what we've come to know Roth for. Brutal storytelling where anything can and does go. The one thing missing from this that I usually love the most about his films, is that I never cared for any of the characters. Usually he does such a fantastic job of making us care for the characters before they swiftly meet there fate. Here though, I can honestly say I never did, and furthermore I never really felt like he tried to make me care. Perhaps he realised it was a lost cause when he considered this was after all a bunch of activists we are talking about. Not an easy group of people to portray as likable I'd imagine.That aside though every other brilliant piece of filmmaking we expect from Roth is present. The unpredictable script (anything can and does happen in the blink of an eye), the extremely violent scene that even the toughest of viewers winces at (despite no doubt denying it afterwards) and the unique ending where things that would never even cross other filmmakers minds usually happen.To be honest I was a little let down overall by 'The Green Inferno'. It's undoubtedly a very good movie but I think I'd built it up so much in my head and expect such a high standard from Roth that pretty much anything was going to be a let down to some degree. It's hard to put my finger on exactly what more I wanted out of it, but for me I don't think it's going to have quite the lasting effect 'Hostel' did. Still a very fine film worth giving your time to.",The Green Inferno
39,jadavix,Pretty boring and pointless,5,31 July 2016,"Characters in horror movies - particularly slashers, for example - are generally unlikable. They're also generally stereotypes, like the stuck up rich girl who hates the goody two shoes virgin who ends up the hero, the jock, the prankster, the sensitive type. What I like about Eli Roth's horror movies is that his characters are always distinctly obnoxious and unlikable. It's as though he knows it's cliché, so accentuates their negative traits as a knowing nod to the viewer.In ""The Green Inferno"", it's less that they're all horrible in their own way than it is that they all suffer from the shared delusion that rich Americans trespassing into indigenous South American territory could somehow help the people living there. Many people have read this as a direct rebuttal to all the activists out there, a stinging diatribe against their existence, but the movie doesn't really have much of a point to make. It's a gore flick, and not a particularly interesting one at that. There isn't even any memorable violence in it. It's one of those movies that, if you know what it's about, there's not much point in seeing it. Nothing about it takes you by surprise or shows you anything you couldn't have imagined in your head while reading a one- line plot description.",The Green Inferno

FYI: He is also married in real life to the leading lady, Lorenza. Lorenza plays a college student that hears Ariel making a speech on campus about saving the rain forests in the Amazon, which gets her all excited about helping those poor people. She decides to volunteer for his next trip, which she soon comes to regret. John plays a fellow volunteer activist that goes on the journey and Richard plays Lorenza's father, who tries to dissuade her, in vain. After they do their protest stunt down in Peru, and they are flying back home is when things go bad. Their plane has problems and crashes right down in the middle of the rain forest that they were just trying to save. The problems continue when cannibals are the first responders to their crash. FYI: The natives in the movie have never been filmed or photographed by westerners before their debuts here and they are not real cannibals. Be warned, there are scenes of torture, mutilation and human bodies being eaten. This is not one you want to take the little kiddies to see. I must say, among all the grisly violence there is a humorous scene involving one of the victims having marijuana in their body before being eaten that is quite funny. It's rated ""R"" for violence, torture, grisly disturbing images, sexual content-including nudity-language and drug use and has a running time of 1 hour & 40 minutes. I enjoyed it and would buy it on DVD.",The Green Inferno

When the group is returning to civilization, the plane blows-up and crashes into the forest. Soon the survivors discover that they are not alone and they are abducted by a tribe of cannibals.The films of Eli Roth are an acquired taste. But there's one thing you really can't deny and that is that Eli Roth is an avid and obsessive lover of the genre and that clearly shows in every film he delivers. ""The Green Inferno"" is a giant homage "" love letter, even "" to the temporarily popular trend of Italian cannibal movies from the late 70s & early 80s. This very secluded horror niche contains relatively few titles, but each and every single one is a notorious and bona fide cult classic. The most infamous and influential one is, of course, Ruggero Deodato's ""Cannibal Holocaust"".Once again, Roth is really great at the psychological thriller and general ""f--up upt-ness"" of the film. As expected, the film delivers lots of gruesome gore (dismemberment, eye-gouging and decapitation aplenty). It also has comedy, with a mixture of the bizarre that is guaranteed to shock viewers.

42,drownnnsoda,"Upperclass white kids go from urban jungle to ""jungle,"" jungle",8,25 September 2015,"Long awaited and long discussed, ""The Green Inferno"" has a group of university students in New York City venturing into the Amazon to stop an industrial corporation from destroying the rainforests that house ancient tribes. After the protest, a plane crash leaves a group of survivors stranded in the rainforest, only to be taken in by a tribe of cannibals who unfortunately mistake them for the logging crew.In the tradition of the cannibal films of yore, ""The Green Inferno"" is as much a throwback as it is a clever take on our contemporary culture of social justice warriors— the film is sometimes one, sometimes the other, and sometimes both. The main premise is a bunch of upperclass New York City collegiates taking it upon themselves to go into the jungle and ""save the rainforests"" and their people; the cannibal angle is what gives the film its real meat (pun intended), and what begins as a wry social commentary spins out of control into an outright cannibal film, only to eventually turn in on itself by its conclusion, in which the whole violent ordeal becomes transmuted for the very values that kids' protest claimed to stand for.The notion of the cannibal film having these social connotations is not exactly new, and the setup of these films by nature provide a lot of room for filmmakers to hit on the more anthropological subtexts (take ""Cannibal Holocaust,"" clearly a major influence on this film, for example). The nuances that Roth employs here in that regard are actually surprisingly clever without being too obvious or flashy, which I appreciated. In terms of cinematography, there are a lot of slick, breathtaking overhead shots of rainforest, as well as effective and retro lens flares and other unnerving nuances that emphasize the horror happening on the ground.As for the main course, we have a heavy heaping of violence here— which, if you know Eli Roth, it's what he does. I was never a terribly big fan of his ""Hostel' films, though I did like ""Cabin Fever,"" and I felt like this film was a perfect synthesis of narrative and thematic detail with Roth's signature exploits; in other words, yes, it is gory, but there is also enough going on in the subtext to . Yes, it is gore galore, but it's also very realistically done, with impressive special effects from Greg Nicotero. The first on-screen murder is inarguably the most graphic, and I was genuinely disturbed by it.The performances are great here— Lorenza Izzo makes a perfect leading lady of Justine, and the supporting cast is all fantastic and believable. Daryl Sabara is one of the easily- recognizable ones from ""Spy Kids"" and Rob Zombie's ""Halloween"" remake, and singer Sky Ferreira also appears in the beginning scenes of the film as Justine's cynical yet likable, always-sounds-stoned roommate. The innumerable villagers who Roth brought in to make up the tribe are also fantastic.Overall, I felt this was a very noble effort from Roth, and I say that as someone who is not even that big of a fan of his. It's gratuitously violent, which is the main draw for fans of cannibal splatter flicks, but it also juggles astute cinematography and thoughtful thematic elements that make it a more well-rounded film than you might think. That's not to say that one should expect some quiet meditation on culture and anthropology, because that's not at all what the film is, but the subtext is what shapes it into a formidable horror film. 8/10.",The Green Inferno

Justine is attracted to their leader, named Alejandro. Another guy named Jonah invites Justine to their next meeting. There Alejandro proposes their next mission--to fight against Amazon rainforest deforestation in Peru, which would kill some native tribe. Their plan is to provoke the logging corporation, film it all, and put it online. Of course the logging corporation is protected by an armed militia.A dozen or so take the trip, among them Justine, Jonah, Alejandro and his girlfriend, who is jealous that Justine has a crush on him, two lesbian girls, some goofy guy, another guy and some others. There's also some rich Peruvian guy who is their contact and organizes the trip, which starts on plane, then moped, then boat. They arrive at the site, chain themselves to trees, Justine who was given a defective lock is grabbed and threatened with a gun to her head. She is actually the daughter of a UN diplomat and the treehugers used her and set her up. Nevertheless, they succeed and post the event online.On their way back on a plane over the jungle, the plane's engine blows up and they end up crashing in the middle of the jungle. Some of the kids don't survive the crash. Suddenly someone else arrives, next things they know, arrows start flying and the kids are sedated.When they wake up they find themselves taken to a village by the river by some aborigines. They are particularly interested in the hair of the girls. Jonah who is rather heavy is chopped to pieces, his body fried and then consumed. The rest are caged and will try to escape before they're eaten.It's not a bad idea to bring us a cannibal movie, it's been a while since those have been made. The problem with The Green Inferno is the awful cast that for the most part gives pretty lousy performances. So you don't really connect with these people, let alone root for them. The best actors are actually the natives, who are on task and appear believable. Another problem is that this movie is not particularly scary or gruesome. It lacks a crudeness needed to make it effective. The story is pretty decent. There are some twists that make it richer than one expects it to be, except for the silly marijuana nonsense. I appreciate the spirit and enthusiasm of The Green Inferno, it just could have used more violence, gore, (female) nudity, scares.",The Green Inferno
45,a_chinn,"Eli Roth's cannibal holocaust is sadly routine, but still entertaining",6,21 April 2020,"A group of annoying self-important college student activists venture into the jungles of Peru to stop deforestation and protect the gentle native people by chaining themselves to bulldozers and steaming it all online. These same vegetarian college students' ideals are tested when their plane crashes and a group of cannibals capture them, intent on eating their liberal bleeding hearts. Roth made a name for himself with ""Cabin Fever,"" a slasher film with a virus instead of a slasher. He made an even bigger splash with ""Hostel,"" which was unfairly dismissed as gratuitous torture porn, but is actually a clever take on international extreme horror cinema and added American horror film tropes, which he then used to play against audience expectations (if you've seen the film, you know what I'm talking about, but if you haven't seen it I don't want to spoil anything). Roth knows horror cinema inside and out, so I was excited to see his take on the disreputable cannibal horror sub-genre of the 70s and 80s (i.e. ""Cannibal Holocaust,"" ""Cannibal Ferox,"" ""The Mountain of the Cannibal God,"" etc.). Unfortunately, with ""The Green Inferno"" he's crafted a love letter that's faithful to its source material, but fails to be much of a shocker and even more disappointingly fails to play against genre topes and audience expectations, which is what he's done so well in his previous films. The film does not offer many surprises, which was a major disappointment. His prior film felt as if anything could happen and usual rules of mainstream cinema did not apply. I suppose cannibal films in general do not follow mainstream film expectations, but for anyone who's seen a few cannibal films, this one won't offer any surprises. The gore is pretty gruesome (that's good or bad depending upon your taste) and the film does boast the use of authentic native people, which is somewhat controversial in itself (Roth reportedly showed them Ruggero Deodato's ""Cannibal Holocaust"" to explain what he was making), but although ""Green Inferno"" is a technically well crafted horror film, it's nowhere as original as Roth's prior films (which is also how I felt about his subsequent film, the tame remake of ""Death Wish"").",The Green Inferno
46,davidmvining,"Not really good, but better than I thought it would be.",6,22 November 2019,"I liked this a lot more than I thought I would, which is to say that I didn't think it was terrible.The story of a bunch of well-meaning college activists who travel to the Peruvian Amazon to stop loggers from bulldozing a native tribal village and then get eaten by those villagers is that makings of pure schlock, and that's exactly what Eli Roth delivered.There are some consistent issues that plague the movie a bit, though. The biggest problem is its structure and general disinterest in engaging with the few ideas it has, especially once you get into the second half. The other is that Roth doesn't seem to be a particularly good director of actors. Especially in the first half, when everyone isn't screaming endlessly, performances are universally stilted and awkward.Still, there's a deep cynical irony that permeates the film and actually drives it into comedy. The movie is usually categorized as a horror film, and I get the impression that Roth would disagree. The movie is definitely a comedy, even at its most gruesome. Roth hates every single one of his characters that he sends into the inferno. He finds the organizer to be pure scum (which everyone realizes he is). He finds the fat kid pathetic. He finds the vegan stupid. Even the main character is a naïf who should know better, so she probably kind of deserves what comes to her. Roth is kind of a sick man (as you might expect from a guy who films someone getting their eyeballs ripped from their sockets and then every limb hacked off followed by the head, which all precedes the body being smoked and eaten), so I don't think it's a large stretch to imagine that he simply took glee in conceiving the different ways for these people to die.It seems like a weird movie to not hate, isn't it? Well, I kinda liked it. Because there's a clear delineation between fantasy and reality, it's easy for me to watch horrific acts of violence in a film and potentially enjoy it. It's really a question of tone, which Roth largely seems to hit here.

Seeing this movie, without adequate prior knowledge about who Eli Roth is, makes me wonder what as it that enabled this stupid movie to steal a spot, as brief as it was, in the Box Office a few weeks back. Okay I admit I'm not really into the gory violent sub genre of horrors, particularly the cannibals. Still I braved this movie out of curiosity. But then again, me braving this movie didn't really pay anything since the movie was so bad, going as far as being stupid even. As a horror, it didn't even get to scare me, although it successfully grossed me out of the gory violence. The technicalities show that this movie lacks very much, as though the production was just a byproduct of a daydreaming delusion. The coloration choice is very bad. Being very bright for a horror?

I don't particularly find his films that enjoyable, yet I sit down and watch all of them when they come out. I believe the man receives too much hype and credit from some horror fans because quite frankly, he hasn't done anything to deserve it. He sure as hell knows his horror films though, that is for damn sure. But what has he given us? Cabin Fever and Hostel are his two most well known films, they're decent, at best. Yet time after time I hear about how he's going to save the genre. Well he hasn't and he won't. Look no further than he last two entries. Knock Knock, the seductive thriller that stars Keanu Reeves as a cheating husband being tortured by his sex partners and The Green Inferno, Roth's homage to the cannibal genre. Did the cannibal genre need a film to homage it? That's up for debate, as is the quality of this film. The Green Inferno was actually shot 2 years ago, but has been stuck in release limbo since then. It has finally seen the light of day and as it is with any film that has been held back, it doesn't live up to the hype. Is it bloody? Yes. Is it sadistic? Yes. Is it a good movie? Not really. I can't really blame it on Roth though, the genre itself is nothing to wag a stick at. He manages to hit the same notes as all those other films do. They just seem tired and repetitive. He even acknowledges those films in the credits, so I would recommend seeing those movies instead. Our characters are in a plane crash somewhere in the jungle. The survivors are immediately captured by a tribe of cannibals and are held prisoner until the tribe feels the need to eat. One by one our characters bite the dust, either by being eaten, or killed while trying to escape. Either way, it doesn't look good for anyone. Nor does it look good for the audience as they have to sit through an hour of repetitive screams, decapitations and sleep inducing darts. For a film mainly about killing people and eating them, it's pretty routine.The cast of characters range from tolerable to down right annoying. Two characters that we are suppose to like are the tolerable ones. One of them being Roth's wife, who was also one of the seductive torturers from Knock Knock. Here she is put through the wringer and dehumanized. Roth also seems to like the idea of showing his wife's naked body to as many people as possible. On the other end of the spectrum is the down right annoying lead activist, who has secrets...oooohhhhhh. Even in the face of death, the man still manages to be more despicable than the savages. What makes it worse is that we are not allowed to relish in any torture given to him. I won't explain, but the film doesn't seem interested in making this guy suffer at all, it's everyone else that has to take it. With the exception of the first kill and eating, this film was surprisingly tame. I'm more shocked at how the film did not disgust me than I am with the acts depicted. When one character is eaten alive by the tribe, it's basically a shot for shot lift from Day of the Dead. This idea behind what happens is obviously more horrific than what Roth can come up with, but he still tries to one up us. It doesn't work out in the end and older cannibal films like Ferox or Holocaust are more shocking than what The Green Inferno can offer.Green Inferno is a near miss for me, despite it falling almost perfectly in line with what it intended to do. Oh...and I really like the title of the film. I don't know why. It's the best thing about the movie.",The Green Inferno

I was slightly disappointed that it wasn't released in cinemas (which I was hoping for), but was glad to get it on DVD anyway as it was on my 'must have' Horror Film list!The film is about a group of students who go off into the Amazonian Jungle to protest against construction workers destroying the native peoples environment with bulldozers.

Although I wasn't expecting to be extremely outrageous, even with films now that are shocking in terms of graphic violence have to have limits somewhere or they'd get banned & never shown!The gore in this film was top notch! It didn't disappoint with the violence especially when one of the student got brutally chop & eaten by the tribes folk! It was nasty but bloody gory fun!! The funniest part of this film had to be the drugs getting stuffed into one of the victims, cooked then given to the tribes folk who became 'high' as a distraction! It was clever to say the least! The rest of the film was pretty good & shockingly brutal! The one thing I didn't like was 'female soul survivor' ending! 1 of the things I hate in films like this!

Well, those terrible films didn't need an homage, most of them needed to be forgotten, like this. It's easy to see why it wasn't widely released, or liked. It's basically a rip off of Cannibal Feroux, only worse. The characters are shallow, the situations are stupid. This is nearly unwatchable, even the violence is so cartoony as to be laughable. Torture porn such as this should simply be pushed aside and forgotten. The little stupid scare at the end was ridiculous and expected.

But you packed it in. There was hardly a dull moment. I liked all the twists too.But what was up with the digital photography and use of excess light? Why did you shoot all of it in daylight? It would have been scarier if the whole film happened in the dark. I got the impression that the activist people were too close to civilization all along. Also, the tribe seemed to be too small. There should have been more of them there. And they did not look that scary or anything. But I think I understand what you did. Why make a cheap visual imitation of Predator and Apocalypse Now when you know you couldn't beat them.The cast was pretty good overall. But Ariel Levy was awful. He was trying to do the whole Brando thing, but he was just lame. You need to be careful when you're casting actors in such important roles.But Lorenza Izzo was great. Decent actress. And what a beautiful woman. I am glad you did not use her as a sex object like Sigourney Weaver in Alien or Sandra Bullock in Gravity. Though you could have.Btw, are you a hardcore capitalist or something? I mean, the film does portray activists in pretty poor light, man. You could have done more with the whole female genital mutilation thing. You did take a dig at third world cultures. The film was quite politically incorrect. Though you did balance it off by making fun of Jews. Don't think I didn't notice that.The dig at Che Guevara and all the social commentary, you did stick your neck out, dude. I am impressed. And the violence was gruesome. My god, it really was quite shocking. I will definitely watch it on Blu Ray. I'm sure it would look better than the pirated DVD that I watched.Best Regards, Pimpin.(6.5/10)",The Green Inferno
54,gedikreverdi,A very good film as I'd expect of Eli Roth,7,9 February 2021,"It was an extremely nice watch. The actors did an amazing job and it was so unexpected because in such movies you always expect sub-bar acting skills. Especially the anxious blonde girl who slit her own throat after she found out her bowl contained some human remains after eating some pork scrap was an amazing actor. They flew to Peru to draw attention to a local amazon tribe that's threatened by some oil company. They wanted to do a live show in the leadership of Alejandro who founded the student club. They arrived to the area with a small plane and a boat trip. They chained themselves to the trees and got arrested. When they were sent back with another small plane, their engine caught fire and their planet crashed in the middle of the forest. Some people flew out of the plane in midair and the pilot was beheaded by a tree. They then encountered the red painted matriarch cannibal locals. The annoying girlfriend of Alejandro got speared in the neck and died then they were kept in the pork shed. The chubbiest one got chopped up on a boulder. His limbs eyes and tongue and then got beheaded. They cooked him in a dome shaped oven. One of the girls wanted to escape but the guard threw a poisoned arrow and knocked her off. Alejandro turned out to be a hypocrite egoistical maniac. They checked the three and the virgin Justine painted like a local. The girl with very good acting skills took her own life and they are her too but before that they stuck a pack of weed down to her stomach to make them high. It worked and they got munchies and ate one of those that Alejandro poisoned with the spear not to be alone while Justine and Daniel the bald guy escaped. She almost drowned in the muddy river and got back to the place where the place wreck was and found the rest on the tip of poles and they got caught too. The local boy saved Justine because she gave him her flute necklace and killed Daniel out of pity because he was tortured with ants. She ended up in the middle of the war between militias and locals and got saved. She didn't talk about locals being cannibal back home and praised them on the contrary and didn't help Alejandro to escape. At the very end his sister called her saying that they found a satellite image showing his brother alive. Peruvian amazon scenes, the waterfall, the river and the jaguar was amazing and acting was amazing. Most people have it and rate it low just because they hate gore movies and it deserves a much higher than this rating.",The Green Inferno
55,IonicBreezeMachine,"Eli Roth's fourth film improves upon his first three, while still maintaining the Roth trademark.",6,24 March 2021,"Justine (Lorenza Izzo) is a college freshmen who finds herself fascinated with a social activism group headed by the enigmatic Alejandro (Ariel Levy). The group heads to the Amazon to stage a protest against developers using mercenaries to displace the native Yaje tribes and bulldoze the area, but Justine finds Alejandro's tactics to be dangerous and life threatening. On the flight back the plane's engine fails resulting in Justine and the other activists crashing in the jungle. Those who survive are soon taken prisoner by the Yaje and are subjected to horrors of torture and cannibalism.Following Hostel Part II's disappointing box office performance, Roth took a hiatus from directing. While Roth did have some writing and acting credits during this time, notably his role as The Bear Jew in Inglorious Basterds, Roth's directorial work was stalled with projects such as Endangered Species and the Stephen King adaptation Cell either being put on the backburner or taken over by another director. The Green Inferno was supposedly meant to be Roth's big comeback picture following his hiatus but financial problems with the distributor meant the film ended up in limbo and sat on a shelf for two years before being released. Now finally free of the hurdles does the movie serve as a comeback? It won't win over many (if any) of Roth's detractors, but it'll remind those with less animosity towards the man why he often receives praise.With the Green Inferno, Roth largely trades his abrasive sex and drugs crazed stereotypes for abrasive two faced characters (and maybe one or two drug crazed stereotypes just to pad out the body count). The Green Inferno is heavily inspired by the Italian cannibal movies of the 1970s (down to the fact the movie is named after the film within a film from Cannibal Holocaust) and like those movies it has beautiful jungle locations covered in blood and gore from duplicitous characters who wallow in their own hypocrisy.Lorenza Izzo as Justine is really quite good in the lead role and makes for an effective anchor/proxy for the audience to react to the horror. Ariel Levy is also quite good as Alejandro who plays up the sinister side of his character and makes his extreme activist character simultaneously sinister and threatening. The rest of the cast is decent for what's given to them. Richard Burgi has a brief two scene cameo as Justine's father and is a welcome addition. I also rather liked Nicolás Martínez as fellow activist Daniel who made me feel sympathy for a character that for all intents and purposes didn't have that much to him. The rest of the cast is mostly their as a way fro Roth to fit in his usually tropes of crass dialogue and odd humor, but in this case Roth dials it back so it works better here than it did in Hostel.The story structure will be very familiar to anyone who's even passingly familiar with old Cannibal movies. The movie takes us from campus demonstrators, to corporate mercenaries, to finally cannibalistic nightmares and it's basically as the title suggests a journey into a green colored Hell. While the characters don't raise themselves too far above the typically kill fodder in Eli Roth film's they do give just enough character to give weight to the violence we witness. The Cannibal scenes are effectively gory and well done, but I wouldn't call The Green Inferno scary. It's definitely a shocking movie and keeps you invested to the end, but there's really no points in the movie where you feel fear. With that said however, the movie's adventure in violent carnage is pretty effective and still manages to be engaging.The Green Inferno represents a massive improvement for Roth following his underwhelming Hostel films. While the movie doesn't stray too far from Roth's established wheelhouse he does break a bit from his conventions and makes a movie that feels unmistakably his while still giving us something we feel like he hasn't done before.",The Green Inferno

I'll start by saying this movie, for the most part, was exactly what I expected. A bunch of idiot college students going to a place they have no business going to, and they end up falling into a nightmare.
Some of the gruesome parts of the movie weren't remotely realistic, IMO,,, we've seen close to the same violence and gore on TWD, GoT and the like. Other parts could definitely be upsetting, depending on your tolerance level.",The Green Inferno

The Green Inferno is not only a terrible movie, but a lazy bore of a terrible movie at that. This is supposed to be a tribute to Cannibal Holocaust, perhaps the most infamous gore picture of all time. This had potential to be, at least, mesmerizingly terrible. I'm talking about serious effort. Acting is porn level bad, and by that I mean really low-rung porn acting. The tribe of cannibals looked so uninspired. The costume department looked like nothing more than a constant stream of ""More red-dye please"". Ugh. No redeeming qualities here at all.",The Green Inferno

It is a simple plan but things can go wrong.Now this is from Eli Roth ('Hostel') who as a film maker tends towards the slash and gore type of experiences – and this is no exception. The violence is quiet graphic and I actually wasn't expecting it. The Amazon tribe are all played by real natives and that gives this a real sense of reality. Some of the plot is a bit far fetched and some of the acting was just about OK.The thing is I am still split –a bit like some of the protagonists ooops– over whether I really like this or not. If you are a fan of the genre then I hope you will not be disappointed but if you are looking for something with an eco message about cuddly 'indians' being exploited, then best advice is to avoid this one.",The Green Inferno
59,Vivekmaru45,This film is a modern update of the 1980 Ruggero Deodato film Cannibal Holocaust.,10,8 July 2016,"For what it's worth, the film lives up to the expectations of any gore-fanatic. But if you are interested in jungle tribes, you might want to check out these films: The Naked Prey (1965), The Emerald Forest (1985 based on a true story) and Where The River Runs Black(1986).The plot of the film is similar to Cannibal Holocaust. Justine, a college freshman at Columbia University, becomes interested in a social activism group on her campus, led by Alejandro and his girlfriend, Kara. The group plans a trip to the Amazon rainforest to stop a company from logging and obliterating ancient native tribes there; the goal is to film the logging crews with cell phones and stream footage to raise awareness.The operation is funded by a drug dealer named Carlos, who takes the group of students to Peru via plane. They arrive in the Amazon and head to a logging site where they begin their protest, chaining themselves to bulldozers while filming the loggers cutting down trees. The logger's private militia then arrives on the scene, but cannot seem to break open the chains to get them away from the logging site. The protest receives viral attention on the internet when Justine is almost shot dead by one of the militia officers. The group is then arrested, but Carlos pays the police to let them go. Justine then realizes that she was a pawn: if things went badly, nobody would kill the daughter of a UN attorney. As the plane leaves, it crashes into the forest.What happens next is for you to see and find out. This film contains graphic scenes of extreme nature. I would not allow any one below the age of 18 to see this film. The direction and photography is good and the background sound-effects are professionally handled. The cast is also decent, Lorenza Izzo being the principal character of the film as Justine. Director Eli Roth has made many other cult horror films: Cabin Fever(2001) and Hostel(2005).",The Green Inferno
60,kuarinofu,What a mess this movie is,3,22 February 2018,"This movie tries to be everything at once. Fails at everything besides being a very gory parody. Clearly inspired by Cannibal Holocaust and similar movies of the 80ties, instead of going for the shock value of trash movies it quickly turns into some kind of a cannibal theme parody. Most of the actors and extras were smiling time to time. The gore scenes were well made yet still their purpose was not to shock or disgust you, but rather to confuse you on how to feel. Seeing confused extras doing something they don't understand and looking into the camera... I guess Eli Roth finds these scenes funny or something, but not everyone has such a twisted mind to be able to enjoy gore for the sake of gore (or laughs).Story is pretty straightforward yet still has tons of plot holes. Cannibals, intelligent enough to understand planes, mobile phones and to breed pigs, still eat humans for some reason. And they make it look like everyday routine, kids having fun while eating human flesh...Again. Why?The ending just spits on your face. They clearly tried to steal the ""who are the real monsters"" message, but this surely doesn't work in a movie like this. Just makes the lead actress an asshole in the end, she learned nothing.It's not even good trash, it's confusing, stupid, overly long and kind of boring.",The Green Inferno
61,MattyGibbs,Brutal but very decent horror,8,3 October 2020,A group of student activists get more than they bargained for in the jungle.This is a bit of a slow starter as it sets up the principal characters. No bad thing in my opinion. Once the action starts though it's pretty relentless. There is a likeable performance from the lead Lorenza Izzo and plenty of interesting characters.It's exceptionally brutal and there is an abundance of gore to keep horror fans happy. The luckless activists are stuck in a terrifying position and the film builds up a tangible sense of dread. There are also a few surprises and twists thrown in.Ive seen this film twice and enjoyed it both times.

62,dfa120374,Just Another Average Eli Roth Film Really,5,2 April 2016,"I guess it was only a matter of time before we saw a cannibal film directed by Eli Roth. Unfortunately it's not much better than any of his other movies I've seen. It's not altogether that bad, but it missed the mark more often than it hit.If you've seen films like Cannibal Holocaust then you'll see a similar overtone in Green Inferno. I say similar only because the content in Holocaust is much darker, sinister, and disturbing. One plus Inferno has over Holocaust is that there's no animal killings. It's one thing to shock people with gore & violence, but to kill real animals for ""entertainment"" is a completely different issue, and I'm glad Inferno didn't touch on that. I know laws now stop that, but it was still good not to see anything like that.What was also good was the message the film sent to these Social Justice Warriors - you know, the kind who latch onto genuine causes just so they can get their names in print while not caring about the actual cause itself. A few of the characters in Inferno were JUST like that (Alejandro & his girlfriend being the main ones), and it was rather satisfying knowing that karma was right behind them. Another good aspect was that the villagers weren't professional actors. They were true indigenous people living in the village where the film was made...and they done a great job. Dare I say it, but they were better than some of the ""real"" actors.That, along with some of the cinematography, are the only real pluses though as the rest was just unoriginal and a wee bit lackluster. The majority of practical effects were decent enough, but you could tell in some instances that they were very obviously not real e.g. a village child carrying a leg, and the way a torso moved when it was cut up. Some of it was just comical instead of disturbing which ruined the feel somewhat.If you're a fan of Eli Roth then Inferno is worth a watch, but for me it's only a one-time watch as it's not really anything more than that.",The Green Inferno

So many characters are defined either by just their name or a single defining attribute that will eventually be accredited to them as the film rolls by. However, despite this, I did dig the visuals, its throwback feel to the cannibal films of the 70s and the amazing practical effects by Greg Nicotero.""The Green Inferno"" had the potential to live up to its predecessors like ""Cannibal Holocaust"" but falls really short of it due to a weak plot and some dark humor gags that fell flat. This film clearly wants to shock you but doesn't come off as horrific as the films that inspired it. Add in the fact that you can see things almost as equally bloody on regular television doesn't help the shock-factor of this one. Overall, the film has its merits but just not enough of them for me to really enjoy it.",The Green Inferno

Remember what I taught you: why go through the effort of making up a story of your own, when you can rip-off somebody else's? Little Eli: You mean, I should make another slasher-flick and put your name on the cover? How about a reboot of ""Hostel""? Big Quentin: No, be a little more creative! The field is so big – Spaghetti-Westerns, mercenary-flicks, Mondo, Blaxploitation, Nunsploitation, Nazisploitation Little Eli: Please, no Nazis for me! You know my image and all. Big Quentin: Well, then how about a Cannibal-flick? There hasn't been a real one for almost 40 years. Little Eli: Like ""Cannibal Holocaust""? I love that film! Always wanted to make a movie like that Lenzi-dude (pronounces it ""Lencee"").Big Quentin: Yeah (rolls his eyes). But not just 'like' ""Cannibal Holocaust"", but more like a remake without calling it a remake. Remember: we don't call it ""plagiarizing"", we call it ""a nod"". You get my drift?

Big Quentin: For god's sake, you think real horror-buffs watch your crap? No, you've got another target-audience. Impressionable teenagers, who wouldn't know a classic horror-film from Adam. So make it hip, make it snappy. Keep it light with the humour, add a few pretty faces. You know, a few hunks for the gals and a few bazongas for the boys. Think of ""Scream"", just with jungle-cannibals instead of psycho-killers. Little Eli: What about the actors? Should I also work with laymen like Lenzi did in ""Cannibal Holocaust""?

Eli Roth is one of those brave folks who are still taking stabs at his beloved sub-genre with the ability to produce a film for a wide release. Roth's The Green Inferno had a lot of people talking but never did take off with good reviews or a cult following. I'll give Roth credit that cannibal movies and scenes are really disturbing for some reason, way worse than when a zombie feeds. However, unsettling gore sequences aren't going to create tone or a creepy atmosphere. More had to be done with character development, finesse dialogue and finer editing. The Green Inferno had none of these attributes and included an unrealistic storyline, laughable poor acting and a lack of mystery.

70,mwilson1976,Gleefully offensive cannibal torture porn from the director of Hostel,4,26 March 2019,"Director Eli Roth returns to the director's chair with this vile, incompetent, dumb, hateful cannibal torture film. It is a homage to Italian cannibal films of the late 1970s and early '80s, particularly Cannibal Holocaust (1980), which features a film-within-a-film titled The Green Inferno. A group of unlikeable and privileged student activists travel from New York to Peru for a direct-action mission against rainforest destruction. When a plane crash lands them among the native tribes they're out to protect, they find themselves not exactly welcomed with open arms. Indigenous peoples' groups have objected to the depiction of the natives as avid flesh-eating, leering, body-painted, nose-pierced, primitives especially as there are no actual cannibal tribes in South America, but the real target of scorn are the entitled foreign do-gooders. Aaron Burns did the grizly special effects, and makes an appearance as one of the activists who gets dismembered and then cooked in a prolonged scene.

71,room102,Eli Roth's attempt to create a CANNIBAL HOLOCAUST movie is a complete failure,2,16 October 2015,"The greatest achievement of ""Cannibal holocaust"" was its success in creating a sense of authenticity and atmosphere of savagery, danger and fear. ""The Green Inferno"" completely lacks all of them.This movie is the result of bad direction, acting, effects and editing and a most predictable and bad plot.The film opens in a most unnecessary and amateurish tiny pre-credits scene that foreshadows the poor job the entire has to offer and sums up many of its bad elements: Scenes that were obviously shot in different times and locations and were edited together into a single scene, spoon- feeding the audience, over-dramatization in the wrong place and going the wrong way by showing the savages from THEIR point of view instead of showing it from the point of view of the ""visitors"" (as was done artfully in ""Cannibal holocaust"").After the much-expected wasting of over 40 minutes in unnecessary plot, full of terrible amateurish acting and bad writing and direction, the movie starts its ""gory"" part: A plane, that takes off from one location, suddenly flies conveniently above a jungle. As expected, it crashes in one of the most poorly directed plane crashes I remember seeing in a movie. It is then that you realize that the gory effects of this movie are so poorly made, that they all look completely fake and staged. At that point, the movie also suddenly changes style and is shot in a ""commando"" style, in which the camera shakes and frequently goes out of focus, all done in a very obvious way that contribute nothing to the authenticity of the film.Everything in this movie looks staged. Quite a lot of the violence is done completely off-screen and the stuff that is shown either looks completely fake or is done with lots of quick and bad editing - and all accompanied by fake and inappropriate reactions.The amateurish aspect of this movie includes lack of coverage (e.g.: the river escape scene), sloppy direction (e.g.: a kid slashes the throat of a guy that is at least a meter above his reach), silly situations (e.g.: people escaping while everyone around them doesn't notice that) and maybe worst of all - being dramatic in the wrong parts, including over-dramatic music and over the top, yet completely unbelievable reactions.The lead actress cries in almost every scene. Her acting is over the top and doesn't let you suspend your disbelief even for a moment during the entire movie.While ""Cannibal holocaust"" wasn't a perfect film and had its flaws, ""The Green Inferno"" only comes to show how good it was in comparison.Over 30 years after ""Cannibal holocaust"" was made, Eli Roth shows that he didn't learn anything from Ruggero Deodato's movie-making and the best he can do is giving Deodato a cameo in ""Hostel 2"".You have to be blind in order to take this movie seriously.",The Green Inferno
72,ericrnolan,"A quick review of ""The Green Inferno"" (2015)",4,16 October 2015,"There is one special effects sequence in Eli Roth's ""The Green Inferno"" (2015) that is technically very well done. I won't describe it, for fear of spoilers here, but if you know that Greg Nicotero was in charge of effects for this movie, and you know the TV show with which he's associated, then you have a pretty good idea of what this sequence entails. (Hint: it's ""The Walking Dead."")This movie also makes excellent use of its Peruvian location, and the real tribe employed as extras.Beyond those two things  this really is a rather mediocre horror- thriller, folks. It's nothing to write home about. In fact, it seems amateurishly made on a few levels, especially considering the creative talent Roth exhibited with films like ""Hostel"" (2005), ""Hostel 2"" (2007) and ""Cabin Fever"" (2002).This movie held my attention, and it does serve up a disturbing horror film that's weird and different — which is what I think Roth is known for. But, regrettably, it just wasn't especially well scripted, performed or directed. I'd give it a 4 out of 10.",The Green Inferno
73,Ramascreen,Everything you'd expect from Eli Roth,8,23 September 2015,"The sickest twisted most f*cked up film I've ever seen and it cracks me up. THE GREEN INFERNO doesn't apologize, it doesn't hold back, it aims to make you feel as uncomfortable as possible. But ya know what, I don't expect anything less from the man who gave us ""Cabin Fever,"" and ""Hostel,"" point being that you should know what you're getting yourself into when you're about to watch an Eli Roth presentation.Co-written and directed by Eli Roth and starring many of the actors he's worked with in the past including his wife, his go-to actress Lorenza Izzo, THE GREEN INFERNO is essentially about a group of college student activists who travels to the Amazon to protest the corporation that's hurting the rain forest over there. These are young naive idealists who think that chaining themselves up to a tree and capturing that event on social media would spark worldwide attention, that's their sole plan. To a certain extent it works, but their plane then crash-landed in a remote area where they find themselves captured by the very primitive natives who happen to be cannibals. That's right, these guys eat humans.What's entertaining about THE GREEN INFERNO is that as disturbing as the cannibalism sequences may be, and trust me, they get really graphic, you will see eyeballs being pulled out and swallowed, but as disturbing as those scenes may be, the satire remains intact throughout the whole ordeal. It's not so much that Eli Roth is mocking the idea of activism, but I think THE GREEN INFERNO is poking fun at the idea of savior complex. Members of the group start to question the actual purpose of their being there in the first place, while seeing their fellow friends, one by one, getting chopped off into pieces and served as dinner. It's hilarious seeing them turn on each other, it's even funnier seeing some of their escape plans which speak loudly about each and everyone of their personalities. So it's not just simply a story about activism gone haywire, it's not one plot that drastically turns into a completely different plot halfway through. Eli's point, if he claims to have one, remains intact the entire time.Despite what you may think of THE GREEN INFERNO, you may quickly dismiss or judge it, you may be disgusted by it, but you've gotta admire the ambitious nature of this project, not to mention involving the local villagers in that area to participate and play these roles that don't actually represent who they are or what they're about. The fact that they agreed to do this is mind-blowing, I read somewhere that they had never even seen a moving picture, so Eli Roth had to screen for them a film prior to production. So it's an ambitious and impressive effort that I think pays off. The main key actors themselves, give a whole a new meaning of terror, you are scared just seeing them scared. But I hope films like the Dowdles' ""No Escape"" and Eli Roth's ""The Green Inferno"" do not end up scaring you into never wanting to visit these exotic places on earth. If anything, I think it should raise curiosity and awareness.",The Green Inferno
74,jackmeat,FInally it has been released but is it worth it?,6,19 October 2015,"My quick rating - 6,4/10. After years of problems with legal, money, distribution and who else knows what, this movie is finally out and viewable to the masses. So the big question is ""Can Eli Roth bring us something worth all the hype?"" My answer is Yes BUT not a yes with all capital letters. Let me explain quickly. The movie is an homage to ""Cannibal Holocaust"" which is a flick that came out and was so disturbing, violent and original (the actual first found footage movie) that the makers of the movie were arrested since the government thought it was an actual snuff film and the people were killed. Obviously that failed since the creators brought the actors n TV and proved their point. Anyway, big shoes to fill and Eli Roth takes a shot at it. So armed with the plot of a group of college kids standing up for political reasons (here it is stop knocking down rainforests and destroying tribal cultures)crash land and met said tribe. Of course, they are cannibals and hence the fun begins. So of course the gore is heavy when need be but was it so bad to disgust? Not really. Actually the movie is very well written to also make a point. People stand on their soap box to make a point when in essence they don't care but want to just further themselves. Anyway, the rest of the plot is fill in the blank with double crosses, escape attempts, and dinner served up. Oh, and the scenery in this film is spectacular since Roth is definitely one who knows how to use a camera. Overall, a bit longer (I suspect there is a much longer version) and maybe more to the story aside from the lame soapbox ending and this would be scoring even higher but as is, very good stuff.",The Green Inferno

76,Coffee_in_the_Clink,Activists feed an entire village,5,11 May 2020,"Eli Roth's troubled homage to the cannibal exploitation films of the 1970s and 1980s is a film with a good build-up that is hindered by a mediocre pay-off. Completed in 2013, ""The Green Inferno"" was not widely released until 2015, due to apparent financial problems on the production company's behalf. That made the film a long wait for many fans, and invariably increased anticipation and expectation. It doesn't deliver, partly due to Eli Roth's immaturity behind the camera. I am a fan of ""Hostel"", but have little time for much else of Roth's canon. Here, Roth delivers a very good build-up as we get to meet the activists and follow them on their eventual journey into the Peruvian part of the Amazon. The sense of what is to come really racks up the suspense. When the group is captured by a native tribe and taken to their village, the suspense begins to dwindle tenfold, when it should be the opposite. There is some good gore and a few horrific scenes, but they don't have the required horror to go with them because the suspense just dies as soon as this all starts.Roth can't hold it together, partly because of the poor dialogue and the stupid actions that his characters commit from here on in. When one of the group commits suicide, the rest of them stuff a huge bag of cannabis down her throat, the idea being that it will get the cannibals really stoned, and maybe kill them. As soon as this idea raised its head I thought, Please, no. How ridiculous. Surely not? We are then treated to the following inanity when one of the group is attack by a duo of cannibals: ""They have the munchies"" he yells. This was cringe-worthy, and by including stuff like this, Roth watered down the horror and created an unwelcome distraction. Like the clown at the back of the class who makes fart sounds when something serious is being discussed. I say this was a hinderance to the film because it makes the viewer question whether Roth means for us to take it as a serious horror, or as some sort of parody of the very genre he claims to be paying homage to.It's not a bad film. But it should have been so much better. The toilet humour and gags are just the mark of a film-maker not very confidant in what he is doing. Roth swaggers and strives to be as notorious and controversial as his idols. He was on the right path with ""Hostel"" and ""Hostel: Part II"" but the persistent distractions in ""The Green Inferno"" serve to water down the unfortunate truth that Roth did not have the nerve to push the boat as far down the river as Deodato.",The Green Inferno
77,michaelradny,The Jungle Fire,6,21 October 2015,"The Green Inferno is a confusing film. I feel as if it doesn't quite understand what message it is giving; is it anti-green; is it pro- genocide; is it a parody; is it a social commentary; it feels jumbled and the ending doesn't help it's cause either. However, strangely, I found this film quite easy to watch, amidst the blood and guts, which felt sort of bizarre, but a good bizarre.The Green Inferno wasn't as great as I hoped for, but with that said, it wasn't as bad as I was lead to believe. Yes it seems to suffer from a few weird scenarios, but in my opinion I feel that this goes beyond a tribute to cannibal films, and actually embraces the elements that make them 'bad' and creates an almost satire out of it.",The Green Inferno
78,dommercaldi,A Somehow Worse Take On Cannibal Holocaust (1980),2,26 January 2021,"Pros:
1. The gore is virulently visceral and thus those scenes resonate long after viewing.
2. The make-up and costume design is great and it allows for the natives to look absolutely barbaric and terrifying.Cons:
1. There are stale performances all around, but especially from Ariel Levy (Alejandro) whose line delivery is awfully flat.
2. The foreshadowing is extremely heavy-handed and clunky.
3. A lot of the dialogue is really poor and laughably simple: ""Activism is really gay.""
4. Some of the serious moments are unintentionally funny: Jonah (Aaron Burns) puking on himself aboard the crashing plane, and one of the students nonsensically jogging into the spinning rotor-blades of said plane.
5. The comedy never lands as it feels incredibly childish (there's even a weirdly placed poo gag) as well as being jarringly inserted.
6. The score sounds like generic scary horror music which adds almost nothing to the horror scenes.
7. The movie is thematically confused. It tries to pay homage to Cannibal Holocaust (1980) by portraying the natives savagery as reactionary to western deforestation and encroachment upon their land. However, it spends little time upon this point as most of the time is upon the natives brutally killing and cannibalising the students. This makes it impossible to side with the natives which is clearly what the film wanted you as the viewer to do.
8. Somehow, Alejandro miraculously escapes the natives' camp, off-camera. It's clearly done to set up a needless sequel.",The Green Inferno
79,theromanempire-1,Gory.......but no animal cruelty......,7,10 October 2015,"This was based on gore for the most part and reminded us of the earlier Italian 89s cannibal films from 30 years ago only those films showed many animals in the jungle and animal cruelty like a mutilation of a turtle , snakes, crocodiles and other monsters.this movie had none of that and u get to see a jungle with no animals.instead u see much of human mutilations and dismemberment and i wonder is this a good thing ?I'm sure those animal organisations which protect the animals were happy from eli roth as he tortured in his movie only humans......not animals.Really this animal paranoia has to end at some point.u can't make a cannibal film showing none animal cruelty and worst no animals at all in the jungle.it's like u are watching a porno movie and the actors wear their clothes in the whole film.Anyways i will not spoil the movie so check it out....the gore is satisfying and the story but the movie could have been A LOT BETTER.",The Green Inferno
80,geminiredblue,The Dangers of Activism,8,20 June 2016,"Eli Roth is at it again! When the man sets out to make a horror flick, he seems to have one thing in mind: to make the bloodiest, most disturbing films possible. Sometimes, they turn out brilliantly (like HOSTEL) and sometimes they suck (AFTERSHOCK). THE GREEN INFERNO is definitely on the better end of his spectrum. Created as a throwback to the old Italian cannibal movies of the late 70s and early 80s, Roth goes about telling yet another grisly tale. In this one, young student activists decide to take action when they learn that a logging company plans to decimate the rain forest and thereby destroy an ancient Peruvian tribe. Upon arriving at the site, they succeed at getting global coverage. As they are being airlifted out, their plane crashes in the middle of the jungle. The survivors are about to find out that being stranded is the least of their worries. Before you can say ""Cannibal Holocaust"", they run afoul of some friendly natives with an unhealthy appetite. And don't even get me started with their interests in the women. Overall, it's a decent chiller. There are several moments where you're guaranteed to cringe. The ending seems a little rushed, too conventional, and confusing. But apart from that, I'd recommend this to my fellow goremongers!",The Green Inferno
81,patriciogl10,"If this was a test or exam, it would barely get a D.",6,3 September 2018,"I went into this movie thinking that I would like it, based on the premise which I found to be interesting. Instead I was in front of a poorly executed premise, with horrible acting, only Lorena Izzo did a good job in my opinion, and also Daryl Sabara who served as a decent comic relief. Alejandro (Ariel Levy) portrays the typical activist leader with a revolutionary attitude that when they get caught by the cannibalistic tribe, he starts to show his true colors, as a compassionaless and unsympathetic foe. Yet this movie fails to bring down the wrongdoers. We don't get to see neither Alejandro nor the Peruvian tribe get what they deserve. Although one could argue about the tribe, after all these student activists were there to save them in the first place, that is why the ending of the film is understandable, even though I found it a bit unsatisfiying. Because in the face of such torture and gory violence, one would think that the characters would stand up against them somehow, fight back or at least try to come up with a creative way to escape rather than just run idiotically.There's no character build up, so when the bloodshed begins, you feel nothing for these characters. I believe that out of the large group in the beginning, I only rooted for two of them. I will say though, that the gore does not disappoint, Eli Roth has that area well covered. There's one particulary disturbing scene that had me feeling in severe discomfort; when the first victim of the cannibals is chopped piece by piece and then prepared like a meal. Contrasting that notorious part, there is another scene which involves several members of the tribe go after one of the characters and literally eat him away in a zombie-like fashion, which I thought it was so utterly ridiculous that it just couldn't be taken seriously. The film has many flaws, it does not commit, does not scare, it does not give you something truly satisfiying, besides the gore. The first half of the film is a bore fest; yet I believe this is an okayish tolerable cannibal movie acceptable for just one view; because if you are naive enough to come across this movie more than once, I'm afraid the grade or rating you gave it first can only go further low. Not impressed but I was mildly entertained, especially in the last 30 minutes or so. That's why I was generous enough to give it a 6.",The Green Inferno
82,TheRedDeath30,Get Off Your High Horse and Just Enjoy the Ride,8,26 September 2015,"Over the past two years, this movie has been generating an incredible amount of hype in the horror scene. Though it's been several years since Eli Roth directed his own movie, he is still considered to be a minor god among a collection of horror acolytes. In the same way, there are many out there who are rabid for the cannibal sub-genre of horror. Combining Eli with cannibals and a ton of gore was sure to whip up a frenzy of excitement among the horror faithful. As such, though, I find it can be hard to get an honest to goodness assessment of the movie.Those who blindly worship Roth were sure to praise this movie, despite any weaknesses it may show. On the hand, those who feel that his movies are typically shallow exercises in monotonous gore, with no layering to them were going to hate on this no matter what strengths it may show. Then, you add in all of the hype, which is producing expectations that no movie could possible live up to in the end. So, where do I fall?I am certainly no Roth disciple. I love CABIN FEVER and think it was a fantastic debut movie for a promising young director. I hated HOSTEL, finding it to be a tedious exercise in interminable buildup to produce a climax that may have been strong on gore, but was severely lacking in intelligence and suspense. I am, also, not a big fan of the Italian cannibal genre. I firmly believe that CANNIBAL HOLOCAUST would have faded into obscurity, like the c-grade dreck it is, were it not for the controversy that it stirred up and the continuing dark curiosity that it produces based on its' legendary animal cruelty. So, am I completely impartial? Certainly few viewers can be, but I would like to think I went into the movie with an open mind.Almost every review I've read, here and online, seems to center on the same two aspects of the movie, gore and humor, with wildly differing opinions on the two. I guess it's almost obligatory, then, that I throw my two cents into the conversation. I have read plenty of reviews that speak in length about the terrifying brutality of this movie and the excessive gore. I have read accounts of people walking out of the theater in disgust (surely by now a common cliché for any hyped up horror movie). In truth, it was probably what disappointed me the most about the movie. Maybe I'm demented or deranged. Maybe my expectations were too high. Maybe I've wandered much too far down the dark rabbit hole of the horror genre and seen so much gore that I've desensitized myself. Certainly, there were a few scenes that a sure to bring a smile to any gorehounds face, particularly the dismantling of the first victim and the human sushi scene. In final count, though, there are only a select few of these gory scenes. What is there is certainly no more brutal than what's available in dozens of indie horror flicks released each month. Yes, for a major release movie this is probably gorier than most and the average popcorn-munching horror fan is probably not prepared for it. For those of us who walk that razor's edge of horror fanaticism, though, it's been there and done that. The other aspect that many a review seems to be harping about is the humor that is injected throughout the film. I saw so much talk of people's disappointment in this aspect that I was ready for a pseudo-Troma take on the cannibal genre. Maybe I watched a different movie. Absolutely there are moments of levity in the film, but I never felt they drew the viewer away from the suspense and terror that Roth was creating, at all. In fact, I think it was an important part of the movie. This was made for a very specific kind of horror fan, a twisted few that laugh at outright gore and smile at carnage. The few toilet jokes that may pepper into the movie helped provide a sense of fun to the proceeding.The film is not without any weakness, though. I hated the camera- work in some parts. I felt that Roth was trying subtely to emulate the style of Deodato's early found footage work, though with professional cameras. Too often the camera was shaky, unfocused and far too kinetic. It took away from the drama, at times, as I was pulled away in my attempt to find any point of visual focus. As many have pointed out, I was disappointed in the ending. I ""get it"" and understand what Roth was trying to accomplish. I understand that the experience shared by our heroine had taught her a great deal of what was real in our world and who was worth supporting. Looked at from a wide lens, it makes logical sense that she would make the decisions that she did. I guess, maybe, I was hoping more for a bleak, hopeless ending with one last bloody finale. Maybe I'm just more warped than I care to admit.Take a good, hard, long look at what passes as a good horror film over the past ten years. Take an even harder look at what Hollywood actually puts in the theater. I can't think of more than a few that were truly great and made their way to mass release. Let's be thankful that a movie like this found wide release. Let's stop hating on any horror film that gets some attention and support directors who are trying to bring uncompromising horror to a widescreen. I am not, in any way, espousing this as a perfect movie, but I am completely willing to say it's one hell of a movie and I will surely be watching it again.",The Green Inferno

He uses her for his purposes against the evil business industry (This is anarchist, job destroying propaganda) falsely professing that the 'oil industry' is responsible for destruction of the Amazon rain forest & the indigenous indians. For those who keep up with the Amazon rain forest destruction it is all about farming, not oil, so the movie presents a false plot to pursue its evil means.

As you waited in line and contemplated what lay ahead, your heart started beating faster. When you occupied your seat, and the picture in front of you began to move, you found yourself wondering what you had gotten yourself into. As you arrived at that first really scary moment, you resisted the urge to close your eyes, even as others around you were enjoying the thrill by thrusting their arms into the air. From that point, everything was a blur of shouts and screams, ups and downs, punctuated by brief moments of relative stillness. Then, suddenly, the ride ended. You were surprised how quickly it went by and, even though you felt a little queasy, you were glad you had the experience. You even may have commented that it wasn't as bad as you thought it was going to be, and that you kind of enjoyed it, all as you started to look forward to that next uncomfortable challenge. You just rode a scary new coaster, but might as well have been experiencing the uncomfortable thrill of a new Eli Roth movie one like ""The Green Inferno"" (R, 1:40), for example.Personal feelings about graphically violent movies like the ""Saw"" franchise or Roth's own ""Hostel"" films aside, Roth's film ""The Green Inferno"" has a colorful history. The film traces its roots to cannibal-themed movies made in Italy during the 1970s and 80s. Roth's 2015 resurrection of this controversial horror sub-genre draws most directly from 1980's ""Cannibal Holocaust"", a movie so realistic that director Ruggero Deodato was arrested and put on trial for the murder of some of the actors in the film. (Deodato was only exonerated after he gathered all of his actors together for a TV show appearance and then demonstrated in court the special effects used to create the actors' ""deaths"".) That movie's working title was ""The Green Inferno"", a title which was eventually applied to the most gruesome scenes in ""Cannibal Holocaust"", specifically, the film within the film that purports to show footage from a missing documentary film crew. (This was the first use of the ""found footage"" or ""pseudo-documentary"" device, which was popularized in the U.S. by 1999's ""The Blair Witch Project"".) The title ""The Green Inferno"" was later also used as an alternate title for the 1988 sequel ""Cannibal Holocaust II"". Eli Roth filmed ""The Green Inferno"" in the jungles of Peru in 2012. His film opened at the 2013 Toronto International Film Festival. It was scheduled to be released in the U.S. in September 2014, but financial problems at the film's production company led to the film being pulled. Blumhouse Productions stepped in and the company's multi-platform releasing arm, BH Tilt, released ""The Green Inferno"" on September 25, 2015.After a brief scene of bulldozers flattening a rain forest in the Amazon, the narrative of Roth's cannibal film starts innocuously on the streets of New York City. College freshman Justine (Lorenza Izzo) and her roommate, Kaycee (singer-songwriter Sky Ferreira), are annoyed by the student activists protesting outside their window, but Justine is also intrigued. She attends one of the group's meetings in which their charismatic student leader, Alejandro (Ariel Levy), discusses their plan to save a village in Peru from being overrun by bulldozers paving the way for a natural gas mining operation. The students plan to dress as workers, chain themselves to trees and bulldozers, then live stream video from their cell phones to get the world's attention – and keep themselves from being shot by the armed mercenaries which protect the operation. Justine's dad (Richard Burgi), a lawyer at the U.N., expresses his reservations, but Justine goes on what she naively believes will be a weekend trip to save a native tribe from extinction.After landing in Peru, everything goes according to plan until their small plane crashes in the Amazonian jungle. Several of the students die in the crash, but the survivors are captured by the very tribe that the group was there to save. Not speaking any English or having had any positive experience with outsiders, the tribe considers their captives their enemy – and their dinner. One of the students is ritualistically killed by the village's elder / high priestess (Antonieta Pari) and then he is promptly dismembered, cooked and eaten. His friends watch in horror from behind the wooden bars where they are confined. What follows are more killings, more feasting and various attempts by the students to escape before the natives finish them off, whether for food, as punishment, or because of their brutal religious practices.""The Green Inferno"" is a wonderful family movie. (Still reading? Just checking.) Actually, the film is more restrained than I expected. There's much less nudity than in previous Eli Roth movies and the gore, as disturbing as it is, could have been a lot more graphic, given what's happening on screen. Most of what's shown is on par with typical slasher flicks. You might even say that this is a relatively tasteful cannibal movie. The story's solid, the acting's fairly decent for this genre and the film works as a horror movie, a thriller, a political commentary and there's even some dark comedy. Some call this kind of movie ""torture porn"". I think that's a stretch, but the more graphic scenes make it difficult to simply call this movie ""entertaining"" without qualifying the term. I judge movies based on how entertaining they are and how well they each accomplish their individual goals. Based on those measures, I'd have to say that, much like that big, new roller coaster, this movie isn't for everyone, but many will find it bloody good. ""B+""",The Green Inferno

Who the F#$k are you to go to another country and tell them what to do with it? Handled by a competent director, it would have made for great satire and social commentary, but Roth has not made anything worth watching since the original Cabin Fever, and even that was forgettable.

91,stephendaxter,"After years of waiting, the goriest film since 'SawVII' has arrived",6,18 October 2015,"FINALLY!!! It has been 2 years that i have been waiting to see this damn movie. It was first shown at a film festival in 2013 and then got pulled from its 2014 release date due to financial issues and now it has finally arrived. Was it worth the wait? Yeh, it wasn't amazing but no-one was expecting that. The Green Inferno is a film from the twisted mind of Eli Roth where a group of activists travel deep into Amazon in order to save the forest but come across an untouched tribe of cannibals, and all hell ensues. As expected from an Eli Roth film, this does feature his trademark excessive gore and would most definitely fall into the 'Torture Porn' horror sub-genre. Roth has been quoted saying that he took inspiration from 1980's 'Cannibal Holocaust', a film that caused a whole lot of controversy when it was released. So from that you know that the focus of this film is going to be lots and lots of gore and you definitely get that. Despite my anticipation to see this film, i still went into it not expecting much in terms of getting an amazing film but it did tick all of the main boxes that i expected it to. Lets start with the focus of the film, the gore. I personally like the idea showing a tonne of gore as long as there is a reason for it to be there. For example, the 'Saw' franchise is built around the gore so it makes sense that it would be gruesome and that is the same for this film. The gore in this film is definitely not for the faint of heart, it even made me cringe at some moments. Roth did a great job at creating these very confronting shots that show off the gore and blood and violence so effectively. The very graphic violence is what makes this film stand out above anything else, you take out that gore and you just have a generic horror flick that probably would never have been made. There isn't really much i can say about the gore other than it is bloody and it is disgusting, but overall it was exactly what i wanted to see. People getting excessively mutilated was what i wanted going in and it is exactly what i got. In terms of the characters, i thought there were like 2 maybe 3 interesting characters and everyone else was either just a throwaway character or seemed a little too generic and cliché. This made it difficult to really care about some of the characters but at least the main protagonist i thought was well set up and well developed and did a good job at leading the film. Much of that was due to her performance, it wasn't amazing but Lorenza Izzo did well at leading this cast of mostly unknowns. (Yes, i know, that completely contradicts what i said in my 'Knock Knock' review where i said i didn't want to see her act anymore. Maybe she just made a bad decision, a really, really bad decision). Daryl Sabara and Aaron Burns held the film together and kept it interesting when nothing much was going on. The plot of the film was also really weak i thought, but i'm not going to hold it against the film much. Eli Roth only really needed to find an excuse to get them into the forest and from there he let the gore take over. I still think the first act went for way too long, the first 30 minutes was progressing really slowly and was setting up some characters that were pretty much irrelevant for the rest of the film. The plot wasn't fascinating but it was OK, and let the film progress at a reasonable pace after the 30 minute mark. So in the end, The Green Inferno was an accumulation of blood, gore and excessive violence from the sick mind of Eli Roth and through his use of sharp and confronting camera movements he managed to make it entertaining. If you don't like gore you won't like this film (pretty self-explanatory), as it is the main driver of the film and the best parts of the film. Some well done characters were a highlight but the throwaway supporting cast and lack of interesting plot really do hold the film down despite not being a focus. - 5.5/10",The Green Inferno
92,jdollak,Possibly one of the worst movies I've seen,4,11 July 2017,"If this is one of the worst movies I've seen, why am I giving it a 4? It's technically fairly good. The photography looks nice, everything is as it should be as far as sound, color, etc. It holds attention pretty well.But this movie has a problem that I've never seen in any other movie. It misses the point it was trying to make.A number of people have brought this up - Eli Roth's explicit focus was to make fun of what he characterizes as ""social justice warriors"" or ""slacktivists."" It should be clarified that both of these are very different ideas.In both cases, he's sending the exact opposite message than he intends. Instead of poking fun at people who want to do good, but are too lazy to do so, he focuses on a group of people who make the effort to do good.Is the point that it's a bad idea to try to do good if you don't have all of the details? Was the message that this cannibalistic tribe should have been wiped out in favor of deforestation? This may have been the direction his thought was going in, but it's remarkably oblique.The other elements of the movie are not especially worthwhile. The gore is not especially shocking. It's usually sort of funny, since it plays out in a less-than-realistic way.It's hard to not compare this to Cannibal Holocaust, which achieved a much more creepy and distressing story. While we are supposed to like the protagonist, it's hard to do that when she's mostly passive until the end, and even then, makes a completely bizarre decision that requires as much of a logical stretch as the so-called ""point"" of this movie.I watch a lot of bad movies, and I usually look for the good in them. Even stuff like The Room is intensely personal. This is... a tribute that seems strangely shortsighted. Like a nihilistic teenager looking to prove that everything sucks.",The Green Inferno
93,lnvicta,"Gore-hounds will be satisfied, people expecting a good horror movie won't be.",5,18 October 2015,"The Green Inferno is a standard Eli Roth fare - gore galore, cannibalism, and occasional humor - set in the Amazon rainforest. The acting is terrible right off the bat, but thankfully it isn't an issue halfway through the movie when the body count starts up. The characters themselves are paper thin, only about 3 of which are given actual personalities while the others are just fodder for the natives. The premise of the movie is disturbing and will sound appealing to most horror fans, including myself, but the execution leaves a lot to be desired. Yes, the gore is done very well; as usual Roth uses great practical effects to create some wince-inducing scenes. The problem is that the first half of the movie feels like a student film. Really bad acting, horrific dialogue, and the documentary style filming doesn't help at all. It's not so much an issue once the characters are captured, but you aren't able to get immersed into the world from the get-go so you're never truly frightened or concerned for them when the bloodshed begins.The biggest issue is that The Green Inferno isn't scary in the slightest. Apart from a cheap jump scare near the end, there's little to no suspense or tension in the movie. It's just a linear storyline with characters getting killed off one by one with very little left to the imagination. It also isn't funny. There's maybe two times I chuckled at the tongue-in-cheek jokes. Most of them come across as forced, partly due to the acting and partly due to the jokes not being very funny. Roth tries for a darker, more disturbing atmosphere and he succeeds, but he sacrificed the potential fun to be had with the film. It's not terrible - Eli Roth fans will get exactly what they're expecting - but it also isn't anything new. The Green Inferno is a decent effort but a wholly mediocre movie watching experience.",The Green Inferno

95,perica-43151,"Nice and trashy, with an unexpected satirical punch",7,11 September 2019,"This movie has, especially in setup phase, a somewhat shabby acting (though on par within typical Latin American entries) and writing is less than convincing with a number of slight plotholes (for instance, threatening execution of our heroine makes little sense, and the plot is not exactly a masterpiece, but it is perhaps not wise to overthink it, a great script is not really the point here). Gore is all there, plenty of cannibalism and nice jungle shots with authentic tribe to boot.The movie manages to pull additional layer of subversive commentary, which is a big plus. It satirizes the terrorist-activists, shows hypocrisy of cynical Che-wannabe and his adventure-seeking poser friends. Perhaps the most scarring thing in the movie is not the cannibalism, but crude brain washing indoctrination and imperialist condescension that goes in classrooms during what nowadays passes as University education. The acting becomes more convincing in the second, gore and action filled part.Overall, it is a pretty decent contemporary update on the genre that had its heyday in Italy, circa 1980.",The Green Inferno

Now don't get me wrong, I did enjoy watching it but it could have been put together a little bit better. For example, in one scene the cannibals tied one of the captives to a pole to allow an army of ants to crawl on him and devour him but after a while when another scene cut back to him there were no ants around and he didn't have any related injuries to show an army of rainforest ants had attacked him. Now I'm no entomologist but I know these kinds of ants are killers and they take their prey down to the bone. It's just that when I'm watching a film I like for it to be as real as possible. There were a couple of other things in this film that dropped the quality of it a bit but you'll see for yourself if you watch this film. Along with the action in this film it's filled with violence and gore, that's probably what made this film what it is. One thing I like about this film is the mistaken identity plot or at least what I think is a mistaken identity plot. After a plane crash the surviving group of activists who are dressed as contractors to protest the destruction of the rainforest are mistaken as the contractors and captured by cannibals. After reading a few reviews I learned that this film is really a watered down version of a genre of Italian cannibal films which I never knew existed. If this is a watered down version I can only imagine what the authentic versions were like. If you like violence and a lot of gore in a film this one is probably for you but don't expect any much more.",The Green Inferno

101,troy-daniel-bush,Frustrating,2,7 November 2019,"When it comes to Eli Roth, I never really understood the appeal. His movies are just gore fests with talentless actors playing unlikable characters. However, Eli Roth seems like an enjoyable person to be around. And it's clear that he loves what he does, and that he is proud of the films he has made.This movie does have a few things going for it. The cinematography is decent. The tribe looks cool. (Yes, I know it was a real tribe.) The gore effects are convincing for the most part. It's shot on location. You can also tell that it's a passion project of Roth's, and I personally love seeing a passion project come to life.Other than that, the characters are so smug and stupid that I wanted them to die. And it doesn't help that the acting is AWFUL!The script is garbage. They're given scraps of they're dead friend and one of them says, ""If we're going to escape we'll need the energy."" Ughhhh! Another great dialogue moment is where this girl is going to the bathroom by a tree and this guy goes over the same tree to go to the bathroom and she says to him, ""Not here this is the girls tree."" Here's another; ""You know what this is. You know what their doing to us."" Yeah, no crap he knows! How do you write and read these lines and not realize how stupid they are?! There are multiple things that make zero sense! Like, they only have one guard watching the kids? Okay! Who by the way is terrible at his job because he gets distracted by something that the kids throw out of the cage to distract him! There's also this member of the tribe with a yellow face and bones going through his nose, he did not look like he belonged there! He was obviously a white guy that they covered in paint! Same can be said about the tribe leader. In fact, the entire tribe didn't look the part! There's also a scene where the stoner guy is ripped to pieces by the tribe and a little kid runs away with his severed leg. Okay, how did the tribe manage to break the bone and tear the tendon and all that stuff with just their hands and teeth? They didn't have any weapons, they just used their hands! And during that one scene where they're eating bits of their dead friend, nobody refuses. And after they finish eating these bits of their friend one of the girls cuts her own throat after realizing that she ate pieces of her best friend. First of all, the way she finds out felt pretty contrived. Like, ""Well it sure was convenient that that piece of skin that had a tattoo on it was right there for you to see!"" And when the main girl comes back with all of this paint on her forehead, which symbolizes that she will be used for a ceremony later, they ask her what happened. It's pretty obvious what they did to her, you idiots! They also knocked her out with the sleeping dust so that they could put this paint on her forehead. Why?! You're just putting paint on her and you're a bunch of vicious cannibals with weapons, and she's just a tiny girl! She's not gonna do anything, nor could she do anything! Anyway, when she comes back with this on her, one of the guys says to another guy, ""You know what this is. You know what their doing to us. She'll bleed to death or die of an infection."" First of all, how does he know what that paint means? And, more importantly, why doesn't anyone ask, ""What does it mean?"" Or be like, ""She's going to bleed to death or die of an infection?"" And when they first get to the tribe's camp, one of their friends is butchered and for some reason they don't cover their ears and look away! Any normal person would do the exact opposite! And I mentioned that one scene where that girl went to the bathroom by a tree, I'm pretty sure that any normal girl would, you know, punch a guy in the nads for whipping it out in front of her when they're trying to go to the bathroom! All attempts at humor fail miserably! I mentioned there's a scene where a guy goes to the bathroom in the jungle. Following that brilliant ""This is the girls tree"" line from that one dumb girl, he goes over to a log to go number one and a spider approaches his crotch and he runs back to the boat to say, ""A spider almost bit my **** off!"" I almost turned off the movie, I swear! And there's another scene where a guy masturbates in the corner of the cage because he had to clear his mind. No! Just no! There's another scene where a girl has diarrhea in the corner of the cage and there's these cheesy crapping sound effects. And I said before that during the scene where they have to eat bits of their dead friend, nobody refuses. One girl refuses at first but only because she's vegan. Seriously?! It's also super predictable! There's this little kid that the main character befriends, and I was like, ""Oh gee, I wonder if he's going to help her!"" And I don't understand why she chose to befriend him in the first place! His people took pleasure in torturing her friend! And they ate him! And there's a scene where a history teacher is giving a lesson on genital mutilation. I was like, ""No! There's no way that's gonna be reincorporated later!""There's also an obviously computer-generated Jaguar. Oh my god, it looked terrible! So did the ants! And the gunfire from the rifles! Ugh!There's also some very obvious cuts. During the scene where the girl escaped she rips this ring of bones from this older woman's nose and you can tell that there was a cut just before she tears them out of her nostrils.There is plenty more I can talk about but because I'm lazy I'm just gonna end it here. Besides, I'm sure I've made my point clear.",The Green Inferno

105,MattBirk,Actually kind of disappointing after years of being built up,2,25 September 2015,"If Eli Roth is known for one thing, it's that he is known for high levels of violence in his films and pushing the envelope. And The Green Inferno is no exception, it's easily the most graphic movie of the year to receive a theatrical release. The movie features some extremely cringe-worthy scenes where the villages show no mercy to the young students. Of course, this is the focal point of the movie, the gore/torture of these somewhat arrogant, twenty somethings. Yes, there is some social commentary in the movie, mostly poking fun at today's society and how everyone wants to 'appear' to be fighting for a cause when in fact, they are doing very little. And yes, he has a point here, but it isn't as thought provoking as he wants it to be, especially once the carnage starts and those ideas fly out the window. Only for those ideas to awkwardly return at the end of the movie.There is not much to say about this movie other than the obvious, it's extremely violent, nothing more nothing less. The Green Inferno is obviously a homage to those 80s cannibalistic horror movies. Which means the body count is high and the foreigners are going to be punished by the natives in some of the most cruel ways imaginable (at least since the SAW series). But I can't help but feel a bit letdown after years of build up with the movie being stuck in release hell.While The Green Inferno isn't on par with other strong horror contenders for best horror movie of 2015, it is easily the nastiest, most violent movie of the year.

106,Eric_Cubed,Ewe Bowl in Disguise,2,29 February 2016,"The first 5 minutes are impressive, and at once we are led to believe we have the old Eli ""hostel"" Roth back. The tribes people are savage and authentic and the menacing slaughter of the rain forest by the dinosaur bulldozers fills us with impending conflict that we gleefully realize must end in proper sausage grinding. And then we are introduced to the characters. At this point we are only left to surmise that either Roth is a very, very bad director, got very, very unlucky with the casting, or that he is intentionally causing us to despise the characters so that we will cheer with imminent consumption. Because these actors—and the script—are probably the worst I've ever seen. Suspension of disbelief is about as possible as an non-believer being convinced of the afterlife after watching Constantine. Still, I'm only 15 minutes in, and this review will continue in real time, in true Kiefer Sutherland fashion. Okay, now at the ½ hour mark. Non-hilarious shenanigans ensue, such as a dude exposing his wee willy while a tarantula inches ever closer. Can you picture the madcap hilarity as he runs from the jungle to join his 18 year-old friends at the boat on the river? We almost expect him to make a joke about the token hot actress sucking the poison out, but thankfully we are spared this—and yet are perplexed as to why the obvious chain of clichés did not occur. Okay, and now after the next 15 minutes. Well, well, well, oh my brothers. Our little collective clan of altruists has succeeded in filming the evil destruction of the rain forest and innocent tribes that live there, by uploading video instantaneously, and so the powers that be have no option but to arrest them and put them back on the plane, where drinking and smoking ensue to never-ending non-hysterical abandon. Oh No! The plane goes down and the fledgling one-dimensional brats are now getting mowed down by poison spears, some killed, some merely inoculated. Let's see what happensHawaii. Hawaii is what happens. Though the cannibal natives and the scenery and cinematography were once plausible they are now bereft with inescapable setting and lighting. We are left with a dull drizzle of Hollywood fakers. At this point, we can't help but to wonder, is it Eli Roth or Uwe Boll? Quentin Tarantino was a master of reinventing the seventies exploitation flicks, personified in the Kill Bill series. Roth fails miserably, unforgivably here, trying to revamp Cannibal Holocaust and the like, making a lover of unadulterated 70's B movies feel something akin to abject betrayal. And yet, the gore scenes at the first native feeding is just enough to make us not turn it off. We must see more. Remember the eyeball popping scene in the first Hostel? It's like that, only better. And more inspiring, we are glad the first feast is the most obnoxious of all the characters. And now the captives are sitting around contemplating their options, as string shoe bamboo shoots that could easily be crushed to pieces envelop them. And of course, the racism, is stewed to perfection, as we are all led to the belief that all indigenous tribes are nothing more than savage primal animals without conscience, empathy, regret or values of any kind. And now we are intruded to an earlier theme: female genital mutilation, as our star token beautiful female hero is now being prepped for this ceremony. What shall her jealous nemesis do to save her? Is there a hidden value or narrative for women's rights at play? Let's continue to watch and find out. Oh No! The natives feed on another captive—a most unpleasant experience. And then for some inexplicable reason Alejandro (said nemesis) starts rubbing one out, thinking the stress relief will somehow immunize him from being picked next for cannibalization. Now we are left with the two escapees, with Alejandro left behind (busting nuts with impunity) as the make their way through the embryonic heart of darkness jungle maze (that is, the symbolic symbolism of how primitive persons are associated with defense mechanisms of civilized entitlement}. Oh No! They caught the two escapees, and now one of them is strung up and being eaten by ants. And the other is once again in danger of female genital mutilation. Will It happen? Hark! The child she embraced with her flute has come to her rescue! And now she runs and runs until she is caught between the militants and the indigenous tribes.

107,Amthermandes,"Intense, effective, yet I still can't recommend it to everyone",7,30 September 2015,"I'll get right to the point. The movie is well done, and highly effective at creating tension and instilling fear in the viewers. Even though there are parts that look and feel fake, even cheesy.I'm assuming most of you reading this is familiar with Eli Roth, or at least the violent nature of this film. Yes, it's violent. You want carnage, you want gore, it's got it. You cannot see this if you have a weak stomach, I'm telling you straight. It's not loaded with it, but a few scenes are very over-the-top and a few are even terribly realistic. I'm used to this sort of material and still I had to look away during two scenes.With that out of the way, let's hit some other elements. The acting teeter-totters, some times it works, sometimes it doesn't. But I'm talking about the actual actors, the fact that the villagers are all authentic tribesmen and women, is one of the really cool things about this film. At times it almost feels like a documentary. The plot, basic. And from the start, you get an idea of what Eli Roth thinks about protesters and college students and their tendency to jump aboard the ""causes-ship"" to support their entitlement. This film is a message, but it's also a way to vicariously blow out some steam.Movie's a bit predictable, camera's too shaky, and there are times I felt like Eli Roth was trying too hard to stir up audiences' anger towards his characters, but all in all it's a well done movie and CAN be enjoyable, if you can stomach it and if you understand that it's just a movie. I personally felt it was too weak and where it wasn't, it was too strong. There wasn't really an in-between.If anybody is planning on seeing this, and are not used to extreme graphic content, I suggest skipping this one.EDIT: I actually ended up showing this movie to a friend of mine, and I was surprised to find that I enjoyed it a bit more than I did previously. I gave it two more stars. It's still as brutal as I remember, but I gotta admit, it was very well done, and the actors did a fantastic job.

108,antoniokowatsch,Slightly underwhelming,6,19 May 2018,"This movie is a classical ""cannibal tribe"" horror movie. It's not the best of its genre but it can stand its ground. The visuals were impressive; the contrast between the red body paint and the green vegetation was nice to the eye.
The acting performances were inconsistent but nothing that would make or break a movie.The main thing that I liked about the movie was the setting. It was quite belieavable. Especially in the beginning. Student activism is highly encouraged these days by the majority of colleges. It also served as a nice segue to the main part of the story.Storytelling-wise there were some things that I didn't like. One of which was the abundance of ""generic characters"". When the students embarked on their trip the first thing that I thought was ""well, that's a rather big group"". It should come to no surprise that most of them were ""killed off"" in a timely fashion. 
Another storytelling faux pas was the abundance of cliches. Like the scene where one of the protagonists falls into a river. I'm pretty sure you can guess what happened next... it's one of the most overused movie cliches ever. 
The most obvious trope in the movie however is one that I'm not going to mention here because it would be a ""heavy spoiler"" (I will address it in the last paragraph should you be interested).Overall, I think the movie was quite OK. The biggest critique that I personally had was the lack of truly memorable scenes. Most horror movies tend to have their signature death scenes. In this movie however most of the deaths happen off-screen which is kind of a bummer (for a horror movie). If you've seen the movie just ask yourself; ""what scene was the most memorable?"" And then follow it up with a _""how unique was it?"" You'll quickly come to realize the veracity of my claims.On a funny side note: the scene with the ants, although cleverly tied to the lecture at the beginning, had a slightly goofy subtext due to its similarity with the infamous ""torture/bee"" scene from ""The Wicker Man"". So yes, I did see what they did there, I just question the execution.
( Disclaimer: Heavy Spoiler ahead )The biggest problem with this movie is the so called ""Chosen One""-trope. It becomes quite apparent right at the start of the movie that one protagonist is ""special"". In the sense that she will be the only one to make it out of the movie alive. It's just too obvious, the movie doesn't even try to hide it. Quite to the contrary; the whole thing with the virginity ritual and the special body paint just further confirms this suspicion.Final verdict: watchable but it's missing some pizzaz",The Green Inferno

Going in I knew Eli Roth had a gore fetish, so I expected some harsh killing, but the film was even more gory than I expected, and was a little hard to watch. Beware that the film isn't really a horror movie in the sense that it's scary, it's more like Saw with cannibals. This movie takes gore and killing so far that it's really only for those who enjoy overly gory films. The acting, dialogue, and story are all weak, but the film's preliminary focus is more directed at how many ways can people be brutally murdered. It's the focus on killing that exemplifies that Roth didn't care as much about story, he wanted to take killing and gore, and make them an art form, like Tarantino. The movie did have a dark sense of humor, one example is that these people are being killed, while the tribe has a bunch of cows and pigs that remain untouched.

This film must have been hard to make, specially with a tribe that never watch a single flick (if you read IMDb trivia, Eli made them watch Cannibal Hollocaust and they laugh and think it was a comedy).According to the storyline, there no cannibal tribe anymore, but when that tribe is in danger because the government want to destroy their home, they are in beast mode and kill every stranger and in not so funny way. They torture them, dismembered them. Not one of the murders are the same which is something I like a lot. Their are clichés too, but that actress, Lorenza Izzo show she can act. I saw her in Aftershocks (2012) she was OK but still bland. But in this film, she really show how good of an actress she is. Sure, she is Eli's girlfriend but she is in no way a terrible actress from a Giallo of Dario Argento (that i like but the actress were dumb). That actress could be a good choice for an adventure flick ala Tomb Raider.Watch this film for what it is, you have a lot of gore in the 2nd half of the film and I enjoy it.",The Green Inferno
114,natashialw,Very thrilling!,7,13 October 2021,"To be honest I had put off watching this for a long time afraid it may be too gory, I saw Netflix has this and was like ""okay let's do this"". Glad I did, I don't think it was as gory as Hostel? Maybe some parts but after all the horror flicks I've seen it's nothing for gore to me. Glad the ending was a happy one to, give it a watch if you enjoyed Eli's other works and Midsommar!",The Green Inferno
115,acdc_mp3,I guess chanting college students don't know everything after all!,10,11 February 2020,"This movie was a joy to watch actually for the reason that people who claim to be ""helping"" indigenous people have absolutely no clue of what their culture is. It's freakishly accurate in the attitudes of people who are obnoxiously pushing their agendas and having it go so horribly wrong that it is a very good lesson to be learned. The lesson is this: Just because you do not approve of something that happens in other countries or think what is done in their cultures doesn't meet your ideas of a perfect fairy tale life, doesn't mean you are right or these people want you representing them. This is the sad reality of many sheep like college students in the US today.This movie was enjoyable for many reasons, but it was the karma factor that made it a true piece of entertainment. The other thing about this movie has been mentioned in other reviews is the throwback feel it brings. Cannibal movies are a genre that is always pretty scary because it IS a reality and for the most part an impossible situation to be in. (Unless you are a smarmy college student who knows everything, that is).The effects used in this movie are very well done, as the CGI isn't overly shoved down our throats and it does add to the feel of the movie.Look at this movie as an educational piece. Don't assume everyone wants American students to come and save the day. Don't assume that everything in this world isn't driven by money. It is, so stay alive and focus on getting an education that will actually allow you to have a life that a useless ""humanitarian"" degree won't give!",The Green Inferno
116,Krackoon,They Got The Munchies!,4,17 October 2015,"It's obvious what inspired Eli Roth's 'The Green Inferno.' But there's a rumor going around that everything Eli Roth does, is supposed to be terrible. That makes it hard to rate/review his films, but...Let's pretend for a moment that Eli Roth actually wants to create decent, entertaining material - and that he failed miserably with 'Knock Knock.' How does 'The Green Inferno' hold up? If you enjoy plot less, gore filled nonsense, you should really enjoy most of Eli Roth's library. However, Eli Roth suffers from the same delusions that plague Rob Zombie - If you're looking for a cast in your upcoming film, look no further than the people closest to you. Lorenza Izzo is a dreadful actress, that will continue to see work, due to her relationship with the director. Ariel Levy is on a whole different level of God awful, and the rest of the cast isn't too far behind. But I guess the whole purpose of these films, is to have characters so bad, you enjoy their demise. I'd just like to see these characters played by, well, actual actors. I do understand why he has such a large following, and I'm sure he's a blast to work with - who wouldn't want to work for a successful director with no expectations? But starring in one of his films, and watching it, well, those are two entirely different things. One is far more enjoyable than the other, I'm sure. Imagine working for a guy like Martin Scorsese - Yuck! 'Cannibal Holocaust,' for some reason, still has a solid following. So, if you find yourself enjoying that type of material, Eli Roth did a fine job here. But if you're looking for something a little more, like better acting, better directing, better writing, better camera work, or an actual plot - there's a lot better horror films coming out in the near future. None of which will be directed by Eli Roth. Random Ramblings of a Madman: When a tribe gives a better performance than any actor in your film, you may want to start looking elsewhere for a cast/friends. Long story short, It's okay, because Eli Roth wanted it to be terrible. Contact me, Eli @Krackoon on twitter. I'm a terrible actor, but who gives a damn? I just want to party!",The Green Inferno

118,FixedYourEnding,Very good slasher film with an added agenda,7,19 November 2019,"Eli Roth (Hostel, Cabin Fever) and Blumhouse productions brings us another slasher movie, but this one is actually quite good. Story line is solid, character development is there, although it is very templated overall it is a very good watch. There is enough gore and blood in there to fill your cup, however many scenes are more psychologic than gory which I find uplifts the movie from a run-of-the-mill low-budget slasher to something quite a bit better.
The story revolves around a group of students who travel to Peru to perform, what initially presented as a routine protest and live web broadcast. It all goes awry when their plane crashes on the way back and they are being captured by an ancient tribe called Yajes, a cannibalistic tribe. The film was filmed on location with actual natives which I found admirable.
However, one thing that bothered me about this film was the ending. Sorry for the spoiler, but the virgin girl makes it out alive... even so, her traumatic near-death experience does not sway her away from protecting the Yajes immediately after that. I simply could not accept that her character, which is a relative outsider to this advocacy group does not flip and understand that some things are better not preserved. I think with a better ending I could consider giving this slasher an 8. Not sure what exact statement Mr. Roth was aiming for, but this one decision made the movie less enjoyable for me. I wanted some revenge! btw- loved the cameo by Sky Ferreira, even though she is only there for about 5 minutes, she does well in playing the role of the girlfriend and her song ""I will"" is a nice add to this film.
My exact score: 72/100",The Green Inferno
119,keithlovesmovies,The Green Inferno Review,5,3 October 2015,"College Student Justine (Lorenza Izzo) decides to meet with a student activist named Alejandro (Ariel Levy) when he and his group go on a hunger strike on behalf of underpaid janitors. Because she has a crush on Alejandro, she agrees to help him with his next project to save the Amazon. She will soon regret that decision when her plane crashes somewhere in the Peruvian jungle and after her and the rest of the group are captured by a tribe of cannibals.First of all, you know a movie isn't for everyone when you have to be ID'd before going in. I will say that it is rated R while most films (at least in Canada) are rated at most 18A but I did not let that dissuade me. I don't know the difference between the two ratings but I guess it's worse than 18A since they had to ID me and I never get ID'd when I see 18A films. As I have said on many occasions in other reviews, I was not familiar with other works of the film's director Eli Roth so my review will be based on that. Now I will just say that this film is definitely not for everyone and it earns the R rating. There is one scene in particular, that I will not spoil, that I thought earned it that rating. There are other moments, however, that come close. I will say that I did not find this film very scary but I do not think that it was the film's fault. I may have ruined it for myself because I was aware of the film's premise beforehand. Knowing this did not completely ruin it for me but I probably could have figured it out on my own quickly enough and I would have been in the same position. The film felt more suspenseful to me because most of the plot focused on whether or not the students would survive their predicament. The story isn't the most original I have ever seen for a horror film, a bunch of college students in the forest because that never ends well. I thought the story started off a little slowly for me. I found the buildup to their leaving for the Amazon to be a little boring and a little cheesy and bad. I felt like it could have just started with them in the Amazon and/or taking the time to introduce the characters that we will see because what we did see was little to no character development so we as viewers just don't care about the characters or about what happens to them. I've always felt that horror films are better with character development because if you care about the characters, you are more scared when something happens to them. Justine and to a lesser extent Alejandro got some character development but I didn't really care about them. I thought the acting was bad to mediocre but that wasn't a surprise and I thought the film just got sillier the further it went. I was not a big fan of the end either. I will admit to laughing at certain moments where people died, yes people died because it's a horror film. Overall. this isn't a terrible film but I don't think it's one worth spending money on at the theater, more like a rental.Score: 5.5/10 keithlovesmovies.com",The Green Inferno

Quite some gore scenes even somes that made me look away for a second or two.

121,Healing_Process,A movie that has lost its edge in our modern times,4,21 November 2020,"For what it's worth, I appreciate the time and effort Eli Roth put in to get this movie done. Especially working in the amazon and even working with local villagers, Its admirable to say the least.Biggest problem with this movie is that It tries to hone into the gore/horror that once was ""Cannibal Holocaust"". But Cannibal Holocaust preyed on the ignorance of people in the 1980's. Without the use of the internet, understanding of more things around the world, and the scare of serial killers running amok, it made sense why Cannibal Holocaust had an everlasting effect on people.If you wanted to do a movie like that in the 21st century you need to be smarter than the audience and prey off the new fears of the new generation. This movie did not really do that. To give some more context, I even watched this when I worked at Walmart on lunch with 10 other employees. (Yes, it's inappropriate). But instead of people watching with disgust or anxiousness, we were cheering for the privileged college students to get picked off one by one and over analyzed the actual killings. We might be an exception, but this is a good example of the mindset people have these days that must be taken into account to have a good movie that is in the vein of something like Green Inferno.With all that being said, I personally don't even think the gore was up to par. I don't think it will even please gore fans that maybe Hostel did. So not only did it not hold up for a horror flick but it didn't hold up for gore porn. I would say you're not missing much if you haven't seen this movie yet and you probably will never need too. Maybe next time Eli Roth. 4/10",The Green Inferno
122,stroggos,"Cheesy and gory, but kept me entertained and in suspense",7,20 July 2017,"THE GREEN INFERNO follows a group of young activists who are held captive by a ""savage"" tribe of cannibals in the deep jungles of Peru. As we come to expect from an Eli Roth movie, there is a lot of gore and a lot of exploitation. Yes, the movie is at times indulging itself in torture porn. Yes, this movie—despite relatively high production values—has a cheesy feel to it with some pretty tacky dialogues and some pretty stereotypical characters. At the same time, this movie kept me entertained throughout. It had some smart ideas and a few twists towards the end that I genuinely didn't expect. And the suspense never faded away, which is what so often happens in gore flicks.Perhaps surprisingly, THE GREEN INFERNO explores some interesting political and social themes. Despite having a B-movie feel to it, the final moments of the movie actually ask some deep questions: What is cultural progress? Where and how do we intervene on humanitarian grounds with what looks like wrongdoing from our cultural perspective?Don't get me wrong: Just like its spiritual predecessor CANNIBAL HOLOCAUST, this movie is thoroughly offensive and definitely not politically correct on most fronts, for example in its exoticization of seemingly ""primitive"" cultures. If you're an anthropologist, or basically anyone with a bit of cultural sensitivity, you'll be mad at how the ""natives"" are depicted. And the negative perspective on social activism is definitely over-the-top. Although it is good to raise the issue of whether social activism is hypocritical at times, I worry that people who already mock activism come away from this movie with their ideas vindicated. A lot of these social issues are dealt with in a tongue-and-cheek manner though, so you are free how to interpret them! And once you look beyond THE GREEN INFERNO's indulgence with shock and confrontation, you'll find a suspenseful movie with an interesting story arch and some relatable and interesting characters. Go for it, if you like gore and B-movies.",The Green Inferno
123,samgiannn,"""The Green Inferno"" should please Eli Roth fans",6,26 September 2015,"A movie inspired by the ultra-violent 70's Italian cannibal movies seems perfect for a director like Eli Roth. If you're not a fan of his films already, this won't win you over, but if you his brutal, tongue-in-cheek horror, The Green Inferno is a perfectly serviceable gore-fest. The Green Inferno follows Justine, a freshman in college who joins a student activist group that plans to save the Amazon rain forest. But these guys aren't just all talk: they are going to go directly to a village in Peru to rescue it from impending bulldozers before the village is destroyed, and their mission is successful. They rejoice on the plane ride back home, but their celebration is short lived as the plane crashes somewhere in the vast sea of green. Soon enough, they are taken hostage by a cannibalistic tribe and must escape before they are turned into someone's next meal. Like Roth's previous films, The Green Inferno takes its time before unleashing hell on the victims. The crew doesn't actually encounter the cannibal tribe until about 45 minutes into the plot, so when the violence comes, it really packs a punch. You'll definitely want to finish your popcorn early. Unfortunately, the movie doesn't have much of a plot after the group gets captured, so a lot of it is focused on the gruesome death scenes. I have to give credit where it's due, though. There are some really hard to watch scenes in this, and that's exactly what this movie wants. However, what makes The Green Inferno not just your average torture porn flick is how stylish it is and some darkly funny writing. The humor does sometimes get a little unnecessary at times, but there are many times where I had a laugh with the movie. Mainstream audiences won't appreciate how it homages classic cannibal flicks, but Eli Roth fans should be satisfied with a suitably nasty descent into hell.",The Green Inferno

Unapologetically violent, gory, and at times, hilarious, is what Green Inferno gives us. It was a tad bit slow at the start, but once it got going it was the roller coaster ride I expected. Not as shocking as, say, Hostel, but really fun in that same (bloody) vein. If you like suspenseful AND gory horror, you are really going have a good time with this one. Cook up a nice bloody hamburger, and plop yourself down on your sofa for nice shiny little film.",The Green Inferno
125,rosecalifornia,Bottom of the barrel,1,16 February 2021,His movie is just so awful you can't even put it into words.The storyline/script....is NOTHING like the release description/summary.No idea how the person that wrote this was able to show financial backers and they all said - hey yea this sounds great !Don't just don't even peek at it.,The Green Inferno
126,kira02bit,An ugly film inside and out - incompetently directed,1,23 December 2015,"A good friend with a love of horror films literally could not find one person to attend a screening of The Green Inferno with him, so I knuckled under and joined him. He owes me big time.For those not in the know, The Green Inferno, Eli Roth's latest steaming pile of fecal matter, centers on a group of well-meaning college student, led by Ariel Levy, who venture into the Amazonian jungle to protest the destruction of the rain forest and its indigenous tribes by ruthless corporations. On the way back, their plane crashes into the jungle and they find themselves at the mercy of a terrifying tribe of cannibals. Oh, you can just cut the irony with a knife.To say that I am not a fan of Eli Roth would be an understatement. One of the great tragedies of modern cinema is that filmmakers of true talent cannot seem to get funding for worthwhile projects, but somehow a hack like Roth manages to get a national release for dreck like this ""film"". This is Roth's homage to that long overlooked subgenre – the cannibal film – and grindhouse epics like Cannibal Holocaust. Given that 98% of filmgoers have no knowledge of these films or much knowledge of this subgenre and that no one has exactly been clamoring for its resurgence at the cinema, I am hard-pressed to figure out how Roth got any interest drummed up here, other than the most deprived of gore fanatics.Forget things like story or sympathetic characters, Roth has no time for such foolishness. His energies are all reserved for how graphic and stomach-turning he can make his gore. This story pretty much unfolds like all his others. A group of young people exit their comfort zone in a foreign environment and pay the penalty. He seems to have some personal axe to grind against ""armchair activists"", but is completely clueless that the very act of these people traveling into the unknown to protest deforestation makes them anything BUT armchair activists. If the targets of the tribe's animosity were the corporate representatives behind the destruction, one could posit that this was some kind of vengeance tale against corporate greed, but such a theme seems beyond Roth and company. He seems to actively dislike anyone who takes a stand on an issue and wants them punished. His feelings are pretty much vocalized by the roommate of the leading lady, who chastises her for activism and preaches introversion and selfishness. Or at least it seems so – but it could also be the distractingly horrible performance by Sky Ferreira, who speaks as if joining us from another dimension where speaking is barely a hobby. Additionally, he seems to find all foreign people objects of suspicion or terror.Not surprisingly, Roth cannot make us care about what happens to anyone in this cast. An actor's director he is not. The only face I recognized was Daryl Sabara (formerly of Spy Kids) as the stoner in the group. His big moment is flashing some full frontal nudity, while nearly having his privates attacked by a tarantula. He should fire his agent post-haste. Lorenza Izzo has the central role and given that she is the director's fiancée/wife, it is not surprisingly that her acting is lacking. The only other role of note is Levy as the leader of the group, but given that he plays the part from the start as a major sleaze, it is hard to fathom the heroine's attraction to him and it renders the ""twist"" of his motivations completely unsurprising.For the duration of the running time, people are torn apart, have their eyes gouged out and eaten, are vivisected, etc., apparently all to Roth's glee. When you think it cannot get much worse, Roth actually introduces the potential of female genital mutilation for good measure, apparently proving there is just no gutter too low. He punctuates everything with unwelcome bursts of puerile humor, such as when a vegan realizes she is eating her friend or someone has explosive diarrhea. Oh the hilarity! Meanwhile, the film sports some of the ugliest cinematography in recent memory.This is a film that is truly ugly inside and out. Roth seems to actually detest the people who populate his films, especially if they have good intentions. In fact, he may well detest people in general since he unleashes films like this godforsaken mess on them. It is incompetently directed and written – Roth has no notion of build-up or sustained suspense. He fails to grasp that there is a huge difference between scaring a viewer and repulsing them. Rumor has it he has been hired to helm the big budget version of the bestseller Meg, which is head-scratching since Roth fails to prove he can handle a big budget, actors, or even the very basics of storytelling. One can only assume that film will just feature two hours of Roth's camera focusing on chum and innards floating in the water because that is all he has demonstrated he is capable of.",The Green Inferno

The Next Duo In The Horror Genre World!!!",10,3 July 2016,"Today is Ms Antonieta Pari's Birthday (May 31), and it's night over here. To honor her I watched the movie that I knew her from, Eli Roth's The Green Inferno. This movie is a tribute to classic cannibal films from the 70s and 80s, a homage to ""Cannibal Holocaust."" Antonieta plays a leader of a cannibal tribe, and her performance is terrifying and frightening, with her looks. She's just incredibly fearsome and amazing. I'm really looking forward to seeing more of her films. Lorenza Izzo, who is Eli's wife, was the leading actress and did an outstanding job. The rest of the cast and crew was also awesome. It has that disturbing bloody gore, with scenes that will make you go WTF. It also has comedy, with a mixture of the bizarre that is guaranteed to shock viewers. I have seen lots of bad reviews for this movie and I just don't understand why. Some people says it's gory and some says it's not gory enough. Everyone has their opinions, but for me everything was perfect and it's in its order. Eli Roth really worked hard for this feature. It's not easy making a movie like this. He trained real life villagers who had no experience in acting. Lorenza risked her life in a scene where she nearly drowns. They busted their asses for the movie, and some people just don't give them credit. I truly respect and love them 100% for this bloody, dark, good, intense, adventurous fun ride. One of the reasons I loved it is that there is no animal cruelty in it, and I salute Eli Roth for that. Eli and Lorenza prove that they are one of the best duos in the Horror World. Whether you love it or hate it, this is one of those films people will be talking about for ages. Back in 2013, my Dad was so thrilled when he heard that Eli was doing a cannibal film. He was a huge fan of Eli's films. The sad part is he passed away in June. Fast forward to 2015, and it was released in my country on September 24, my Dad's Birthday. I was like, Dad, I am gonna celebrate your Birthday by watching the movie you waited for. I watched it on the big screen and it was heavily censored, but I still enjoyed it. In January 2016 I finally got to watch it uncut for the first time on iTunes. Later I got it on DVD, and this is a movie that every horror fan out there should own. And I'm so excited that there's a sequel in the works titled ""Beyond The Green Inferno,"" and I truly hope Antonieta Pari reprises her role as the Queen Of The Cannibal Clan!!!",The Green Inferno

129,dean2900,There could be a good social commentary but it failed,3,18 December 2015,"I do not understand the success that Eli Roth has had. His movies seem juvenile and torture porn seems to be his choice.If you have seen Cannibal Holocaust then skip this as it adds nothing knew to the genre.This is about a bunch of wealthy (above average at least) middle class white kids that go to South America to boycott destroying the rain forest and end up getting caught by a Cannibal Tribe.Unfortunately, the production company paid the tribal people money to act in movie even though they have never seen TV before. Lets just say it shows that they don't understand what TV/Movies are.The sad part is that this movie really could have tried to make a very in-PC point that maybe the loggers are the good guys and the tribes (at least if they really were cannibals) need to be wiped out. It also missed it's chance to show that kids in college boycott things they know very little about makes them seem like the dumb people in this show.I cannot guarantee that added a little more commentary in it would make it a better movie but I don't see how it can be worse.Roth delivers plenty of gore like all his films but is nothing any seasoned film-goers has not seen many times before.I truly believe with a smarter plot, perhaps more humor, and creating more of a thin line could have made this a much smarter horror movie and allow it to stand on it's own merit other than being nothing more than an update of Cannibal Holocaust.Dean",The Green Inferno

133,longcooljolie,It's a competent gorefest,7,10 September 2020,"Eli Roth is my favorite director of the audacious, ""I can't believe they made a movie about that,"" sub-genre of shock/horror cinema. This time he made an updated version of the cannibal sub-genre of the late 70s and early 80s.Other reviews have said that the acting is a little subpar, and it may have something to do with the conditions going in. They had to be in the Peruvian jungle and get yellow fever shots and be in a location where there were no bathrooms. It sounds like the TV series ""Survivor,"" but at least we know the actors got paid. So, it could be that Eli had trouble finding experienced actors who would agree to the conditions, but in the end they're all appropriately horrified, shocked, and disgusted by what becomes of them.And yes, willing suspension of disbelief gets stretched to the breaking point at several turns, including how the group of college students got involved with the protest in the first place. without going into too much detail, the cinematography is a huge strength of the movie as is the four-person team of makeup and effectss. Yes, the various disasters and cannibal carnage looks real!Had it been simply a 90 minute slaughterfest my rating would have been lower, but believe it or not Eli Roth shows restraint involving some clever off-screen action and a horrifying reveal later on. There are also some nuances involving the priestess, one of the main college kid girls, and the little native children. It took a couple of viewings for instance to realize how it all tied back to the opening scenes of the movie back at the college.Also, as other reviewers have stated there's plenty of gallows humor, which many complained ruined the tone and made it uneven. For me, I appreciate good camp when I see it so the little black humor touches here and there worked. Yes, it's shlock in the end, but it's competent shlock and a must-see for any horror cinema fan.",The Green Inferno

138,ryanmark-57919,"Unique, but not Necessarily Great",5,6 October 2015,"I didn't know what to expect from this one but I finally saw it on a whim. The trailers were all mysterious and left me wondering what it was going to be about. Well, after watching the movie I can safely say that the movie doesn't really have any purpose but to gross us out, which, to be fair, it accomplishes quite well actually. I can't say that I'm a huge Eli Roth fan since his movies usually have weak stories and this film is no exception. It has a few entertaining parts but only if you're into some of the bloody stuff.The story focuses around a young woman named Justine (Lorenza Izzo). Justine has joined an activist group at her college to try to make a difference in other people's lives. She and her classmates head to the Amazon to stop some demolition work in the rain forest. They succeed in doing this but the return trip doesn't go quite as planned when their plane crashes and they're found by a tribe of cannibals. Yeah, it's not going to be a very good trip...I'm going to be honest. I don't know who any of these actors and actresses are in this movie and I'm not really impressed with what I saw from any of them. These characters remind me of the exact same characters that I've seen in almost every slasher film that I've ever laid eyes on. Izzo plays the sweet and naive Justine that believes everything will be alright and that she can accomplish anything she sets her mind to. She does portray fear pretty well, which is good since that's the primary emotion we see Justine portray in the film. She's more likable than the others so it's easy to root for her but I still wasn't impressed by her acting ability. The only other character that stands out in my mind is a character called Alejandro that's played by Ariel Levy. This guy is one of the douchiest characters I've seen in all of cinema, which is saying a lot actually. This guy is pure scum and he's the only one of the entire group that you want to see get it in the end but his final fate is left ambiguous. The acting is largely forgettable but there are a few highlights.The actual rain forest that the film takes place in is actually gorgeous and evokes many different emotions. It's hard not to appreciate the beauty of the place and we don't want to see it destroyed but there's also a sense of mystery and brutality that permeates everything we see there. The animals are frightening enough but then we see the actual human inhabitants and this beautiful place becomes a living Hell. The actors and actresses playing the parts of the cannibals did a decent job of portraying a bunch of brutal killers. From what I understand, these people weren't trained thespians at all but I felt like they did a better job than the actual actors. This part of the film is easily the most entertaining but that's because of the shock value. The story is severely lacking but the gross ways that the characters are murdered and eaten is at least something we don't often see in the movies.Despite the relative uniqueness of the film in the movies of today, the weak story and characters keep it from being a truly great film. It's worth a watch if you're into horror films and the ever elusive sub-genre of cannibal films but I believe most movie goers probably won't enjoy the film a great deal. I'm a bit ambiguous since there are a few things that I liked but the poor story and unlikable characters make it hard for me to really get into. The gory scenes didn't bother me as much as they did some others I knew but they didn't really do anything for me either. I was curious at times if Roth was willing to do what I thought was about to happen and it turns out he's more than willing to 'go there'. If you don't have anything else to watch then I'd say go for it. Just don't expect anything too extraordinary.",The Green Inferno
139,matthewnoorman,Another Roth film,4,12 April 2021,"Eli Roth is in my opinion one of the worst directors of all time but is also a genuis at practical effects, gore and realism. The Green Inferno is a catastrophe of a film, it has no artistic merit, the acting sucks, the characters are thin and non existent, so much so that you never really learn their names. But the plan crash scene was well done, as is all the practical effects and the killings but the story is juvenile. Its beginner film making and you know it sucks but you can't turn it off. Why? Because roth creates an environment thats so real and the gore is so good you cant look away. Its up to you how you feel about this film. I enjoyed it even though I think its a trashy film, its just fun to watch. I like its an homage to cannibal holocaust, its not as good.",The Green Inferno
140,TheBarleyGuy,Why do you do these things to me Eli Roth? Why?!,5,18 December 2015,"Alright, well as you probably guessed from my review of Knock, Knock, I'm not the biggest fan of Eli Roth. I find his characters unlikable, his stories weak, and the gore and torture-porn pretty gratuitous. On top of that, I wasn't a fan of the movie that this one so clearly draws 110% of it's inspiration from, Cannibal Holocaust. Though, I objected to that movie because of the horrendous animal cruelty and the fact that it's hugely boring. Anyways, getting back on topic, The Green Inferno is a throw back to the hugely exploitative cannibal films from the 70s and 80s. Something that you really can't deny it managed to pull off effectively. In this case, Roth filmed in an actual village with actual indigenous Peruvian people, who had never been filmed or seen films before (according to the trailer), which does add an interesting layer of authenticity to the film.The movie has been slowly building hype for years, after it was delayed from being released and featured trailers and an R rating which both promised ""aberrant violence and torture, grisly disturbing images, brief graphic nudity, sexual content, language and some drug use"". I don't know if it's a sign that the movie was over-hyped or I am desensitized but, this really didn't feel any more extreme than anything horror has produced in the last few years. There is some graphic violence, but none of it is prolonged or especially hard to watch. No one was going to think that this was some kind of secret snuff movie watching it. There is no gore what so ever until 45 minutes into the movie, and the first cannibal related death of the movie is gross, sure, but nothing we haven't seen before. So, on that front the movie really isn't anything special.The initial 45 minutes of the movie will pretty much make or break your ability to get through it, I was tempted to just say ""Forget it"" a few times, but I stuck with it, wanting to see what all the fuss was about. The beginning of the movie is really dull, introducing us to Roth's special brand of unlikable or nothing characters, and cramming in awkward foreshadowing about female genital mutilation (yeah). The main character is played by Lorenza Izzo (who previously proved her chops in Knock Knock), and she is pretty unremarkable throughout. Her friend, played by Sky Ferreira (Mean Girls 2), has the line ""Activism is so freaking gay"", which is either a hugely unfunny joke or a clear sign that Roth is really out of touch with how people speak. Also starring in this movie is Daryl Sabara (Spy Kids) and you can prepare to see most of his dick in this movie. So there's that.So, in the space of an hour (after the characters have been captured), the movie manages to shove in dismemberment, cannibalism, poop jokes, fart noises, a character jerking off in a cage after one of the female characters kills herself with a bowl made of her friend's skin, and even a 9/11 conspiracy reference. Plus, it features the three female characters being tested for 'virginity', because evidently Eli Roth is of the belief that women are sealed up until they have sex. Which, by the way, is not how hymens work. You could essentially have chopped off the first chunk of the movie and been left with a gross short film that has no sense of tone. It's really hard to tell when this movie is trying to scare you or trying to be funny, as I mentioned, there is a poop joke complete with hilarious fart noises that happens within a few minutes of one of their friends being ripped apart and eaten, and it felt really weird and tone deaf.I wish I could completely pan this movie, but there are actually a couple of things to like about it unfortunately. The scene where the characters first arrive in the cannibal village is genuinely frightening. The way the scene is shot really makes you feel claustrophobic and disoriented, and pretty effectively captures how the characters are feeling, and how you would feel in that situation. That scene is capped with the first brutal murder, and those two things together do make for a pretty effective scene. Honestly, the movie is well shot from start to finish, it has a very distinct look at I will give credit where credit is due.It's not great, the characters don't add anything, and it hasn't really lived up to its SHOCKING reputation. All in all, it feels too long and doesn't offer up anything new or exciting. If it sounds like something you'll enjoy, you probably will. It's gross, is exploitative, and over all (besides looking good) it's pretty weak.www.barleydoeshorror.com",The Green Inferno
141,bastiaan0740,A cult movie? No. OK? Yes!,6,19 April 2016,"OK, now I had no idea this movie was 'anticipated', nor did I ever see Cannibal Holocaust (although I saw fragments), so I guess this is as fair of a review as any - although I do like Eli Roth and try to see most of his work, finding some good and some bad - so I'm pretty open either way. One of the first issues I have is seeing Richard Burgi in a minor appearance. Don't get me wrong, I love the guy since 'sentinel', But him being cast previously in Hostel (and killed), and seeing Roth has a cult following most of whom have therefore seen mr. Burgi before, is spoiling the illusion of realism. There was no reason not to use a fresh face.You will get what you came for: cannibals, dismemberments, and flesh-eating. We also get some torture, female genitalia mutilation, and mass zombie-like behavior as well, the last of which seemed out of place and unrealistic. Some parts are silly and not in a good way, I can't tell which ones (spoiler). Some minor CGI, can't tell... (spoiler).There are some nice 'setups' in the movie, and I applaud it for that. We aren't merely talking about a documentary, we have people with an actual agenda and some twists. Ariel Levy does a great job in being unlikeable and providing a story arc, evolving into a near psychopathic personality. The movie got a little carried away with some methods that ruined the realism, but to each his own. To me, that's what hurt the most. The way how the movie wraps itself up makes little sense, we get some ideas thrown in that didn't really work, combine or satisfy - but that's just the last 2 minutes.In all, a careful recommendation to the fans of the genre.",The Green Inferno

At the time of exploitation films it still pushed the limits. While Roth loves those days of film it is nearly impossible to do it today after being bombarded with years of ""torture porn"" movies. The acting though is definitely superior to Cannibal Holocaust, Not sure if that was a good thing though. The prior had more of a sense of realism like a documentary. This you can tell is no doubt a cinematic film. Roth does capture the terror of the crew captured. Some scenes he does add his usual touch of brutality so any fan of his will not be disappointed at all. Overall I thoroughly enjoyed it as a stand alone film and not as a remake.",The Green Inferno
146,Kolobos51,Loooong wait for a disappointment.,4,17 October 2015,"Words can't describe how psyched I was to see this movie. After waiting for more than a year, and absolutely loving Eli Roth's first movie, and liking his next two, I really thought this would be something good. Or, at least, something worthwhile. Well, it's not, not really. I guess if you're not actually familiar with the cult, Euro sleaze cannibal flicks this is clearly inspired by, an homage to, and, ultimately, a blatant rip off of, you might sort of enjoy it. If you are, you'll find it derivative and pointless.The movie has the same basic formula as the first Hostel. We spend the first half of the movie with a group of dim, annoying ""American"" college kids as they go on an adventure into a foreign county that they neither understand nor respect. The second half, they pay for their ignorance with pain and suffering.First, I'd like to say that American is in quotation marks because this is actually a Chilean film and you won't buy that you're in America for a second at the beginning.The movie gets sort of interesting in its critique of self-important college activists, but this idea is pretty much totally abandoned in the second half making the first chunk of the movie rather pointless. You could argue that it's developing character, but given the weak performances and rather one dimensional nature of the players, it really doesn't. I also have to say that Ariel Levy, as the group's jerk leader, is awful beyond words. The best is Spy Kids star Daryl Sabara as the funny stoner type.When the cannibals attack, it's nothing that exceptionally brutal, especially if you've seen the older movies, that were meaner, nastier, and more creative. Seriously, nothing new is added here, except for a weird fixation on female circumcision, which is used as a looming threat throughout. There's only one really gory scene in the whole thing, surprising for Eli Roth, and even more surprising is that Roth has said the movie wasn't cut for the R rating meaning there's probably not an extended cut forthcoming.The Green Inferno moves fast enough to rank watchable status, and the plane crash is pretty impressive, but that's all that really recommends this movie. Maybe it was Roth's long absence behind the camera and he was just plain rusty, maybe the cannibal sub-genre just can't be resurrected in our politically correct climate, or maybe Eli Roth needs to give up and admit that Chile is not a viable filming location, after failing with Aftershock, The Stranger, and this movie. Regardless, skip it and watch Cannibal Ferox again or for the first time, as it this movie's most direct ancestor. Better yet, watch Cannibal Holocaust, a genuinely great movie. Just don't waste your cash on The Green Inferno.",The Green Inferno
147,chimera3,Repulsive with a Capital R,1,16 October 2017,"Ever since I saw ""Cabin Fever,"" I always pictured Eli Roth to be a very odd duck. I myself am an odd duck but he has some rather interesting tastes when it comes to making movies, tastes that put mine to shame. From what I read about him, he does not like the sight of real blood but has no problems with fake blood. By itself, that part makes no sense. What kind of movie maker (particularly one who makes horror movies) can be so squeamish about the sight of real blood?Anyway, I digress. Going into this, I had no real high hopes for it. I just wanted to see what it was like and nothing more. True to form, it was typical Eli Roth, the king of shock value. When I watched this (it was late at night and I thanked God I had an empty stomach), it definitely grossed me out...and it takes a lot to do that, by the way. A group of college environmentalists take a plane ride into the jungle and end up being involved in a cliché plane crash that leaves a number dead and others injured after the fact. Those who survive then have to fight through the dangers of the jungle in order to survive and end up being on the wrong end of a cannibalistic tribe with all sorts of weapons and techniques at their disposal.There was never a moment in the movie where I didn't squirm in my chair...and, to repeat, I almost rarely do that. If Eli was trying to do an homage to the 1970's cannibal movies by making this filth, he failed miserably. In true survival horror movie fashion, only one of the survivors walks away and heads back to the real world, forever scarred by the horrors that she went through in the jungle.I have never truly been a fan of Eli Roth. I've seen ""Aftershock,"" which is just as revolting. I've seen ""Cabin Fever,"" which is decent enough for a few scares. Now there's ""The Green Inferno,"" a nonsensical waste of time that should have never been made. There is a reason why those types of movies were made in that time: you were more likely to be scared during the 1970's than you are now, where you become more numb than anything. I wouldn't even recommend watching this on a bet, not even by yourself or with friends...that is, unless they're friends that you don't ever want to talk to ever again. Watch something else other than this. Your stomach and your friends may thank you.",The Green Inferno

150,Bryan_Roderick,Not Eli's Best Work.,5,22 April 2016,"Green InfernoI had been wanting to see this last year but was unable to see it in theaters. The direction of them film was mediocre for a Eli Roth film. I know he could have done better. The writing was good, lots of foreshadowing, which was also done by Eli Roth. So kudos.I went into the movie having seen the ""scene"" that everyone told me about. It came and went and the film didn't shock me again. A bit disappointing on that part. Also the build up to that point was a tad overcooked.Justine played by Lorenza Izzo the main character did a wonderful job of convincing me she was fearing for her life and body parts. Alejandro played by Ariel Levy was a complicated character that I loved to hate. Just goes to show Eli Roth's storytelling.Sky Ferreira shows the acting range of early Kristen Stewart a bland angst with bad timing on delivery. She set a very negative tone for the rest of the movie.The film itself has a bad overall tone. Like my previous review the film wants to be a horror film. This time I finished feeling like the genre was more adventure with gore elements. Watching this makes me excited to see Knock Knock, since it's also written by Guillermo Amoedo and Eli Roth who co-wrote this movie.Verdict: If you know who Eli Roth is and what his movies are like then you should watch this and compare it to Hostel and Cabin Fever. Average moving going audience though, it's a pass.",The Green Inferno
151,stanrogersmith,Avatar meets The Deer Hunter,3,12 November 2015,"Yep, I couldn't get it out of my head. This was a cross between Avatar (for obvious reasons) and The Deer Hunter (when the soldiers are held captive by savages). The rest of the movie was just OK, but I really disliked most of the characters. I was hoping that Roth would at least give some better gratuitous skin shots of the female lead. Unfortunately not enough to warrant an extra star. The main guy who was the scumbag leader of the group I really wished that they had him get chopped to pieces and eaten at the end. What a turd of a character. The first guy to get chopped up into smoked jerky was also a moron and was glad he got killed off. But if you're really interested, here are some very specific reasons that this movie was ridiculous:1. Female bimbo takes off to parts unknown with strangers against the gut feeling of her bimbo best friend - can say cliché?2. Female bimbo doesn't realize she's being played for a fool when she's manipulated into almost being executed because the lead moron gave her a defective or sabotaged padlock once at the protest site - a blind man could have seen that coming a mile away.3. Scene just after the plane crash where people come out of the plane and you get the one guy who was lucky to survive the crash unhurt but confused enough to stumble into the still spinning engine propeller blades - again, totally cliché.4. The unnecessary and totally stupid scene where the chick needs to have an uncontrolled diarrhea explosion in the cage while her fellow captives look away or look on disgusted, but the little children of the village watch and laugh making ""stinky smelling"" gestures with their hands by their noses. If Roth thought that would be some levity, the dude should never try to make a comedy then because he obviously doesn't know a joke from his a-hole.5. Trying to escape through the top of the cage. Really, are these primitives so effing stupid that the first time they saw the attempted jail break they didn't think to fix the hole in the top of the cage???6. The scene of testing the chicks for virginity with what looks like a dinosaur fang on the finger of the one-eye-blind cannibal bitch in charge. Just flat out stupid. And the least Roth could have done is shown a booty shot of the chicks from behind. Blown opportunity.7. The main chick wins the trust or respect of one of the village children by playing a couple of notes on a necklace flute. Come on...8. A successful escape only to have the morons go back to the plane crash site TO BE CAPTURED AGAIN!!! How stupid are these idiots?9. The fire-ants swarming the dude. Again, missed opportunity. I'm embarrassed to write this but, Indiana Jones and the Crystal Skull did such a scene much much better.Finally, 10. The scene just before the end where the douchebag is back at the university and comes up behind the main chick to say he made it back, she turns, looks shocked to see him, but then bares her bloody cannibal/savage filed teeth and attacks him, only to have a quick cut scene to her waking up safe in her bed because it was just a nightmare. Seriously, WTF was that??? The oldest and lamest trick in the book. Roth should be beaten mercilessly and repeatedly for that stunt alone.Now that I've gotten that off my chest, its off to see what other piles of steaming dog doo there are to waste my time watching.",The Green Inferno
152,Coolestmovies,"Gore galore, but a slavish re-tread of the Deodato/Lenzi films. Not that that's entirely bad thing . . .",7,8 September 2013,"NOTE: slight spoiler in the second last paragraph, duly noted below.I've always found Eli Roth's films to be mixed bags. GREEN INFERNO is by far his best picture, but as in most of his other films his limitations as a dialogue writer are foregrounded too often, albeit thankfully to nowhere near the extent they were in the RZA's execrable vanity project MAN WITH THE IRON FISTS. His character development skills, however, show unexpected signs of refinement during his six year absence from the director's seat.In particular, Roth's take on environmental activists -- all of the main characters in Green Inferno are self-serious, latte-drinking ""save the rain forest"" university types who infiltrate a clear-cutting operation deep in the Amazon jungle and chain themselves to the logging machinery in order to protest ""corporate greed"" via satellite linkup with their iPhones -- cuts effectively deep for a filmmaker not usually given to social criticism.Most criticism that could be leveled at the film's dialogue and subtext, however, is irrelevant since the drawing card for horror buffs will without question be the exotic, ""dangerous"" location (which promises enough stories for multiple gory sequels, according to Roth), and the copious scenes of torture, dismemberment and cannibalism that ensue when the protagonists' plane -- possibly due to sabotage, it's later implied -- crashes into the forest on the return trip home (the opening protest mission is entirely self-contained, and actually successful, or so it seems at first). Enter the natives -- reportedly played by an authentic Chilean tribe, albeit one not prone to dining on human flesh -- and the feasting begins.The grisly makeup effects are by a team led by legends Gregory Nicotero and Howard Berger (who aren't credited at IMDb as of this writing, but ARE listed in the opening credits of the film), and they certainly deliver, particularly the squishy, screaming dismemberment that sets the ball rolling. As far as cannibal movies go, the special effects in GREEN INFERNO are certainly the most elaborate to date, but considering the most notable (and notorious) run of this genre happened thirty years ago, that probably goes without saying.Manuel Riveiro's full orchestral lends the film an appropriately ominous sense of portent -- especially when it accompanies sweeping flyover shots of dense jungle -- and a feeling of scope and import that belies the fact that GREEN INFERNO is ultimately a throwback/valentine to the works of Ruggerio Deodato and Umberto Lenzi, almost to the letter, in particular Lenzi's CANNIBAL FEROX (aka MAKE THEM DIE SLOWLY). Speaking of those two, Roth's film is actually dedicated to Deodato, and the credits list most if not all of the films in this sub-genre that one should probably see or at least be aware of going in or coming out. At TIFF, Roth claimed this list (along with numerous tweet handles in the final roll) was simply a great way to insert some marketing magic directly into the film itself, but one could also read it as a preemptive strike against critics (and fans) who might realize just how shamelessly he treads familiar ground with this show and attempt to dock points for it. Mind you, if enough future audience members haven't seen any of the late 70's or early 80's Italian cannibal pictures -- and let's face it, a whole new generation or two probably doesn't even know they exist -- that might bode well for this picture, especially via DVD/streaming, as there's nothing like experiencing a dedicated cannibal movie for the first time, and with a strong stomach. It's also now very likely that some of GREEN INFERNO's predecessors will get fancy new Blu-ray re-releases thanks to the existence of this film. So there's that.As for gratuitous skin -- always a component of the originals -- Roth treats us to more of Daryl Sabara's junk than most viewers probably ever thought they'd care to see, for what that's worth, while for the likely-to-be-predominantly-male demographic of this type of picture, Loranna Izzo spends a fair portion of the final act bounding through the rain forest in a skimpy little muslin jungle bikini (and -- SPOILER AHEAD!! -- appears oh-so-briefly topless during her FGM ""preparation"" scene), while she and a couple of the other actresses have fleeting moments sans pants getting ""examined"" by the tribe's cataracted, jaundice-skinned resident witch doctor and gynecologist. Such as it is, the skin quotient -- when it's not being ripped and chopped apart, and cooked and eaten, at least -- is more or less on par with the original films. Thankfully Roth and company avoid scenes of animal cruelty (even faked) altogether, so those who uncomfortably recall such unpleasantness from the Deodato/Lenzi films can rest easy; it's only the humans who get eaten this time out.Finally, a dangling subplot involving one character will undoubtedly serve as the foundation of the just-announced sequel, which reportedly begins production almost immediately. To be honest, I'd almost forgotten about this character until the drive home, which was probably the point all along.",The Green Inferno
153,HorrorFreak1997,7.0/10. a solid homage to the Italian cannibal movies of the 70's and 80's.,7,28 September 2016,"The Green Inferno (2013) directed by Eli Roth is a solid homage to the old Italian cannibal films of the 1970's and the 1980's. The cannibal sub genre isn't exactly known for its amazing plot structure or character development, it's mostly known for its shock value, beautiful locations, suspense and good gore effects. The Green Inferno doesn't live up to the excellence of say, Cannibal Holocaust, but it does do a great job of finding it's place within the sub genre as a good film that achieves mostly everything it set out to achieve. It just doesn't blow you away the way that Cannibal Holocaust does.Lorenza Izzo plays Justine, the main girl and does an alright job. To make things short all of the acting is just alright. The script and its characters don't really have any depth, which is fine but it doesn't allow any of the actors to give a performance that is better than alright. Which once again is totally fine as long as the acting isn't totally awful, and its not. The film focuses more on shock value and gore than anything else. While it does have some pretty shocking and gory scenes of cannibalism and dismemberment, it feels rather tame when we have films like A Serbian Film in this day and age. But to the casual movie goer, this one will be very disturbing. Rightfully so, you watch this kind of film to be shocked, not for a structured plot, deep characters or excellent camera work and editing. Yet, aside from one scene there really isn't much here in terms of true shock value. Which leaves the viewer a tad bit disappointed. This doesn't ruin the film by any means but it does leave you wishing there was more. The gore effects are amazing. It's easy to tell what scene took up a nice chunk of the budget. The tribe and the way they are depicted is pulled off very, very well and the environmentalist angle is also pulled off very well in the beginning and towards the end of the film. This is all topped off by the lovely scenery and some scenes of suspense here and there.To conclude my review ill just say that The Green Inferno (13) directed by Eli Roth is a great cannibal flick, but isn't top notch by any means. It does a good job of paying homage to the old Italian cannibal flicks and carves out its own identity with some realistically depicted cannibals, some amazing gore effects, one astounding scene of pure gratuitous violence and some good production values. Really you know what you are getting into when you sit down and watch it, and you get what you are promised.The verdict: 7.0/10.",The Green Inferno

The ""Hostel"" movies were lame. ""Cabin Fever"" was barely tolerable. But this movie just baffles me...Maybe I'm getting old and this movie is just aimed at a younger audience. I mean, if you've never seen or heard about cannibals before then hang on to your seats 'cuz this movie will be a shocker to ya! But, if you've seen ""Ravenous"" or ""Silence of the Lambs"" or ""Hannibal"" or ""We Are What We Are"" or ""Alive"" or any of the zillion zombie movies out there than you have a pretty good idea of what cannibals have for dinner. So why is this over-rated director trying to make it seem like the eating of eyeballs or the tongue is the zenith of horror? I got news for you Eli, this is a typical meal! They're cannibals!!! That is not terror...that is Tuesday brunch! Again...maybe I've just watched to many horror movies and I'm disgusted by the fact that the good ones are few and far between. It's a movie about a cannibalistic tribe that captures these meddling college kids and....wait for it.... then cannibalizes them. There's no buildup of tension or dread or even a scare. The outcome is inevitable (dinner) so it's like Roth didn't even try....no scares, no characters to root for. Heck, even the character you're suppose to hate doesn't even make you that angry. Throw some black magic or witchcraft in there to try and build mystery or suspense of some kind...do something! The gore was good, the setting was good...and I literally felt nothing when the movie was over. No dread, no anxiety, no pity for the victims....it might as well have been a documentary...no, no...that's not right...documentaries have better scripts and acting...",The Green Inferno
155,peedur,Remarkably lame,1,2 October 2015,"I'd hoped for something - maybe a more clearly horrifying, less trashy-exploitative reinterpretation of the 70's Italian shocker that Mr. Roth was faithfully emulating. There WAS something unnerving (and elusive) to ""Cannibal Holocaust,""as grubby and amateur an effort that it was. Sadly however, ""The Green Inferno"" misses whatever that quality was by such a huge margin, one wonders what on earth the filmmaker was thinking. Did he even understand what made that earlier film work? Cardboard characters with cliché feelings, motivations so caricatured they border on contempt for the audience. We don't care that these characters may perish. Neither the story nor the filmmakers take them very seriously beyond their value as flesh, a miscalculation on several levels.The internet has conditioned or calloused us to footage of dismemberment, beheading and viscera. This subject was taboo and terrifying in the 70's when one could only see it on the rare videotape - the secretive quality made it so much more forbidden. Today, we actually need more context to be horrified.The primitive natives could have played a wonderful contrast to the American/European characters, but they were treated with even less interest beyond their basic caricature. A simple look at ""Apocalypto"" might have given Mr. Roth some pointers about how an alien culture can be horrifying with violence. But there is nothing that lofty here. What the natives do is given the aura of ""yikes"" rather than dread or horror.""What is it that makes cannibalism horrifying?"" is a question which isn't even asked in this film. The filmmaker takes it for granted that it IS horrifying and leaves it there. There is no exploration beyond the visual; what we do get in terms of exploration feels tame since there is no awareness of why it even needs to be understood. Horror is not an easy genre to master, we are skeptical about the nature of manipulation. We are more aware than ever about psychology, media, character motivations and what makes stories compelling; it's the reason why TV and film has rapidly become so much more sophisticated. Death requires more context to induce terror - horror movies cannot take anything for granted. Mr Roth's successful efforts concentrate on the issues of sadism/torture and/or the fear of pain. This one takes the subject of cannibalism and doesn't explore it beyond it's basic mechanism.This is a sad, bland film which is sadder given how much the intent was to be shocking and ghastly. It achieves neither.",The Green Inferno
156,roguecritic42,Delicious Gorefest for Brutal Horror Fans!,8,27 September 2015,"I can't believe all these bad reviews about such a great horror film. What movie did these people think they were going to see? It's a movie about college kids trying to save the rainforest, the plane crashes and they get eaten by cannibals. Were these people expecting some kind of Emmy winning performance by George Clooney, or just a fun gore-fest of horror about people being tortured in fun ways? I love it. Yes it fell short in a couple spots. This movie was titled ""Green Inferno"" to give a nod to its predecessor the Cannibal Holocaust, so that is what I'll compare it to. While this movie was definitely dark and had some memorable gore scenes, it doesn't quite measure up to the Cannibal Holocaust. One of the things about Cannibal Holocaust was that the cannibals seemed justified. I mean the people who were eaten by cannibals in that movie were doing horrible things and murdering villagers and burning their houses down and stuff. In contrast, the cannibals in Green Inferno had no obvious motive other than it was said ""They see us as the enemy"". These ""do-gooder"" college kids in Green Inferno did nothing to insult or provoke the cannibals, so it lacked that important story telling part which we were given in Cannibal Holocaust. There is also a scene in the movie where a small bag of weed is put in a persons dead body, then the cannibals eat the body and get high. The ridiculous part was that was a real small bag of weed, and somehow like 50 villagers got stoned out of their minds. Not realistic at all, but still made for a funny moment in the movie, so whatever. I was willing to suspend disbelief for a moment to simply enjoy the gorefestival that it was.All that aside, it was my type of horror film. Yes, I would have liked to see some more female nudity. Instead Mr. Roth gave us a penis shot, which I did not need to see. But whatever, it was a funny flinch- type moment.",The Green Inferno
157,DexX,An absolute shambles,2,6 November 2018,"Considering the experienced filmmakers working on this film and the genre of cinema to which it pays homage, I can't really understand how it managed to be so very bad.The Green Inferno is badly acted, ineptly written, poorly directed and edited, and fundamentally misconceived. It has no idea what it is trying to say or how it is trying to say it, veering wildly between stark horror and puerile slapstick. One of the characters is so poorly-written that I actually shouted ""WHAT???"" at the screen in multiple scenes as they became a full-on villain with absolutely no justification.Even worse, this movie seems to be making a case that student activism is pointless and that some ""primitive"" people are savages who deserve to be wiped out. Parts of it come across as full-blown pro-colonial propaganda.Perhaps its worst sin, though, is that it chickens out on the gore and exploitation. Despite all the posturing about ""reviving a lost film genre"", there is clearly a line in the sand that the film refuses to cross, and as a result it feels cowardly. Nicotero and his team did a solid job of the gore, and it's insulting to their work that the camera shies away from showing too much of it.Eli Roth may pretend to be following in the footsteps of Ruggero Deodato, but he doesn't have even a fraction of his imagination and sheer bravado. Deodato had his faults, but Cannibal Holocaust was at least an honest film that dared to go further than any other films dared. Roth is a weak copycat in comparison.",The Green Inferno

The movie is entertaining and smart without taking itself too seriously. The gore is well done, very believable as is the situation. I like that Roth did not care about being politically correct. Catering to the hypersensitive low intelligence sanctimonious section of the public is something no horror movie should ever do. This one did not. It had a great premise and went with it, bravely. I was pleasantly surprised to see the main actress is the director's wife. She is very good in this film and a pleasure to watch. The movie does not skimp on details and keeps you entertained throughout.",The Green Inferno
159,Zoltanko,Not Just Bad Filmmaking - Totally Inept,1,26 November 2019,"I don't usually review bad movies. Generally not worth the effort. But this film should usher in a new ""zero stars"" rating on IMDB.It's a direct ripoff of that low-budget, amateurish, raunchy, exploitation film from almost 40 years ago, Cannibal Holocaust. However, that was a better film than this! And Eli Roth obviously had much more money to spend; he certainly wasted every penny.The acting is atrocious, despite the fact that many of the cast members are professional actors. Perhaps their knowledge of English was limited to the point that they didn't realize what absurd lines they were being asked to speak. But isn't it the director's job to fix this? Roth either didn't care or is such a bad director that he can't distinguish between a good delivery and an awkward stumble. Then again, the script is so full of nonsense and trite cliches, the cast really didn't have a whole lot to work with. Roth is one of the writers, so again, we know where to lay blame.There is so much wrong with this film it would be hard to make a list. The fact that Roth thought we want to see masturbation, deification, vomiting, urination, mutilation, torture, just to name a few, makes me wonder about his mental stability. He tries to save it by injecting some socially conscious environmental message about the fate of the Amazon Rain Forest - which is actually quite laughable in the context of everything else.This isn't just a bad movie - it's totally inept. The kind of thing someone makes who has no clue how to actually do something worthwhile. Pathetically horrible in every sense.",The Green Inferno
160,ReelBrew,A group of college activists must fight to survive after a cannibalistic tribe capture them.,5,12 December 2015,"Going into a film like The Green Inferno you have two kinds of people; the aware and the unaware. Those who know the Italian- exploitation genre and have seen the films of the late 70′s early 80′s that director Eli Roth stems his appreciation from, and those who were dragged along by the former. This is a film that knows what it's doing and where it wants to go, which isn't how Hostel felt at times, though its sequel certainly improved upon. What makes The Green Inferno enjoyable is the initiative Roth takes in building a story around a group of activists intent on heading into the Peruvian jungle in order to stop acres of vegetation from getting slaughtered, as well as the guidance it has throughout the third act. The Green Inferno showcases a director's strengths attempting to escape the clutches of their weaknesses, giving an attentive nod to an adored genre while falling over the footsteps of exhausting dialogue and comedic gags that only deaden a pace crafted from obvious talent.In the first act we are introduced to Justine, a dough eyed college freshman who quickly falls under the effortless spell of Alejandro, an activist bent on change at any cost. It's with naivety and jadedness that Eli Roth places us in the company of cookie cutter characters that we for the most part dislike given their hollow and callous centers, save for sweetheart Jonah and pragmatic Daniel. Walking the same path as Hostel, we're left wondering if we're meant to dislike these characters, rooting for their untimely demise or if we're suppose to embrace their naivety as a humanistic fault. Ultimately we are cast away with these characters as they plunge head first into unchartered territory, taken away with a story that is wholly Eli Roth; a story that is frequently engaging and surprisingly tense with lush cinematography by Antonio Quercia.Once we are stranded with our doomed adventurers we begin to see The Green Inferno shift into a film that was pursued and given life as Frankenstein gave life to the dead; in order to see passion and love for what was watched and study have new meaning again. With a score by Manuel Riveiro breathing movement and life into each scene, we are taken on a ride into hell that has a fondness for dismemberment. Roth and fellow screenwriter Guillermo Amoedo fine tune a script that pulsates with ingenuity, with Roth knowing all too well what to give us once we reach the gates of hell. Flexing his skills and knowledge for tackling horror, Eli Roth gives us the films swan song with the tribes first ritualistic kill, knowing that it takes a lot more to get our pulses raised once the grisly terror halts in order to push the story along. It's a move that is frustratingly genius, as what's to come can never reach the climactic bullet we've barreled along with for over an hour. What we are subjected to till the very end is an effort that is indebted to its source material but tepid in its approach, feeling all too safe to truly feel respectful of the Italian-exploitation genre. When one of the captives gets ill within the confines of their prison cell, it feels all too comedic and amateurish to show her defecating in the corner, an approach both the genre and Eli Roth are better than. Perhaps with the time saved removing this scene there might have been extra funds in the budget to produce better CGI, which stand-out like a severed thumb within a gorgeous and natural environment. The Green Inferno isn't a bad film but one that plays it too safe in the third act, despite dealing with certain subject matter. With a flawed finale and unnecessary elements amidst almost palpable dread, The Green Inferno should be applauded for standing out as a beacon of hope for modern horror films and the directors that continually push for their films to be released.",The Green Inferno

It helps, a LOT, to have seen most if not all of the films this one references, but I was surprised and pleased to see some references to Werner Herzog in there too, which should be expected since Roth shot on the same river as Aguirre. But I digress.Filled with enough blood, guts, and viscera for the most discerning gorehound, the film gets the kills going, includes an uncomfortable vaginal exam, and a very unpleasant plane crash which was probably the most horrifying thing in the entire movie from my perspective, since I hate flying.A Cannibal Ferox ending followed by a Man From Deep River teaser in the credits?

He had a solid cast, what looked like a reasonable budget, gorgeous locations and KNB on the makeup effects. Well, he screwed it up...again! The film has it's good points, all of which lie within the first half hour or so. The character development is solid, the storyline is refreshingly linear and simply told and the plane crash is handled well. It's after said crash that the wheels come off.This is where the film should have jumped into high gear and sent its audience screaming in fear. It's weak, it's predictable and above all - it's not in the least bit scary or ultra violent - in fact this felt like a Cannibal Holocaust Lite, for the ""Scream"" TV series generation.The gore was mostly silly and unoffensive, the cinematography was way too clean and lacked the true grit that Holocaust had years earlier and there was little to no authenticity in the cannibal scenes.Though not a terrible film - I'm being harsh purely based on my level of anger. This is coming from a man who claims to love Cannibal Holocaust but does't have the foggiest idea as to why that film works so well.For those of you that know Deodato's work - Avoid!",The Green Inferno
163,thatpunkadam,"Leaving the grind house opened a visual feast, but restrained by homesickness",5,1 November 2015,"""For as much as it's concerned with questioning the infliction of our own values onto these people, The Green Inferno shamelessly contradicts itself. Rather than spend time painting the natives as a unique culture, save for 2-dozen quick cuts of laughing, singing, and a single ritual, the film thrives off of the horrendous deaths of these students. Yet, by the third killing we still don't learn anything new about the culture – the types of Gods they worship, hierarchy of power, annual celebrations – instead justifiably fearing them before we're told we're imperialists for feeling such away by Justine's jarring metamorphosis. At times, though, the unpredictability of the tribe works effectively as a means of organic suspense; the lack of a means of communication and the killing ritual did a commendable job at keeping me rigid in my seat.""FULL REVIEW HERE: http://www.borrowingtape.com/latest-reviews/the-green-inferno-2015",The Green Inferno

Eli Roth, known for Hostel, Grindhouse & Cabin Fever, as always tries his best in his own movie genre, which can only be described as splatter parody.Be prepared for a few crazy splatter scenes, along with some utterly ludicrous ones. This movie will probably be remembered in the future as a B' movie, but I have to tell you that the script is well worked (ecological thoughts mixed with criticism on western life, but at the same time a dose of racism is necessary for Eli Roth's parodies) and the cinematography is perfect. Needless to say do NOT choose this movie for your first date (unless you want to troll her). Choose your most immature buddy instead.

165,SeakDub,Laughable. Bad. Try another movie.,4,16 October 2015,"From other reviewers going into much detail about the film, I'll just say what was good and bad. We will start with the good, or the bits I found likable.Or you could even watch SOUTH PARK, season 3 episode 1 RAINFOREST SHMAINFOREST which is about saving the rain forest that doesn't end well. Same thing, expect SOUTH PARK was funnier.Good- The movie itself was beautiful. Love the scenery and it does make you wonder about the rain forest, made me want to check into places to help support and conserve the rain forest. I did appreciate that. Loved the fact they had the Peruvian jungle natives in the film and everything. Now for the laughable part of the film, I don't know if it was suppose to laugh at certain scenes, but I did enjoy laughing at them, made it felt like a B movie. But I wasn't sure if it was met, some of the death scenes were bad that I had to laugh. Some jokes that I found funny. But otherwise not much else had me going for the film, it did start with the story and ended okay. Bad- From the beginning, the moment Justine's roommate is introduced, I couldn't stand her character. Made me want to fast forward every part that included her. I was enjoying the story built up, but once the cannibals started eating, it just became that, an expected porn torture movie on how can I kill the next guy. I forgot all about the story, all you focus on from there is how the next person will die. I knew this movie was gonna have heavy death scenes, brutal killings, I wanted to feel sympathy for these people. But I didn't, I wanted the cannibals to quickly kill and eat them just so I know how the movie ended so I could leave. With that it was very boring and terrible to watch. I was hoping to be surprised and disgusted, I wanted to tell someone I didn't see it coming! But all I did was criticize the deaths. They either looked terrible and completely fake, the acting was bad in the death, you see worse stuff nowadays on TV shows. You see movies for the fantasy and to get away from reality. Certain scenes had me wonder why they would do that?! Didn't make sense, could have been avoided, why they didn't help each other. Besides what I pointed out what I found good, I just found everything else to be bad. I can tend to like a movie that ends up bad but to have something small make it worth while. And to finish it off, the ending, worked I suppose, just felt bad. Can't really describe it. I thought it fit but felt very pointless and lame to me. Don't get me started on, SPOILER!, the after credit scene how supposedly one of the guys is still alive. What was Eli Roth planning with that? A sequel? To surprise us? Again pointless and waste of time to add it. So to end it, more bad, lots more bad than good. I would have rated it lower if it wasn't for some good, especially laughing at parts. I would not recommend it, probably won't even remember this movie exists, will never get around to watching it again. Save your time to find another movie with better ratings and reviews or even just watch CANNIBAL HOLOCAUST, the movie that inspired Eli Roth on his horror movies.",The Green Inferno

167,jacobywarner,Eli Roth Has Done It Again!,8,30 November 2019,"I am a huge fan of all of Eli Roths work, his use of violence and gore contribute to his many underlying themes. In this film he uses these tools to bring attention to some of the many issues that the rain forrest faces, and despite the Amazonian people preforming most of the violence it is an not without aggravation. He uses their brutality as a paradox of what large corporations are doing to the amazon.He employs colors that compliment each other by ways of extreme contrast which gives a striking image appealing to the eye. There is also some great dialogue in this film that is very reminiscent of the many conversations that I have had with my college roommates and friends. For each character I could cast the perfect person just from my current friends and that is what really allows me to connect to this film.I am giving this movie an 8/10 because it is a great film that I recommend to everyone. This movie is a true homage to the 1980 Cannibal Holocaust with references to Cannibal Ferox and should be in contention for the best cannibal film of all time.",The Green Inferno

169,gorepump,"Roth's best film to date, but unfortunately tops out with only one stand-out scene...",4,24 October 2015,"Despite his status as an implicit 'one-trick-pony', relying predominantly on the pandering of low rent, fan boy-run social media- based horror ""news"" outlets who have continually publicized his plethora of ill-fated projects over the better part of a decade, Eli Roth actually managed to complete something and get it released. And, I'll be damned, I was actually somewhat interested in this latest work as it was a departure from the infantile, jump-scare laden, supernatural toilet waste that passes as 'horror' these days, as far as more 'mainstream' releases go. The idea of a NEW tribal cannibal flick hitting the big screen was inherently appealing to me, regardless of the smug douche hackster gracing the director's chair...A wanna-be activist chick joins up with some environmentalists who travel to the amazon to ambush a crew of corporate loggers with a live-streaming ""cyber"" protest. Sh*t doesn't totally go according to plan (or does it?), yet they still manage to avoid getting their heads blown off by the militia. Their victory celebration on board their little plane is cut short by a crash that kills about half of them, leaving the rest to be kidnapped by a tribe of people-eating savages who mistake the do-gooders for the ""evil"" tree choppers. From there, you pretty much just watch the remaining captives get killed and eaten.So, once you make it through the slow start, involving inane college kid babble and the botched protest, things actually start looking promising. The petrified group of Americans being herded into the tribal village made for a pretty strong and dire looking scene and the first guy to be gruesomely dismembered alive (after having his eyes and tongue yanked from his head and devoured...) was a delectably brutal bit of carnage, courtesy of some convincing and bloody practical FX work. Then, unfortunately, it's pretty much downhill from there with the remainder of the human livestock sitting in their bamboo cell and hatching their hair brained escape attempts in between idiotic scenes that only a frat boy-minded tard like Eli Roth would think fits into this type of movie. Sh*t like: a guy whacking off amidst bloodshed in order to ""keep his mind clear"", a chick with cartoonishly explosive diarrhea and getting the tribe high by jamming a bag of weed down the throat of a soon-to-be cooked corpse.Aside from all this unfunny and out-of-place bullsh*t, the death scenes following the initial dismemberment are quite weak and ineffective. One of them kills herself in the cage. One demise is entirely off-screen and another involves lousy looking CGI bullet ants. That, on top of Roth's insufferable writing and one of the sh*ttiest 'payoffs' I can recall in quite some time, ""The Green Inferno"" disintegrates quickly into a tragically unremarkable and all-too 'traditional' looking horror flick, encompassing a cast of genre stereotypes. I guess I was hoping for a few less punches pulled in the long-run. Granted, it was a safe bet that animal killing and rape-sprees weren't going to 'fly' as far as a studio film in this day n' age goes, but there was ample opportunity for some dick chopping that never played out! And the topic of female genital mutilation is prevalent, but still never comes to fruition... Again, it all comes down to that one stand-out death scene.On the flip side, is it better than all the other ""Poltergeist/Paranormal Activity"" sh*t coming out? Absolutely. Without a doubt. Hell, it's way better than the ""Hostel"" movies by a long shot and props go out to Roth for at least attempting something like this and pushing as hard as he did to get it released in theaters so I can't bitch too much. I only wish it was more worth the effort and the wait. It's worth checking out for those who appreciate the top dogs of the 'cannibal exploitation' sub-genre, such as ""Cannibal Ferox"", ""Man from Deep River"" and, of course, ""Cannibal Holocaust"". It's nowhere near as raw and visceral as those, but when is the last time you saw a NEW jungle cannibal flick?On a side note of bonus douchebaggery, Roth decided to include the Twitter handles of the main cast and select crew members along with their credit at the end. Good idea since the popularity of social media sites has never been known to dwindle and accounts are never suspended or deactivated. Way to incorporate that timelessness into your movie, as*hole. Twitter will surely remain eternally relevant.More of my reviews @ http://swinesewage.blogspot.com/",The Green Inferno

The acting, if you can call it that was terrible most of the time, the acting newbies the tribe members were a lot more believable and they were actually the best part of this film by a mile. The first 40 mins of the film are painful, you are stuck watching these unlikable characters try to act and Lorenza Izzo's reasons for going there in the first place are ridiculous! She has a thing for the activist leader, sure he is decent looking but good looking enough to possibly die for....no! oh and he also very much has a girlfriend who is also on the trip. What was she thinking...urgh! Once they end up in the jungle it definitely gets better and what happens to the tribe's first sacrifice is absolutely epic. The deaths unfortunately get a lot less gory from there, in fact i would probably say there is more gore in The Walking Dead. This shocked me because Eli usually goes all out on the gore front (Hostel,Cabin Fever) He even says that this is his directors cut, which is surprising. Some things happen that are just ridiculous! I was watching this to be creeped out but i ended up finding it hilarious!!*Stop reading now if you don't want it to be spoilt*We see one of the girls squat in the corner of the cage with a bad case of the s***s, complete with plenty of fart noises. Someone dies and the team leader starts masturbating (EH?!), they then shove a bag of weed into the body so that the tribe get stoned while they are cooking their next meal. This works for a while but then backfires when they get the 'MUNCHIES!' the victim actual screams this before his demise. The ending also confused me so much, so did other various plot points which i only now understand because i seeked out the answers.

The direction for the whole of the movie was uneven and I got the impression that the producers hired someone off the street to edit this movie, as the continuity and the uneven flow of the movie made it difficult to watch. The best part of the movie was the score, it kept me interested.The Green Inferno is another case of a movie being made for the sake of gore, horror and violence. I thought it was setting out to make a point about the environment and deforestation, bit It doesn't even bother make that point.

182,predatorlm,What's the point,4,10 July 2020,I don't understand the point of this movie. The main character has no growth. She wants to save the tribes and then once they almost kill her she still wants to save them. She watches her friends get eaten and Tortured and then straight up lies about everything and acts as if these savages are misunderstood. The movie should of ended with the villagers getting mowed down by a private military.,The Green Inferno
183,alexrwatson-888-169026,Bloody Atrocious,2,1 January 2016,"Eli Roth's The Green Inferno has premiered at several film festivals over the past two years before finally getting a wide release in the United States. The Green Inferno is about a group of college activists who visit Peru in hopes of stopping the destruction of the indigenous people's land. The group soon finds themselves at the mercy of these indigenous people and their cannibalistic nature. Eli Roth's filmography has been very hit or miss for me. His directorial debut Cabin Fever is a great, campy horror movie, but I'm not a huge fan of his Hostel movies. The Green Inferno and its terrible script is more disturbing than any of the film's gory visuals and left me wondering the intended audience for this atrocious film. Justine (Lorenza Izzo) is the lead in The Green Inferno, and she looks like an Oscar caliber actress among the other terrible performances. While poorly acted, the characters have no depth and all are generic characters you've come to expect in horror movies. These include, but are not limited to, the nice guy, the loose girl, the stoner, etc. The indigenous people give the best performances in the entire film. They are actual villagers on the Amazon, and because of that, they feel very authentic.There are so many things in the story that are silly and don't make any sense. One way I can sum this up is by using a mild spoiler as an example so SPOILER ALERT. At one point when the group is captured, they put a small bag of weed inside a dead body as part of an escape plan. So when the cannibals begin to cook this body, the weeds burns, and gets the tribe high. This knocks out a large group of them so the group can begin their escape. END SPOILER ALERT. Knowing what to show and what not to show is very important when it comes to movies in general, even more so with horror movies. The Green Inferno relies on gross-out visuals for a majority of its runtime, and after an onslaught of gore and violence, I became numb to it. Sometimes less is more, and I found myself tuning out after a certain amount of the relentless visuals. A lot of the violence is filmed in this hand-held, shaky style, and this gets old very quickly.The special effects are not very good either. Some of the blood is practical, but the blood and other effects added in post-production leave a lot to be desired. A CGI panther is the worst offender and looks like it was pulled from a SyFy original movie.Eli Roth is known for his strange humor in his movies, and he again attempts to break up the violence with laughs. The dark comedy amidst people eating other people doesn't mesh or make sense tonally.All the generic characters, silly script, gross-out gore, and comedic misfires really make me wonder if this film is for anybody. Hardcore horror and gore fans will be put off by the shaky style of filmmaking, and your average movie fan will be sick to their stomach seeing the film's gross-out visuals. Which makes this even crazier is that this movie has received a wide release. I hope Eli Roth rebounds from this, but until then, he should just stick to Shark Week.If you liked this review, check out the rest of my reviews over at www.watsonmoviereviews.com",The Green Inferno
184,misterphilipj,Give it at least half an hour,8,27 September 2015,"I was unimpressed in the first 30 minutes. The acting was bad, the effects were cheap, and I was wondering how this even made it to a major release. After 30 minutes however, I was sucked right in. Everything suddenly became better, and I was experiencing the horror of everything with the people who were right there. After seeing it I realized the film was rather unique. The screenplay, the music, the behaviors and acting, the lack of subtitles and dialogue from the natives, everything was a very unique experience. I left horrified and you will to, beware ! I would compare this to the blare witch, a low budget project which proved to be a success.",The Green Inferno
185,CEBaum,Idiots eaten by cannibals,5,13 November 2013,"Amazing vistas shot Kubrick-like (Think The Shining) are sharp in perfect HD 4k, dizzyingly beautiful forests lay the path ahead – wonderful as a bloody tribesman's foot crosses the view.Cut to a college in the USA.Now, this hi-def is great for seeing leaves on trees in the forest and fleshy, bloody gore, but not so great when used on actors with little to no makeup and without any kind of filter or lens – it seems an oversight until you wonder if it had been Roth's intention.Because here he uses horribly behaved ugly-skinned teens-rude, sullen and hysterical -even using the drugged-up Sky Ferreira as UC roommate Kaycee, obviously way high on screen, to spoiled Daddy's girl, our heroine Justine (Lorenza Izzo) . Slobbering on greasy pizza and stropping through lectures with cold sores, bad hair, peeling zits and huge inverse entitlement, the script is as poor as the characterization as a group of misguided students decides to take on the loggers in Peru, led by the completely narcissistic Alejandro (Ariel Levy), who Justine kind of takes a fancy to despite him being a huge idiot and having a girlfriend who is a complete bitch.Despite this, and egged on by a female circumcision video in class (yes, this movie really does go there) Justine decides to take up a place on the latest planned ""direct action"".It takes Green Lantern over thirty-five minutes to hit the Peruvian jungle, literally. You'll see. Poor lines with more ham than a pig sandwich add to the jawing discomfort. If this discomfort at the sight and sound of these awful college students is intentional, then Roth is a genius. If not then he's a hack. And I don't know which right now. I know it's a horror trope to hate most of the cast before they start dying – The Descent is a great example of a bunch of stupid people doing exceptionally dumb stuff to end up in peril. So now we can visualize the act heading, written on a matchbook, ""Rich idiots get eaten by cannibals"".And when the promised cannibal action hits, it's predictable theater, reminiscent but only a third generation faded Xerox of Cannibal Holocaust or Apocalypto. There's nothing groundbreaking in the choreography of scenes, nothing peerless. Every part of the piece seems to be a nod to something else, much like the Grindhouse/Death Proof/Planet Terror projects from Rodriguez/Tarantino that Roth was part of some years back. It's just a little too steeped in its predecessors to come off as anything peerless.When Roth does attempt some groundbreaking it is by going cruelly further than necessary; for example I'm not sure I ever wanted to see sharp objects going up girls parts ever, let alone for entertainment, let alone on the massive screen.There is little tension because we know Roth will go the full way most times. When he doesn't, it seems bland for some reason. There are more indirect ways he creates a narrative – storytelling from offscreen regarding one death is interesting, as the victim's tattoos become Ed Gein-esque play for the native kids. And there's some cooking detail that adds texture. But it needed more, earlier.This movie is not fun. It leaves an icky feeling all over you in many ways; the bad actors, the terrifyingly abandoned setting, the direction given as relentless pain and unhidden messages. It's too much. And if Roth, like Noe, for example, hoped to cause real discomfort he succeeds.The instruments he uses to do this are crude and too obviously on point. I am not sure if all this secondary cerebral effect Roth has created is by accident or design. Anyway round, you will still be thinking about this movie for days after you allow it into your brain. If you dare.",The Green Inferno
186,hughchilles,I watched it after Cannibal Holocaust,8,27 June 2021,"It has a weird feel of like Cannibal Holocaust refilmed through the lens of Apocalypto and Final Destination. I really enjoyed the Apocalypto side, that side had an authenticity to it that Holocaust lacked there were some moments of the tribe and children getting involved and the culture side that were really surreal and worth watching for.It's tough to review because the unknown cast and realistic setting made for the immersive jungle horror I had hoped for but the digital effects and cinematic style took away from the authenticity that Holocaust had. It too often reminds you you're watching a film while Holocaust used so many layers of film making you got lost in the reality of it, that said I don't think this needed more shakey documentary cam, maybe less actually, like a Tarantino, often it pulls it's punches and feels too Hollywood to be intimidating.The gore and the music are excellent and I loved the art direction but it leaves you feeling confused and underwhelmed what it's goals were. That said I would definitely recommend it, I just found myself more interested in the tribal rituals than worried about the characters, maybe the whole thing was a statement about cultural practices and social norms I dunno.",The Green Inferno

If you're familiar with his other films then you'll know what I mean, and this film is no exception to his trend.In this one some wide-eyed and idealistic American tweens go off to the jungle to protest the destruction of it and the habitat of an indigenous tribe and then without giving anything away, it all kicks off.The acting is decent, there's a few good shocks and a few tongue in cheek laughs.

This movie is a joke. Every event is a joke. Its a disgrace of horror & gore films. We all know the story of the film so I am not going to discuss about it. Acting is lousy with low class actors, gore effects are absolutely ridiculous and all death events happen like its some comedy. The man-eating cannibals they have been styled by some pathetic hairdresser and their acting is also horrible. I expected to see something like Apocalypto with much more gore. I was fooled.

191,Kyllandra,Mixed bag o' crap,4,20 February 2016,"Well, what can I say about this movie? It sucked. And tbh, the movie that ""inspired"" this one, Cannibal Holocaust, sucked too. It's hyped as being classic horror, but sometimes I think people bestow the ""classic"" label on anything old these days. That movie was barely watchable and only the last 20 minutes were even remotely interesting. I felt nothing for the characters and was happy to see them all get their well deserved deaths. The theme song was fairly haunting though like most Effed up movies from the 70s early 80s but that's just about the only memorable thing about it. However, that is still more than I can say for The Green Inferno which is a movie that you will see, be mildly entertained, and then forget. The only thing you may remember is how horribly acted this film was. I get why directors use unknowns, but at least use unknowns who can act. The acting was so wooden you could chop it up and keep your house warm for an entire winter. Maybe two. I hated every single character in this film too and felt nothing but LOLs when they met their demise. I was hoping ""Kaycee"" who was the only smart character apart from ""Amy"" who decided to take herself out of the equation before the Pygmies could get to her, would decide to go with them at the last minute so she could get killed too. Absolute worst actress I've ever had the displeasure of watching. Something tells me a bunch of these actors did porn. ""Check me out! I made a real movie. Never had one acting lesson!""The hell you say ... *eye roll*I'm starting to think Eli Roth is on his way to being another M. Night Shamalammadingdong; made a couple of decent movies early in his career and then nothing but pretentious flops. It's like they just stop trying. I just don't get it. I really don't. Do these people WANT to be seen as washed-up hacks? Eli Roth IS talented and this movie could have blown the original out of the water. It's like once these entertainers become famous and successful they lose that fire in their bellies and their movies/music/performances etc. amount to little more than a disappointing waste of time.I gave this movie 4 stars because I didn't look at my phone the entire time the movie was on; I didn't want to miss the wildly unlikable characters getting the chop.I'm probably going to watch knock-knock too despite it having terrible reviews as well. Morbid curiosity motivates me to see if that movie is as bad as this one. I'm sure I'm going to be gifted with more horribly wooden acting since Keanu Reeves is starring in it. Speaking of ""wood"", Eli Roth clearly has a big one for Lorenza Izzo. If he's going to keep giving her parts because he's banging her the least he could do is pay for some acting lessons.Don't pay more than a dollar to see this movie.",The Green Inferno

You can tell they did it on location, but even the militia people looked and acted fake too. I mean, come on people. Eli Roth should have known better than kicking his fan base in the teeth and laughing at us the whole ways to the bank. God it was just bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad. The gore was bad.

But, whatever skills Roth had to make those movies, clearly deserted him in making this absolute pile of nonsense.It's everything Hostel isn't - poorly acted (Roth's real life wife is the main character), characters that almost from the first scene they appear in you just want them to die. The character that played this idiot - Alejandro - right from his first scene he was just so obnoxious, and yet we are supposed to believe he is some charismatic leader, I won't say more, as this is spoiler-free, but you'll see for yourself.I could go on and on about all the things wrong with this film, but I won't bother.

Similarly, it has thrill seeking adolescents from the good ol' U S of A and sadistic weirdos from some eastern block s@#t hole. Both films are made by the same company. Furthermore, these films push the limit of violence because, it gets people talking about the movie. Above all, ""The Green Inferno"" is too similar to Mel Gibson's production, ""Apocalypto"". Gibson's story is about a young villager who is taken by Incans as a human sacrifice. As well as, ""Apocalypto"" there are myriad b-movies about flesh eaters including, some retro classics.

And you forgive the director for the minor let downs, because the dark vibe now is very well doneThe movie proceeds perfectly, the vibe turns dark and sick, and the first cannibal kill is showed in all his sickness : they take the less arrogant of the group, gouge out his eyes, cut his tongue, dismember him leaving a fat screaming still alive torso, and finally behead him.The movie proceeds with some WTF moments, probably created to tone down the seriousness, other two deaths are showed, then the lamest kill of the movie (the ant kill) and then... the nonsense.After that, it's clear that the production lost some screenplay page,or has some budget problems, or some actor just left the set, because it doesn't make sense and some characters just disappear (like the main female villain) I won't spoiler more, but after the protagonist returns home, she had an interview, a nightmare, and the movie ends with a scene that was appropriate for ""Mission Impossible""Seriously one of the most out of place and lamest ""finale""/""last 10 minutes"" ever made, that completely ruined the entire movie (that was really good)With a couple of more decent kills, and a just normal finale, I'd give this movie a 7/10.

There was actually a coherent plot, heroes and heroines and villains, and there definitely was action. I wasn't sure if it was intentionally campy at times, or if the budget was stretched a little thin. Either way, it was definitely a different take on typical horror movies and it pushed boundaries.

I subjected myself to this gore-fest last night. Critics of Steinbeck's The Red Pony vent their disgust with both the book's content and the author. Similarly, with The Green Inferno, I could rant about the tastelessness of the content or how someone so demented could produce such filth, but I was drawn to this material and voluntarily consumed it. The story was rather simple and the performances were less than stellar. But, like with porn, I presume that anyone wishing to view this particular title doesn't do so to experience Academy-level talent. With that in mind, I was quite impressed with the carnage and visual effects; lifelike, convincing and fairly creative. Roth once again manages to shatter the shocking meter. I was so compelled that after viewing it once through that I replayed a scene that was perhaps the most disturbing part of the movie because I knew I'd probably never sit through the entirety of this one ever again. If you're expecting gratuitous sex and nudity you'll be disappointed. I was surprised that with the number of young, attractive females we didn't see much skin, unlike Hostel or Cabin Fever.Regarding the plot, I was disappointed with the survivor's defense of of her captors. I couldn't believe that she was willing to describe them with such dignity just to protect a few trees. Dumb!Overall, I saw exactly what I expected to see which is the only reason I rented it.

The dialog somewhat predictable, and I was enjoying it but then at about 50 minutes in, it goes off the rails.

204,italbarenow,This can't be the movie Eli intended . . .,2,26 September 2015,"Opening Day. Waited 2 years. Pretty dazed and confused, and I just want to put on the record that there is a vibe in the flow of this film that gives the impression it's been sliced and diced up and put back together again for reasons that hopefully will leak out at some point. This seems like a movie torn from it's director's hands, and homogenized for American audiences.Keep focusing on the fact that Eli Roth is not stupid, and during this 2 year waiting period and reading about the stages it went through, SOMETHING had to be causing the delays. This was intended as a homage, or re-imagining of Cannibal Holocaust, and seeing Mr. Roth's arc of history, he had a blueprint to go off on that it looks like at first he was going to do.I am willing to bet there are HOURS of footage he shot that went unused, allusions to the original ""Holocaust"" gore, yet they are like writing full sentences as part of a paragraph, then all of a sudden, the sentence just ""stops"" - and if you know the source material - you know precisely why the action stops, and it's because it would have been a bridge too far for American audiences. There are several times, we get the foreshadowing (like someone taking a p*ss, not a spoiler) that is clearly a setup for something that happened in Cannibal Holocaust, yet you see the lead up . . . .the pitch . . . .and then there's no hit. It was clearly ripped out. Hollywood ruins everything with it's formulas. My hope was Eli would wield some power, and do what the French have been doing and break some ground in the horror / thriller genre. I don't like that I hated this experience tonight. I was pulling for it. If you were hoping for a new level, you still can only go to the French, with Haute Tension, Inside, Frontier(e)s, and Martyrs. They leave Hollywood in the dust. Sure, it was aggravated by several cringe worthy moments of dialogue, but it was mostly tight. The lead actress was amazing and nearly carried the entire picture on her shoulders. The villain's arc completely unbelievable and cartoon-ish. Greg Nicotero from the Walking Dead did the effects, and I was salivating for how much more he was going to get away with than he could on television, yet this was LESS than we see on a weekly basis with Walking Dead! Less gore than television? The Cannibals of Terminus arc was infinitely more visually horrifying than this. I didn't have to look away once. The laughter in the theater tonight didn't come at the right parts either. No one would be cracking jokes in these characters situations.Say what you will about Hostel - it reinvented the genre a bit for American audiences, and caused the creation of the idiotic expression ""torture porn"" to roll off everyone's lips in an excuse to explain breaking new ground.I've never heard of a completed film of this nature delayed for so long without explanation. I think the original vision is shut down, I think major moments were cut, and knowing the blueprint of Cannibal Holocaust, the ending is particularly infuriating because anyone with a film background knew where the ending was headed - yet in a series of strange edits that reek of ""post post production tag ons"", we seem setup for a damn sequel. Jammed into the middle of the credits, seriously? Half the audience was gone. That's the most disgusting torture of the night.",The Green Inferno

Not really, but still fun to watch.So, college kids travels to the Peru jungle to expose a corporation trying to force away natives from their land. They end up crashing with their plane and captured by cannibals.The movie starts off slow but has an acceptable back story so it's okay. When the gore finally starts we get some nasty stuff, but it could have definitely been more. I would have particularly liked to see some more tributes to the kind of gore portrayed in Cannibal Holocaust. And honestly, even though it's always fun seeing people getting slaughtered no matter what sex they are, I would have liked to see some more graphic butchering of females. I'm not a misogynist (and not a feminist either), but come on, this is what we all want to see when we watch a movie like this one.The make up could have honestly been better. I think they over did it. The actors playing cannibals looks very much just like that - actors playing cannibals. Deodato and Lenzi managed to do much better with much less. Some of the scenes were difficult to make sense of, like the scene where the kids are fed by the cannibals. But I won't go into detail of this since that would be a spoiler. There was some cynical social commentary which I personally liked, which also was present in the films this one payed homage to.All in all, far from Roth's best and really over-hyped. But still an entertaining movie with some nice gore scenes. Know what to expect and you won't be that disappointed.",The Green Inferno
207,afishcalledsid,Entertaining and horrific yet believable,10,6 February 2016,"I am at a loss to explain the bad/mediocre reviews. This film has atmosphere, a believable plot and superb performances from the cast, particularly Lorenza Izzo. I will be recommending it to many friends. There is even an embedded moral dilemma for one of the leads that plays out in an intriguing manner. The contrast between New York City and the Peruvian rain forest is palpable and striking. The descent into fear, panic, despair, desperation, hopelessness is conveyed brilliantly. Vital and all too human questions are addressed, such as when a fate is worse than death, when the value of a ""cause"" is greater than personal survival or that of people who trust you, what constitutes redemption, what constitutes a morally bankrupt society as opposed to a morally divergent one. This film is, actually, SUPERB in many regards.",The Green Inferno

It later turns out the leader of these naive misfits has other motives for dragging his group out in the middle of the Peruvian jungle.Second, the plane ride home crashes unexpectedly, and the survivors are greeted by cannibalistic, indigenous natives painted blood red. The village of the natives has half eaten human bodies strewn all over the place. Also, there are human heads on spikes that would make Jeffrey Dahlmer blush if he were still alive. Still, nothing inherently scary about this. One of the survivors gets eaten immediately. Third, I'm not sure why the some of the females were given a body cavity search by the village leader and hostess who resembled Marylyn Mansion in aboriginal garb?

218,viva_la_dube,Poor execution on a good concept,4,8 September 2019,"I streamed this movie on HBO because I was bored. I had no clue it was an Eli Roth film until I can came here to IMDB. This may be his most disappointing film to me. I never once felt an ounce of fear or dred. The concept seemed legit but was poorly executed.Roth's movies aren't known for thier great character development but this one was extra bad. I never really felt any attachment to any of the captives so i could care less when they were quickly slaughtered. The first 15 minutes of the film focus on the lead actress and extras that dont continue on through the movie, had they had her friend go to I would have at least been a little more invested in one character.The film had somewhat of an identity crisis, at first it seemed serious until the part where they shoved 5 grams of marijuana down a dead girls throat to ""scooby doo"" 100 tribe members when they cooked her. I thought ""no way is this actually supposed to work in this movie"" and then it did! I could understand this part if i was watching one of the ""scary movie"" films, but in a movie focused on realism I just couldn't handle it. A tiny bag of pot on the fire isn't going to take out a tribe of 100+ people to the point where they are falling out of trees. The ""munchie"" bit was funny but didn't fit well with the movie either.
The Green Inferno kept me entertained enough that I could sit through it. The gore looked nice and I didn't feel like the death scenes looked cheaply done. I would have liked a little more build up to the deaths though. If Roth was okay with the Scooby bit he could have easily done the cliche boil a person alive in a pot scene. Watching someone slowly cook to death in a pot or getting roasted alive on a split would have been better than the majority of the death scenes.",The Green Inferno

I felt compelled to write about this film because I am a huge fan and supporter of the horror genre (yes the 2 are different) I saw huge potential for Eli Roth when I first saw cabin fever, it was intense and scary and gross and then that dim wit deputy comic relief character came along. Its as though Eli is afraid to make a straight up balls out horror film without adding some sort of levity.Same thing goes with Green inferno. It has genuinely frightening moments and some well written and expertly directed scenes but all in all the director seems convinced that the audience needs to know that he is a dude and he's cool and we should all laugh at his jokes. This film had ALL the potential in the world to be a brake out horror sensation and scare the hell out of audiences but at the directors insistence we get misplaced fart jokes, an out of place masturbation scene and a juvenile teenage pot gag.I will continue to watch things with Eli Roth's name attached to it but not forever.

221,jmwbate,"If you've not gotten on board with Eli Roth films yet, you most certainly won't after seeing this one.",5,15 October 2017,"From briefly scanning the internet, it appears that Eli Roth has more haters then fans nowadays. Although I remember when his debut Cabin Fever came out and myself and many others adored it. When Hostel came out it wasn't quite the fanfare as Cabin Fever, but I've grown to quite like it over the years. I think he doesn't take himself too seriously, he loves trolling his audience and he's a horror fans filmmaker, or at least he was.The hate for him has evolved into quite something over the years. I can see why, he seems like a self aggrandising narcissist at times. He's also not done anything of worth since Hostel (and a lot of people wouldn't even consider Hostel something of worth).I've still been a defender of Eli Roth, and I also believe his best work is coming. However, It pains me to say this, but I did not like The Green Inferno.In The Green Inferno, Eli Roth tries to recreate the brutality and excess of films like Cannibal Holocaust and Cannibal Ferox while also trying to skewer Social Justice Warriors. What he actually does, is make his messiest and most amateurish film. The film's message and premise are badly realised and the filmmaking often has the cheap feel of those horrors that reside only in the depths of Netflix.If you want bloodletting this will not disappoint. In fact, the excessive brutality and taboo pushing violence is where the film works. These sequences don't do much to save the film though.Maybe my expectations were too high, but I think the 'haters' were right about this one.",The Green Inferno

It is horrifying and unsettling in all senses, from start to finish. Much like The Human Centipede, you are left in a state of disgust for long after (not something I particularly enjoyed). However, good film making has to be credited, which is the reasoning for my 6 rating. If it's your sort of thing, then you'll enjoy it. The trivia on the film is fascinating, so I would recommend reading it. I've never seen any of Roth's previous movies, so this was a real shock.

She played the naive but curious girl to the point!A privileged girl, Justine is a daughter of a UN ambassador, who wants to make a difference. Joining Alejandro's cause to save the rain forest and the tribes, off they went to the Amazon for live telecast of their fight. Upon leaving, the plane crashed, half dies and half stranded and became special ""guests"" to the endangered tribe.True to form like all ""non-profit organizations"", Alejandro explains that they halted the destruction by mere 2-3 days and the plane might have been sabotaged. Well played on that part. I believe this is a sting to all organizations trying to make a difference in the world. Or so they say. Nevertheless, Alejandro makes his character more evil, compared to the cannibalistic tribe.The effects were fantastic! The throat-slashing, the appendage-chopping, the flesh-skinning! You'd actually think that it's true and a tribe with the same rituals currently exists. And I wouldn't be surprised if there is.Trying to save herself, Justine tried to befriend a young boy and gave him a necklace with a mini recorder pendant, who later helped her escape. In the end, after Justine survived everything, leaving the antagonistic Alejandro behind to be devoured by the tribe, she explains to his father the other UN representatives that she was saved by the tribe and was greeted with hospitality; they only became hostile when militia men invaded with guns and construction machines.

236,paulpaz,"""The Green Inferno"" – Even Worse Than We Anticipated",1,25 September 2015,"This is a review from the human rights and environmental NGO, Amazon Watch:Publicity for ""The Green Inferno,"" the latest film by ""torture porn"" film director Eli Roth, left our team at Amazon Watch in disbelief that anyone thought making a film based around the retrograde stereotype of the savage cannibal indigenous tribe was an acceptable idea in 2015. The premise was so racist that within Amazon Watch, we debated whether to denounce, deride, or simply ignore the film.Eli Roth helped make the decision for us. In an exchange on Instagram with an incensed activist, he defended the film in part by claiming that ""Amazon Watch saw the film and loved it!"" Extraordinarily, his response was effective in momentarily defusing outrage about the film.In fact, Roth was either lying or simply misinformed – at that point we had definitely not seen the film. We were, however, able to put together an exhaustive plot summary based on reviews, YouTube clips, and conversations with people who had seen advanced screenings. In the end, this summary did accurately represent most of the elements of the film. Based on that analysis, our esteem of ""The Green Inferno"" was indeed that it was offensive and racist.In addition to issuing our own initial statement against the film, we supported statements made by indigenous activists both in Peru and here in North America.Still, doubts persisted about the veracity of our critique given we hadn't seen the film. So last night we went and sat through it. And now, on the occasion of its national release, we can definitively say ""The Green Inferno"" is indeed racist, just plain absurd, and frankly not particularly scary.What are our key take-aways from ""The Green Inferno""?The inherent racism of an Amazonian cannibal movie is on full display. A false stereotype of the animalistic and brutal indigenous savage is a central conceit of the film. Other than the fake name of the tribe, no indigenous person has a name, nor says anything intelligible, nor is otherwise humanized – the one exception being the young girl who miraculously transcends her people's mob mentality and liberates Justine. The experience of the white people, who have names and motivations – as shallow as they might be – is entirely central to the plot. The degree to which the film evokes any emotional response, it's supposed to be some kind of horror at harm befalling the gringos. In dialogue between the activists, there are various references to ""what they are doing to us."" This is a classic example of othering.Roth's portrayal of activism is absurd and cartoonish. Ostensibly, the film's social subtext is a critique of ""slactivism,"" inspired by what Roth apparently observed around phenomenon like Occupy Wall Street and Kony 2012. But, as numerous reviewers have noted, ""slactivists"" wouldn't travel to Peru and carry out a direct action in the middle of the rainforest. The extreme naivete or venality of members of this group reaches caricature proportions. In all, it's not a serious social commentary, between being incoherent and hyperbolic. Unfortunately, this makes it all the more pointless, because there are cogent critiques to be made of well-meaning but clueless activists who ultimately do more harm than good, protected by their privilege from paying any consequences – like Roth himself..There are some real-life issues illustrated in the film, but to such exaggeration that any prospective value in raising awareness about the Amazon is completely lost. Yes, there are gas and other extractive projects in the Amazon menacing indigenous peoples within their own territories today. But the lethal threat is generally not armed mercenaries that will shoot indigenous natives, instead risks posed by foreign disease or adverse health effects from pollution are far more likely to have an impact. Yes, Amazonian indigenous peoples tend to resist unwanted incursions into their territories, but they don't systematically mutilate and murder the invaders. In the overwhelming preponderance of cases, indigenous peoples defend themselves through nonviolent and often sophisticated means using lawsuits, protests, and their own media campaigns.A little over a month ago, Roth claimed that he ""made ""The Green Inferno"" to spark discussion and bring awareness to the devastation these tribes face at the hands of corporations."" The belated expression of attempted social relevance smacks of opportunism, especially coming on the heels of several strong criticisms from indigenous peoples themselves. Beyond the collaboration with Mongabay, the practical utility of which remains to be seen, how is the film actively ""sparking discussion""? We've only seen a slick online marketing campaign, and have to assume those comments were a disingenuous tactic therein.Having now sat through the film, we continue to support the concern that ""The Green Inferno"" – assuming the publicity and film itself are widely seen – could cause far more harm than good. It contributes to a generalized public perception of Amazonian indigenous tribes as primitive and savage, in the absence of countervailing information within the collective consciousness. In Peru, that perception would reinforce existing prejudices against indigenous peoples, potentially enabling the government's current push to carry out controlled contact with isolated tribes such as the Mashco Piro. This new policy is extremely controversial and has been strongly condemned by indigenous people's organizations as a dangerous precedent. ""The Green Inferno"" didn't create that problem, but could potentially exacerbate it.One saving grace might be that the inescapably ridiculous nature of the film ultimately condemns it to a marginal audience, as buzz generated by the publicity campaign is rapidly eclipsed by negative word-of-mouth from viewers.Our prediction? ""The Green Inferno"" will bomb at the box office and the rumored sequel, ""Beyond The Green Inferno,"" will be shelved indefinitely.",The Green Inferno

241,SoTotallyDude,The Green Inferno stinks.,4,5 October 2015,"Eli Roth is at it again with all the blood, gore, and cheesy horror tropes you've come to expect, but this time with an anti-activist message wrapped up within.Right out of the gate let me answer the question; no this is not a good movie. The acting will have you laughing the entire film, and I mean laughing at the characters not with them. The film looks like it was shot with an HD video camera from Best Buy, and the script is unabashedly flimsy. But with all of these negatives they somehow coalesce into a film that's great fun if you walk in with an open mind. Eli Roth's passion for this film shines through so much that I can't help but think every detail, bad acting and all, was all designed that way. And when approaching this film with that mindset and watching it with friends, you're guaranteed an enjoyable experience. It's certainly not a letdown when it comes to the gore effects; this movie has numerous killing scenes that are extremely brutal. You'll be cringing at some scenes and then awkwardly laughing the next. The main story-line raises questions about activism and critiques the motivations behind those who tear down jungles and those who tie themselves to trees. It seems smart at first but a little on the nose in my opinion.So overall I wouldn't recommend The Green Inferno to the average movie-goer but for those die hard Eli Roth and horror fans, you'll certainly find something to love.",The Green Inferno
242,HermitBat,So I enjoyed this movie. Yet I am confused on why a lot of people were disappointed...?,7,17 November 2016,"Eli Roth's Green Inferno was honestly everything I would hoped it would be. There was a ton of gore that made me cringe and satisfied for my horror needs. Also it was amusing that Eli Roth used a lot of over dramatic music, which adds to his whole ""joke"" directed towards Social Justice Warriors. The entire message of this film was to expose to people on how a lot of activists unfortunately get themselves into issues that end up being too extreme/dangerous for them to handle. In this case, the activists in the film end up crash landing into the forest they put efforts forth to protect only to be kidnapped and eaten by cannibals. Despite that there isn't a whole lot of ""deep meaning"" in this movie, I will say that it is definitely self aware when it comes to social commentary and how a lot of the characters lack ""common sense"". Personally, I found this very amusing. Plus I wouldn't say that this film is solely just a horror film, but as a whole a horror comedy without needing to ""stress"" the comedic value. Definitely would not recommend this film to any squeamish folks, but if you are all for the gore and the semi offensive aspects then dive on in!Also as a last note; really not sure why people were disappointed in this film. Granted, not everyone is going to like a film. But as for the massive amount of negative feedback, I am kind of left scratching my head as to why that is. Cause I am sure this movie is a hell of a lot better than trash like Unfriended.",The Green Inferno
243,vickydanville,Loved it,7,19 October 2015,"Im a bit disappointed reading some of the other reviews and glad i didn't read them before booking this film. Personally i really liked it, I'm sick of horrors just showing young people having sex at parties and then getting killed,this had something different to offer and perhaps even possible or believable even in some ways. I thought the acting was neither good or bad but fair and in line with the film some of the scenes had me chewing my fingers which is rare these days. I did like the characters and thought they rang true to what was happening to them. Well done ELi a good horror film which kept me thinking and i especially loved the end thanks and keep up the good work. I would recommend this film to others.",The Green Inferno
244,maxsloan-37584,When your excited to see a hardcore cannibal movie...,3,25 June 2016,"...but would rather eat someone than watch this garbage. I don't hate Eli Roth but prefer him as an actor rather than a director (personally I only like Cabin Fever.) The Green Inferno is a failed attempt at re-capturing the camp and cheese of 60's 70's and 80's cannibal films. What it doesn't understand is that those films were and are so effective due to the extreme amounts of gore and campy acting. It's fun to see people get killed and eaten in cool ways. The acting in this is terrible and in no way redeeming. These characters are some of the most annoying, idiotic retards I've ever seen put to screen. At one point everyone is held in a huge cage, this guy just starts jerking off for no reason. Another character walks overs and starts choking him, and the guy just KEEPS SPANKING IT!!! I'ts shocking how dumb this script is. The gore is nothing special or freaky. The first kill is probably the best, and it almost got me excited, like, wow this might be a pretty gory, sick movie. No, no, not at all. In the end it may have been a good concept on paper but final product was a hardcore wannabe cannibal film. Just watch Cannibal Ferox instead.",The Green Inferno
245,sniggendeswiffer,Bad and over violent - even by Eli Roth standard,2,2 April 2019,"This movie is a mess.The natives play their roles brilliantly, but alot is off.First off, the extremely gory death of Jonah, is so much over the top, that it doesnt do anything except show a gory death of a character, that you dont even care that much for in the first place.
The hidding ""cannabis"" in a corpse concept is just plain Silly, and in the end you just sit there with a bland ""What ever"" feeling.Go see Cannibal Holocaust instead.",The Green Inferno
246,martinwyer,My second favorite Cannibal Movie,7,10 July 2017,"Not every movie has to be a cinematic masterpiece to be enjoyable. I'd been looking forward to watching this one since it's release. I'd missed it's theatrical run due to family commitments and had largely forgotten about it until it was added to Netflix a couple of days ago.It's hard not to enjoy it in my opinion. Yes, the acting is crap but who watches Horror movies of this particular type studying the acting? At it's very core this is an old fashioned adventure movie, the plot is basic but effective. The pace of the film works really well and I did find it to be quite tense and thrilling hoping that at least one character would escape.The movie also delivers on the gore front, the color is absolutely glorious. Vibrant greens contrast with the blood red of the tribe to create a sickening feeling.A final point before I wrap up, I see a lot of comments about the message behind the movie. Slacktivism etc, don't get bogged down in all that. We don't need a profound reason to find a bunch of 20 somethings stranded in the jungle and captured by cannibals, just accept it and strap yourself in!! In the grand scheme of things I think I enjoyed this more than the likes of Cannibal Ferox, Jungle Holocaust etc. Not as good as Cannibal Holocaust though.",The Green Inferno

250,evilstalkerhorne1,Very scary and VERY UNDER RATED! GREAT MOVIE!!,10,6 November 2015,"You get it all! There is little left un-seen in this movie. You get your token nudity, all the chicks are hot and so much gore and violence in general it will make you glad you were not there. I personally hate most activist groups and the like so watching them get potentially slaughtered and such was just an extra plus! The characters are believable and the acting is well done! The script is solid as well as the story line. This is in my opinion one of the best horror films to date and after watching it a few times now I honestly can say WELL DONE TO ALL! I cannot believe it gets such a low IMDb rating! What goes the extra mile here is that in so many other films done in this style (Cannibal Holocaust) with the same basic plot leave out details and backstory. This does not do so, you see every characters motives and thought processing, values and such. There is no thinking ""Hey they would not have done that"" or ""What the fxck are they doing?"" Nope, this is all done without overfeeding the audience such as the US version of Let the Right One In (which I would watch 10 times before watching the US Let Me In again.... which sucked in my opinion). It is a fine line of over doing things and subtly letting the audience know what is going on. This is done VERY well in The Green Inferno of not assuming we all are stupid and need a line scripted to let us know the non-verbals where we should have caught on such as the US version of The Girl with the Red Dragon Tattoo's line ""I hope you like anal sex."" The french version implied it very well and no actual verbal cue was needed. I could go on about Let Me In doing the same thing but will not since one could go on quite literally all night about such since there were SOOO many of them in that flick particularly. It is insulting and actually makes me angry that directors do this assuming people need such literal cues to catch on to things that they should just understand. So, with this film it was very refreshing that they let you infer such things as lesbians and that certain characters met an ill demise with no line like ""Oh they ate _____"" no we all are not stupid and can pay some attention to cues you film without the need of spoon-feeding. The ending left me a bit puzzled as to what was said in the interview of the main character. I suppose the sequel may explain since if you watch the credits there is a set up extra scene there. So again, this movie was well done and very well filmed/edited. This is what really puts it apart along with actors and actresses that can all sort of act well. Great job to the special effects people and overall although a stressful thing to produce in a taboo subject matter that will make most not like it etc. this is a gem! If you like gore and slasher films and are a classic horror movie type of watcher this is for you! It is much better than the crappy re-makes everyone is pumping out nowadays such as Evildead and Halloween - both of these re-makes I would have paid not to have seen but out of some misplaced curiosity from the great originals I watched anyway in dismal disgust. It is NOT just a Cannibal Holocaust re-make! We have something much much more useful here people! I doubt it will ever get the credit it deserves as a film in this genre due to it's subject matter. That being said though, it is a VERY under rated film with everything in place put into a believable situation with believable characters in a believable story line in great HD filming with believable special effects and it is edited great also which really does set it apart since most films of this subject or similar types lack in many of these departments. It also does a great job of driving home the abuse of female mutilations that third world countries actually do (those of us who are slightly studious and know a little of the world other than our own backyard will note these things are not made up) but again, due to the subject matter it is easy for most to look away in disgust and dismiss things rather than face them head on in the light of day so I doubt it will be credited for that either. Great job on so many fronts of un-pleasantness and taboo subject matter! Well done I can not say this enough! Scary, gross and very real feeling!",The Green Inferno

Anyway, I started watching but I fell asleep within the first 5 minutes. Later I was awoken because of screaming on the TV. I looked at the screen,and there was the fat guy being chopped up into pieces. It was the most disgusting thing I have ever seen in a movie, and to wake up to that... well I have no words to express the feeling. I really wish I hadn't fallen asleep because I'm sure there were scenes before that one that would have made me shut it off before that point. I am deeply disturbed. I LOVE scary movies, shark movies, etc.... the kind that put your heart in your stomach with nervous anticipation. I'm not a fan of gore just for the sake of gore. This is a piece of garbage that is basically just a movie trying to be as disgusting as it possibly can and nothing else. I have no respect for that at all. I'm pissed at Netflix for not only not putting in a proper description, but on top of that they should put in major warnings. All I can think is a teenager (or God forbid younger) watching this on the sly (or having  patents who let their kids watch anything). I'm am adult and I feel scarred.

257,stigdu99-52-293555,Decent hark back to the 80s cannibal gut-munchers,6,18 October 2015,"I wouldn't say I'm a huge fan of Eli Roth, but I'm not one of his detractors either. Cabin Fever didn't do too much for me, and after reading the previews of it and how Roth was the new name to watch in horror, I came away a little disappointed.To this end, I wasn't expecting much of his next feature, Hostel, but was blown away by it. Tense, graphic, shocking, well-acted and with a group of guys you actually grew to care about and root for when the going got pretty extreme. After Hostel, I definitely considered Roth a name to watch.Then came Hostel 2, and it felt more like a re-tread of Hostel (with a few additional behind-the-scenes embellishments of why and how the crazy Eastern Europeans were doing what they were doing) with young women as the protagonists rather than young men. It felt a little more mean-spirited, and a little more 'shock for shock's sake' than the original.*POTENTIAL SPOILERS AHEAD* The Green Inferno is Roth making his 'love letter' to Ruggero Deodato, director of the infamous 'video nasty' Cannibal Holocaust. While he's modernised it by having the protesters film everything on their mobile phones, everything else seems pretty faithful to CH and follows in its footsteps whilst treading its own splattery path.I disagree with some of the reviewers on here who have said that the comedy took away from the tension, and that it is poorly, or rather, cheaply, made. There wasn't actually all that much comedy in the film, and we're not talking 'slapping the thigh' or rib-tickling guffaws either, merely a small handful of moments of dry humour to alleviate the tension.*SPOILERS AHEAD* For 5 million dollars, it looks pretty good to my eyes, bar the slightly ropey-looking plane crash. The lush greens of the jungle, the red and yellow painted skin of the tribe, and the red blood which flows freely all looked great, and really pop out of the screen.The gorehounds among you won't be disappointed either, with Nicotero and Berger's doing some excellent FX work.One character meets a particularly graphic and grisly death. I would have felt quite sick, were it not for the ridiculousness of it all in this scene, in that he survives having both his eyes gouged out, his tongue cut out, and all 4 limbs hacked off (I think the decapitation finally did him in, though).*END OF SPOILERS* My wife watched it with me, and she hates horror films. Even she thought it was pretty good and was glued to the screen throughout.If you don't like Roth, then I don't think this film is going to make you change your opinion of him. But if you give him a chance, I think you'll come out of this one pleasantly surprised.",The Green Inferno
258,ccdn73,"Very disappointing, considering the potential that the theme has",4,14 January 2016,"When I heard that Eli Roth was going to tackle the cannibal genre, I was quite excited. I really enjoyed the classic cannibal movies from Italy, especially ""Cannibal Holocaust"" (with slightly forced alibi social commentary messages). Unfortunately Roth wasn't interested in making any ""mean"" movie at all, but instead he came up with a completely boring and tame mix of teen slasher/""cannibal""-movie. The slapstick/comedy elements eliminate any attempt of creating a menacingly setting, which IMHO is the most important part about this kind of movie. As for gore - unfortunately this is extremely disappointing as well. The absolute highlight of the movie happens pretty much right after the confrontation with the cannibals, after that it turns into a bore-fest with embarrassingly bad attempts at humour (""jacking off"" scene...). I prefer to cringe from mean deaths / gore than from pathetic and sad story writing. The ""torture porn"" ""genre"" has been criticized heavily by many, but personally I think that that's what Roth's fans really want. Unfortunately he does not seem to be able to create a truly menacing, mean horror movie. Instead you get an immature film maker who is able to make you lose interest in any violence on screen thanks to his irrelevant sense of humour.",The Green Inferno

260,DarkManX2,A Little Too Tame,5,11 February 2016,"The Green Inferno is a cannibal film for a new generation inspired by the cannibal films of old. In the movie a group of protesting college students go to Peru to stop the destruction of a forest which would result in the killing of a local native tribe. Their attempts succeed but as they make their way back home their plan crashes in the forest and they are captured by the same tribe they were trying to save. They are locked in a bamboo cage and cannibalized. This is a nice simple premise for a cannibal film but it simply does not measure up to those that Eli Roth is paying homage to.First off the set up to the plane crash takes forty five minutes. This would have been okay if the movie was two hours or more, but it's only an hour thirty and the set up takes so long it leaves little time for the films main story. The pilots and half the students die in the initial crash. On the ground one dies from pure horror movie stupidity by walking into a propeller and another is killed with spears by the approaching cannibals leaving only seven left. The rest are hit with knockout darts and locked in a bamboo cage.After the crash instead of being chased and caught by the cannibals in a tense scene the students are easily overtaken and locked up. They spend the rest of the film in the cage trying to escape which actually turns out to be so easy a feat I have to question the intelligence of the tribe whose diet depends on the successful capture and imprisonment of other human beings. There's one big graphic scene, really. After they get captured the tribe takes one of the survivors, removes his eyes and tongue, cuts off his limbs, and then cooks and eats him. Another scene has one of the men getting eaten alive while trying to escape, but it isn't nearly as graphic as the aforementioned scene. These are the only two scenes of people being eaten in a cannibal movie, or at least ones that we get to witness.The movie tries to have humor though it's mostly crude humor that a high school student would find funny. This includes one of the women getting explosive diarrhea in the cage where we hear very over the top noises but are thankfully spared the image. At another moment the main male lead begins masturbating as a way to clear his head. I found these humorous attempts very crude and juvenile and they did not make me laugh.The films ending is completely nonsensical and very confusing. It ranges from an almost illogical dream sequence to the only survivor making a bafflingly bizarre decision that left me scratching my head. There is also a mid-credits sequence which hints at a possible sequel which wouldn't shock me considering how many sequels these kinds of movies tend to spawn.The acting isn't that bad for a horror movie of this type though the characters are all horror movie clichés and it's impossible to care about any of them except the main female lead. Too much of the first forty five minutes is spent on development which is completely pointless due to this. Ariel Levy especially, the main survivor antagonist, does a great job being detestable although it is hard to believe, even in a film like this, someone could be that soulless and careless in such a dire situation.Despite its flaws the movie does have redeeming qualities. The practical effects are fantastic and the natives, especially the main headhunter, look truly terrifying and inhuman complete with dark red skin and bones in their faces. The music is nice and creepy and the cannibal's village, decorated with skeletons and human heads, looks great. There is a very tense moment where the main female lead almost has her female parts mutilated and another great scene where we discover what happened to one woman who managed to escape. The two graphic scenes are very well done and very real looking.I found the movie entertaining enough, it was good for what it was, but it seems to me that inside this movie there was a better one trying to get out. I felt like Eli Roth held back on the gore and violence instead of going all out and giving us a balls to wall cannibal movie. Anyone not acquainted to this kind of horror will definitely be sickened by it but those who have seen enough gory movies will probably find it to be a little too tame.",The Green Inferno

There is a lot of talking but none of the characters really shine. If the idea is to make the audience care about this group of people, it doesn't really work. Although there is some interesting conflict within the group, it never is fully developed. The second half of the movie with the tribe is a watered down cannibal movie that has only one real harrowing scene. Roth likes this long set up as he did in the Hostel movies but the second half of this movie fails to really shock like the Hostel films did. There are some themes that are covered in this movie in a rather haphazard way such as FGM, which is an important issues that could have been dealt with better. It is a shame this doesn't work as Lorenza Izzo is rather good as the leading character and is the stand out performer here.

272,immortaltech1,Extreme cinema gets a wide release?,7,25 September 2015,"Being that this is an Eli Roth, I'm inclined to skip past explaining the plot or analyzing any subtext because, in truth, it's all irrelevant in a film like this. What we all want to know is how gory, how shocking, and how disturbing this film is and if it lives up to the reputation of Cannibal Holocaust it's so heavily inspired by, right? Well for one, this is an incredibly brutal, gory and borderline traumatic film-going experience. I had the pleasure of attending the midnight showing (to a surprisingly packed theater no less) and counted 6 people who walked out after the first death scene after the group is captured. This scene which depicts a man getting his eyes gouged out, tongue cut off, and hacked into pieces limb by limb before being decapitated and eaten is by far the most brutal, goriest, and graphic scene in the entire movie as absolutely EVERYTHING is shown on- screen in full view with nothing left to the imagination. Thankfully (for casual moviegoers at least) the rest of the film and death scenes are noticeably toned down, but still pretty nasty nonetheless. As a fan of extreme cinema, I admit this isn't as shocking as films like CH, A Serbian Film, Salo, Antichrist, Men Behind the Sun, Philosophy of a Knife, August Underground, Melancholie Der Engel, Martyrs and other similar extreme films. Having said that though, this is still one of the most brutal and nasty ""mainstream"" horror movies to date, and when I say ""mainstream"" I mean horror films that have gotten a wide release.Now, a few gripes I have with the film is the poor dialogue, pacing, and ending. The character development is actually pretty decent, a definite step up from Roth's earlier films, but the poor dialogue, particularly in the beginning, sort of counteracts the improvements Roth made as a filmmaker. The film starts a little slow, but picks nicely once the group is captured and the first character dies. However, for whatever reason, Roth sprinkles in a few short scenes of comedy which hinder the relentless brutality and tension that was established. I won't discuss the ending much, but let's just say that it was really f***ing stupid.If you're a fan of Eli Roth then you'll almost certainly like this movie, and if you're not a fan of his, there's nothing here that will alter your opinion. Compared to the more obscure extreme films this isn't quite on the level of say A Serbian Film, Men Behind the Sun, August Underground and the like, but for the casual moviegoer this is definitely one of the most shocking and gory horror films that has gotten a wide release.

Before watching it I had watched Roth's new feature, ""Knock Knock"", which is even crappier (as it is equally stupid but even more embarrassing and way less graphic), but I had decided give Green Inferno a try since I like the Hostel franchise and I respected Roth's work as a horror filmmaker, and because the previews seem promising... but I shouldn't have.It is disguised as a tribute to cannibal films but it is too not charming.

Okay the setup for the ecological freaks is way too long. Then the gore which, hey I love is blah.

275,julcaesar2000,A Nerveless Tribute to Italian Horror Nasties,3,26 September 2015,"Eli Roth's ""The Green Inferno"" is a movie so ineptly made - so poorly executed - that it's almost not worth writing about but for the fact that you might be tempted to actually watch it yourself. You should know what you're in for. Director Eli Roth has a clear penchant for gore and exploitation. His movie ""Hostel"" helped launch a new wave of torture porn flicks in the United States. Now comes ""The Green Inferno"" which is a kind of riff on the old Italian splatter movies of the 1970s and 80s. The movie follows a group of student activists into the Peruvian jungle as they attempt to stop corporate developers from destroying the wilderness and its inhabitants. When their plane crash lands in the middle of the forest, they are captured and put up on the menu of a tribe of cannibals.It's a gore fest. Nothing wrong with that. I can appreciate a splatter film. Those old Italian horror movies, in particular Ruggero Deodato's ""Cannibal Holocaust"", were infamous (and still are) for their extreme violent content and gore and scenes of graphic nudity and misogynist sexual violence. They were midnight movie dream material, and they were extremely effective at making audiences queasy and uncomfortable. Sleaze is the point.But, this new movie is something else, and I am surprised it has even seen the light of day, with a theatrical release no less. Evidently, this movie sat on the shelf in post-production limbo for about two years before finally getting distributed by Blumhouse Productions. ""The Green Inferno"" screams straight-to-VOD release. The first thing you will notice is the acting. To describe the work on display here as amateur is being kind. Think of the caliber of acting you might encounter in porn and you get a pretty good idea of what it's like in ""The Green Inferno."" To be fair to the actors, the scenes and lines they are given to work with are so poorly written that no one could have made this material work. Consider the following gems of dialogue:As the students board the plane that will inevitably crash, one character remarks, ""Eh, I hate small planes I always get this feeling that they're going to crash.""After the tribe of cannibals dismembers one of their friends - gouging out his eyeballs and chopping off every limb of his body - and locks the rest of the students in a bamboo cage for future tortures, one character actually says, ""We have to get out of here."" Yeah. But, the acting isn't the only problem here. The second thing you will notice is an uneven and rather jarring mixed tone of humor and horror. Consider the following:At one point, one of the girls, while locked up with her friends, realizes with alarm that she needs to defecate. With much commotion, she goes to the corner of the cage and violently releases herself.After one character is brutally killed by the cannibals, one of the students starts masturbating in the cage in front of all his friends. ""What the hell are you doing,"" someone asks him. ""Relieving stress,"" he responds. In fact, we don't care about these characters enough to care what happens to them. It is impossible to believe that real people would act this way or say these things in these circumstances. So, what is it that we feel when these characters start getting chopped up? Revulsion? Admiration for the technical effects?Admittedly, Roth is known for infusing his horror with moments of absurd humor, and it's possible that this is all intentional folly. The movie, perhaps, is intended as nothing more than a repository of absurd potty humor and pot and masturbation jokes. Certainly it is not intended to be taken seriously. But, Roth is a director who loves and is inspired by exploitation horror. If he wanted to pay tribute to those old video nasties by making his own, he should have had the nerve to go all the way. The humor in ""The Green Inferno"" doesn't feel deliberate. It feels like the cop-out of a director who lacks the skill to muster even a shred of dramatic tension or the pang of terror at the prospect of being eaten alive. On a final note, I want to bring attention to a peculiar obsession of this movie - female genital mutilation. One character is faced with the prospect of undergoing this horrific procedure at the hands of the cannibals. In what I can only assume is a ridiculous show of feminist solidarity, the movie features a female tribe leader and, earlier, a set of male genitals in danger of being bitten by a spider (equal opportunity endangerment?), lest the movie be accused of the type of misogyny its Italian predecessors were guilty of. As if that weren't the least of its worries.",The Green Inferno
276,drysdale-68153,"Just about watchable, mindless brutality (*Minor Spoilers*)",6,11 May 2015,"I had the opportunity to see 'The Green Inferno' last year at London's FrightFest film festival. I am a big Eli Roth fan (as a director and an actor) and had heard of the buzz surrounding this film for at least a year prior to seeing it myself.In brief, a group of college students venture to South America as part of an anti- deforestation activist group. Their plane crashes and the survivors are taken captive by a cannibal tribe, the same tribe the sought to protect through their mission to protest.The film will win no awards for a captivating plot or storyline, nor were the performances award worthy. However, 'The Green Inferno' packs a punch when it comes to shocking and brutal scenes of gore. In one particular scene, one of the survivors is extremely graphically and literally hacked apart by the tribe, we see in gory detail each of his limbs hacked off whilst he is still alive. One of the most horrific and graphic scenes I have ever seen in film.There are one or two political messages put out by this film to do with deforestation but all in all this film is really designed to shock, which it certainly does. A couple of character's fates are left open to interpretation.An intense and watchable 90 mins or so, if only for shock value. Just about worth the wait. 6/10",The Green Inferno

There is as much stamina in this picture as there is passion. It captures you into its heavily spirited sentiment and never lets go.

The man has done his homework and if you are a fan of the cannibal subgenre and you have seen and enjoyed films like Cannibal Holocaust, Cannibal Ferox and Mountain of the Cannibal God, there is no reason why you shouldn't enjoy The Green Inferno. I've seen many cannibal films after discovering the Video Nasties list as a teenager and for a new cannibal film, I don't think it could have been done any better. My hat is off to Eli Roth, and the cast and crew of this film. The only thing that literally blows my mind is how this movie got an 'R' rating and not an 'NC-17' or an 'X'. The violent sequence in this film is one of the most brutal and hard to watch scenes I've ever seen in a theater.

Here, we get Roth staging privileged Columbia kids against vague, movie-ish South American geopolitics, with them first relying on their first-world- ed-ness to intervene in deforestation and then finding that first- world-ed-ness no big thing when they run into a tribe of cannibals. As a work in the genre, Inferno's subject to some imperialist charges in terms of depiction, but his fantasy isn't one of imperialism but instead one in which imperialists are punished. And punished they are here! People are drawn and quartered, darted, shot with arrows, plane-crashed, etc. This thing has a 50% on RT right now and a 5.0 on here which is pretty much a joke.

283,bubblegumwolf-23205,Green Disappointment,3,14 July 2017,"I have to say, I was looking forward to seeing this movie when someone mentioned it on a horror forum saying how explicit it was and shocking. All in all, I was disappointed. With it having potential, I thought it would be an all out gore fest...I mean its a cannibal tribe for christs sake! But to be honest the gore wasn't well executed. Even though the first death did leave me feeling uneasy (nowhere near as uneasy as the film 'Cannibal holocaust' made me feel) because it was extremely gory and ""kind of"" well done, the rest just made me feel bored...Not only that but it came across like the gore was very cartoonish and more comedy based in some parts. I know that the film did have some comedy elements and I have nothing against that in horror but some of it was just darn right weird. I'm talking about the goddamn NOT NEEDED wanking scene by the annoying guy which I just found ridiculous. Within the situation they was all in why would he start doing that? unless he was aroused by it all or just plain psychotic...who knows? Also not forgetting to mention the diarrhea scene that one of the girls did randomly because she was feeling unwell. Even though the group had just witnessed one of their friends being dismembered, their friend having diarrhea was seeming to make them more disgusted then anything??? they seemed to show more disgust for that and the guy wanking more than they did anything else that happened in the movie? How does that make sense at all?! Even though they'd seen their friends die one by one...Okay then. Overall, the acting was terrible. I did find myself at times wanting them to escape but there was just a lack of character from all of them which just left you really not caring. I was also disappointed when the main character (notice how I don't remember any of the characters names? that's how unmemorable they are)got home and was talking about her experience and then was basically sticking up for the cannibal tribe even after everything they had done, killing all her group/friends in the most horrific way and eating them in front of her, she seemed to change her way of thought towards them. If you was personally in that situation would you be sticking up for the tribe? NO WAY. There was only one kid from the tribe who lead her to safety, hardly a reason to change your thoughts really after everything she'd been through. WEIRD. I would not like to forget to mention the AWFUL and only jump-scare at the end which was plain terrible and of poor taste. I think rating this 3 out of 10 was too good of a rating for it after me going over the film again.

287,trombitasistvan,Colorful disappointment,3,13 December 2015,"I do like the horror genre, I have also watched cannibal movies, so Green Inferno seemed like a fresh air. But just the trailer. I was amazed by the colors of the native Indians, the Amazonian forest, the life in the village, the faces, the body paintings. But for me this is all the movie could offer. Of course, it was shocking, but just for the sake of being shocking, it was ruthless because horror movies supposed to be ruthless, it did not show any mercy, yes, I admit it. But if all this don't combine with a good plot, good acting, consistency it will fail. So the outcome was a light, horror-like experiment with plenty of blood and scream. I got bored at a certain point, because the director didn't seem to be really serious about the movie. So why should I take it seriously? He is focusing so much on the fact that the movie should be shocking, horrifying, that he forgets the rest. Thus stupid scenes are plenty: the whole village gets high because of that marijuana-trick, the sick girl with her diarrhea, the masturbation scene in the cage, the guy pissing with the tarantula, the phone is ringing after days, at exactly the time when the fled whites are close, to hear it, the circumcision subject involved, oh, there are so many silly moments in the movie. There was no tension, suspense, intelligent turns. I was waiting for some sense, some good idea throughout the movie. But beside the voice of the jungle and the native Indians' bright color, I got a boring, yet another ""a group of teens gets lost and then finally finds a place where they get killed on by one"" movie. The Amazonian people could be explored so much more, not just use it as an exotic setting. The plot was watery, single lined, nothing brilliant. The captives had no plan whatsoever, they did nothing.

Fast-forward to when it dropped on Hulu, and 5 minutes in it is clearly a ""let's get people to hate it so bad it's the next Sharknado.""
Cinematically, there is no camera skill involved. It cuts from one view to another abruptly, zero panning, zero moving shots, zero payroll for a good cinematographer.
Acting is LITERAL GARBAGE. They could have done better picking up homeless folks off the street, and giving them lunch for every day they were on set; at least they could haven't written this film off as a charity at that point.
Storyline is heavily recycled, overly focused on trying to sell a cheap, poorly CGI'ed Gore scene and patent it as good horror. I chock this movie up to a once skilled director trying to sell to the millennial masses by adding an ""As if, OMG"" TO what could have been a well scripted, well acted plotline.

The acting at points is barely on par with a high school play and the plot is incredibly uneven and honestly ridiculous. The reason why I say almost is because the practical effects are top notch and it does create a tone of dread throughout. Yet this movie is a MUST WATCH. Not by yourself, but with a group of friends where you can watch them react to the gruesome deaths, and ridicule the movie as it happens to you, which is the best way to describe how this movie plays out.

I understand that this is not meant to be a dramatic, well acted thriller, but in the end I wasn't sure if this was just a satirical piece that is meant to poke fun of millennials and SJWs, or if they really thought that is what college kids are like today. I went into the Green Inferno excited because the idea is a classic and is something that could really be played with and experimental. A bunch of hippie, rich college students with no real world experience get dropped off in the middle of the Amazon with no survival instincts and are then captured by sadistic cannibals? That's something that you could really make horrifying. But unfortunately it really is never horrifying at all. I was more unsettled by 'the scene' in 13 Reasons Why than anything in this entire movie. Most of the actors where absolutely horrible. You start of with Lorenza as Justine, which was fine. Then you are introduced to Kaycee... oh my god she was unbearable. While I was watching I kept thinking, there is no way this women got paid to mumble and look completely uninterested for 20 minutes. Then I looked up the actress and only then did it make sense. Sky Ferreira. Shes not an actress. Shes a pretty good singer, but she did not belong in this movie, even if it was for only a section of the film. Watching Juni from SpyKids play as a stoner the whole movie was pretty hilarious. But everyone else was pretty sh't. It's pretty telling that the village people were the best actors, seeing as they were all were recruited from a small village and had never even seen a movie before. A couple good things: the cinematography was actually pretty good as well as the lighting. I thought the shots were great at certain times. I thought the message was pretty interesting. I'm sure there are a lot of young people that are defending causes that they have absolutely no idea what they are talking about. I liked that they probably taught a few people about FGM. Thats about it. A lot of bad things: zero complexity with the characters, the weird 'millennial lingo' scattered through out the movie (""so flip"" almost made me turn the movie off), scenes with absolutely no purpose (Juni peeing in the forest scene), the fact that they conveniently wanted to mutilate Justine's genitals... considering she 'feels so strongly' about FGM (even though she learned about it like, a day before), the fact that the entire tribe got high from the weed in Amy's body and they then proceeded to have the munchies. The gore was not even that good. When the arrow hit Kara in the head I literally laughed out loud because it was so crappy looking and the fact that Daniel looked like he was a little wounded and swollen then proceeded to gasp 'kill me' was also hilarious. The ending is confusing and stupid. They just had to throw in a jump scare at the end for.... reasons? I could go on but it would be even longer than it already has been.

302,jazzyhenry,A lack-luster effort for this seemingly forgotten horror sub-genre.,3,29 November 2015,"Obviously you know the synopsis, a group of college ""activists"" venture down to Peru to aid in preventing the destruction of the rain forest. After a deadly plane crash, wearing the construction worker's uniforms of the bulldozing enemy, the students are pegged as such by the natives and shot down with arrows, tranquilized and led back to be caged and await their gut-wrenching fate of being consumed. That said, I had a host of problems with this film but I'll start with the positives which will be brief. The tribe was awesome. A real tribe was cast in the movie by Roth which made that aspect very realistic along with the environment. I liked that it didn't throw in random gratuitous nudity as some sort of redeeming factor. It makes you take a movie more seriously without it and honestly, from Roth I entirely went in just expecting it. So props on that one.The social commentary is note-worthy on activists seemingly taking a stand on a significant issue but never really doing anything about it and/or just wanting to claim the notoriety of being a part of something. Now the negatives; The acting. Oh, the acting. You'd think with experience from both a film lover's viewpoint and from someone that is actually involved in the creation of such that horrible acting would instantly be pegged and try to be avoided at all costs. It prohibits the viewer from getting attached to characters and enjoying/""getting-into"" a movie. The performances of the tribe were the most convincing and therefore the best. So mad props to them, being first-timers and all. Why on earth would they care about genitally mutilated the main actress if it's a rite of passage from child to womanhood? Were they planning on accepting her as one of their own in the tribe? They sure didn't treat her as such. None of that is evident or made clear. Two of the most dislikable character's, Alejandro and his snarky girlfriend, fates left something to be desired for. She is killed quickly and one of the first to go and Alejandro's precise fate is unknown. We know he is more than likely going to be eaten, yes, but this is a character everyone would have been rooting to meet a particularly cruel demise. Roth had remarked on how this fake activist culture would be fun to see basically ravaged, in a video I watched on Youtube. Yet, the two people you'd want that to happen to, deservedly so, are spared. He is seemingly about a fun watch yet misses obvious opportunity to make it more-so. Which brings me to another point; you can mix seriousness and comedy, of course, but he seemed unable to do so. The parts obviously pegged to stir up a laugh were unrealistic and juvenile humor, at best. Yes, I'm talking about the marijuana stuffed in the body they cooked and then got stoned from. At least they could of made it look like a bigger amount so it would be a tad more convincing? But a tiny amount in a plastic baggy seems like hardly enough to get an entire, large tribe incomprehensibly stoned. You'd think since the creator of this was such a fan of this horror sub-genre he would have been more prompt to shock and wow his movie-goers but such is not the case here. It had hope.You're taking the viewer into a place most of them will never go. Hazardous terrain, dangerous wildlife, plants that make you hallucinate, a mysterious and vibrantly painted portrait of what could have been with this film resonates more than anything.A few cringe-worthy scenes but there is NO suspense. You sort of end up in this indifferent void while watching it. Do they live? Do they die? I don't know, I don't really care.",The Green Inferno

If you would not like to see a stupidly put together film with horrid images then don't see it. It is lower than a b movie and I can't believe a company would waste money on making it. Please if you enjoy the saw films and like to see people get cut up then go ahead and watch it it may become you new favorite movie. In short I would say that for me this is not my movie and I wouldn't recommend spending two hours of you life wasted watching this movie.",The Green Inferno
306,gustavix-costa,Love the references... hated this... and let me explain...,4,3 December 2019,"I was a really young kid back in the 80's. I was born in 81... but I live in a small country called Portugal. We lived in a dictatorship until 75 and things just tooked some time to be mainstream here. But, there was one movie when I was a little boy that scared the crap out of me when I was around 6 or 7 years old. It was a time when there were video stores. Beta and VHS were fighting for world conquer... and that cover just scared the hell out of me... it was Cannibal Holocaust. Bare with me. In this small country back then almost everything was ok after a dictatorship. I wasn't ready for that. Noone was... but... years gone by. And I turned into a adult, and I wanted to challenge my demons (we all do I think) and decided to see what the hell was that about.
. An evil, discusting, but powerfull movie. It really is... Now, going to the topic witch is The Green Inferno... Eli got it wrong... I think he was actually afraid... people say it was bad casting, or actors were just bad... If a story is no good, how can someone make it better? Bad scrip, actors trying to make it not taking things seriously. I bet that most of them weren't aware of the source material!!! Eli Roth needs to get his s**** together... just a blood filled picture with nothing behind it. Cannibal Holocaust could be great if some things would be done in other ways. But even that is almost forgotten because is a well written and directed story... with a real punchline. With a real purpose. This movie by Eli ""I was once a Quentin friend"" Roth??? Just pure garbage, waste of time and money... Eli, pay tribute the right way... this is just stupid...",The Green Inferno
307,Christina71087-415-101132,AN HONEST FILM REVIEW FOR ROTH'S BEST WORK! Moments of Brilliance!,10,26 August 2015,"Before I go into how much I love it, let me start by stating I could not stand the first 30 minutes, mainly because out main character Justine (Lorenza Izzo) has an atrocious roommate Kaycee (Sky Ferreira), whose hipster, 1990's grunge, forced dialogue was one of the most horrific things in the film. HOWEVER, did Roth INTEND for this dialogue to be horrible? Let's take a look at some classic horror films, we always get the ""annoying"" friend that the viewer can't wait for to be killed off, is Kaycee that standard horror movie character?Once we learn the true intentions of the activist group, the film really picks up.In the land of superheroes, remakes, and movies that are made to appeal to the lowest common denominator, The Green Inferno was by far the most original, beautifully shot, mainstream horror film I have seen in years. The cinematography is stunning, THIS IS WHAT MAKES THE FILM! Shooting 4k and the help of the films soundtrack really brought the jungle to life on the big screen. The opening scene mimics Stanley Kubrick's The Shining with panoramic helicopter shots, however instead of following a small car along a winding road, we are weaving around The Amazon River. The colors are so brightly saturated and so beautifully contrasted you would swear you are watching Planet Earth on the big screen. Most of the film is shot during the day, so this color is present throughout the whole film and makes a horrifically violent film absolutely incredible to watch. The jungle in The Green Inferno makes the biggest film of the year, Jurassic World, environment look dated and fake.I will say I have been a fan of Roth's since Cabin Fever and I do respect his unique approach to filmmaking. I was deeply disappointed with the first Hostel (which felt like I was sitting through a 45 minute soft porno followed by 30 minutes of gore) I was thrilled that The Green Inferno has NO sex scenes (seriously) and really showcases the female lead and goes miles above Hostel's Part Two female empowerment.Keep in mind The Green Inferno was shot in 2012, before being a ""feminist"" was cool. EACH female character has an important role or ultimately chooses their own fate in the film. The Amazon tribes leader is female, she is the first to make a kill and the first to eat. We have another female character who when trapped in a cage decides to escape and run for a boat and save the rest of the survivors. This character ultimately fails, which leads to our next female who ends up taking her own life (regardless if you believe suicide is a cowards way out SHE made the decision to end her own life (something which none of the males did)). Ultimately, the film centers around Izzo's character who survives and chooses the fate of the tribe.Izzo's acting is spectacular once the activists are in the Amazon. You can really feel her fear I left the theater wondering, ""what else has this girl been in?"" There is a beautifully twisted, horrific moment near the end of the film where Izzo is tied up and painted white being a female I was cringing my seat as the tribes women were about to conduct a ritual on her. When she is eventually saved, she runs around the jungle and once again the cinematography is just stunning!Izzo is not the only good acting in this film You really feel for some of the characters, ultimately you want them to live (but come on it's a horror movie). If there is one thing Roth does well it is a psychological thrill ride, full of twists and turns of human emotion (which for me it is usually hate). I would say the main ""villain"" in the film, ironically enough is not the tribes' people, but is Justine's activist leader Alejandro, played by Ariel Levy. Just when you thought you couldn't hate this man any more, he does something so revolting you want to cringe. Roth knows exactly when to place these moments and he places them well. One great thing about The Green Inferno is it BARELY uses any CGI. Greg Nicotero and his effects company did a great job using practical effects in the film that could be shown in broad daylight and still look realistic. I commend Roth for using real effects Ultimately, it will make the film hold up better over time. The only noticeable part that was clearly CGI was a scene with some ants (when you see it you will know what I am talking about). Maybe the ants won't look as fake on a smaller television screen, but on a 70ft screen the CGI in this one scene is particularly noticeable. I feel like people hear the name Eli Roth and they expect the most bloody, violent, disgusting film of the year Is this film that gory? I didn't think so apart from one scene where a man is torn apart (literally limb from limb) and eaten, I don't think this film had any more blood than say Tarantino's Django Unchained. Before the screening took place Roth and Izzo spoke about the film to quote Roth, ""we pushed the film as far as the R rating would allow."" I simply do not see an R movie here in the terms of gore. Once again, Roth is really great at the psychological thriller and general ""f*cked up ness"" of the film. Now is this a film you want to take the family to see probably not. Please remember, I might be writing kind words, but it does center around a tribe of cannibals!",The Green Inferno
308,re4713-521-662265,This is the film that was supposed to be shocking? PFFT What a LETDOWN!,1,11 January 2016,"MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS!!!! Honestly, this movie is so bad in so many ways that I just had to write a review for it. Without giving too much away, the acting, the plot, the characters, the gore, the dialogue, heck even the nudity, everything was just plain awful! I'll give it to them the first ""gore"" scene made me cringe a bit but after that I was pretty disappointed; there was only what felt like 2 gore scenes which is pretty low for a Roth film. Unless there's an unrated version, I wouldn't watch this movie again even if you paid me. I spent $5 on the PlayStation Store and waited almost 40 minutes for it to download in HD and stayed awake until 4:30am watching a movie that almost put me to sleep. If there is an unrated version of this film, it may be better but needless to say I was expecting a lot more from this one. And if, god forbid, there is a sequel, I won't be watching it. And who calls it The Green Inferno when clearly it should be called The Red Inferno.",The Green Inferno
309,colinbeale48,"If your'e going to do this, have the courage to do it properly!!",2,19 October 2015,"I am a great lover of horror films and used to be a great fan of Eli Roth. I was especially impressed with 'Hostel' and 'Cabin Fever' as (imho) both films pushed the boundaries of horror at the time. I am also old enough to remember and be impressed with Cannibal Holocaust, this film, directed by Ruggero Deodato in 1980 was unlike anything I had seen before and certainly justified the tag line 'The Most Controversial Movie ever made. As the title suggests it chronicled the meeting between a team of documentary makers and a cannibal tribe with resulting horrific and extremely graphic consequences.So I was excited when one of my favourite directors was virtually remaking albeit up to date, the most explicit cannibal horror film ever. Boy was I disappointed!Below contains several spoilers for which I apologise in advance. However they are needed to illustrate what a pile of tripe 'The Green Inferno' actually is.The story line is similar to Cannibal Holocaust. Spoiler: It starts in New York where an environmental group are planning to visit the Amazon rain forest to confront corporation funded logging contractors who are systematically destroying the indigenous flora and fauna. Into this select group comes Justine played by Lorenza Izzo. It quickly transpires that she is not particularly interested in saving the rain forest just bedding the group leader. So far, so boring; we do not get the opportunity to begin to know, bond with or even like any of the characters let alone care what happens to them.With the back story out of the way, our intrepid group arrive in the Amazon basin, confront the loggers, win a somewhat pointless victory and fly home. At least some way home! As they are flying over one of the most impenetrable areas of jungle the plane develops a fault and crash lands.Spoiler: At this point things get incredibly silly. The cannibals appear, painted red for some reason that is never explained, and disable the remaining crash survivors with their blow pipes. All except the annoying girlfriend of the team leader who receives two arrows in her head. Mr Roth obviously thought this was punishment not only for being terminally annoying but also thinking that red painted savages with blow pipes and bones through their noses were there to be of assistance.Spoiler: The survivors are transported back to the cannibal's village where they are stroked and fondled by the natives who obviously, apart from the loggers, surveyors etc. have never seen a white person before. This is definitely the case as they can't wait to see what one of them tastes like. The lucky winner is a portly chap who is laid out on some type of sacrificial rock (this must have recently been cleaned as there is not a spot of blood anywhere). Now call me pernickety if I was preparing 'long pig' for the feast I would remove the clothes first. Not so these cannibals, our portly victim had enough clothes to survive an Artic winter, but the cannibals just went ahead lopping off arms and legs. It was similar to preparing a steak that is still in a plastic bag!!Several other scenes pointed to Mr Roth's obvious embarrassment with the human form.Spoiler: One victim is killed by having some green stuff plastered all over him which attract the voracious 'Fire Ants'. Will he be eaten alive? Well no, not really, the man was fully dressed and the green stuff was plastered not on his body but on his outer garments so apart from a couple of bites on his face when death finally spared his agonies, there didn't seem to be anything wrong with the man.There were many similar instances of the film while not shying away from gore was unnaturally cautious about displaying the human body even in circumstances where the authenticity of the script demanded it.Finally in it's own shy way the film attempted to tackle certain modern contentious issues. Spoiler: Female Genital Mutilation was, apparently, a practice the natives thought they would introduce to their captives, providing they were virgins. During one scene our heroine Justine is being prepared for this ritual. Although she is naked during this scene she is tied in a way that keeps her modesty intact. She manages to break free of her captives and at this point has managed to acquire and is seen sporting a fetching string bikini.Scenes like the above are scattered throughout the film making it a ridiculous parody. What makes a good horror film is it's ability, no matter how preposterous, to make us believe that it could happen. Events in 'The Green Inferno' could happen but the way the various actions are portrayed make us believe that it never would.",The Green Inferno
310,Nox_13,Never disappointed,8,17 October 2015,"I liked the movie pretty much. I've been waiting very long for this (like everybody else), and (finally) seen it with (of course) pretty high expectations. And I have to say, I wasn't disappointed at any point.I read other reviews and they seem to not like / get 2 of the scenes, so here's what I think about that:The behavior of the others during the diarrhea-scene I fully understand. However, I think that they have tried to get away from Amy, so she has at least a modicum of privacy. Who likes company during a ""diarrhea-attack""? In that case, I think, it doesn't matter, what else is happening.The masturbation scene is, I think, to increase the hatred of Alejandro a little more, so you can comprehend Justine's decision to leave him at the end.I think, Eli Roth did a good job with this and I'm going to watch more of his movies after I liked this one so much.

315,beastep2,A good reminder of what to not do while making a movie.,1,28 September 2015,"The Green InfernoI'm going to break my review down into a few sections. I'm writing my review as a film student but not trying to say I'm an expert in anyway. I don't like to leave reviews on films I found to be awful but after watching The Green Inferno I feel like I have to.Synopsis:A group of college students (activists) travel to the Amazon to save the rain forest and find themselves battling to save their own lives.Acting:Immediately, the acting was poor. I don't know what type of college the writers went to or are trying to model their story after, but I have never seen college students act like that. It seemed too unnatural. My friends along with myself kept pointing out how the acting didn't seem natural and that the actors were not very good. Throughout the movie however the acting did get better. So that's an upside I suppose. Directing:I felt like I was watching a movie that didn't have a director. What I mean by this is that it appeared as a movie that had someone running around with a camera shooting actors who have never acted before. I felt like the director didn't care about his movie at all.Cinematography:The visual experience was far from enjoyable. There is one particular shot that I'd like to talk about. There was a scene in which the actors were talking about something on the side of the river. Clearly something I was supposed to see. The camera shake was so intense that I couldn't even see what they were talking about. I'm sure it was some type of jungle cat but not really sure. The overused camera shake was throughout the entire movie.Editing:It looked as if they didn't have it in the budget to have the film color graded. Looked like the entire thing was shot on a cheap dslr and edited in iMovie. Story:The story would have been fine if it weren't for the following, the scene where Alejandro was masturbating in the cage, the scene where the tribe were high off of a small amount of Marijuana cooked within a body, and pretty much every death scene was bad. I have never felt like leaving a movie theater early until watching The Green Inferno. I had to force myself to stay until the end simply because I paid to watch it. I like to watch movies whether they be great films or terrible movies. The Green Inferno goes to the top of my terrible list. I do not recommend this movie to anyone.",The Green Inferno
316,kesslermc,Sadly terrible,3,10 October 2017,"This shouldn't have been this bad.

Fans of the gorehouse genre will love this film, though it's not for everybody. It is definitely Eli Roth-esque with the touches of wit, stupidity, and of course.....gore. The ""Damn girl get movin', they're comin!"" happens a lot and sometimes its funny and sometimes you're like ""Saw that coming."" It's the movie you ""expect the expected to happen."" Thoroughly enjoyed the movie though, of course it had a couple of flaws, but none that need to tarnish what Eli (in what I believe) has tried to do here. Create a gorehouse, witty, offbeat, campy slasher.....in a jungle. Enjoy!",The Green Inferno
318,keithbradley,What's worse than cannibalism?,1,5 October 2015,"Sitting through this painful movie. I'm surprised people are even discussing its merits - it doesn't have any!!! Except for the cool look of the natives. Speaking of natives, all they do is jump around with spears. It looks like a racist bugs bunny cartoon from the 40's. Also the Director keeps showing basically the same shot over and over of the natives, that being a wide shot of the village. The shooting is cheap cheap cheap cheap cheap. It looks like an iphone. Seriously. I was Wondering early on what kind of camera they used because it was hideous to look at. This guy's friends with Tarantino? The setup is super weak and goes on forever. I fidgeted the whole time, nodding off at one point. There is 1 scene of cannibalism, it's half decent but brief. Most of the scenes in the movie are trite and simple minded. I read an interview with Roth recently and he said he would never do another Hostile because it would be like going back to High School, he's grown that much as a director. I'm sorry Eli but you've done exactly the opposite - you've regressed: This is as bad as many a 1st- timer's efforts.",The Green Inferno
319,chrisgottschalk,"A good modern take on cannibal films, violent and leaves an impact",6,25 September 2015,"I had to see The Green Inferno in theaters, seeing as this would be the first (and probably the only) time I would get to see an old school-style cannibal film on the big screen. I was a little skeptical, but excited. While certain aspects of the The Green Inferno could have been better, I still left satisfied and happy as a fan of the original cannibal films of the 1970s and 1980s.Writer/Director Eli Roth brings 21st century college students to the Amazon to protest the destruction and killing of a tribe in order to exploit their land.After protesting and being put under arrest, their plane crashes into the jungle. The survivors then become victims to he natives that they were protesting to protect. The movie actually develops great social commentary and manages to create characters that are more than one-dimensional. The movie does a great job of exploiting how modern the world has become.Seeing modern actors/characters in a cannibal film was sort of mind bending for me. This definitely looks and (at certain times) feels like an actual cannibal movie from 30 years ago. Sure, the characters weren't making a good decision and come off as very ignorant, but that's exactly what made it work for me. It's watching a very modern civilized society realize that the world is way bigger than their cell phones. The movie's vibe worked well for me, even with the little bit of comic relief Eli Roth likes to slip in. It worked.I have to say, I was very impressed with how much on screen violence this was able to get away with. If this was the R-rated cut, I can't wait to see an Unrated version. The violence was very grisly and doesn't hold back. Eli Roth didn't disappoint on the gore in this film. Easily some of the most violent stuff I've seen on the big screen, period.The main problem with this is movie is that it doesn't feel very authentic at times. I was very disappointed at the amount of computer generated effects were used, and not necessarily for the violence. There were way too many computer generated animals in this film, and that is were most of the authenticity of this film fell off. The gore is spot on, but the movie lacked good shots of real animals or good shots of the jungle in its natural habitat - with no characters. While the natives looked great on film in their location, so much more could have been done with the jungle around them. The Green Inferno was definitely not a letdown, but it wouldn't have taken much to make it a lot better.Don't expect the shock value of Cannibal Holocaust but get ready for one of the most violence films of the year. It is definitely a wild ride, and should be a lot of fun for fans of cannibal films or extremely violent horror films. Very disturbing, and I appreciate that it isn't completely brainless, and manages to fit in some social commentary with it.",The Green Inferno
320,ricardoisla,Entertaining and chilling,9,26 September 2015,"Watched this yesterday here in the Philippines. I was following this movie ever since I saw a trailer for it I think in 2013. The movie sets off with a group of college students wanting to disrupt deforestation works in the Peruvian tropical forest, however something goes wrong and they land in the hands of a cannibalistic tribe.The story telling is very realistic, as this could really be a reality and indeed if you google it, there is a certain island/tribe in the Indian Ocean where a tribe resides whose members kill any visitors.This film just uses practical effects with exception of 1 scene and thus comes over as very convincing. It had good laughs several times and I wouldn't call this movie a ""gore"" or even R-rated movie, even though there is a certain shock value. It also has a nice plot twist at the end and interesting mid-credits scene that makes you anticipate a sequel.All in all, it was an entertaining and chilling ride. Having this watched in the Philippines, I think the viewers could somewhat relate to the style of living of the cannibals as they had quite nice huts and social system where the elderly women keep themselves busy and where young kids are taught how to go about various chores or handy works. And truth to be told, those old ladies also could pass as Southeast Asian, sometimes you can't really tell the Southern American and Southeast Asian tribal/aboriginal people apart. Even the singing of the old women while they go about their things is similar to here in the Philippines and the kids could pass as Filipinos as well.At any rate, the cinema was quite full and I think especially for people living in tropical countries or emerging countries, being confronted with having their natural resources exploited by money hungry global corporations and careless governments, this movie is very interesting. Definitely an eye-opener to other cultures and how wrong things can get when a superior civilization enters a feudal/tribal one.I am giving this a 9 out of 10 because the only thing I disliked was the picture quality. Even though it's screened digitally, some shots containing wide angles where a bit blurry and not sharp and I also wonder why the tribal people where all in red. It might be to make them look scarier, but with the mostly green background (trees, grass) in the village, my eyes hurt about from the color contrasts. But that's purely something aesthetic, go watch this movie if you want something refreshing aside from the usual Avengers or Marvel blockbusters.",The Green Inferno

323,machina-32561,Entertaining but nothing to remember.,6,28 September 2015,"Compared to some of the really bad examples of the cannibal sub-genre this movie isn't all that bad. (Cannibal Terror is the first that comes to mind) But I feel like the tone of the movie was a bit confused. It's presentation wasn't very serious, but it tried to take itself seriously. (I don't want to spoil anything so I won't list any examples) I had a hard time caring about the characters because they weren't well acted, and often just unpleasant. Almost so much so that I thought it was intentional. Like a slasher film. The gore effects were pretty solid, I cringed a decent amount. But I was laughing pretty regularly too. The CG bits in the movie looked pretty bad, but the director at least tried to cover it up with camera filters and shaking. Except for one scene... that involved ants. That was bad ha ha. But the seriousness of the material didn't come across for me, the only thing that really held this movie up was the gore... and maybe the setting and the indigenous people. Although the only thing that I was really thinking about was the gore. If the acting was better from the ""college student"" actors then the setting and tribal people probably would have had more of an impact. If you want gore, or you want to get together with friends and go ""EWWWWWW"" then you won't be disappointed. If you want a proper horror movie that will make you feel scared and tense, this is definitely not it. I will probably forget about this movie with time unfortunately.",The Green Inferno

The locals were convincing as hell and the female tribe leader was terrifying.There were some horrific scenes in the film but I only really had any concern for the plight of one character, albeit the lead actress. I was unsure about the some of the acting but on reflection I think you were simply not supposed to really like many of the characters and I think that this clouded my judgement on their acting performances. In my opinion Eli Roth is a both a great Director and Writer but paradoxically for me because of this I sometimes feel he could do just slightly better. I would strongly recommend this movie to fans of the horror genre but its definitely not a movie for the squeamish.",The Green Inferno

Portraying demonstrators as a bunch of freaks, tiny group of nut jobs, illogical and collaborators with illegal elements.Try writing a script, you will realize how your personality gets reflected onto it.If one tries to imagine the ideology behind the scenes and dialogs, it is pretty horrific more than the movie itself. Acting on occasions, purposefully or blatant bad in trying to paint the activist groups are are blind followers (not mobilized Cox of the idea but due to some silly teenage attractions or narcissism) to a few simple minded dogmatic fascistic Stalinist type unreasonable leaders.To the young horror loving teens, the message is that, ""Don't follow your humanistic instincts, they are mental, just stay at home and watch brain draining movies."" ""Contrary to popular activism, it is only a single bull dozer doing the ""Development"" and all ill- conceived idea of corporate terrorism against the world's natural resources are not true (only peaceful workers eating their lunches & securities for self-defense from demonstrating bombing terrorist groups such as that shown in the movie). Any mass opposition is destruction of individualism and freedom""What is the idea behind, title credits showing 2-3 Min's of the abundance of forest resource. Is it to prompt you into thinking we don't have enough cutting down of trees?. And immediately after showing gene tile mutilation of ""muslims"", the camera pans onto the free world, developed and pure with steak and wine.The part about tribes is more unrealistic and disconnected from the real world which to be honest isn't the cause of immediate concern as much as the actual propaganda section of it.Edit: Well, well, Just came across this HTTP://www.la times.com/enter TA ... Turns out I was spot on.",The Green Inferno
327,buddhabudda,Three years of waiting waisted.,3,9 November 2015,"With three years waiting/hype from a director who's movies I usually enjoy, I was left wanting more. With the comparison to the infamous ""Cannibal Holocaust"" matched with previous hard-hitting, gory films(""Hostel"" 1&2, and ""Cabin Fever"") I went in expecting full on gore and not much plot line. What you in fact get is the exact opposite. The movie very nonchalantly throws its sub-plots in your face, while failing to actually entertain. With (at least what i've gathered) the sub-plot focusing mainly on female circumcision and activism, leaves you wondering whether you just watched a movie or a 100 minute call to action documentary.Another thing that bothered me was the run time itself. With forty minutes until any actual ""action"" starts, you'll find yourself bored before the plot even starts. With that said, when the ""action"" starts, it comes on strong..for about ten minutes. The only real gory, brutal scene is when one of the only likable characters is dismembered. Towards the end you find that all of the sub-plot of female circumcision comes back in full swing, as the main character is faced with the act herself. Which to me was really the only uncomfortable scene of the whole movie. The ending itself was very lackluster and honestly ticked me off a little as i was expecting more(which i found most of the movie did). If you were curious around all the hype and waiting for three years, give it a shot. But don't set your expectations too high.",The Green Inferno
328,jasonnavarone,stupid,1,10 January 2016,how low have the American populace become to think that we are as stupid as the characters in this film? The entire film is just an exercise in hoping the mains get killed because they are so stupid and idealistic.. and the end is even more disappointing. I found myself actually cheering the savages when the were eating the idiots... Thank you for making this world worse by promoting this crap.I am not sure how to explain how much this movie offended me and my sense of common sense. The idiot who was to scared of snakes to urinate or his efforts to avoid the flesh eating disease that was infecting the gun he was given to ward off snakes. Or the idiot who ran his face into the still spinning aircraft propellor. These were a bunch of starry eyed college idiots trying to change the world with cell phones rather then something real.I hope the average American is not as stupid as what is portrayed in this film.This movie is stupid...,The Green Inferno
329,danfinnegan-70315,Who knew social activism could be so wrong?,1,11 January 2016,"What exactly is The Green Inferno? Well hold on because I'll try to tell you what it isn't: 1. A ""scary"" movie. The most frightening part was realizing that I wasted about 1.5 hours and five dollars on it. 2.A social commentary on rain forest deforestation. The film portrays a small group of college students lead by an uncompromising, hypocritical ideologue on a sojourn into the Peruvian rain forest to disrupt deforestation. While trite in theory, the action comes off even worse. The worst action, however, is reserved for the ""never-before-filmed"" tribe of Peruvian hut-dwellers. Let's hope they never have access to power down there in their huts so they won't see how lame this film is. 3. Well-filmed. The cinematography is just not particularly good (e.g. the jaguar that is barely visible and the airplane scene).It seems as though Roth elected to use the same quality of camera as the folks who made mid- 90s episodes of Are You Afraid of the Dark. 4. Well-written. Deaths happen with no particular rhyme or reason with total disregard to improving the plot. There's also no particularly like-able character throughout the whole movie, and the conclusion leaves much to be desired. Just an altogether poor effort. 5. Well-acted. I suppose in summary, you could consider the Green Inferno to be a slightly gory waste of time (and yes, I did like Hostel).",The Green Inferno
330,jdhwizard,"Why, just why",1,29 June 2021,"MAJOR SPOILERS AHEAD: Movie's been out for 6 years and I finally broke down and watched it. If you're into unnecessary gore, you'll enjoy the gore. So much of the movie didn't need to be there. There's a scene where one of the main characters blows the contents of their colon into their cage, and the other characters react worse to that than the sight of their friend being chopped up and eventually eaten, or the smell of him cooking. The main characters are fed a meat dish after a friend escapes, and most don't think about the likelihood that, if it's not their friend, it's another human. There's foreshadowing to an unnecessary scene where a character is forced upon and almost mutilated in the genitals. I could go on all day about the lack of necessity for most of the scenes, but let's move on to how the movie moves along. It takes almost an hour to get to the main plot. This movie is listed as a horror movie, and it's more disgusting than scary except for a single, terribly CGI'd jump scare at the end. As CinemaSins would say: horror movie takes 1 hour and 40 minutes to horror, also, jump scare at the end of a horror movie cliché.",The Green Inferno
331,ninichirgadze,terrible film!,1,5 January 2020,"Probably the Worst movie I've ever seen!!
horrible cast, directing, writing, everything!! I watched this movie 4 years ago with my friends and in the middle of the movie i felt so bad that i left the theatre! this movie has no sense it just makes you feel awful. i love horror movies but that's something else.... Don't waste your time on this film!",The Green Inferno
332,samhudsonart,sorry if you sat through this movie. and this review,1,22 April 2017,"I'm seriously tired of seeing film where the ""atrocious"" natives are depicted in such a negative way; terrorizing the privileged individuals that are in the area with intentions of helping or saving these peoples. I know this is supposed to be fiction, but it perpetuates myths that uneducated acquaintance believe all to often. myths that these practices are still continued. I have noticed films like this, hostile, and ones similar give justification to a perverse sense of nationalism. And in the era where television is mother, father, and god, at least give your uneducated viewing audience the context that this is a fictitious event. other than that it was a mediocre rehash of a less that classic film. you can do better Eli, you use to have somewhat original ideas. I dare you to think of something relevant to our issues of this new millennium.",The Green Inferno
333,lowrider-71605,Terrible,1,26 May 2017,I am convinced that this is a comedy it is so bad.Eli Roth needs to just stop. This movie is worse than Cabin Fever.There are no likable characters whatsoever they have nothing to them that makes them interesting.The movie is just not a horror movie in anyway shape or form. Try to get through this without laughing.,The Green Inferno
334,nilam-23050,Not too bad,6,23 January 2019,"It was alright. I haven't seen many cannibal movies so I can't judge that aspect of it except from my own opinions. I enjoyed the little eating scene they had with the tribe, it felt very real as if they've done this often. I found out about the movie from a 'most disturbing' movie list but it's not too bad if you're an active horror fan. Not to call this movie a horror movie..",The Green Inferno
335,spongebob-10641,Eli Roth has delivered one of the best homages to a long dead genre I have seen!,9,12 February 2018,"The Green Inferno is something special, it feels like a breath of fresh air when you see the huge number of all those supernatural horror films that come out. I am just going to come out and say that if you expecting a movie that has all the ""essentials"" of a great movie you are going to greatly disappointed! Are you people serious? Do you really expect great acting, a deep plot and well established characters from a cannibal movie? The shock value was pretty much the star of Cannibal Holocaust but no one today gives the movie backlash for that, but when it happens with this movie, people get outraged because they didn't get their OSCAR worthy horror film! This movie has wonderful cinematography, a decent if not always present story, and some pretty awesome gore! The first scene with the cannibals is one of the most intense and gruesome scenes I have seen in a LONG time! This movie is extremely entertaining, I was never bored at any time in the movie. Much like Hostel, it takes quite a while for the good stuff to start, but when it actually starts, it's so worth the wait! If I can say I had a complaint at all with the film, it's 2 things, the ant scene and the scene with the girl having diarrhea. The CGI on the ants was pretty bad, and the diarrhea scene was just unnecessary. Overall, if you are looking for the Oscar worthy film that many people here on IMDb were expecting to get, don't even bother watching it because you will be pretty angry! If you are just looking for some simple trashy entertainment, The Green Inferno will make you pretty happy!The Green Inferno is a fun experience and I give it a 9/10",The Green Inferno
