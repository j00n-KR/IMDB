0,TheLittleSongbird,"Energetic, good spirited nostalgic fun!",8,11 February 2010,"I will admit I didn't like ""Grease"" very much at one point, but like some other musicals, it has grown on me. It is just a fun film, yes with some corny dialogue and some slow moments, but the performances, choreography and songs more than make up for any misgivings. I like how ""Grease"" is filmed, the cinematography is smooth, and the costumes are lovely to look at. The script has some nice raunchy humour, if a little corny at times. Also there is a nice compelling story in general, even if it is slow in spots. The performances are of high energy. John Travolta, is it just me or wasn't he really sexy here? I thought Tim Curry was sexy in ""Rocky Horror Picture Show"" but Travolta's Danny who swivels his hips like Elvis brings a different kind of sexiness as well as acting like a tough kid, which he isn't really. Olivia Newton-John, dressed in whites and creams looks beautiful and is appealing as Sandy, she is almost unrecognisable in the final musical number. Stockard Channing provides a voluptuous contrast as Betty Rizzo, and does it with swagger. What makes this movie enjoyable are the song and dance numbers. I wasn't keen on the songs when I first saw the film seven years ago, but as I have been re watching the film over the years, like the film they have really grown on me. ""Summer Nights"", ""Hopelessly Devoted to You"", ""Grease Lightening"" and ""We Go Together"" are classics. Overall, this film is fun, you mayn't like it first time, but if you give it another chance it could well grow on you. 8/10 Bethany Cox",Grease
1,Leofwine_draca,Good singalong,6,18 September 2021,"The perennial favourite. I like some of the songs, what can I say? A good '50s throwback with Travolta even slicker than he was in SATURDAY NIGHT FEVER. Less a film than some enthuasistic songs joined by a bit of plot.",Grease
2,SnoopyStyle,"Loads of fun, and lots of joy",8,25 December 2013,"Greaser Danny Zuko (John Travolta) returns from a summer of love with sweet girl Sandy Olsen (Olivia Newton-John). Instead of going back to Australia, she ends up in the same school as him. Danny is the leader of the T-Birds while Sandy joins up with the Pink Ladies. Danny can't quite bring himself to show his soft side in front of all the guys.This is a fun musical above all else. The music is infectious. Olivia Newton-John is wonderful singer, and actually quite a lovely actress. John Travolta is a good song and dance man. Some of the actors are pushing the age limit like Stockard Channing, but none of it matters as much the joy of this movie.",Grease
3,Hitchcoc,Some Really Fun Songs,7,25 April 2006,"John Travolta is coming off his Vinnie Barbarino persona. He mugs for the camera. He plays the dummy too often. He is totally a child of peer pressure. I end up thinking, I don't really give a damn if the two of them ever get together. Does anyone else care. The movie is lightweight, but it never takes itself seriously anyway. It's a series of really great songs and interactions, primarily among the hoodlum element of the fifties (who seem to be the standard bearers of that time, even though most kids weren't part of that culture). The movie rides along on its production numbers which put forth the things that kids thought important at the time. There's the fear of pregnancy. The fear of being an outcast. The cars. The primping and showing off. The worst thing of all--being labeled a good person. The adults are even bigger buffoons. And the fact that an older Frankie Avalon shows up, doesn't quite work. These guys are dying off now so they probably will have to start casting people to play them as characters. Anyway, if I pick up this movie, I fast forward to about ten places that I totally enjoy and ignore the plot (I guess there is a plot somewhere, but it doesn't matter). I was surprised that Travolta is a pretty decent singer.",Grease
4,mark.waltz,How many times can you revisit old pleasures?,7,16 August 2016,"O.K., I'm sure that some teenagers my age saw ""Grease"" more times than I did. But I must confess that in its initial run in the late Spring/early Summer of 1978, I did see it four times on the big screen. Memories of playing certain songs over and over at a club which specialized in showtunes have embedded in my mind and won't leave. Now I look upon it with jaded cynicism, but at one time during my blossoming years, it was one of my favorite movie musicals. Looking back, I have a hard time seeing much of the cast as high school seniors with only Olivia Newton John of the four leads the most acceptable, that is until she puts on those black leotards at the end, screaming early '70's hard rock rather than late '50's rebellious teen.In spite of his maturity as greaser Danny, John Travolta acts, sings and dances excellently. Stockard Channing stretches the imagination as the tough Rizzo, but actually does come out smelling like a rose otherwise, giving the most memorable performance of the four. Jeff Conaway is a close second, but I found Olivia, the youngest, to be the blandest even if she sings sweetly.Such veterans as Eve Arden, Dody Goodman, Sid Caesar, Joan Blondell and Alice Ghostley show how its really done, but Arden, in more of a featured role than a cameo, really does get the best lines in the film. Didi Conn is the best of the teen sidekicks, getting a great production number with the aid of veteran '60's teen, Frankie Avalon. Jersey Boy Frankie Valli gets to introduce the title song, while the camp boy group Sha Na Na is a delight in the prom sequence.If you can get past the age of the four leads, you will find a lot to enjoy in this musical blockbuster that held the record for most successful movie musical ever for years. It came at a time when nostalgia was king and my generation of teens looked on at our parents from that generation as (at least for a while) as pretty cool. This isn't among the best movie musical adaption of a Broadway hit, but for all its success, it must have done something right.",Grease
5,kosmasp,Light entertainment,7,29 December 2010,"Don't go into this expecting another West Side Story or anything that has a big social commentary written all over it. Watch it if you like Musicals in general, but still keep in mind, it might not be as elaborate as other Musicals have been. Watch it especially for the songs, which are very good.And while I'm not particularly a Musical fan, I have to admit that the songs were really good (and you may have heard a few of them). Strong songs and performances and quite raunchy for a movie of that time. There is a scene with the girls (I won't spoil the content of it), that I'm sure got the censors all riled up.A light musical that is there to entertain you, if you let it (with a few actors that became more known later on and I'm not only talking about Mr. Travolta).",Grease
6,Sleepin_Dragon,A timeless classic.,9,23 January 2021,"I watched this when it was transmitted over Christmas, and then watched in horror as the offended brigade started complaining.Made in 1978, it's the ultimate feel good film, sure it's over the top, it's absurd, and some of the scenes will have you maybe feeling a bit cringe worthy now, but it still remains a great film.As a youngster I watched it frequently, it's funny how some films stick with you, could I really believe in most of them as High school students, well I did back then.It is all about the music, music which is still iconic, and hopefully will be heard at theatres in the not too far off future.Would you make a film the exact same way now, of course not, is it ok to love a film made back in 1978, yes it sure is.Watch for the music, ending, and of course John Travolta.It really is the word. 9/10",Grease
7,gavin6942,Even More Awful than I Expected,6,9 October 2007,"A guy and girl fall in love, but then must return home... only to find out they go to the same high school and act completely different when their friends are around. With the help of some music and dancing, can they make cars into speed demons and ladies into sexual creatures? Oh, I think maybe they can...The only reason I should have watched this film was to see Lorenzo Lamas as Tom Chisum. John Travolta was nothing special, Olivia Newton-John (who the video clerk said would be a guy's dream) was nothing special (and Australian) and Stockard Channing... oh my! Here's the spoiler: after all the singing and dancing is over, the female lead decides that instead of being herself, she is going to start smoking and wear black leather to be with the man she loves, despite the fact the man she loves was only acting at the time. The male lead, who was beginning to change, reverts back to his old self and everyone is happy. Moral: women of the world can only be happy once they give up their identity and become a man's shadow. (Ladies, don't you think there are other man more like you in the world? Just maybe not at Rydell High.) So yeah, I had to watch this against my will. At least my friend Lisa was nice enough to suffer with me. I know the songs, I don't mind the songs (especially when done by Less Than Jake), but the film is just trash and I have no idea how this has become an international sensation. Rubbish!",Grease
8,lee_eisenberg,"Sometimes when people mention ""Grease"", I mistakenly think that they're talking about Greece.",5,26 March 2006,"The plot isn't anything that we haven't seen before - a good girl falls for a greaser - but the energy makes it worthwhile. Maybe the movie is overall kinda hokey (as musicals usually are), but it does have some neat scenes. I certainly get the feeling that John Travolta was getting typecast as a song-and-dance man, given that he had just starred in ""Saturday Night Fever"" and now ""Grease"" (and later ""Urban Cowboy""). As for Olivia Newton-John, I don't know what she's done since this. Maybe ""Grease"" is worth seeing once, as a cultural reference.And yes, sometimes when people mention this movie, I think that they're referring to Greece. The things that we see in life...",Grease
9,jboothmillard,Grease,9,7 September 2005,"This is the highest-grossing musical movie of all time, with many memorable pop style songs it is certainly one of my most favourites, based on the successful Broadway production, directed by Randal Kleiser (The Boy in the Plastic Bubble, The Blue Lagoon, Honey I Blew Up the Kid). Basically in 1958, teenagers Sandy Olsson (introducing Golden Globe nominated Olivia Newton-John) and Danny Zuko (Golden Globe nominated John Travolta) meet each other at the beach while on vacation and fall in love spending the summer together, Sandy worries they will never see each other again when she returns Australia, he assures her it is only the beginning for them. On the first day of senior year at Rydell High, Danny is the leader of greaser gang the T-Birds, his fellow gang members are second in command and Danyy's best friend Kenickie (Jeff Conaway), Sonny (Michael Tucci), Doody (Barry Pearl) and Putzie (Kelly Ward). Sandy meanwhile has enrolled at Rydell after her parents' changed their plans, she is unaware of Danny's presence, as is Danny of hers. Sandy has made friends with Frenchy (Didi Conn), a member of the T-Birds female equivalent group the Pink Ladies, the group's leader is members are Betty Rizzo (Stockard Channing), and other members are Jan (Jamie Donnelly) and Marty (Dinah Manoff). At lunch Sandy and Danny tell their friends about meeting each other over the summer, Rizzo finds out Sandy is talking about Danny, she deviously arranges a surprise meeting, Danny is excited to see her, but acts cool in front of the T-Birds, which hurts Sandy's feelings, but at a slumber party with the girls she laments missing Danny. After the T- Birds help repair Kenickie's car Greased Lightning, Danny asks Coach Calhoun (Sid Caesar) to help him find a sport so he can impress Sandy, she has started dating football player Tom (Lorenzo Lamas), having tried various sports Danny eventually settles on track sprinting, and rekindles his relationship with Sandy. Danny and Sandy's date attempt is crashed by both the T-Birds and the Pink Ladies, who are gradually pairing off, Kenickie and Rizzo have an argument and the two groups leave, Frenchy is left alone pondering dropping out of high school to attend beauty school, she is visited by her guardian angel (Frankie Avalon) who advises her to go back to high school. Weeks later it is the school dance, Rydell High has been picked for a live national TV broadcast on National Bandstand, hosted by DJ Vince Fontaine (Edd Byrnes), Rizzo and Kenickie try to score off against Leo (Dennis C. Stewart), leader of rival greaser gang the Scorpions, and his on-and-off girlfriend Cha Cha (Annette Charles), while Danny and Sandy go together, Cha Cha was once Danny's girlfriend, she pairs with Danny as the final dance is underway, Sandy leaves alone and upset, while Danny and Cha Cha win the national dance-off. Days later Danny takes Sandy to a drive-in theatre and apologises, but then makes some quick passes that cause her to leave, meanwhile Rizzo tells Marty in confidence she thinks she is pregnant as she has missed her period, this is overheard and quickly passed to Kenickie, the potential father, but his phrasing to make things right offends her, she tells him it was someone else, in spite, Rizzo laments being rumoured as promiscuous, Sandy finds and comforts her, the two finally become friends. Kenickie has set up a race between him and Leo at local racing spot ""Thunder Room"", the winner will get the loser's car, Putzie inadvertently knocks Kenickie on the head, concussing him, Danny takes his place, Sandy watches from afar, Danny wins the race, but cannot celebrate completely without Sandy, she realises she loves him, but decides to change herself to be with him, asking French to help her do so. The school year ends and all students attend a graduation carnival, Kenickie and Rizzo reunite, she has found out she is not pregnant, they reform their relationship, Danny and everyone is stunned when Sandy shows up with a new bad girl image, she and Danny share a dance and proclaim their love for each other, and the film ends with everyone celebrating and singing together, with Danny and Sandy soaring away into the sky in Greased Lightning. Also starring Eve Arden as Principal McGee, Joan Blondell as Vi and Dody Goodman as Blanche. Travolta, who made an impact in Saturday Night Fever the year before, and Newton-John are fantastic as the loved up innocent teens, Channing gives a great performance as the unruly one, and the supporting cast members get their roles right as well. The best songs of the film (three featured in 1990's ""The Grease Megamix"") are: Golden Globe nominated opening song ""Grease (Is the Word"" by Frankie Valli, written by Barry Gibb, ""Summer Nights"" (UK number one and number 70 on 100 Years, 100 Songs), Oscar nominated ""Hopelessly Devoted to You"", ""Greased Lightnin'"", ""Beauty School Dropout"", Golden Globe nominated ""You're the One That I Want"" (number 62 on The 100 Greatest Number One Singles) and ending song ""We Go Together"". This works well as a nostalgic swing into the 1950s, with a sweet love story, there are mild elements of the dramas teenagers face, but more than anything there are plenty of toe-tapping songs to sing along and dance to, a highly enjoyable romantic musical. It was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Musical/Comedy. John Travolta was number 46 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, he was number 38 on The 100 Greatest Sex Symbols, he was number 63 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons, and he was number 46 on The World's Greatest Actor, the film was number 20 on 100 Years of Musicals, it was number 97 on 100 Years, 100 Passions, it was number 16 on The 100 Greatest Family Films, it was number 12 on The Ultimate Film, and it was number 1 on The 100 Greatest Musicals. Very good!",Grease
10,moonspinner55,Klutzy musical-comedy has two left feet...,6,26 May 2001,"High schoolers in 1959 pair off for nostalgic romance. Musical comedy adapted from the hit Broadway show features choreography so stilted, it's amazing that director Randall Kleiser ever got the juices flowing. His picture has some exhilarating moments, but much of it is fumbled. The sock-hop sequence gives John Travolta a chance to strut his stuff, though the dance moves are mechanical and he comes off looking a little soft (perhaps that's because he's saddled with Olivia Newton-John, who's all fluff). The movie's rampant vulgarity can be deemed ""cute"" (it seems to make everyone laugh, but is it out of embarrassment?) and the music (some original B-way tunes and several new songs) is half-hearted. The film has a cleverly chosen, colorful supporting cast, and Travolta as Danny Zuko is really in the spirit. It's good-natured and strictly featherweight, but that is no excuse for the finale (which is an insult), nor for the lack of subtlety or the flaunting of its amateurishness. **1/2 from ****",Grease
11,tavm,"After previously watching this several times during my youth, I got a great kick of seeing the sing-a-long version of Grease",8,8 June 2020,"Just watched most of the sing-a-long version on CBS hours earlier (I came home from work after the first 30 minutes had already played). My mom claimed she had not seen this movie before but when I was younger, I remember her commenting on some of the scenes when watching the VHS version with my siblings. When I was a pre-teen kid, I had watched this particular movie lots of times, whether at the local library, at the Broadmoor Theatre, or on network TV (which censored certain lyrics of ""Greased Lightning"" and cut out the mooning scene). The version I just watched on CBS simply muted the offending words-as well as not print them on screen though the sh-one got various typed symbols-from that song and just didn't show the bare butts on camera during that mooning scene. Anyway, all those times I previously watched it, I enjoyed it sooooo much, it for a while was my favorite movie. Since 1981, It's a Wonderful Life took that place. Still, it's always a treat to watch John Travolta and Olivia Newton-John on screen together whether talking, singing, or dancing together. And the songs are always a thrill to watch and listen to especially since I've heard the songs several times on record before my first time watching this movie. The lyrics printed on screen also added some visual symbols to basically humorously comment on the action on screen. Of the older adult characters, I especially liked the interaction of Eve Arden and Dody Goodman as the principal and her assistant, respectively. And Sid Caesar is aces in those PE training scenes with Travolta, that's for sure! And then there's that John Wilson cartoon during the opening credits while Barry Gibb's title song is playing that's also a fine addition to the movie. Really, all I'll say now is Grease is still the word, after a little more than 40 years... Update-I finally got to see the sing-a-long versions of ""Love is a Many Splendored Thing"", ""Summer Nights"" and the first ""Look at Me, I'm Sandra Dee"" number on YouTube just now...",Grease
12,ComedyFan2010,Grease is THE word!,9,10 July 2010,"I really love this movie! First, I need to mention my favorite part of it: the soundtrack. It isn't even the kind of music I usually listen to, and yet I love all those songs. With all this time that passed since the movie was filmed they are still awesome. ""You are the one that I want"" always makes me want to dance. ""Hopelessly devoted to you"" is a classic. And my favorite and most under-appreciated song of the movie in my opinion: ""There are worse things I could do"" It never bothered me that the actors were not teenagers. I didn't see it as a big deal when I was a teenager and now when I am their age I think it makes the movie more enjoyable to me since it is easier to connect with them. Let's be fair, Hollywood was never very accurate with age, but to me it is the performance that matters. And they did it great. I wouldn't want to see anyone play Rizzo. To me she was perfect at it.I also love the bright colors, the fun clothes etc. that are supposed to represent the 50's.There is some overacting in this movie, but I think this is the right way for this movie. It isn't a drama that needs accurate performances of human behaviour, a perfect presentation of the 50's and a deep plot line. It is simply a feel good movie, that makes you happy and also nostalgic for a time that was way before you were born.Also, I think the ending is great. I believe it is misinterpreted by some critics. It doesn't send the message to change for a guy. It is simply telling you to overcome your shyness and social demands (girls should be ""good"" and ""wallflowers"") and become yourself.",Grease
13,wes-connors,Conventionality Belongs to Yesterday,4,7 January 2011,"Love is a many-splendored thing for dimpled stud John Travolta (as Danny) and pretty blonde Olivia Newton-John (as Sandy). They frolic on the beach for a summer. We later learn it was ""all talk and no action."" When school starts, we also learn how little they spoke, as Mr. Travolta is surprised to discover Ms. Newton-John is an Australian exchange student attending swingin' Rydell High School. The way these character look, act and speak suggests Rydell is a ""special"" school for those who are having trouble graduating. Best pals Stockard Channing (as Rizzo) and Jeff Conaway (as Kenickie) are a little brainier.""Grease"" is a moronic adaptation of a stage hit set in the 1950s, made to sound like the 1970s.Considering the personnel involved in this picture, old-timers offer ironic ""rules"" for the enclosed ""dance contest."" Eve Arden warns, ""Anyone doing tasteless or vulgar movements will be disqualified."" More importantly, Sid Caesar notes, ""All couples must be boy/girl."" So, art doesn't always imitate life. There are a lot of familiar faces; see who you recognize, and why. If you get bored, don't stop until you find the great ""video"" located near the end of the film - the ""You're the One That I Want"" duet performed by Newton-John and Travolta, driven by a pulsating bass line, is a terrifically sexy pop fire-starter from 1978.**** Grease (6/13/78) Randal Kleiser ~ John Travolta, Olivia Newton-John, Stockard Channing, Jeff Conaway",Grease
14,studioAT,"It's still the word, it still has meaning",8,9 January 2012,"Grease will live on forever as one of the greatest musicals of all time and it will do this because of it's story, it's music and the cast who brought it to life.There will be imitations and spin-offs but the original is still the best and Grease captures elements of everyones high school experience beautifully.The cast are fantastic from John Travolta right down to the supporting players while the songs come thick and fast and are still beloved today.At almost any wedding a Grease song will be played and have everyone dancing and this is a testament to this film.Anyone can enjoy it, anyone can sing along with it - in my opinion if you're looking for a musical to watch then Grease is the word.",Grease

16,hitchcockthelegend,You're a fake and a phony and I wish I never laid eyes on you!,9,10 October 2010,"Grease is directed by Randal Kleiser and stars John Travolta, Olivia Newton-John, Stockard Channing & Jeff Conaway. It's co-written by Jim Jacobs, Warren Casey (Musical), Bronte Woodard & Allan Carr.1958 and Danny (Travolta) has a holiday romance with the pretty and virginal Sandy (Newton-John). She ends up going to the same high school as he, but he's under peer pressure to stay cool and uphold a tough guy image. They fall out, argue, make up, their friends are equally unstable. Oh and there's the small matter of some truly memorable songs and dances too.As full of gusto as it is cheese, Grease is the musical that's hard to dislike. The acting is so-so, the direction one dimensional and the plot could have been written on a 50s beer mat. Yet we love it because of its faults, the kooky charm that sidles up alongside those roaring tunes. We care not that these actors are too old to play high schoolers, the fun is watching them have fun being teens again. Hell there's even innuendo unbound and cheeky lyrics for those of an adult mind. A truly great fun movie that's longevity shows no time of ending any time soon.

17,Doylenf,Zestful version of the Broadway hit...,6,6 January 2007,"GREASE is the movie version of a Broadway hit that began off-Broadway, where I saw it originally--and always remember it fondly because it provided me with a good glimpse of someone who just happened to be in the audience that day--INGRID BERGMAN with her son, Roberto. Saw her in the lobby during intermission and she was avoiding eye contact, and seemed to enjoy being ""left alone"". At the time, I thought it was odd that Bergman wanted to see GREASE, a strictly American type of look at the high school experience that she probably had no part of.Anyway, the film is full of pop songs that were high on the chart at the time with the standard number of stock characters you'd expect to find at Rydell High School. JOHN TRAVOLTA and OLIVIA NEWTON-JOHN are the leads, Travolta repeating his Broadway role as Danny. Frankly, as the years passed, I became less and less interested in Travolta as an actor/celebrity--ditto with Olivia Newton-John--but this, apart from Saturday NIGHT FEVER, is probably tailor-made for his brand of singing and dancing.The talented supporting cast adds a lot to the proceedings--STOCKARD CHANNING, SID CAESAR, EVE ARDEN, JEFF CONAWAY and JOAN BLONDELL all contribute nicely to the overall flavor.Not my idea of a ""favorite musical"" (unlike so many of the commentators here), but it passes the time quickly and amusingly.",Grease
18,preppy-3,Well....the songs are good,1,3 December 2005,"Dreadful mish-mash. A musical about sweet, lovable Sandy (Olivia Newton-John) in love with hood Danny Zuko (John Travolta). Tedious and predictable complications ensure. It all ends up with Sandy deciding to become a tramp (she's wearing a skin-tight leather outfit at the end) to get the man she loves. Great message to the girls in America--you can't get the guy you love by being sweet so be a tramp and you'll get him.I've never liked this movie. With a few exceptions the actors REALLY overact to an embarrassing degree. The guys who played the T Birds were particularly annoying--they acted like a bunch of hyperactive fourth graders. The dance numbers (I'm being charitable to call them that) are disasters. Except for the prom dance they're all over the place. Especially during the ""Summer Nights"" number--it seems like everybody is dancing to totally different songs! The script has Mickey Mouse dialogue and is chockful of crude stupid jokes (most of which are edited out of the TV prints). There are a few things that save this from total disaster. Newton-John is very sweet and pretty as Sandy. Travolta overacts--but in an engaging way. Jeff Conaway as his best buddy is very good. Also Stockard Channing (who was 30 when she made this) is on target as Rizzo. She also gets a chance to belt out her own number ""There Are Worse Things I Could Do"". Also the songs are great--""Summer Nights"", ""Hopelessly Devoted to You"", ""You're the One That I Want"", ""Greased Lightning""... Too bad they're all so ineptly staged. I have seen the movie multiple times--but only as camp. It's something I just watch and wonder at. How did something so badly done get to be such a big hit? Channing herself has openly said she hates the movie. And I find the message this movie gives to be very troubling.I give it a 5 but that's only for the music and some of the acting.

19,CinemaSerf,Who put the ram in the ram-a-lang-a-ding-dong?,7,27 December 2020,"""Sandy"" (Olivia Newton John) is a well brought up young girl who meets and falls in love with ""Danny"" (John Travolta) during summer break in late 1950's California. When they both start high school, though, we discover she to be the archetypical preppie-type who hangs about with Stockard Channing's ""Pink Ladies"" and he the leader of the ""T-Birds"" - the school's leather and white T-shirt clad greasers. Their obvious attraction to each other is hemmed in by their respective roles at school and they've got to find a way to sort it out! Channing is the star for me in this film. She's great as ""Rizzo"" - loads of attitude, earthy wisdom and ""Look at Me, I'm Sandra Dee"" - that helps ""Sandy"" to hook her man. Along with some entertainingly well choreographed dance routines, the other songs are superb too - a mixture of toe tappers and sloppy ballads from the likes of Frankie Valli, Frankie Avalon and of course, the two stars with ""You're the One That I Want"" and ""Summer Nights"" that frequently outdo the rather banal script. It's a gently engaging, slightly competitive love story that, though a bit dated now, was certainly an important film as I grew up!",Grease
20,zardoz-13,Slick!,10,1 December 2011,"This toe-tapping high school musical homage to the 1950s toplining John Travolta and Olivia Newton-John epitomizes nostalgia like few movies can with top pop tunes and hip-wiggling choreography. Basically, the Bronte Woodard screenplay of the Jim Jacobs and Warren Casey stage musical recycles the venerable boy gets girl, boy loses girl, and boy gets girl back formula. Of course, in Hollywood, everybody is eternally youthful, even when they are well past their high school prime. Rydell High is the setting for all these shenanigans, with Principal McGee (Eva Arden) presiding over the likes of Danny Zuko (John Travolta), Rizzo (Stockard Channing), Kenickie (Jeff Conaway), Frenchy, (Didi Conn), Eugene (Eddie Deezen), and Tom (Lorenzo Lamas). The action opens to the strains of Love Is A Many Splendid Thing on the beach as the summer sunset sets on a whirlwind romance between Danny and Sandy Olsson (Olivia Newton-John) who has to return to Australia. Little does she know that she will not be going back down under and winds up at Rydell High where she encounters Danny. Like most teenagers in high school, the guys have to posture when they are not running their combs through their grease-soaked coiffures. Danny leads a black-leather jacket clad gang called the T-Birds and their sworn enemies are the scorpions. This fierce rivalry smolders throughout the action while Kenickie takes an old jalopy and overhauls it. Kenickie and his squeeze Rizzo eventually break up when she fears that she may be pregnant and one of the Scorpions (Dennis Stewart) challenges Kenickie to a drag race for pink slips, i.e. ownership papers of the car that loses. At the last minute, Kenickie has to back and Danny takes the wheel. Just as Sandy and Danny are warming up to each other, Rydell High becomes the site of a nationally televised dance contest with Vince Fontaine (Edd Byrnes) acting as the Emcee. Danny takes Sandy but he winds up dancing with feisty Cha Cha DiGregorio (Annette Charles) and winning the contest. Sandy breaks up with Danny, but they are back together for the finale. The chemistry between Travolta and Newton-John is sizzling with their singing finale as a corker. GREASE pays tribute to many seminal 50s films, such as ""Ben-Hur,"" during an automobile race. The performances are fine and the music is memorable.",Grease
21,grantss,Good musical drama,7,14 October 2016,"Teenagers Sandy (played by Olivia Newton-John) and Danny (John Travolta) have a summer romance but that seems to be how long it will last. Then they discover that they now both attend the same high school...Good musical-drama. Basic plot, but the movie is made by the music. Catchy, and keeps the story moving along.Decent performance by John Travolta. Olivia Newton-John is weak and unconvincing in her role though. Supporting cast is solid, though casting in general is a major problem. Who thought casting 20-somethings as teens when they don't look anything like teens would be a good idea?

23,neil-476,Good but flawed,8,14 February 2019,"Australian nice girl Sandy has a summer holiday romance with Danny, and ends up going to the same high school, to their mutual surprise, only to find that peer pressure leads Danny to be a crass sexist rather than the nice lad she had encountered. The scool year features many irrelevant digressions - car remodelling, a televised dance contest, a pregnancy scare, a hotrod race - before Sandy disovers that the way to her man's heart is to dress like a slut and start smoking.Grease tops tge cgarts for a l9t of people. I undestand why - it has some great musical numbers, well staged, and some winning from performanes from, especially, John, Travolta, Stockard Channing, and Eve Arden. But i find it flawed.One, this high school teenagers are all, obviously, at least a decade older than the characters they are playing. Two, Oliver, Newton and John is both lovely and sexy, sings prettily and dances competently, but doesn't command the screen in the same way her co-star does. Three, the film delivers a mixed message. It shows us both wholesome purity and slutty promiscuity, and seems to endorse and deplore both. Colour me confused, ditto any teen trying to use this film as a route map to negotiate a way through those difficult years of sexual uncertaintty. Four, the episodic digressions which comprise the centre of tye film are barely, if at all, linked to the central Danny/Sandy plot.The mus8c remains great fun, though.",Grease

Although he is equally sad that they have to be separated he reluctantly goes back to school where his buddies in a gang known as the ""T-Birds"" eagerly greet him. Naturally, he falls back into his tough-guy routine and life continues as it was. Then one night Sandy appears and tells him that she is a student at the same high school. But rather than being pleased Danny puts on a show in front of his peers to avoid embarrassment which he immediately regrets afterwards. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this was a pretty good musical-comedy which earned quite a bit of money and was also nominated for an Oscar along with several Golden Globe awards as well. The dance routine at the end was also quite impressive. In any case, although I wasn't quite as overwhelmed by it as some viewers were, I still liked the film to a certain degree and I have rated it accordingly. Slightly above average.",Grease

It is a musical about time and style starring John Travolta and Olivia Newton-John as Danny and Sandy who are reunited after sharing a summer romance. He is one of the T-Birds gang and she is introduced to the Pink Ladies. We can relate to their trials and situations as they pass through this faze. A lot of fun with electrifying musical numbers including ""Grease Lightning"", ""Beauty School Dropout"" and a comical ""Sandra Dee"" number performed by Rizzo. Director Randal Kleiser is backed with exquisite art direction. Travolta as Danny struggles with sincerity as he attempts to win over Sandy as well as balance his friendships. Newton-John plays off the innocence of Sandy who sings a wonderful number about her helpless devotion to Danny. Stockard Channing steals scenes as tough talking Rizzo who leads the Pink Ladies as well as struggle with her relationship with Kenicky. Jeff Conaway plays rebellious T-Bird leader Kenicky whose tough surface shields his true emotions. Didi Conn provides amusement as Frenchy, who drops out and fails in beauty school. Engaging musical about friendship and memories that will remind viewers why ""grease"" is the word. Score: 9 / 10",Grease
27,Aaron1375,"For a musical it is tolerable, even if it has virtually no plot.",5,20 March 2010,"Like I start off saying before I review most musicals, I really do not care for the musical format in a movie. That being said this one is more tolerable than most musicals I have had the misfortune to see. In fact, some areas of the movie are rather good. To put it bluntly a five is a very good score for me to give a musical. The main problem I have with the movie has less to do with the fact that it is a musical and more with the fact it has almost no plot whatsoever in the film. Also, it seems to be trying to teach people that the only way to be accepted is to act like everyone else and not be an individual. So not the best message in the world that is for sure. Still, the songs in this one are actually kind of catchy compared to some musicals, though my favorite musical number in this one is the song played in the opening credits. There are a couple of other rather good songs in this one though, I have to say the worst song in this one is better than anything heard in the dreadful sequel to this film. There are also a couple of humorous scenes in this one too, like the sleepover where they make fun of poor Sandra. And speaking of Sandra, Olivia Newton John is very good in this film as is most of the cast. Even Travolta is rather good in this one and to be honest I am not a big fan of his usually (when I usually can tolerate him is when he is a bad guy). So while not something I would want to see every day, this musical to me is tolerable which is high praise coming from me who hates musicals usually.",Grease
28,Wuchakk,Iconic campy musical of high school life in late '50's Southern Cal,7,9 July 2017,"Released in 1978 and directed by Randal Kleiser, ""Grease"" stars John Travolta as a high school greaser in 1958 Southern California, who takes interest in a new clean-cut girl from Australia (Olivia Newton-John). Stockard Channing plays the leader of the Pink Ladies with a bad rep who romances the leader of the greaser Thunderbirds (Jeff Conaway). Didi Conn and Dinah Manoff play two other notable Pink Ladies while Frankie Avalon has a song & dance cameo. This iconic musical/dramedy is campy, but kinetic and all-around entertaining. The main cast was in their physical prime. The race in the storm drain scene is a highlight, as is the school dance contest. The movie runs 110 minutes and was shot at Huntington Park High School, Burbank, Malibu, Bellflower, Venice & Los Angeles, California.

High school drama of clicks. With songs in the middles end etc mixed into a romance. Sort of a 50's Happy Days feel. Acting, and directing is okay, but not my cup of tea. A classic if you like musicals because Olivia was a great singer, and John is great actor.",Grease
30,Mr-Fusion,Iconic,6,18 April 2016,"Full confession: In a '50s musical, my favorite song is Frankie Valli's titular disco track. That's what's kind funny about this movie: it's youthful midcentury Americana by way of the '70s. But it's also pretty much a cinema staple - you're an oddball if you haven't seen this (I mean even the '98 rerelease was enough to tell me that back in high school).Musicals aren't my thing, so I'm not the ideal audience for this - but even I can appreciate big set pieces and elaborate dance numbers. And any time you see the L.A. river in a movie, you think of this drag race. That alone says a lot about the movie's legacy. But the cast looks good (even the way-too-old Stockard Channing), the songs are lively, and you don't really see this kind of thing anymore.6/10",Grease
31,JamesHitchcock,The Fifties As They Should Have Been,7,4 February 2011,"Despite occasional revivals, the early seventies marked the end of the cultural dominance of the traditional Broadway-style musical film. (""Fiddler on the Roof"" and ""Cabaret"" were the last two great examples). ""Grease"" was perhaps the nearest equivalent in the second half of the decade. Although it uses popular music rather than the quasi-classical music of Gershwin or Rodgers and Hammerstein, it shares two features in common with earlier Hollywood musicals which set it apart from the dance-based musicals of the late seventies and eighties like ""Saturday Night Fever"", ""Fame"", ""Flashdance"" or ""Dirty Dancing"". Firstly, it is based on an earlier stage musical. Secondly, it uses songs in a non-naturalistic way as a means of commenting on the action and of demonstrating the characters' emotions, unlike the dance musicals in which the characters only sing and dance in situations where people would sing and dance in real life.The film is set in 1959 in the fictitious Rydell High School and tells the story of a romance between two of the pupils, Danny Zuko and Sandy Olsson. (Sandy is an Australian, a detail presumably invented to allow Olivia Newton-John to avoid having to attempt an American accent; the equivalent character in the original stage version was American). Also featuring are Danny's gang, the T-Birds, and their female counterparts, the Pink Ladies. As is common in American high school movies supposedly teenage characters are played by actors in their twenties or thirties. Stockard Channing in particular looks more like a member of the PTA than of the student body.Recent films about the 1950s, such as ""Far from Heaven"" and ""Revolutionary Road"", have tended to take a negative view of the decade, seeing it as a period of hypocrisy and social repression. In the seventies and eighties, however, film-makers were inclined to take a more positive view, partly because the studios were still under the control of a more conservative generation who had grown up before the social changes of the sixties, and partly because of the trauma of the Vietnam War which led Americans to see the period immediately preceding that war as a lost golden age. Like ""Diner"", a film from a few years later also set in late 1959, ""Grease"" looks at the fifties through rose-tinted spectacles.The title derives from the fact that the film celebrates the ""greaser"" subculture of the era. ""Greasers"" were young men who adopted a distinctive look involving leather jackets and the greased-back hair from which they took their name; they were generally lovers of motorcycles, fast cars and rock music. (In America they appear to have adopted the ""greaser"" name as a badge of pride, but in Britain their preferred name was ""rockers"", ""greaser"" being an insult hurled at them by followers of rival youth gangs such as mods and skinheads). One of the most popular television programmes in the seventies and early eighties was ""Happy Days"", which featured another ""greaser"" character, Fonzie, played by Henry Winkler. Winkler was offered the role of Danny but declined it, apparently because he did not want to become typecast.Winkler's loss was John Travolta's gain, as ""Grease"" helped him consolidate the reputation he had won in ""Saturday Night Fever"" the previous year as Hollywood's coolest young actor. The success of the film's soundtrack also gave a massive boost to Newton-John's career as a singer, although her acting career never really took off in the same way, possibly because her follow-up to ""Grease"" was the forgettable ""Xanadu"". (Forgettable, that is, to all except trivia quiz junkies desperately in need of an answer to the question ""Name a film beginning with X"", and even that need has since been undermined by the X-Men franchise).The film's music, in fact, is really better than its plot, which is no more than a standard boy-girl romance reminiscent of sixties beach movies. Some of its cultural references now seem very dated; I am not sure why the scriptwriters were so keen to satirise the long-forgotten Sandra Dee, admittedly a huge star in 1959 but by 1978 already a prime candidate for ""Where Are They Now?"" There are no really great acting performances, but all the stars do what is expected of them. The real star is the music, based on the popular music of the era and unfailingly cheerful and high-spirited. Some of the songs have become classics, such as ""Greased Lightning"" ""You're the One That I Want"", the love-ballad ""Hopelessly Devoted to You"" and the witty ""Summer Nights"" in which Danny and Sandy independently tell their friends about their romance from different viewpoints. (As might be expected, the boys are obsessed with sex, the girls with romance).There are some similarities between ""Grease"" and ""Absolute Beginners"", a British musical from eight years later also set in the late fifties. In terms of their visual style the two films are very different, and the soundtrack to ""Absolute Beginners"" is based around jazz rather than rock. (It deals not with the rockers but with their ""mod"" rivals for whom jazz was the music of choice). The British film also makes some serious points about racism; ""Grease"" does not really tackle social issues, apart from a minor subplot about teenage pregnancy. What the two films have in common is that both present an irresistible, upbeat celebration of youth culture; what we see in them is not so much the fifties as they actually were but the fifties as they should have been. 7/10",Grease
32,StevePulaski,Frankie Valli said it best,8,28 September 2012,"In the grand scheme of Broadway musicals turned films, the one everyone seems to know is the 1978 adaptation of Grease. It has proved itself timeless with its over-the-top portrayal of 50's culture and hilariously broad performances by its two wonderful leads. It may not be the best musical, you'll be hard-pressed to find a film wackier, more enjoyable, and more subversive than the 1975 cult musical which I believe doesn't need to be named, but for a film that works mostly on its own terms, it's flyweight and easy to love.John Travolta, always a charming, energetic actor, plays Danny, the kid at the school who sports black leather, jeans, and greasy, slicked-back black hair affirming his style and attitude. Singer Olivia Newton-John plays Sandy, a good girl with hair of gold. We see the two say a long goodbye on the beach after a summer of clear passion and enjoyment disintegrates into distant memories as Sandy must return to Australia.Cue the wonderfully animated title cards with the Frankie Valli song we all know and we are at Rydell High School, the school where people wear their social cliques and popularity status like a brand new leather coat. It comes as a surprise to us and to the characters that Sandy has switches to RHS, and, after a fabulous ""Summer Nights"" dance number, this discover their newfound romance can continue. Well, in a perfect world that is, and that would not be the case.Danny Doesn't want to risk his astronomical reputation as a bad boy just so he can date some goody-two shoes girl. He provokes her and her friends to impress his, but we can see he doesn't mean what he says. The rest of the pictures involves the two desperately trying to express their love for each other and singing whenever they get the chance.Like many musicals, the exposition is rather slim, while the production values and the performance of the songs are put ,more into focus. This isn't a bad thing, but after a catchy music number returning to mildly interesting setups can be an abrupt, awkward change at first. Thankfully, the film knows how to punctuate its antics.The film's charm mainly comes from Travolta, who delivers energy and dominance in limitless quantities. He seems fully comfortable when he needs to be, mainly during the songs, and totally capable and reliable as the person at the wheel during the scenes in between the singing and dancing. He is only made better by Olivia Newton-John, whose smile and personality go a long way in the picture.As far as films go, this isn't a very great one. It's choppy and so sweet it causes cavities and puts the viewer at risk for diabetes (face it, I like John Waters' Cry-Baby, the even more self-aware parody a bit more than this). As far as musicals go and as far as cheery camp goes, Grease shines through it all, completely showing its viewer just why it has been loved for so many years. It may not have the grand amount of depth I crave when I watch films, but its production values, charismatic leads, and infectious song and dance numbers provide it with enough substantial entertainment value.Starring: John Travolta, Olivia Newton-John, and Stockard Channing. Directed by: Randal Kleiser.",Grease
33,Smells_Like_Cheese,It's only the beginning... Grease IS the word!,8,15 March 2004,"Very possibly the most known musical of all time, Grease is a film that just blew up and knocked everyone out of the ball park with it's catchy tunes, sexy actors and just gave everyone a great time. I've watched this movie since I was a kid, I find it hard to believe that there isn't a person who doesn't at least know one song from this musical even if they hadn't seen it. But I just adored it, played it over and over again because of the songs. I thought the pink ladies were so cool and the T-Birds were so funny. Growing up and watching it again, it does have a different view than that of a child, but I think it holds up well and is still a ton of fun.Danny, a greaser, is a member of the T-Birds who include Kenickie, Doody, Putzie and Sonny. Meanwhile, the Pink Ladies arrive, Rizzo, Frenchie, Jan and Marty. After her parents decided not to return to Australia, Sandy enrolls at Rydell and befriends Frenchy, who considers dropping out of school to become a beautician. Oblivious to each other's presence at school, Danny and Sandy tell the T-Birds and Pink Ladies their respective accounts of events during their brief romance. Learning Danny is Sandy's lover, Rizzo arranges for the two to reunite, but Danny is forced to maintain his bad boy attitude in front of his friends, upsetting Sandy. Now with their love on the rocks, these groups need to drop the attitude and just sing their problems away because ""grease"" is the word.One of the most talked about scenario's is that Sandy supposedly has to change herself in order to be with Danny, enraging a lot of feminists. My look at it is that these two did genuinely love each other, while they shouldn't have cared so much about what their friends thought, they would be willing to do anything for each other in order to be a couple. You even see Danny dressed a little bit more preppy before he sees Sandy in her new transformation.I love the energy that is put into this film, I think that's what makes it so special. Everyone just loves to dance and sing to this movie. How could you resist it? My favorite scene that still gives me chills and gets me up dancing is definitely the school dance scene. Between the dancing the music, then to add the jokes that were made on top of that with Kenickie lifting up the cheerleader's dress to just have fun since she's such a goodie-goodie, was just too funny. My only complaint being about this movie that I still don't get is that Danny starts dancing with Cha Cha when she pulls him away from Sandy, he just keeps going not even thinking about Sandy. One of the things I find so hilarious about this movie also is that the actors who all look like they're in their 30's are playing 17 year old's. But I digress; this movie still holds up today because it just brings a certain happiness to people. It's a wonderful film that anyone could find themselves dancing or singing too.8/10",Grease
34,DKosty123,Broadway Musical Makes It Big With Disco Sounds,7,7 March 2008,"John Travolta, & Olivia Newton-John dominate this film. Everyone else is just a bit player though kudos to Eve Arden who has a nice cameo here even though she was getting pretty long in the tooth when this was made. There are some others who do nice support, but it is clear from the beginning who the big man & woman on campus are in this one.There is a little bit of a side plot about losing virginity which was really a mild plot for 1979. The rest of the film & the main plot is that John & Olivia are in love. If you realize this before watching the film, your better off. There is no rocket science in this movie.This film is a transformation film though. It has elements of the big musicals of the past & the start of the transition to the 1980's style musical. Past musicals have big stages & production numbers. This movie has that. 1980's Musicals have a feel good, put your brain away feeling & light plot. This movie has that too.The disco beat dominates the sound track with Franki Vali warbling the closing theme in dominate fashion. The disco makes sense as Travolta had done Saturday Night Fever shortly before this one. The photography & staging are crisp. The film is the right length that the performance don't get bogged down. Even Travoltas voice is OK doing the songs (unless that is lip sync-hing). This is by far the biggest of the 27 films Randal Kleiser has directed even though he also did Big Top Pee Wee.This is a put your brain away for something light on a Saturday afternoon type of film.",Grease

The rest of the cast are just as great as the two leading characters which brings the film to elevated heights. It's a great film that all movies lovers should watch.The movie has a groovy soundtrack - and well sung by the cast. I still love to listen to the theme song ""Grease"" by Frankie Valli.The Rydell High School seniors will have you in stitches laughing at their shenanigans and comments to one another. But the real focus of the students becomes focused on the budding romance between Danny and Sandy. Rizzo is a bit jealous of Sandy and will try to rip them apart while, Frenchy is more than willing to play cupid to help her best friend Sandy win Danny.A good film to watch when you are in the mood for light-hearted comical romance movie.9/10",Grease
36,Robert_duder,Finally seen the patriarch of modern musicals...and it's the...one that I want,9,25 December 2007,"This is one of my girlfriend's favorite films and yet I have never seen it!! It took me nearly thirty years to sit down and watch it. Grease's pop culture pull is easy to see...I mean I recognized nearly every number, and different scenes that have been re-created or poked fun at, or just been on people's lips. I don't know if that added to the film but I was blown away because Grease is just a blast. I suppose it only stood to reason since Grease single handedly jump started the career of John Travolta and re-started the musical genre for the big screen and is literally a timeless classic. I'm not sure I've ever heard anything bad about it. I found a few very minor things that stopped it from being truly a perfect film and making it not my favorite musical but still incredible and a must see!! The first thing that really turned me sour on the film is the age of the cast. Yes I know, it's a commonly poked fun of thing and some, if not most, of the cast were from the original Broadway show but there is still something disturbing and insulting to the viewers to watch 30 year olds trying to portray High School students. John Travolta and Olivia Newton-John are the only two that come close to pulling it off and they aren't young either in the film.John Travolta plays the timeless Danny Zuko. Cool, suave, rough and tough and having fallen in love over the summer he now has to remain cool in front of his friends when his love shows up at school. Travolta IS Danny Zuko and I'm not sure anyone could ever play Zuko with the same style or pizazz. His dance moves are timeless and flawless and his campy and cool Zuko is dead on. The lovely Olivia Newton-John is Sandy Olsson, Travolta's love interest. She is absolutely perfect as the polar opposite Sandy to Travolta's Greaser Danny. They have amazing chemistry despite their differences and Newton-John has a style and flair for the musical numbers too. She is perfect. Stockard Channing is the fire-y and outspoken Rizzo. Now she is one of the worst when it comes to age...she looks like she's forty (she almost was---34 to be exact) but trying to play eighteen-ish? Still she does the part very well and definitely makes Rizzo the character she is supposed to be...she is just far too old. Jeff Conaway is the trouble making best friend to Travolta's Zuka...Kenickie. Conaway was only 28, a virtual baby compared to some of the cast but he still looks too old. Still he does a decent job of capturing the Greaser style and look. Didi Conn has to be given mention as the adorable and sassy Frenchy. She does a terrific job and it's easy to see why she is so many fans' favorite. The rest of the cast is equally good and they have a great ensemble.The cast is legendary and have become icons because of this film and yet I think this is far more about the musical numbers, the dances and the historical and memorable scenes...""Don't make laugh Sandy ha ha ha."" It was even more fun watching for the first time because it was like seeing history in action. I knew of almost every scene, every dance number, every character just from having people talk about it and scenes from other films references. ""Greased Lightning"", ""The One That I Want"" and ""Summer Lovin'"" were just awesome and I could watch them again and again. The film definitely must have been considered a little racy even for the seventies considering it deals with ""Teen"" Pregnancy, drinking, sex, and some rather vulgar language and sexual references. Director Randal Kleiser never did another musical...before or after Grease and yet was able to create a masterpiece of musical cinema. He has had some great films since and was an icon of the eighties and even though he may have slipped a little since then, he will forever be remembered for creating Grease. If you're a hesitant musical fan, or never seen Grease you MUST!! It will MAKE you a fan and you'll love it and if you are a musical fan who has never seen it...I can't tell you how much you need to see it. Grease is a knock out!! 9/10",Grease
37,ElMaruecan82,Tender Nostalgia of Unlived Times ...,8,3 August 2015,"At a time that confines now to prehistory, when box-office top-tens weren't made of franchises' appointed reboots or frankly disappointing remakes, of Pixar marvels or Marvels pixilation, two school movies could make it in the Top 3 of the highest-grossing movies of the year. From third to first, it was ""Animal House"" and ""Grease"" (for the trivia, ""Superman"" was the second).And these two movies -regarded now as classic- worked because they didn't conflict one to another, each one carried its own spirit and did a damn good job at that. John Landis' ""Animal House"" was set in 1962 but was clearly impregnated by a touch of absurdity and a sense of anarchy, obviously too mature for the very time it depicted, like a raunchy and adult variation of something that was closer tone-wise to George Lucas' 1962 in ""American Graffiti"". Granted the actors were all baby-boomers who lived the real 1962, but it was their 1978 selves acting there, no doubt.Things work in reverse for ""Grease"", it's set only three years earlier, not a huge chronological leap, but it's an obvious over-the-top, fantasized version of the 50's, one that the cast knew as kids or pre-teens and could only re-enact with a tender nostalgia, which is what ""Grease"" is about. There's no way you can watch that ""We Go Together"" sequence at the end without feeling some magical sentiment invading your heart. The only proper description I can give (from a guy born four years after the film) is 'paradoxical nostalgia'. Basically, I feel like I lived at the film's time or the release's time, who said Cinema acted rationally anyway?And the reason, I, and I believe many fans who're from my generation, feel that way is because ""Grease"" plays the cards straightforwardly and doesn't pretend to be anything else than a good old-fashioned romance and a heart-grabbing musical. Does it sound too reducing? Maybe; but then again, how many romances fail? How many musicals were swept-off by the passing of time? It's not easy, and sometimes, you need two strong protagonists to make it work. In the case of ""Grease"", directed by Randal Kleiser (because the director deserves some credit) and I apologize in advance to Olivia Newton-John's fans, I think the film works primarily thanks to John Travolta, who plays Danny Zuko, the cool and handsome T Birds leader.Indeed, if there's anything ""Grease"" did, is to have proved some skeptical minds that Travolta wasn't a one-hit wonder, the hit being his success in ""Saturday Night Fever"", the cocky disco dancer staggering down New York was meant to 'stay alive'. He had the looks, the charisma and just as he knew how to be funny even in a dramatic way, in the case of ""Grease"", he could be serious in a comedic way. Travolta's success wasn't accidental and although he had many ups and downs, he was an actor who could act and move his way out of a good story, so that his persona wouldn't desert the screens forever. Of course, everyone remembers the names of Olivia Newton-John who played Sandy, the sweet and innocent Australian girl falling in love with the bad-boy, macho man and cool greaser, in another take of ""Romeo and Juliet"" meets ""Beauty and the Beast"" myths, as we all remember Stockard Channing as the scene-stealing Pink Sisters' leader Rizzo and  you know, that actress who played Frenchy it gets tougher, now. I know the rest of the cast includes many nice- looking guys and dolls, 2uko's friend, Kelk.. Kell never mind, the torrid 'Cha-cha' (whom I just learned from Wikipedia that she passed away) but also a first-class list of supporting players who, by their sole presence, pay a genuine tribute to the old days : Sid Caesar, Joan Blondell, Frankie Avalon and Eve Arden, to name a fewBut it's Travolta's movie nonetheless. And he might have half of Astaire's dancing talent or half of James Dean's iconic appeal, but both halves makes a 'one' that oddly surpasses these two legends. And it doesn't shine only during the romantic moments, because like I said, it took two things to make '""Grease"" work: a romance and a musical, and I guess the streak of stinkers Travolta had during the 80's was because each time, something lacked. But even when your plot is predictable, all you need are catchy songs and memorable lyrics. ""Grease"" has more than needed, and there's never one moment you feel like skipping. From ""Summer Nights"" to ""Sandra Dee"" from the sweet ""Hopelessly Devoted to You"" to the defining ""You're the One that I Want"" and the final apotheosis of ""Go Together"", every emotion is rewarded, and the fun is always there.""Grease"" made it in both AFI's Romances and Musical List with ""Summer Nights"" in the Top 100 Songs (""The One that I Want"" was unfairly overlooked). The film was the last musical to throne on the box-office and it is the most successful one in history, and almost forty years later, its appeal is undeniable. It might feel laughable in a sort of juvenile naivety whether the two friends pretending to act macho after a hug, the way one gets knocked down by a car door or the whole 'all's well that ends well' finale but it still works. And as I suspect most viewers in 1978 weren't high school kids in 1959; and thankfully, so they couldn't spot the exaggeration, we love the film now for its timeless quality and tender simplicity; one that made the success a series like ""Glee"". That's the power of music, always carrying a personal resonance. Speaking of mine, I remembered spotting during the dance-off the choreography from that Spanish summer hit ""Asereje"" and using Zucco as my first nickname when I started chatting (good old Caramail days). That among many other things.Oh yeah; and it was Didi Conn playing Frenchie (thanks, Wikipedia)",Grease
38,Pjtaylor-96-138044,Guys and dolls.,5,20 January 2021,"'Grease (1978)' is actually really strange, a bizarre mix of songs and high-school drama that doesn't have a proper structure to it. It can't decide if it wants to be campy and surrealistic or straight-forward and sincere. It also doesn't have a strong story, instead simply feeling like a series of independent skits in which its characters bounce between the 'will' and the 'won't' in their 'will they/ won't they?' dynamic. If it's about anything, it's about peer-pressure. The main tension in the focal relationship is the fact that Travolta's Zuko has to hide elements of his personality - including the fact that he actually likes Newton-John's Sandy - simply to sate his narrow-minded friends. Plus, characters are actively encouraged to drink, smoke, change their physical appearance and, even, have unprotected sex. The thing isn't against peer-pressure, though. In fact, it's a huge reason why things 'work out' the way they do. In general, the affair is very flawed. Yet, because it doesn't take itself too seriously (almost feeling like a parody of itself at times) and its song and dance numbers are usually enjoyable, it isn't a terrible experience. It isn't particularly engaging or, even, well-conceived, but it has its moments and it isn't exactly boring, either. It's just about alright. 5/10",Grease
39,g-bodyl,"""Of Course Not, It's Only The Beginning!""",9,1 January 2014,"When it comes to film and musicals, I am not a big fan. I don't know why, but I can't seem to get into musicals. However, Grease is more than just a musical. It's practically the way of life. This film brought back fond memories of my high school days and this film plays a major role in my childhood. As a musical, this film has many foot-tapping rock'n'roll songs that are very good. As a movie, this story doesn't offer anything new, but it's still entertaining and you care about the characters which I find matters most.Randal Kleiser's film starts off with a young couple, Danny and Sandy believing they will never see each other again. But little did they know, Sandy happens to be the new kid at their high school. Will Danny, a member of a gang, will be able to capture the heart of the girl he loves? The acting is pretty good and memorable. John Travolta and Olivia Newton-John have very good singing voices and they know how to rock their hearts out. They are also good actors and this is the film that put them on the map. The rest of the cast led by Stockard Channing ranges from pretty funny and goofy to mildly annoying. Nonetheless, they are important factors in this story as they are the soul to Travolta's/John's heart.Overall, this is a near instant classic thanks to some energizing music. Despite the lack of newness, coming-of-age films always hold a dear spot in my heart and I will always cherish them and this is what makes Grease special. My favorite scene is the ballroom dance scene towards the end. There are some groovy dance moves here and was very entertaining to watch, just like the film itself. I rate this film 9/10.",Grease

And there are some questionable things in this movie I noticed now that I definitely didn't pick up on as a kid. Nevertheless, there's no denying that the toe-tapping, hand-jiving musical numbers are a lot of fun. I also felt wave after wave of nostalgia while watching it. It seems, no matter how much I wish I didn't like Grease, I'm hopelessly devoted to it.",Grease

43,atlasmb,One Of Those Films You Can Watch Over And Over Again,10,22 June 2017,"""Grease"" is one of those films that I can watch over and over--and I do. Set in the doo-wop fifties, it centers on a group of high school seniors who share the joys and concerns of all teenagers: dating, popularity, first love, the unknown future, fitting in, sexual awakening.The two main characters, Danny (John Travolta) and Sandy (Olivia Newton-John) are the primary love story and the core of a great ensemble cast.One of the best things about this film is the music--a string of sing-able fifties-inspired gems that entertain and advance the narrative.There are also plenty of humor, fine dancing, and numerous references to fifties culture.""Saturday Night Fever"" put Travolta on the track to film stardom and ""Grease"" (released the following year) cemented his place among top cinema stars. Both films were co-produced by Robert Stigwood and their soundtracks (On RSO Records)made them huge successes in two genres.""Grease"" is so dense with cultural references and appearances by 50s-era stars, that it takes multiple viewings to appreciate them all. Even Frankie Avalon drops in for a dreamy interlude.",Grease
44,slightlymad22,Grease Will Always Be The Word,10,29 December 2014,"What is there to say about Grease that has not already been said?? Plot In A Paragraph: John Travolta and Olivia Newton John team up in a musical about teens in love in the 50's! It's California, 1959 and bad boy Danny Zuko and Australian good girl Sandy Olsson are in love. They spend time at the beach, but when they go back to school, what either of them don't know is that they both now attend Rydell High. Danny's the leader of the T-Birds, a group of black-jacket greasers while Sandy hangs out with Frenchie and the Pink Ladies, a group of pink-wearing girls led by Rizzo. Who has had a thing ""ancient history"" with Danny in the past. When they first meet up, it isn't exactly like it was over the summer due to social pressures. Can love find away?? When I was a kid I had a massive crush on Olivia Newton John as virgin Sandy and not that keen on her leather clad appearance at the end. Not much has changed. I also still have a crush on Dinah Manoff who played The Pink Lady Marty!! So my taste in women had not changed since I was a kid. Grease is a movie I will always watch. I'm in a good mood I can watch grease, I'm feeling poorly I can watch Grease (doing that reminds me of being poorly with measles, as a kid over Xmas, and I laid and watched Grease. It's a movie I always watched with my late sister as a kid. Brilliant songs, well acted and sung, and almost faultless casting (some people are too old, but that really is nit picking) I love it",Grease
45,sol-,Mixed messages but great songs and choreography,5,14 December 2015,"One of the most well-known and widely celebrated motion picture musicals of all time, there is no questioning how iconic the songs and hairstyles of 'Grease' are. The film benefits from spirited choreography and imaginative costumes, plus the film paints quite a vivid picture of 1950s high school life. All of this flashiness and vigour comes at the expense of good characters and a solid story though. It speaks volumes that Stockard Channing's unwanted pregnancy has more dramatic weight in an elaborate subplot than the 'will they or won't they?' question that hangs over the two leads, both of whom are self-obsessed teens who we could hardly care less about. He is a jerk who only cares about acting cool, and she seems pleasant, but is prepared to change her entire appearance just because he's the one who she wants. So much for feminism! The film does not work that well as a comedy either. Some of the song lyrics are funny, especially the interjections from Travolta's friends during ""Summer Nights"", but there is an absolutely groan-inducing gym training scene in the mix in which Travolta's lack of physical fitness is awkwardly played for laughs, and nothing ever really seems as funny as the opening animated credits. The film certainly suffices as mindless entertainment, but for a musical that spends more time depicting 50s high school life, more time on gags and more time exploring its characters, 'Cry-Baby' is recommended as a worthwhile alternative.",Grease

The film is shot in the manner of an oversized cartoon and the caricatures played out by the cast (Jeff Conaway, Stockard Channing, Didi Conn in particular) are laughable.The music though does grow on you, although it has an artistic value of about -100.  Everyone knows ""Summer Nights"", ""Greased Lightning"", ""You're The One That I Want"", and ""Hopelessly Devoted to You"", although personally I like the wit of ""Look at me, I'm Sandra Dee"" (often omitted from TV showings of the film), ""Beauty School Dropout"" (drippily sung by former teen idol Frankie Avalon).Movie old timers Eve Arden, Sid Caesar, and Joan Blondell (her last film) are in the cast, and add a lot to the proceedings.

48,TheMovieDiorama,Grease still is the word.,7,6 June 2019,"Well, I certainly got chills after this first time watch, pretty sure they were multiplying. Oh, and I most definitely was losing control. Mostly because of the power this musical was supplying. Gosh darn it, t'was electrifying!...""You better shape up. Do-do-doooo""! Alright alright, I'll stop there. Cited as one of the most popular musicals of all time, and my mother's favourite sing-song marathon, I had to give it a watch. Remember, me no likey musicals...much. Surprisingly, the unapologetic good time vibes this film holds is just something else. I couldn't help but tap my feet and do my best Newton-John impression whilst dancing like Travolta. Greaser Danny Zuko and Aussie darlin' Sandy Olsson fell in love one summer at a beach. The season ends and school starts, only to find that Zuko has to uphold a ""cool guy"" image to which Sandy dislikes.Cue ""Hopelessly Devoted to You""! Or was it ""Look at Me, I'm Sandra Dee""? Hang on, I've got it. Bring on ""Summer Nights"". Aside from the three big showstoppers that everyone and their dog still sing today, the majority of songs escaped my life. Yet, just after one viewing, I can pretty much recite them all. Heck, even the fantastically surreal ""Beauty School Dropout"". It's a testament to the original musical's songs and the stunning vocals of Newton-John and Travolta. ""Harmoniously Devoted to Getting No. 1s"" more like. Kleiser presents them with a barrage of colour, flamboyancy and well orchestrated dance routines to get the audience jiving and kicking. The frequency to which these performances are embedded into the narrative were well paced, despite the slower and less memorable second act.What really tickled my ""Greased Lightnin"" (you can have that one!) was 70s Hollywood interpreting a 50s high school musical. Not uncommon at the time, but its style and energetic approach gives it a sense of timelessness and infectious aura. The costumes, the Elvis Presley swagger and the constant combing of the greased back hair. Definitely had a ""Whole Lotta Shakin' Goin' On""! Travolta consistently dominated the screen. Even when the angelic Newton-John was sharing the screen, who's acting was mediocre at best, he would simply move his hips and put everyone in a trance. Undeniable star power. The acting in general was fairly sporadic, with no real standouts in either the T-Bird or Pink Lady gangs.But my biggest complaint is with Sandy's character. For someone like Danny to treat her so poorly when in front of everyone, just to maintain a public image that actually comes across as egotistical, only for her to then change herself to try and win him over. It felt wrong. I wasn't entirely invested in these two as love birds because of how negligently they were written. Change yourself to win the other person over? No. I don't buy it. It may have been passable back in the 70s but doesn't sit right with me today.So aside from them two as characters, Grease was a blast. The soundtrack reigning supreme with a multitude of excitingly choreographed scenes to accompany them, allows many of the technical flaws to be forgiven. It's a fun, rock n' rolling time that it ""happened so fast"". Last one, I promise...",Grease

The performances are hit and miss. Most of the time the acting is too broad, too cartoonish. My favorite part of the movie is the school dance scene. The dance contest is actually very exciting to watch but the ""Hand Jive"" song's lyrics are kind of silly. I don't watch ""Grease"" that often because it's just too dumb.

None of the actors could mime their songs properly; in fact everybody, especially Stockard Channing, seemed as though they would rather be anywhere other than where they were.

53,l_rawjalaurence,Quite Simply Critic-Proof,8,27 August 2013,"There are some films that are quite simply critic-proof: GREASE is one of these. Forget the flat filming style (by Randal Kleiser) and the fact that the Rydale High students seem way too mature - we should just sit back and enjoy the songs, color, movement and sheer energy of the film. John Travolta's Danny is both arrogant yet touching; someone willing to show bravado in front of his male buddies, yet extremely weak when it comes to showing off his emotions. His body movements are a joy to watch - especially during the sequence where he presents Sandy (Olivia Newton- John) with a cheap ring and asks her to marry him. Newton-John is especially good as a Doris Day/ Sandra Dee-type figure who cannot quite understand why Danny should behave so differently in front of his buddies. Stockard Channing's Rizzo quite simply steals the show; she cultivates a hard-boiled exterior (her real name in the film is Betty), yet cannot cover up an essential vulnerability, especially when she thinks that she is pregnant. GREASE also contains a clutch of memorable cameos from television and film old-timers, from Sid Caesar's Coach Calhoun to Eve Arden's Principal McGee, to Joan Blondell's Vi. In short, there is something in this film for absolutely everyone, regardless of their age and/or cinematic tastes.",Grease

55,Vartiainen,Tale as old as the 20th century,7,30 June 2017,"Starring John Travolta and Olivia Newton-John, this musical from the late 70s will take you right back to the 50s, when boys were boys, girls were girls and having a car actually meant something. Is it dated? Yes, but in a loving manner.Danny (Travolta) and Sandy (Newton-John) separate after a summer romance, believing that they will probably never see one another again. Then they find out that they're attending the same high school and that Danny has not been as straightforward about his personality as he probably should have been. It turns out he's a greaser and while in the presence of his friends about as misogynistic and old-fashioned as a redneck from 1800s. Yet he still loves Sandy, so what are they to do?This is a fun musical. Both the main leads are unbelievably charismatic, despite Newton-John being thirty years old - yeah, I find it hard to believe as well - and even Travolta being well over twenty. But they make up for it in chemistry, great song numbers and good old-fashioned charm. The music is also great. Greased Lightnin', Summer Nights and You're the One That I Want defined a whole generation. Sure, not all of them, like Beauty School Dropout, are all that memorable and some, like Summer Nights, contain somewhat sexist lyrics, but overall the songs are great and the whole film has this energy to it.Grease defines the word fun. It's a high energy blast that is the perfect watch for all teenagers alike. Just remember that it was made in the 70s.",Grease

Sure, in 1978, when the movie first came out, it was one of the best of its kind. I watch it now, skipping most of the musical numbers, and I enjoy it, but I have found a lot better movies to spend my time watching.This movie is a movie-musical, filled with so many songs. This movie is based in 1959, and it's about young love. Sandy and Danny met during the Summer and just happened to be going to the same school, Rydell High. Danny is the leader of the T-Birds, a group of leather jacket grease monkeys, or greasers, what ever you'd call them. While Sandy hangs out with the pink-wearing girls of the Pink Ladies. Danny turns out to be a different guy than he was on the beach during Summer vacation, but eventually, they all try to get along and throughout the movie, they all change in big ways. Overall, I give this movie a 5 out of 10, which in my ratings book is: Okay.",Grease

The story is about two teenagers named Sandy and Danny(played by John Travolta and Olivia Newton John) who meet one summer during school break and fall in love. But surprise surprise they lose each other and never see each other again. Fast forward now and Danny and his mates are goofing around and guess who is starting his school why its Sandy of course who is originally from Sydney Austrailia and just moved to the states so she befriends the Pink Ladies which is owned by Stockard Channing's charcther.So when Sandy and Danny bump into each other Sandy gets upset because Danny was acting like a jerk to her as his a real swagger and appears to be a very cocky person. So will they won't they get together,you have to find out.Bottom line I grew up watching this as a kid back in the 90s(despite the fact this film has been out since 1978)and I knew all the songs once they showed up and all and all its a feel good musical. My favourite song in the movie has to be Your The One That I Want where Danny sees Sandy in the end all done up and Danny is shocked to see the new Sandy Dee sporting tight leather pants.If you love musicals and you like John Travolta or any of the cast then check it out.

In ""Grease"", this movie is totally filled with classic nostalgia. Based on a hit play, and casted with the best stars, this movie will get you on your feet faster than a drag race on the streets. Olivia Newton-John plays Sandy, a beautiful Aussie chick who meets a greaser named Danny, played by John Travolta(Vinnie Barbarino on ""Welcome Back, Kotter""). These two have the funnest summer of their lives, and when that ends, oh well. Or so it is. When it's senior year, Danny gets the shock of his life, Sandy is going to his high school! Now Sandy's the nice girl, and Danny's the bad-boy, who said opposites don't attract? The good part of the movie is when that Danny gets the Greased Lightning to run, and the crew put on the show about it. It's a winner!The really good part is the music. Everyone was really put it on.

Here it's the music and singing and dancing that matters, nothing else. If you want serious drama, this movie is not for you, but if you want a musical, you've come to the right place.

61,barnabyrudge,"Wafer thin plot, but still a blast thanks to energy, exuberance and toe-tapping musical numbers.",9,1 May 2013,"Grease, like a fine wine, has grown with age. It was a phenomenally successful film in its time but its commercial popularity was not equalled by its critical reception. Not that contemporary critics were especially negative towards it, more that they approved it with blandly above average reviews. To be sure, the plot of Grease is wafer thin and its narrative borders on non-existent between the musical set pieces.. However, it is a film which transcends the basic requirements of strong plot and narrative. It's about joyous set pieces. It's about goofy characters, interacting via goofy dialogue. It's about nostalgia. It's about awkward teen courtship. It's about those last days of high school where the joy of being young is ever-so-slightly tarnished by the encroaching end of one's educational era. The final scene of John Travolta and Olivia Newton John driving off into the sky in a flying car roots the film in a dreamy nostalgic/retrospective landscape, reminding us that we've been watching a fun musical fantasy, nothing more. In terms of achieving its goals – entertaining the audience, rocking us out, and putting a smile on our face – Grease does exactly what it says on the tin.It's the start of a new school year at Rydell High, and T-Bird gang member Danny Zuko (John Travolta) enthusiastically tells his friends about a summer romance that he has enjoyed during the holidays. Unbeknown to him, his summer sweetheart Sandy (Olivia Newton John), has not returned to Australia as expected but, in fact, has enrolled at the same high school, where she relates her amazing summer of love with Danny to her new classmates. When they eventually run into each other, Danny can't bring himself to be his true self in front of his friends. Embarrassed by his gushing sentiments, his genuine feelings for Sandy, he treats her off-handedly, cruelly even, and it seems impossible that they will ever rediscover their magical connection. Throughout the continuing story of Danny and Sandy's difficult on/off romance, we also follow the exploits of the other characters in their circle – the risqué relationship between Kenickie (Jeff Conaway) and Rizzo (Stockard Channing); the rivalry between the T-Birds and another gang, the Scorpions, culminating in a classic car race; an impending dance contest at Rydell; and the final graduation (and goodbyes) of each of the gang.What makes Grease work above everything else is the charm, enthusiasm and energy with which it is presented. There's a sense of everyone pulling in the same direction, entering into the spirit of things in a manner that becomes immediately infectious. The characters are at once lovable and identifiable; their actions and reactions cleverly tuned into real people and real feelings, but dressed up in a joyous musical approach. The musical set pieces are very well done indeed – all the songs pretty much deliver, getting the audience toe-tapping in spite of themselves. Best of all is the sensational closing number, You're The One That I Want, brilliantly choreographed against a fairground backdrop, and featuring Newton John shedding her bookish image and wooing Danny in cinema's most infamous tight leather pants. Performance-wise the film is generally pretty good. Travolta and Newton John have a lovely chemistry, even if their characters are a mite too broadly painted at times. Channing is fabulous as the scene-stealing Rizzo, and Eve Arden has some moments of pure comedic gold as the disapproving school principal Miss McGee. Enduringly popular, always fresh and fun to watch, and a real sing-along favourite, Grease is vastly entertaining if nothing else. Yes, its narrative meanders without much direction at times, but Grease is still a blast.",Grease

65,slokes,High School Was Never Like This...Too Bad,8,31 May 2016,"A jukebox musical that redefined its genre and has lasted well beyond all expectations, ""Grease"" is easy to dismiss on the basis of its simplistic story and characterizations that never rise above stereotypes. But it is also a galvanizing entertainment that works.Danny (John Travolta) and Sandy (Olivia Newton-John) are high-school kids who meet at the beach one summer, not knowing that they will be seeing a lot more of each other next fall at Rydell High School. Danny runs with a tough crowd, while Sandy is a sweet and wholesome girl whose affections threaten to hold him down and make him look weak in front of his pals.""I got this image, right?"" he tells her. Like many high schoolers, the characters in ""Grease"" are all about their image, only few ever looked as good worrying about it as these guys do. The unlikely triumph that is ""Grease"" is often ascribed to its soundtrack, which includes a number of recognizable hits still familiar nearly 40 years after the movie's release. But the film's place as a cult favorite is as attributable to two other, related things: tone and balance.Director Randal Kleiser took a fairly rough and raunchy Broadway musical and reinvented it as a paean for Hollywood nostalgia. An opening cartoon, primitively animated, effectively sets up the rest of the film as a gaudy, goofy take on growing up, with plenty of sex jokes that somehow manage to maintain an overarching aura of innocence. Serious topics are introduced, but in a way that never drags down the light tone.The musical numbers are the highlights, mostly ensemble pieces that include two of its biggest hits, the opening ""Summer Nights"" and the closing ""You're The One That I Want,"" both staged with the kind of lavish choreography and tight camera-work that rewards multiple viewings. Kleiser favors long mid-shots with sharp cuts, which works because there's a lot going on and the syncopation is what sells it.Yet for the purposes of emotional investment, the two best numbers, surprisingly, are solo ballads: Travolta's ""Sandy"" and ""There Are Worse Things I Can Do,"" sung by the school's make-out queen, Rizzo (Stockard Channing), both of which achieve an intimacy that gives ""Grease"" a kind of power. I get a lump in my throat whenever I watch a hot dog jump into a bun in the former number that has nothing to do with the double entendre involved.The dialogue, by producer Allan Carr and Bronte Woodard, offers pretty silly banter in place of story for the most part, yet like the songs it keeps the energy moving and the energy light. ""Grease"" is motion, like the Frankie Valli song says, and that's what you get.Even the dead-end scenes that clog the film's middle, regarding a pep rally for a big football game we never see and Danny's varsity sports tryouts only referenced briefly again at the end, don't tax your viewing patience. You enjoy the changes of pace while the scenery is being moved offstage for the next big number. ""Grease"" captures a sense of being young, with its heady enthusiasm and eagerness to please. It's a shame the formula seems so difficult to repeat.",Grease
66,gcd70,What a drag,3,29 May 2007,"This huge hit from 1978 is a rather silly, occasionally funny comedy-musical about high school life and love in the fifties. Randall Kleiser's film has enjoyed several revivals and still holds a baffling cult status today.The acting from John Travolta, Olivia Newton-John, Stockard Channing and support is painful, even if the dancing is, along with the music, quite good. The disco soundtrack featured some huge hits and may have been this movie's saving grace.Watching ""Grease"" for a painful third time, I almost walked out. I could not wait for it to finish. Musicals just aren't my thing.Monday, June 10, 1991 - Golden Twin Cinema, Bendigo",Grease
67,EUyeshima,Nostalgic Nostalgia Fest Maintains Its Superficial Bounce,6,24 January 2007,"It's hard to think of a bigger slice of 1970's Hollywood kitsch than this candy-coated, mega-successful 1978 musical comedy. Capitalizing on the tidal wave of Eisenhower-era nostalgia pervasive on both big and small screens at the time, it manages to be stridently artificial and mindlessly entertaining at the same time, although it still boggles the mind that it has had such an afterlife, including sing-along versions playing at art-house movie theaters. Part of the ironic amusement is watching actors obviously in their late twenties and early thirties pretending to be teenagers. Credit should be given to director Randal Kleiser for his unapologetic stance on maneuvering the contrived silliness with spirit if not much finesse.Set in a period of the 1950's that existed only in Hollywood and lacking any semblance of reality or dramatic conflict, the threadbare plot focuses on greaser Danny, the cool leader of the T-Birds, and wholesome Sandy, a good-girl Aussie blonde enjoying a summer romance on the beach prior to senior year at Rydell High. Sandy was supposed to move back to Australia, but she ends up staying stateside and attending Rydell. With image being of the utmost importance, Danny initially rejects Sandy - now a cheerleader - when they meet again, and we follow all their romantic complications over the course of the school year until graduation. There is also the ongoing power struggle between the T-Birds and the rival gang, the Scorpions, as well as the peer-pressure shenanigans caused by the T-Birds' girlfriends, the Pink Ladies, headed by sleep-around tart, Rizzo.All of this merely provides an excuse for the various musical numbers, the most energetic being the ensemble pieces like the cleverly edited ""Summer Nights"" and the stylized ""Jailhouse Rock"" knock-off, ""Greased Lightning"". Most of the numbers are from the Broadway show, though there are some deliberately anachronistic insertions such as Barry Gibb's disco-accented title tune and the peppy funhouse duet, ""You're the One That I Want"". John Travolta is perfectly cast as Danny, even if his singing voice threatens to evaporate from his sincerity. Olivia Newton-John has the right manner and looks for Sandy, though she is hardly challenged to develop a compelling character here.The standout is Stockard Channing as Rizzo, the only character that has any connection to the reality of the times, and she expertly sings the mocking ""Look at Me, I'm Sandra Dee"" and frankly outdoes Newton-John on the touching ""There Are Worse Things I Could Do"". Several familiar faces fill out the cast - Eve Arden in Miss Brooks mode as Principal McGee, Sid Caesar rather constrained as Coach Calhoun, Joan Blondell equally pallid as malt shop waitress Vi, Edd Byrnes as a Dick Clark-type lothario, Alice Ghostley as the auto shop teacher, Dody Goodman as the ditzy school administrator, and of course, Frankie Avalon serenading ""Beauty School Dropout"" to squeaky-voiced Didi Conn's Frenchy.Serious examination of the film is useless since it is more a cheery variety show with superficial references to the sexual politics of the 1950's. The new 2006 ""Rockin' Rydell Edition"" DVD package comes with extras that should satisfy fans. There is an insightful commentary track by Kleiser and choreographer Patricia Birch; eleven minutes worth of deleted scenes in black-and-white; a nostalgic ""Grease Day"" featurette that contains interviews with Travolta, Newton-John and producers Allen Carr and Robert Stigwood; and coverage of the 25th Anniversary DVD launch party, which includes spirited performances by Newton-John, Travolta and the remaining cast.",Grease
68,adamjohns-42575,Classic yet new.,10,14 April 2021,"This film has an X-Factor, a certain something that just makes it brilliant for all ages. It's a 1978 film about the 50's that still manages to have the production values and likeability of a film made today.The cast is superb. How does John Travolta manage to keep those hips from moving when he's not dancing, surely they have a life of their own? My God he was gorgeous back then. And Jeff Conaway as Kenickie can get me pregnant any time he wants. The supporting cast of the T-Birds and The Pink Ladies are all brilliantly selected too. My only concern really is Olivia Newton-John who's just a bit stiff with some of her lines sometimes, but her singing is glorious. I still want to go out as her one New Year's Eve in that black number at the end of the film, but I doubt I could get my hair to look that good.Personally I am hugely jealous that I have never had that much hair to style like John and Jeff and I can only dream of having the co-ordination to 'Hand Jive' (That's not a euphemism). That scene is just amazingly well choreographed and a joy to watch.The final scenes are brilliant too, you can't help but feel positively about a film that leaves you on such a high note with 'Summer Nights' closely followed by 'We Go Together'.It's full of laughs, romance and just good old fashioned heart.I do find it funny to watch this film and think back to when I was younger imagining that I would be a bit like Sandra Dee one day, but realising that I'm much more like Rizzo, at least I used to be, now I'm more of a Jan.I'm just in awe of this film. There are very few out there that can continually bring the fun on repeat without getting tired and this is one of them.

As she would hang out with the female version of the T-Birds, Pink Ladies led by Rizzo(Stockard Channing)! Danny tries to maintain his bad boy image which offends good gal Sandy. But he tries to reconcile with her, but all attempts fail. But Sandy realizes that she needs to change her own good gal style. To fit Danny's bad boy image with the help of her friend Frenchie(Didi Conn in a brilliant supporting role).The soundtrack rocks and the supporting cast of the late Jeff Conway, Channing, and others really proves that this movie as it is over thirty-five years old, will reach a new generation of viewers.This is the one movie everybody has to see!

71,triple8,Still great after all these years...,10,4 December 2003,"Perhaps I'm not going to be completely objective but I love this movie! It's one of those movies I saw when I was young that I still watch whenever I can. For some reason this movie never gets overplayed. It's almost as great now, as when I first saw it.How does this movie stay so timeless? Grease is a classic that is still so refreshingly GREAT after all these years. I don't know how the movie does it but it somehow manages to remain timeless. The movie is so effortlessly bouncy and so filled with great music that you can't help but never get tired of it.The music is a favorite of mine as well or at least some of it. I've never seen Grease two nor do I have any desire to. But this movie remains one of top ones. I can't say much negative about Grease as I grew up with it, cheerfully admit to owning (and loving) the soundtrack, and watch it whenever it's on television so I can treat myself to yet another viewing. I will say that if I were to voice one negative it would be the transformation of Sandy at the end, which though it was rather fun to watch, does send rather the wrong message at the end. However this movie is so campy that I never really took the story all that seriously anyway since it's almost satirical at times. And honestly the story is not what makes this great, it's the music, dancing and characters themselves.Grease is, to me, a wonderful production. I never ever get tired of the incredible array of songs. It's appealing on so many different levels. It's upbeat, bouncy, a great friendship movie, a great movie to grow up with, and a great overall musical. It probably wont appeal to people who don't like any of the songs and it's also best, when watching it, not to take it to seriously. See it for the great music, wonderful dancing and unforgettable characters. It also never gets old. Ever. And I will say every time it's viewed it's as good or almost so, as the first time-and how many movies can one say that about?Grease will never win the award for deepest picture but that's OK. It is one of the FUN pictures ever made and is one of the ultimate ""guilty pleasure type movies"" . I have to say 10 out of 10.",Grease
72,Spleen,Inexplicable,6,7 February 2003,"Why THIS? Why is THIS, of all musicals, so popular?And why was THIS film re-released all over the world - in mainstream cinemas that were unwilling to touch even ""Apocaypse Now Redux"", no less - rather than some other musical of the 1970s? (I presume ""Grease"" appeals primarily to people for whom cinematic history begins in the 1970s, otherwise the question of why not some other musical becomes even more perplexing.)  Why not ""Scrooge""? ""Fiddler on the Roof""? ""Jesus Christ Superstar""? ""The Slipper and the Rose""? I'll admit I haven't seen those last two, but that's partly the point - I'd LIKE to see them, whereas ""Grease"" is the kind of thing I watch either because of a compulsive behaviour disorder or out of duty, to see if this time around I'll get to find out what makes it so popular.No luck so far. I'll admit it's mediocre, no worse, but it leaves a nasty taste in the mouth. In the course of the whole we-made-it-up-as-we-went-along narrative none of the characters, with the possible exception of two of the Pink Ladies, demonstrates that he or she has a soul, or any of the standard mechanics that make up a human being: beliefs, desires, passions, and so forth. The shallowness goes beyond the fact that the characters are shallow. The characters aren't even really THERE; the film comes across as a circus, a revue, something to enable the songs to be strung together. Each song, considered by itself, sounds as though it's expressing something (which is why the early songs, particularly ""Summer Love"", work best), but this usually turns out to have been an illusion. The unpleasant undercurrent of cruelty is probably accidental. The aggressive barrage of sexual references (it might have come across as playful, but it doesn't) probably isn't, although I'm amused at all the people who pride themselves on being able to play Freud with ""Greased Lightning"", almost the only five-minute sequence that ISN'T sexual.Someone here said, of ""Grease"", that it dates from the era when people knew how to make musicals, when the song-and-dance routines exhibited real performing talent and energy. And so it does; but it comes from the very end of that era. It's the dying gasp. Vey often we can see THAT the performers are energetic, but a sustained display never quite makes it onto the screen. Part of the problem is sonic. The songs, never the best, have been shockingly recorded; listen to ""Sandra Dee"" with your eyes shut, and you can't fail to notice that the words sound thin and the music even thinner, and the voices in ""Greased Lightning"" (which has been ineptly staged) vanish into no particular musical texture even if you keep your eyes open and TRY not to notice.",Grease

74,justin-fencsak,40 years later it's still the word!!!,9,24 May 2018,"When Grease first came out on the same day as Jaws 2 nearly 40 years ago, it broke records for a big budget musical on opening weekend at the box office yet it landed in 2nd place to the shark sequel. Luckily, Grease went on to become the most profitable film of that year and became the most popular musical film of all time, a record that it broke from Sound of Music which has been broken by Chicago (Oscar winner for best picture), and Disney's live action remake of Beauty and the Beast. A sequel was soon comissioned in 1982, and sadly it didn't do well as it was released on the same day as E.T. That year, Grease would come out on home video for the first time, with some minor changes from the theatrical release. In 1998, the film was reissued in a heavily remixed and digitally restored 35mm print to moderate success. It was also the first time that the movie was on DVD and then Blu-Ray. Thankfully this year, Paramount has gone back to the original 35mm negatives and the 70mm six track 4.2 audio to create the definitve Grease experience, which is now available on Itunes as well as DVD, Bluray, and 4k bluray. As for the movie itself, it's a classic. Based on a musical that ran on broadway and continued to run even when the movie was still in theatres, this movie tells the love story of two high school lovers in 1950s america. Both Olivia Newton John and John Travolta shine as well as Didi Cohn and others. Even though the movie is rated PG it's more aimed at teens than kids.",Grease

Some critics called the sets ""cheap"" and the story ""childish"" but the movie-going public knew better. Severely cleaned up from the Broadway Musical Version, it boasts several songs custom-written for ONJ by her favorite tunesmith, John Farrar. Great personalities from the old 1950's include Eve Arden, Sid Caesar, Edd Byrnes, Frankie Avalon, and Joan Blondell. ""Title opening song sung by Frankie Vallie. The Greasers and their gals were not as clean-cut in real life as they are portrayed in this film. I remember ""rumbles"" with knives, but in those days, nobody ever brought guns to school.

The ""graduation carnival"" ending is really well-done. Yes, OLJ was sewed ""into her pants"" when she ""comes out as a Greaser"" in the song ""You'll the One That I Want"". The songs ""I'm Sandra Dee"", ""Greased Lightnin"" and ""Hand Jive"" are often edited for content and lyrics on broadcast TV and cable.

Of course, realism is never the point in a musical; the point is romance and fantasy and looking a something in a new way. It has always amazed me that science fiction fans can believe almost anything-walking on Mars, invaders from Venus-but they cannot believe a simple romantic fantasy. The title song, performed by Frankie Valli is a signature song of the last half of the 20th century. This movie represents in one very special way a stretch of Hollywood history that seems pretty obscure in the 21st century. Joan Blondell appears in this film as a sympathetic waitress; keep in mind this is the actress who delivered ""Remember My Forgotten Man"" Gold Diggers of 1933. ""Beauty School Drop-Out"" with Frankie Avalon is memorable, as is film legend Eve Arden as the clueless principal delivering the line, ""If you can't be an athlete, be an athletic supporter."" Grease is the musical that sums up the repressive, nasty, ignorant, terrific 1950s. There was also a Grease 2 four years later, which you will want to check out if ""Grease"" does it for you, but it was generally panned. Arguably John Travolta is the best all-around actor-singer-dancer of the last half of the 20th century. ---from Musicals on the Silver Screen, American Library Association, 2013",Grease

79,blott2319-1,"Toe-tapping fun, until the plot starts",4,13 March 2020,"Coming of age movies in high school are often a tough sell for me. They have to include characters that I connect with on a deeper level in order for me to enjoy them. Grease is overloaded with characters I find obnoxious and annoying. These are all the ""cool"" kids who value how their friends see them over being a good person. What infuriates me even more is that the film seems to think that Danny is correct for not wanting to be real, and that Sandy should change her entire personality so she's cool enough to be with him. The other plots aren't any better, including a pregnancy scare, and a girl who is too dumb for beauty school (yet somehow she will be able to handle high school.) Also, I just have to mention, I hate that the only intelligent person in the film is presented as a stereotypical nerd and is mocked mercilessly.It's just too bad that the music is so darn fun. I want to hate everything about Grease, but I can't help singing along. I love a good musical, but it's rare for me to enjoy the music in one so much more than the plot itself. Even the choreography and sets for the songs all accentuate the playful joy of the music. This is why Grease is a soundtrack that I own, but a movie that I never wanted to own. It's a shame because there are great scenes built around the songs, and yet they have to combine it with all this terrible plot in between. It also makes rating and ranking Grease a nightmare. Within any given 15 minutes of the movie there are at least a few minutes where I'm having a good time, so I should rate the whole thing highly. Yet, so much of what I like about movies is the plot, and this is a plot I'd rather never see again.

Watching this movie brought back memories of just what happened in American high schools around the 50's and some. We are reminded of how much we knew and didn't know and the nagging thought decades later of how much more we could have done and didn't because we didn't know. The characters bring it all to life imitating what was going on at that time and making fun of it. The actors had a good time doing this movie making the viewers catch the afterglow of it all. Enjoy the songs which become not only memorable but sing-able too. Who hasn't sang at least one of them? Be honest here!

81,one9eighty,Grease is the word - which is never actually heard.,9,5 January 2021,"The film is set in 1950's and features the trials and tribulations of kids at Rydell High school. While enjoying a summer holiday at the beach, Australian immigrant Sandy Olsen (Olivia Newton-John) meets and falls for Danny Zuko (John Travolta), leader of the school's greaser gang known as the T-Birds. They enjoy a summer romance but at the end of the holidays Sandy announces that her family are due to move back to Australia so it's the end of their affair. When term starts, Sandy's family have changed their plans and she is enrolled in Rydell school. At school she makes friends with a group of greaser girls, the ""Pink Ladies"". They teach her the truth of her summer romance when they arrange for her to bump into Danny - he'd been leading a double life as Sandy's summer romance, and a term time greaser that's ""too cool for school"". Realising he's fallen for Sandy; Danny tries to change his way's while maintaining his cool. When he fears it isn't working, he gives up and gets roped into a drag race for his gang. This coincides with Sandy wanting to change for Danny, trying to ditch her 'square' life to be cooler for him. While everything is going on there are sub-plots that the supporting characters are involved in, there are songs and dance routines, there's a televised national dance competition, plenty of fun, excitement, danger and action too! With the end of term coming up with the climax of the film, everything needs to be wrapped up before then though.This film is clunky, it is cheesy, it is camp, and its kitsch - but it is absolutely brilliant too! The acting might not be brilliant, but it's not meant to be, and yes, those 20- and 30-year olds are pretending to be teenagers (Casing point, Stockard Channing was 32 years old and playing a 17-year-old). The film is jam packed with fantastical musical numbers that will stay with you. In fact, it is the musical numbers that hold the film together as there are parts in the plot that make absolutely no sense at all, but you just have to give it up as it is all just fantasy. In fact, don't try to read too much into it or take any deep and philosophical meaning from the film, just enjoy the show. If you started to read into it, you'd believe the film is telling young girls to become a little sluttier and forget their inhibitions to get the cool guys. But if you start to read into things like that you might as well read the conspiracy theories too and wonder to yourself whether the events of the film are all actually a death dream and Sandy died on her summer holiday, or that maybe Danny is in a coma after doing something stupid on his holiday getaway. Think about it a little, that might even explain the flying car finale! For now, let's leave the tin foil hats locked up shall we :DI pray that this film is never remade because it wouldn't do justice to what this 1978 films brings us. There is a sequel to ""Grease"", but we don't talk about that in my household. There should have been two sequels, but ""Grease 2"" bombed that badly that the third film was completely forgotten about. I highly recommend this fun musical film and it truly deserves its status as a cult classic. If you haven't watched this, give it a go. If you have seen this but have a spare hour and half to kill - still watch this. Some films get called iconic and legendary too quickly and with time they face - with ""Grease"" that is not the case. It is still one of the top ten live-action musical films of all time. It has a World-Wide fan base that love it and adore it. I bloody love Grease and agree that ""Grease"" IS ""the word"" - although, for the record, it is not said once at all in the entire film!!",Grease
82,CitizenCaine,Grease Was The Word Then,7,25 September 2009,"Grease followed Saturday Night Fever as one of the films of the seventies that contained a soundtrack specifically orchestrated to sell records and the movie of course. Some songs were dropped and added/changed in order to capitalize on the use of Olivia Newton-John, who was hot stuff at the time. John Travolta, who was becoming a star in Saturday Night Fever, was cast as her counterpart in this ode to 1950's nostalgia. They have a summer romance, recapitulated in the song ""Summer Nights"". Eventually they bump in to each other at Rydell (reference to idol Bobby) High School. Here the typical teenage romance is played out while the lead characters are surrounded by a strong supporting cast, especially Stockard Channing as Rizzo and Didi Conn as Frenchy. Along the way, the cast is peppered with several faces from the past, including Sha Na Na as the musical group in the gym, Frankie Avalon as the teen angel (yikes!), Eve Arden as Principal McGee, Sid Caesar as Coach Calhoun, Edd Byrnes as the perverted Vince Fontaine, and old stalwart Joan Blondell as the diner's waitress Vi.The film is an odd blend of 1950's nostalgia and 1970's production values, a clash between the squeaky clean era it depicts and the racy touches placed on it by the era it was made in. The slick production numbers make the film seem much better than it really is. The Oscar-nominated ballad ""Hopelessly Devoted To You"" was a huge hit but seems out of place a bit with its arrangement for the era, just like the disco-flavored title song by Frankie Avalon. All of this aside, the film is an incredibly shallow depiction of teenagers and comes off as very campy (due to the advanced ages of the cast members playing teenagers), silly, and superficial. ""You're The One That I Want"" is one of those songs from the film that radio beat to death to the point where you ran from any room when it came on. It was a summer of 1978 meg-a-hit after repeat viewings were in vogue the year before with Star Wars. The undeniable energy of the film makes it endure nevertheless, despite it's simplistic views and misguided message. *** of 4 stars.",Grease

Adding to that, the fact that I could really not feel for any of the characters or identify with them does not make it better. A bit of bun shaking by Newton John (or Travolta if you're a girl) does not make up for the lack of story and depth. Plus I've seen the 50's characterized better and cooler in Roadracers by Robert Rodriguez. If you like Rock and Roll watch Roadracers, if you like Grease and schmaltz watch this one.

I LOOVVEEE GRRREEEEEAASSEE! I give it a true 10 out of 10 for it is a masterpiece. The national dance off is the best part with Sandy and Danny, unless the end is.GREASE ROCKS! FOREVER!",Grease
85,eminkl,"It's a delight to watch, still 20 years after it first appeared on the screen",7,11 December 2019,"Grease was a big hit and the musical remains one of its kind's most popular movies. After the Grease and Saturday Night Fever pair came out, John Travolta was catapulted to the top shelf of fame, and hiseasy to see why-the guy is charming, can sing well and has the gestures. Grease boasts what all successful movie musicals have: fun actors, an easy but not insignificant plot, and lots of enjoyable music. Undoubtedly, familiarity with the soundtrack is one of the reasons for the success of the film-several of the songs have reached pop hit status. Grease works in the 1950s as a musical, comedy, a light romance, and a gentle satire of adolescent life.It's a delight to watch, still 20 years after it first appeared on the screen, partially because of its enduring high spirits. If you enjoy musicals, Grease is a great movie, even though it's decades old-nothing has changed over time, and the movie is as entertaining today as it was in 1978.",Grease
86,The_Movie_Cat,"""Rizzo! Genoffathatthiganoffashun!""",8,10 July 2000,"I was amazed to find that, at date of writing, Grease had scored less than an average 7 with IMDb voters. Surely this film is a classic, an iconographic representation of an age? That is, not the 50s, but the 70s, where filmmakers were becoming more knowing. Grease stands as the greatest of all film musicals as, while possessing the requisite laughs, character, romance and song; it is also ironic and self-aware, which puts it way ahead of turgid and dated bores like ""Carousel"" and ""South Pacific"".Of course, we've seen it a million times now, so there's really not a lot left to say. We can still thrill to Travolta and Olivia Newton-John, she the better singer, he the better dancer, neither of them terribly good as actors. We can still be amazed that Stockard Channing as Rizzo never really took off after this film, largely absent from the screen until 1993's ""Six Degrees of Separation"". What really helps with the superb set-pieces are the fact that each of the supporting players get more than a cursory character, each holding their own sub-plots well. My personal favourite is Doody (Barry Pearl), who, while not getting a lot to do, meaning his name isn't that apt, does get to perform some very funny faces. Then of course, there are the songs. Maybe the supply of good songs run out just before the end (""We go together like ramalama dingadingadong"", anyone?) but for the most part they're first-rate. The lack of strong song material was what really hindered the weak sequel, Grease 2. Instead of traditional structures of verse-chorus, the 1982 movie had characters merely melodising straightforward lines to a tune. Even the teacher joins in at one point, seriously negating the cool. Catchy choruses were out of stock, with extended words inadequate substitutes. ""We're gonna scoo  oo - oo  ore tonight"" goes one song, forgettably.  Other songs sounded like weak rip-offs of the original's ""Sandy""; with only ""Girl for All Seasons"" being a worthy number. Two other numbers managed to become more than their parts, such as ""Back To School"", thanks solely to a blistering vocal from Levi Stubbs off-camera. The other, Cool Rider (again, chorus: ""Coo  ooo  ooo  ool ri  der, Coo  ooo  ooo  ool ri  der"") was saved by a seductive interpretation by Michelle Pfeiffer, suggestively riding a stepladder. Maxwell Caulfield was okay as the English Michael, (Though was Cliff Richard to Travolta's Elvis), but generally it was an artificial and lifeless retread, the others (Pfeiffer included) adding shame to their resumes. Grease is a brilliantly witty pastiche of 50s b-movies, whereas Grease 2 is a not-so-witty pastiche of Grease. Like a photocopier, duplication always produces inferior copies. Thankfully Grease is one of the few films  unlike say, Planet of the Apes or A Nightmare On Elm St.  not to be denigrated in light of its sequels.But now that the dust has settled on this one, all that's really left to ask is questions. What sort of moral message is being handed out by a virginal girl only achieving happiness by dressing as a slut?; What is the line that Kenickie shouts to Rizzo on the fairground, almost inaudible?; Who is the guy that sits alone in the stalls for the girls' perspective on ""Summer Nights?""  is it a cameo?; why have I seen two versions of this film, one where ""Summer Nights"" ends in a split screen, the other not?;  Isn't it ironic that the drive-in plays an acne commercial, ending with the line: ""It's time to face up to Face/Off""; Lastly, we can also marvel at the laughable stupidity of the BBC, who, every time this film is screened, crudely edit out a whole verse of ""Grease Lightnin'"" because John Travolta couples the word ""tit"" with ""sh**"". Yet then leave in the entire next verse as he proclaims his car to be a ""real pussy-wagon""!!! Finally, if nothing else, watch this for the spot-on 50s take-offs (The Greased Lightnin' visuals; Olivia and John in the prologue with deliberately cheesy dialogue and ""Love Is A Many Splendoured Thing"" playing in the background; Frankie Avalon appearing as an agony aunt angel); or for Barry Gibb's superb theme score. An exceptionally good movie.",Grease
87,gab-14712,"Charming, Sweet, and Wonderful!",9,18 October 2017,"1978's Grease, in many eyes, is a classic film. It is adored by all ages, and it seemingly passes down from generation to generation with love. This is one of the first movies I remember that have a sense of nostalgia. This movie plays well with the baby boomers because it hearkens back to the 1950's, when love was swamped in innocence. This movie got the feel of the 1950's correct, I have been told. The clothing, the background music, the charm, the acting, and the overall look of the movie. The actual songs are 1970's rock'n'roll style, and they are wonderful songs. The tone of the movie is upbeat, fun, and innocent. It may be somewhat predictable, but the movie itself was made well.There are a variety of reasons why I enjoy this movie. From the interpretation of the 1950's lifestyle to the wonderful tunes to the themes of true love-all of it elevates this movie into 'classic' territory. However, I am irked by a few things though. Mainly the age of the cast. Don't get me wrong, I think the performances are wonderful, but I despise when movies cast people in their late 20's or early 30's to play teenagers. Now some films can get away with it, but not Grease. You can tell that the people in the cast are not teenagers. Check out these ages at the time of movie release. John Travolta was 24, Olivia Newton-John was 30, and Stockard Channing was 34!!! But who am I to complain. This movie gave Travolta and Newton-John the career boost they needed.As for the story, it's nothing new. The story is one that has been told to death, but it is all about how a story is told that can make or break a movie. This love story was told with a passion thanks to the high-spirited screenplay from Bronte Woodard and the energizing direction from Randall Kleiser. This musical starts off at a California beach in 1959. Complete opposite personalities have fallen in love. Greaser Danny Zuko (John Travolta) and an Australian chick Sandy Olsson (Olivia-Newton John). After a summer romance expecting not to see each other again, both of them attend Rydell High unbeknownst to each other. They do their own things at first. Danny is a leader of a gang of greasers called the T-Birds and Sandy joins the Pink Ladies, led by the charming Rizzo (Stockard Channing). When they run in to each other for the first time, Sandy realizes Danny is a different man from the one she met at the beach. But will that stop her from getting back with Danny? Well, just watch the movie! Despite my concerns on the ages of the cast, I cannot deny how effective the performances are. In particular, John Travolta and Olivia Newton-John. Travolta eventually became a major movie star, thanks to this movie. He knows how to sing and dance very well for an actor. It seems like he models his character off Elvis Presley. With the hairstyle and the black leather jacket, he seems to be Elvis-lite. He exerts fantastic chemistry with Olivia-Newton John. She also sang very well and her performance as the new girl in town is excellent. I liked the supporting cast very much. Stockard Channing did a solid job as the sex-happy leader of the Pink Ladies. Jeff Conaway as Danny's right-hand man, Kenickie. There are some veteran cast members who did a fine job particularly Eve Arden as Principal McGee and Sid Caesar as Coach Calhoun.I was most impressed with Grease. I remember seeing it as a little kid and enjoying the music. But as a young adult, it resonates with me because it reminds me of my high school days. The music is great and most of these songs will stick in your brain for a lifetime. Such numbers to keep an eye out for are ""Hopelessly Devoted To You,"" and ""You're The One That I Want."" The former song actually went on to be nominated for an Oscar. This film is all about song and dance. Two of my favorite sequences include the ballroom dance scene which was being filmed for national television and it features some slick dance moves. My other favorite scene is the ending dance sequence at the school's carnival. Very fun! On the whole, this film is upbeat, sweet, and a film to remember.My Grade: A-",Grease
88,SmileysWorld,Automatic! Systematic! Hyyyydromatic!!!,9,3 October 2001,"I must begin by stating that I love this movie.I recall sitting there in the theater at the age of 13 totally mesmerized by it. I love the characters and the way they were presented.I already had a crush on Olivia Newton-John before the film came out,and I must say it truly enhanced it.I can recall wanting to sing along with all the songs,but I didn't know the words yet.I later bought the soundtrack album.I don't mean a tape or CD,I mean the actual vinyl album,which I still have to this day and it's still in great condition.I now know the words by heart and sing every tune on it. The characters in this movie won me over so well, that I hated to see them go at the end.Travolta is excellent as Danny Zucco,in his really good early days as an actor.There are moments and language you might want to shield your kids from,but all in all a fun,fantastic film.I highly recommend it.",Grease
89,Ruskington,"Divisive, controversial and extremely camp",6,13 April 2020,"It's hard to describe just how much I hate musicals, but I can just about tolerate this relatively enjoyable adaptation. Grease is far from perfect and, for a 110-minute film, there isn't much of a storyline to speak of. A lot of the acting is pretty abysmal and there are some dubious messages about what it means and what it takes to be popular. There are also some highly sexist moments that are hard to accept regardless of when this movie was made. Despite all this, the gloriously camp performance of John Travolta and the legendary soundtrack are enough to make this an iconic classic for many viewers.The film is very pretty, with the crisp colours of the 50s and a visually dazzling cast. Travolta is absolutely mesmerising as Danny Zuko and dominates every scene he is involved in. Olivia Newton-John is perfectly lovely although her acting is quite wooden and a little childish at times. I never felt much of a chemistry between these two characters, and the trajectory of their romance doesn't feel particularly believable. Stockard Channing aside, the rest of the cast are fairly useless and many scenes are quite painful to watch.The music is amazing, just pure unadulterated fun. Four decades later and it sounds as fresh and charming as ever. There is an innocence about this music, this era and these characters which may be overidealistic but certainly creates a great feeling of nostalgia, even for those who never lived through this time period. I can understand the highly polarized reviews of Grease; it is both fresh yet dated, charming yet disturbing, edgy yet corny. A fascinating part of 20th century pop culture that makes you question if we have gone forward or backward as a society.",Grease

John Travolta and Olivia Newton John are very good in this movie. I like how the movie is set in the 1950's.

91,Atreyu_II,Is this supposed to be funny??,5,29 August 2007,"How such a mediocre movie like ""Grease"" can be considered a classic and loved by so many people is beyond me.Sure, everybody's got their own tastes and I respect that, but seriously what's so special about this movie? For me, this is nothing more than a mediocre movie full of cheap humor and bad messages. How can this be still such a hit after all these years?? The best thing about this movie is the brilliant soundtrack. The songs are classics, not the movie. Songs such as ""Greased Lightning"", ""Sandy"", ""You're The One That I Want"", ""Summer Nights"" and the opening song are great and timeless, not the movie.Apart the music, there are very little good things about this movie. For example: the romantic beginning with Danny Zuko and Sandy on a beach during the sunset time, exchanging love promises.What else? The original opening credits (with bizarre cartoons and a cool song), the ""drive-in"" sequence and every part with those wonderful songs.The characters are, most of them, annoying. The T-Birds are the most irritating characters of the movie, except Danny Zuko (the only T-Bird who isn't annoying). About the girl characters, only Sandy isn't annoying. Of all the things that anger me in this movie, what angers me most is its dirty humor which is absolutely irritating... not to mention about the ""message"" of it.Plus, one of the things that made me cringe most is that the women in the movie say that «All men are rats» and then they say something even worst «They're the fleas of rats». I am a guy and I find that an extremely offensive and insulting observation. That is not a nice thing to say.The ending is somehow too childish, surreal and ridiculous. What was the point of putting a car flying?? Not to mention incredibly long... after too much nonsense, that's when the flying car comes.John Travolta is great as Danny Zuko and so is Olivia Newton-John in the role of Sandy Olsen.Overall, it is a movie to forget and it doesn't deserve all the attention it gets. Anyway, this is just my opinion. I don't want to get into fights because of this...",Grease
92,johnstonjames,"Lunk-Headed and Mindlessly Idiotic as Well as Unintentionally Shocking Material For a Family Film. But Hey, It's 'Grease' and You Gotta Love It",8,12 July 2012,"every time i see 'Grease' i'm always disturbed by it somewhat. where there are certain bad movies that are unintentionally funny and humorous, 'Grease' manages to be unintentionally kind of shocking and crude, and a little offensive.i mean jeez. you would think that John Water's, who directed one of the most offensive films of all time which was the infamous 'Pink Flamingos', would have made the more shocking film with 'Hairspray'. not so, Water's 'Hairspray' is far more thoughtful, intelligent and morally correct than the simple minded decadence of 'Grease'.and it's a little disturbing that a family film like 'Grease' is unaware of it sleaziness. i mean John Travolta turns down Stockard Channing's advancements by saying he ""doesn't like sloppy seconds"". omg that's a porn term. also the ""Sandra Dee"" spoof goes beyond simple ribald teasing into hardcore cynicism and reckless promiscuity. i'm not sure kids should be exposed to that. this film also encourages smoking and drinking by juveniles.i suppose the juvenile recklessness would be even more questionable if any of these actors even looked like they were in high school. i mean Stockard Channing as a high school senior is really stretching it. all the actors here look like they are pushing the big 3-0. at least in John Water's original 'Hairspray' movie the kids were between sixteen and eighteen which was far more believable. i mean 'Grease' gives a ""double entendre"" to saying ""high school seniors"".also the musical numbers often look like adolescent ""jiffy pop"" versions of Busby Berkley musicals. the musical number ""Beauty School Drop Out"" with Frankie Avalon also comes off as a little scary and weird.do i like this messy, musical mayhem movie? well actually yes. i think 'Grease' is a lot of hokey, cheesy fun. if not a little raw around the edges. but it's vulgar, crudity is part of why 'Grease' is amusing.mostly the day is saved by a couple of things. first of all John Travolta and Olivia Newton John are tremendous here. two of the most captivating musical performers ever photographed in Hollywood film. i mean you can't stop watching both of them because of their strong natural talent and presence. second, 'Grease' is a mediocre stage play and musical, it could not have been brought off with out the self assured compentency of director Randall Kleiser. Randall Kleiser was one of Hollywood's best ""stock"" directors and he always knows what he's doing with a film. Kleiser has a good sense of focus and more than likely this film would have seemed rambling and pointless without him.with Travolta, Newton-John, and director Randall Kleiser aboard, this ride works out to be smooth and winning success. despite a little wear and tear on the shock absorbers. i didn't particularly like 'Grease' when it first came out. i thought it was kind of stupid and corny. but it was a youth phenomenon and a smash hit with my generation, and for some reason i ended up going back to the movies three times to see it (mostly dragged there by other kids). as the years progress i find i like musicals better and appreciate what a sensation 'Grease' was.one more note on this film's morals. particularly the ending. if you are a young person and you get hooked up with this monster musical movie, i wouldn't take this film's advice and go changing yourself to appease the opposite sex. especially some good for nothing greaser boy. i hardly doubt becoming a trashy tart will improve your sex life. with that said have fun. 'Grease' is all about fun. just remember that smoking can be hazardous to your health as well as other kinds of behaviour.",Grease

94,rebeljenn,Teen rebellion and romance and music!,5,1 December 2005,"'Grease' always seems to make its come-back in the world of theatre and television every few years or so. The film seems to come and go with popularity, but it is still considered one of the great musicals by some people, but I really did not think it was as great as some people make it out to be. It's just a simple teen rebellion love story. Olivia Newton-John falls in love with bad-boy Travolta. There is a little bit of denial and reluctance in the romance as Newton-John is a wholesome good girl. The music and the dance routines are pretty good, so it does make a good musical, but by the end of the film, Newton-John sports bad-girl image with big hair and clothing with an attitude. I couldn't help but to scream inside: 'Noo! You looked much better in good-girl image with nice straight hair, Olivia! Now you look horrible!'

99,DarthVoorhees,Awful...,1,17 December 2011,"I've always found 'Grease' to be a troubling and often very lazy piece of theatre. Above any show I have ever seen has always been about creating caricatures and yet we are expected to care about these caricatures. I like a few of the songs on a certain level but as a narrative with characters and motivation I am afraid to say that I think 'Grease' is a mess of epic quality. The 1978 film adaptation is no different. While I think 'Grease' is a show that is hard to do well I think the movie might just be the worst version of the show that I have seen precisely because it is so ""iconic"". Travolta and Olivia Newton John created ""icons"" free of motivation, real conflict, and conviction. 'Grease' is loud and noisy but never does it feel populated by human beings and this is due to horrible performances.The greatest problem with 'Grease' is that it has no real central conflict to the story. It definitely feels as if it has captured something in the ballpark of adolescence. Yet, 'Grease's definition of adolescence is such a distortion to bring out the easiest forms of theatricality. The problems faced in 'Grease' about blossoming sexuality and societal masks exist but 'Grease' not only confounds them but creates characters that make them seem the be all end all's. The quintessential grade school meaning of life question ""does he like me or not"" is not a good enough starting point. The show is about triviality especially in the Sandy and Danny romance because we both know they love each other and they both essentially have a similar circle of friends but the conflict that keeps these lovers apart is all about what clothes they wear. The actors have been given a near impossible task to overcome to make these caricatures characters. If singing in a musical should be the pinnacle of a character's emotional need to speak out than these characters are emotionally warped. The musical numbers are loud and well choreographed and sung but they feel so far detached. And I grant that reality isn't necessarily what one looks for but a certain sense of reality is needed in rooting these characters. Because everything is so false in the acting we feel like we are being lied to. That essentially what acting is, lying, but never do we get to that baseness unless something is really off or consciously dissected.Because the songs do not come from a place of reality(not even heightened reality) the whole musical seems cartoonish. I think a particularly good example of the actor's failure is when actress Stockard Channing's Rizzo sings ""Look At Me I'm Sandra Dee"". Channing is a great singer but a lousy actress. Granted the scene is Rizzo making fun of Sandy because of her insecurities and I think that really is a compelling place to start a scene but even in her attempt to create a sarcastic caricature she seems over the top. I think it is telling that even in a moment where the play is trying to be over the top that it still comes off as too over the top. Channing creates horrible choices with her body, jerking herself around in such mechanical unnatural ways. Her voice accents every lyrical quality of the music in such a blunt and violent matter that we don't notice the lyrics of the song. I've always found the ending to 'Grease' to be very troubling and I think the happy go lucky quality to 'You're the One That I Want' really shows this. I was more opposed to the crowd than anything else. I think this is important because it shows that even in a musical where you don't sing but are there there has to be a motivation and conviction to being there. The crowd scenes in musicals are hard to pull off well because you have to think about every actor creating a motivation for a whole crowd to erupt in song. The show ends with Sandy essentially giving up all her moral high ground and convictions and becoming like Danny who has not mutually changed himself. I can see why Sandy and Danny all dance but why the crowd? Shouldn't this moment have been merely between Sandy and Danny? They go into a funhouse and yet you see the hands of Danny's gang poking through the windows and they are there at the end. Why? I don't think the actors or the director thought hard here because they appear like gorillas and it makes the ending troubling. It can't just be gratuitous placement of characters even if they don't sing and just dance they still have to have motivation. If one doesn't just sit back and turn their brain off here than the ending feels symbolically like rape. I realize I might be looking too hard into this but I DID care about Sandy in a way. The inclusion of these apes actually left me after viewing 'Grease' to think that Danny wasn't going to ""shape up"" and so the lyrics ultimately meant nothing and Sandy's metamorphosis is a defeat. Having the lyrics mean nothing is the worst thing you can do in a musical. It is telling that this happens in 'Grease' during it's most famous number.Sure 'Grease' may be escapist and the musical quality I suppose is kind of fun but the acting is awful. I want to see a production of 'Grease' which has Danny and Sandy in it and not the bad boy and the nice girl with their groupies.",Grease

102,mfellipecampos,Good,7,14 October 2020,"Released in 78 but with references to a time that dates back to the 1950s. A musical that is a classic! Perhaps the most acclaimed of all time and why?! ""Nos Tempos da Brilhantina"" in the middle of the golden age of capitalism! A representation of what was a time of consumerism - and we see this in the film through the attachment to cars, from appearances - in which adolescents exalted their rebelliousness in order to show their independence, but still full of childishness. And that childishness is given to us through animated scenes, like the beginning of the film that is caricatured. It is brilliant how Randal Klaiser gives us the child that still exists in the characters, while sharing cigarettes and drinks. Grease is lively, throbbing, shows us the effervescence of adolescence and Travolta vibrates here! As an actor, singer and dancer! And he won the nomination for best actor at the Golden Globe! It was the peak of his career! But the entire cast is well directed accompanied by a well-kept production.

This movie has many ingredients that are required for a musical such as the original songs that were made up for the movie, and of course the choreography for the movie. The only confusing thing about the film is that Sandy (played by Olivia Newton- John) always tries to end her relationship with Danny and she still keeps on going on back to him I mean if you are going to break up with somebody just do it.

104,BlackJack_B,Still a wonderful movie decades later.,8,21 August 2005,"I remember as a kid when my father sold bubble gum cards showing scenes from ""Grease"" in the 1970's. I had never seen this movie before; to be honest I didn't start watching movies until I was around 10 or 11 when I could understand movies. This was one of the first I saw with the advent of the VCR.Grease, of course, is based on the Broadway play and is a superb film version; it seems one thing Hollywood can do right is taking successful plays and making them into films. While the story is of two lovers from different backgrounds who struggle to try and accept each other's high school images, the movie is really a celebration of the 1950's. The movie makes a case that living in the 1950's; despite the spectre of The Cold War, was a terrific time. The kids of the 50's never had it so good. They didn't have video games, PCs, satellite dishes, the 'Net, or other diversions. They had what we always have had: Love. Perhaps the only flaw is the 1970's trappings. Barry Gibb of The Bee Gees wrote the theme song and while the film captures much of the 50's you see the occasional disco trapping or such of the decade.John Travolta is brilliant as Danny Zuko. Although he may have been drawing heavily from his Vinnie Barbarino character from Welcome Back, Kotter and his admiration of Jim Morrison he portrays Danny as a multi-faceted individual. He can be a charming, naive student or a cigarette-smoking, image of cool. He plays a man who wishes not to be pigeon-holed with a single image but fears to be shunned from his peers. Despite being too old for the role, Stockard Channing is awesome as Betty Rizzo, the leader of the Pink Ladies. She is irresistible and you can't help but fall for her rough charm. Her scenes in the slumber party are fiery; especially when she dons a wig and sings ""Look At Me, I'm Sandra Dee"". In her small role at The American Bandstand dance, Annette Charles murders the dance-floor with her performance. Her superb dancing steals that scene. And while her singing is fine, Olivia Newton-John's performance as Sandy is lacking. She just plays her as a bore a little too much. The supporting cast is excellent, with a mix of just about everything.After 27 years, few musicals top this one (Chicago, Moulin Rouge perhaps) but this one was done in a different era of Hollywood. You need to see this one once a year at least. Oh, and avoid Grease II or the veiled 2003 remake called From Justin To Kelly.",Grease

106,bbewnylorac,Grease is great,8,15 April 2013,"My high school drama teacher pointed out something that a lot of this viewers don't get -- it's a satire! People who hate Grease actually think it's supposed to be a true reflection of early 1960s America, but it's a comedy, a spoof, and it's meant to be fun entertainment. The songs are the best thing, from the pounding opening song, Grease, to the lovely Travolta showpiece ballad, Sandy to the dance spectacular, Hand Jive. There are quite a few silly bits, such as Jan singing the toothbrush song and most of Frenchy's dialogue, but you've got to remember that this is a movie about teenagers, for teenagers, although most of the cast were aged in their 20s and 30s. Highlights for me included Beauty School Dropout by Frankie Avalon, There are Worse Things I Could Do by Stockard Channing and Hopelessly Devoted to You by Olivia Newton-John. Grease was a musical we did at my high school, and it'sjust a quality production that's hugely enjoyable.",Grease

Just recently, I saw the film again. Let me start by saying it is vibrant, colorful and energetic. Everyone looks good in their costumes and make up and everyone is young. Amazing that everyone was smoking but things have changed since this movie was made. So much so that all I could think of was how dated this film is. I found myself wincing during some of the dance scenes. The jerky, odd movements on the bleachers and around the car being ""souped up"". If memory serves me I didn't like these scenes when the film was new so watching them today was a bit startling. The dialogue in some parts of the film is very strange too. No one talks like that anymore thank goodness.Despite the fact that I didn't like the entire film I have to say that I couldn't take my eyes off of it and it did leave an impression. The opening animated sequence is a one of a kind-you don't see many films start out like that anymore. Did Car Wash use something like that as well? I might have to watch the film again but some of this film seems so strange I can't imagine why this would be anyone's favorite film!",Grease
109,roghache,Popular 50's teenage musical sends the wrong messages,4,12 March 2006,"This is one of a number of movies I saw back when they were first released, misguidedly enjoyed at the time, and now find I have major issues with. I suppose it's a mildly entertaining movie of generally brainless drivel (50's greaser stereotype rebellion), with a few catchy tunes. If it was merely that, okay, but this film gives its viewers (especially teenage ones) ALL the worst possible messages.The plot revolves around ""young love"" (?) as experienced by the pretty, innocent young Australian girl, Sandy (Olivia Newton-John) who has a summer romance with Danny (John Travolta). In the fall she discovers that they attend the same school, Rydell High, and that Danny is the leader of a greaser gang called the T birds. Their different attitudes naturally bring conflict into their (immature) relationship. Sandy finally becomes convinced that she must turn herself into a tart in order to keep her man, and proceeds to do precisely that.First, a few compliments to the movie. I'm a big fan of Olivia Newton-John and her (earlier) music, think she's lovely in this picture and a lovely lady still. Also, John Travolta is a guy with charisma galore; I loved him in Saturday Night Fever. In terms of the music, my favorite piece is ""Hopelessly Devoted to You"", a beautiful romantic song that deserved its Oscar. (Too bad Sandy feels pressured to have sex with the guy she's ""hopelessly devoted"" to.) But that's just about where my compliments end, and my rating of 4 is mainly from a sense of nostalgia. Wrong messages, where to begin? First of all, Danny is the leader of a gang, whose purpose is rebellion (as though teenagers needed any encouragement there, Ha, ha) Well, the gang isn't really violent, you say? Maybe not, but even the Pink Ladies, its female counterpart, is at best quite an established clique. Teenagers have enough trouble dealing with peer pressure both then and today. Did they really need a film encouraging them to alter their persona to fit in with the crowd?Sandy begins smoking in order to feel accepted by the Pink Ladies and especially Danny. Way to go, Sandy. I don't even need to start mentioning all the negative aspects here.But worst, absolute worst...the very obvious message to all teenage girls watching, that virginity is just plain unacceptable...you can't possibly expect to keep your man unless you dress provocatively and presumably deliver the goods as well. You know what, Sandy, you were fine just the way you were at the start...young, sweet, and innocent. If Danny doesn't like you that way, tough; let him look elsewhere. YOU keep your self respect, girl, and find some other guy who WILL appreciate you as you are and not expect anything from you you're not prepared to give.Enough lecturing, except to conclude...Yes, Grease is the word all right, if you want to send a teenager all the wrong messages, that is.",Grease
110,Marc_Israel_365,A trip down somebody else's memory lane,7,25 January 2015,"It's kitchy, it's sassy, it's full of adults acting like kids trying to act like adults. In a way, it's very confusing in the discrepancy between how cool Tavolta is in contrast to his suck up cronies, who are as nerdy as can be. Then there's Stockard Channing, looking like a cradle robber but delivering the best lines of the movie. Understandably overstated, as all Broadway Musical Hollywood remakes are repackaged, but if the mix of 1970's BeeGee-ism at the beginning of the film doesn't throw you off your tour of somebody else's' mash up of 1950's nostalgia (and let's face it, most of the theater goers 1950's exposure was pretty much limited to ABCs' ""Happy Days"") then the rest of the picture is pretty easy to swallow. And just like cotton candy, it disappears very quickly and is quite unnutricious. That criticism aside, there are classic song and choreographed numbers that have stayed with me throughout the generations. ""Greased Lightening"", ""Summer Loving"" and the eternal Frankie Vallie singing ""Beauty School Dropout"" are outstanding. I'm always surprised to have forgotten the best song of the film sung by Channing, ""There Are Worst Things I Could Do"", which I deem the only honest moment of the entire film.",Grease

113,alainenglish,"It should not work, but somehow does",9,23 May 2007,"Now the subject of a UK-based reality TV show, as talent scouts look for stars to play the leads in a new stage production, ""Grease"" is probably the definitive high-school movie musical. It's energy and light-heartedness has endeared it to generation after generation of fans.Danny (John Travolta) is an LA high-school student who has a brief summer affair with Sandy (Olivia Newton-John), a beautiful Australian girl. When the summer's over, Danny returns to school at Rydell High and the company of his gang The T-Birds and their girlfriends the Pink Ladies. When Sandy unexpectedly turns up at his school, it leads to a complicated, comic romantic journey...The movie should not work: the plot is flimsy and clichéd, nearly everyone is a walking stereotype and the cast of high-school students are played by twenty/thirty somethings. They should all look stupid up there, but they don't.There are three main reasons for this: first off is the catchy and outrageously memorable music: ""Summer Nights"", ""You're the One that I Want"" and ""Greased Lightning"", to name but three, every song in the film has enough snap to get you singing and dancing. The use of stereotypes in the movie actually works: I don't think I know another movie with so many distinctive and memorable characters: from the romantic leads Danny and Sandy, and minor characters like brainless jock Chisholm and hyperactive supernerd Eugene, each one makes its mark.In today's world, with online communities like Friends Reunited and Bebo connecting people with their old schoolmates, the use of adults to play teenagers might actually strike a chord. The lighthearted and affectionate friendships in the T-Birds and Pink Lady Gangs, are played with a lot of humour and honesty, and will almost certainly bring out nostalgic feelings in the older members of its audience.This is why, for many people, ""Grease"" is still the word.",Grease
114,jayjaycee,Kitsch saved by extreme musicality,6,25 June 2020,"""Grease"" is a 1978 musical directed by Randal Kleiser starring John Travolta and Olivia Newton-John. For I am some sort of musical actor myself (Ten Sing, anyone?), I from time to time love to see films that depict exactly what happens when my two greatest passions collide, and hence I have a weakness for titles of this generally derided subgenre. To this day, I cannot really understand why. What is so hilarious about when two of the greatest forms of art go hand in hand? Of course, it appears rather ridiculous when characters all suddenly sing and dance about their deepest desires, but that's the charm of this genre. No matter, how many people apparently dislike them, they are and have always been popular and successful works of art. One must only think about genre defining classic ""Singin' In The Rain"", of which the titular song is still popular among school choirs (believe me, I speak from experience), or Damien Chazelle's masterful modern masterpiece ""La La Land"", each generation has at least one iconic musical that defined it and of which the songs have been sung by each and everyone who has seen it at that time. When it comes to deciding what the ultimate box office hit of the seventies is, most people settle for this greasy romantic musical, but, as the past has proven it numerous time, does iconic necessarily mean it is of high quality? Well, I can comprehend the general attraction for this flick here, but for me there are too many things that keep me from declaring it grandiose. What grants this film most of its point is without a doubt the well-marked talent of its charismatic lead actors. Travolta and Newton-John are both truly gifted and I wonder if there is anything they can't do. His tenor and her soprano harmonize wonderfully when they sing together, but also in their solo songs they know to display their extreme musicality. As if that wasn't already enough, they also dance to it impressively and also do not forget about acting on an equally terrific level. This could have been enough if it wasn't for the major problems that the odd screenplay causes. Set in the carefree year of 1958, an archetypal greaser falls in love with an innocent Australian beauty over the summer and they live out their relationship like it was the last chance to ever experience love in their young lives, for they are aware that they'll probably never see each other again, but as chance would have it, they of course realize after the lovely vacation that they are now attending the same high school. Will they be able to rekindle their romance or will the flame stay out forever? This is the promising question that made me curious about this film in the first place, but in the end, it turns out that the plot depicted here is far away from being what it originally promised. In this love, peace and harmony kind of musical, invariably everyone is overacting, and sadly, it isn't the pleasant kind of overstated anymore. It is exaggerated to the certain degree where it becomes utterly annoying. There wasn't a single second of seriousness the film would have benefitted from immensely and I felt teased by it rather than entertained. While this effect is kept in reasonable limits in the case of our leading lovebirds, I felt provoked by the silliness of all the supporting characters. What amazes me the most about them, though, is how despite their unnecessarily high amount of screen time, I wasn't able to find a connection to them, nor did they become likeable in the slightest. Speaking of screen time, it was astonishing to see how Danny and Sandy barely share any time together and were pushed in the background in favour of elaborating the supporting characters. Seriously, I felt betrayed that the allegedly wonderful romance that was implied in the beginning isn't what the main focus lies on in this film. That's why it was extremely difficult to believe that they actually love one another. Aside from the fact that the conflict that the presence of his friends while flirting with Sandy bothers Zuko a lot isn't even thematized at all (by the way, they are always there and know that they date and none of them seems to have a problem with it except for him), the only development we get to see happening between them is a simple and dumb pattern. They argue, make up, argue, make up and argue and all the time Zuko behaves like the greatest jerk you will ever see. Not only does this make their so-called romance appear unconvincing, it also entails that there is zero chemistry between the two. For a couple that ostensibly spent the whole summer together in love, this is awfully inauthentic. Next to this, I am also not fully satisfied with the soundtrack. While iconic aestival anthem ""Summer Nights"" made me have a blast (pun intended) and a few other songs were acceptably decent as well, the majority of the songs were either boring or pointless and contributed nothing of importance to the plot (""Beauty School Drop-Out"" - what in the actual hell?). By the way, did I say plot? As funny as it sounds, despite its promising premise, there is barely one. The few sequences that happen throughout the film (the dance off, the car race etc.) are boring and only function as stupid joints to set up the next musical act. I am aware that it was originally a Broadway show conceptualised for a stage, but that doesn't entitle it to have an unexciting and pointless plot. As if that wasn't already enough, the ending is the two-step peak of all the previous nonsense. First, the fact that Zuko is only able to accept Sandy after she had an offscreen makeover and all suddenly turned into some sort of greaser chick, isn't only conveying the totally wrong message that women should change so that their moronic lovers are able to love them, it also deprives the whole romantic conflict of its credibility and dramatic potential. What ultimately gave me the rest was when they drove off into the sky ... Why? Just why? That was the exact moment I facepalmed and the film lost all seriousness for me. All in all, this iconic musical hits the right tones in terms of musicality and dancing, but is heavily off-key in terms of narration, plot and acting. It all appears to be some sort of unpleasant caricature with a dull story and annoying characters I couldn't find any form of connection with, everything is without rhyme or reason. On top of that, it is cheesy, corny and so overstuffed with ludicrous kitsch that it made me want to throw up most of the time. Grease is the word - and like any form of fat it might appear to be good for some, but deep inside we all know it is anything but healthy - and in this case it was definitely not good for me. If it wasn't for the musical achievement and the individual charisma of its leads, it would have been way worse. I even would buy the soundtrack, but the film as a whole? Nah. For now, it is borderline mediocre. Now I feel the need to wash my hair ... it feels ... greasy.",Grease
115,happipuppi13,Why Grease Is Great and Why (Some) Hate,10,8 August 2018,"You can probably already see my rating of 10 stars as you start to read this review. Knowing that, you may also know I'm not going to just put out paragraph after paragraph, praising it and telling you why I like it. I wont even go into the plot, we all know it. I'll be as brief as possible. Yes, I was 10 in 1978 and watched the ABC show, ""Welcome Back, Kotter"" which featured Travolta. ..but, I had also sen him in the TV movie 'The Boy In The Plastic Bubble'. ('Saturday Night Fever' was too adult for me in '77-'78.) So, yes it was that he's the star and I already liked Olivia Newton-John too. 
 I used to watch the variety show ""Sha-Na-Na"". That's the group who were 'Johnny Casino & The Gamblers. Lastly, it was set in my mother & father's teen year , much like 'Happy Days' , so that's all I needed. At that age one's mind (usually) is pretty open to something like this and it appealed to me instantly. As I got older I came to understand or finally notice, the more adult elements Yes, one of them being those 'words' in the Greased Lightning song and also the more mature themes. All of this actually gels well in a film that's set in a time where these things weren't always (or maybe never) talked about in the home. This movie is a favorite because from start to end, the young players put all of their energies into the song and dance numbers., all of them put every bit of themselves into their roles and most of all, in case no one noticed, this movie has a perfect balance of comedy, music , wonderfully choreographed dancing and serious elements. Not 'too' serious or else you'd be watching a musical remake of 'Rebel Without A Cause'. For me it's just fun and enjoyable. That's all it is for me. Now, anyone out there who thinks that it was 'easy' to put a film like this together (and based from a stage play as well), knows nothing about movie making and in terms of dancing, how tough it is for a choreographer to get everyone's movements in synch together. As for 'bursting into song' , in a good musical, there has to be a justified reason for someone to start singing. They can' for example be talking one minute and then suddenly sing ""La Bamba"" (or whatever), it has to make sense. Mainly, it's a faster way of telling the story. If Danny just stood there on the bleachers and talked bout his summer, that's not as interesting. The 'Summer Nights' song helps both Danny and Sandy tell the story, without overuse of dialog. As do all of the other other songs . The 'Born To Hand Jive' number at the school dance is nothing short of everyone giving their all. Especially Travolta and Newton John (and then the women who takes over from Sandy.) The whole dance number is electric. Sounds 70's you say? So what? This is a musical and YES entertainment and gee, t's supposed to be fun. Who cares if some musical liberties are taken? The closing song 'We Go Together' is almost as energetic and in the extras on my DVD, the choreographer stated how proud she was of that cast of young people, whose youthful enthusiasm and energy and dedication made that and all the other numbers what they should be. Entertaining. Yes all the actors are over 21 and into 30's, this was a common Hollywood practice at he time. Movie makers wanted to deal with those more professional that know 'time is money' and will be reliable. They also want people who have confidence in themselves and their abilities. Along with the fact people over 21 have more time to be on the set. For my money, they all did a great job acting like teen agers. About Sandy, everyone seems to forget hat Danny also was trying to change some too , by getting into athletics, which is a god way to learn that everything isn't all about him and what he wants. He was finally, just as willing to change for her and she was for him at the end. She made that choice herself because as the song Grease states 'conventionality belongs to yesterday'. She was what society 'then' said a girl should be, a 'good girl' but (sorry t say by the way) in the world of youth, it's tough to be an individual. Parents wanted (and still do) their kids to be what they say or their peers want them to be the near opposite. I reviewed Grease 2 sometime ago on here and it was easy to pinpoint what's wrong with that film. For the reviews I read here, they all seemed to be either based on their ONE and only one viewing of the movie or they're all hung up in the ending where Sandy changes her personality. (To put it lightly). How can you see a film that's good (based on the fact it did well and people continue to love it 40 years later) only 1 time and say 'this is lousy' (?) If musicals don;t appeal to you, OK that's fair but seen those who aren't into musicals can find something positive. If you cannot let yourself be entertained by a movie and forget all you know about the 'real world' and just lighten up,you can enjoy 'Grease'. If you're going to sit there and watch for 'goofs' , editing mistakes. something to hate about it from the start or even worse..... 'a lesson/message' , well ,you wont enjoy it. These are all the WRONG reasons to watch a movie. Especially a musical. Lastly, in regards to those saying seethe play. Well hey, not everyone can afford something like that and secondly, if anyone in 1978 or now, thought this would be 'like the play', they were crazy to think it would be in the first place. For me, last time, 'Grease' is a great movie just for all that it is and even at 50, none of it's appeal or my enjoyment of it has been or ever will be lost. It hs nothing to do with nostalgia or feeling younger again....I love the movie, period. 
I'm only sorry it took me this long to review it. (END)",Grease

117,jackasstrange,"Regardless of it's classic status, it's worth a watch",7,14 November 2013,"I don't know what so say about a film that was already discussed a lot as this one, so i'll try to be a bit different of the other reviewers and will talk about two things in Grease's story which i found very interesting. Despite being lighthearted almost all the time, it has a couple of melancholic moments that are way too 'dark' to the film's nature. It's very clear to me, in my opinion. For example, Sandy turns into a 'bad girl' in order to be popular and to fit in the society in the end. So the then snob Danny now is the one running after her. That is very sad.Also, Frenchy, Sandy's friend, drop out school to make beauty classes. However, after a while she needs to go back to school because she had failed with the beauty class. Smashed her dreams with no way back. That's depressive, man.I'm just mentioning two melancholic highlights that no one seems to care about, mostly due to it's lighthearted treatment in the film.Overall, it's a funny film to watch. The first and the last songs of the musical are by far the best of this musical in my opinion, but all of them are very well choreographed. Travolta really does a very good job, and so does his film's partner Olivia Newton John, which earn the role in Grease due to Travolta's recommendation.Recommended, a musical classic. 7.5/10",Grease
118,TheHonestCritic,This is the greatest musical film of all-time.,10,29 April 2020,"""Grease"" (1978), this is, without a shadow of a doubt, the best musical of all-time. You're probably thinking: ""what?"" Let me explain, yes, two of my top ten favorite films of all-time are musicals. ""Chitty Chitty Bang Bang"" (1968) and ""South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut"" (1999) are also considered musicals. But, those two movies are so much more than musicals, and I certainly love both of them in that aspect. However, from strictly a musical standpoint, ""Grease"" is the best in that category. My favorite genre of music is rock and roll, and most of the musical numbers in ""Grease"" are rock and roll songs. Aside from that, ""Grease"" also has a perfect story, perfect acting, perfect sets/locations, perfect special effects, and of course a perfect soundtrack to tie it together. The story just seems like your traditional high school love story, but again, it's a lot more than that. It's presented in such a unique and creative way, where it has managed to revolutionize the high school film and musical genre. It is based off a play, but this movie is a rare exception where the movie is better than the play itself. All of the acting is phenomenal, from all of the actors and actresses! But, the two shining stars are John Travolta as Danny, and Olivia Newton-John as Sandy. These two have such an electrifying (FORGIVE THE PUN, AS THE WORD ""ELECTRIFYING"" IS SUNG IN THE SECOND TO LAST SONG), chemistry between them. The performances from the rest of the actors and actresses are nothing short of perfect. This is one of the top ten best casts I've ever seen in a movie, they practically live and breathe their respectable characters. The sets/locations are fantastic and give the movie just the right atmosphere. All of the special effects are very well done, and still hold up to this day. Finally, the soundtrack is perfectly composed. It's one of my top ten favorite film soundtracks of all-time! All of the songs work, and help to tie the movie together. ""Grease"" is a cinematic marvel, I can watch this movie over and over again and never get tired of it. Of course, I give this movie 5 out of 5 stars on my scale, which equates to 10 out of 10 IMDB stars. If you haven't seen ""Grease"" yet, go see it. If you've seen it before, watch it again.

Musicals are not my thing so I can't really comment on that, but what I can say is that from a general movie experience perspective, it is actually not as glamourous a film as I remembered it to be. Sure, the performances are great and the music is very catchy, but the main problem with ""Grease"" is that it is a very simple concept based around a thin plot that struggles to maintain its high once it reaches its peak in the opening ten minutes. It spends the remainder of its duration trying to repeat the brilliance of ""Summer Lovin'"", and while it does manage to do so at times - with ""Grease Lightnin'"", in particular, it only just manages to be anything but dull, and by the conclusion, I breathed a sigh of relief that it was over.

Being so retro all over again is something I had been so liking to be because not many I know is aware I am a closet retro music fan too.

Written by Bronte Woodard and directed by Randal Kleiser in his theatrical feature film debut, the film depicts the lives of greaser Danny Zuko and Australian transfer student Sandy Olsson who develop an attraction for each other. The film stars John Travolta as Danny, Olivia Newton-John as Sandy, and Stockard Channing as Betty Rizzo, the leader of the Pink Ladies.Grease was originally released to North American theaters on June 16, 1978 and was an immediate box office success. In its opening weekend, the film grossed $8,941,717 in 862 theaters in the United States and Canada, ranking at No. 2 (behind Jaws 2) at the box office for the weekend and with the all-time opening weekend records. Despite losing the weekend, it set a record gross in its first 19 days with $40,272,000.In the United States and globally, it became the highest-grossing musical ever at the time, eclipsing the 13-year-old record held by The Sound of Music with a worldwide gross of $341 million. It was re-released in March 1998 for its 20th anniversary where it grossed a further $28 million in the United States and Canada.It remained the highest-grossing live-action musical until 2012 when it was overtaken by Les Misérables and the US champion until 2017 when it was surpassed by Beauty and the Beast. Grease is now the seventh highest-grossing live-action musical worldwide. A further re-issue for its 40th anniversary in 2018 grossed $1 million. To date, Grease has grossed $189,969,103 domestically and $206.2 million internationally, totaling $396 million worldwide.",Grease
125,Stompgal_87,One of my favourite musicals that was a highlight of my youth,10,11 September 2013,"The first time I saw this film in its entirety (prior to this I saw the musical number clips on VH1) was at the cinema when it was re-released for its 20th anniversary when I was 11 and in my first year at secondary school. Re-visiting this film today brought back many memories, especially my Eisteddfod performance of 'Summer Nights (one of the best songs)' with my form. Before I saw the film in full, I'd listen to the film's soundtrack on tape on 'Wet Play' days (playtime in the classroom on rainy days) with my fellow classmates at primary school.There are plenty of positive aspects of this film such as the majority of musical numbers being memorable (with the exception of There Are Worse Things I Could Do,' Rizzo's second solo performance that I completely forgot about), especially 'Grease Is The Word,' 'Summer Nights,' 'Look At Me I'm Sandra Dee,' 'Hopelessly Devoted To You,' 'Greased Lightning (and the dance to go with it), 'Beauty School Dropout,' 'Sandy (my housemate does a brilliant rendition of this one),' You're The One That I Want (which I also remember from a Shape yoghurt advert from my childhood) and 'We Go Together (which sounds a little like all versions of 'The Tide Is High') as well as a version of 'La Bamba' being played in the background in the first Frosty Palace scene; the costumes and vehicles that were true to the 1950s setting; the impressive choreography (especially the school dance scene) and the odd funny moment, especially the scene where Jan imitates the beaver in the toothpaste commercial at the slumber party at Frenchy's house - I couldn't help myself laughing at that today! I also liked the animated segments consisting of the title sequence, toothpaste commercial and the promotional refreshment animations at the drive-in. After having watched the Nostalgia Chick's review of this film, she helped me notice things I hadn't on previous viewings such as Rizzo feeling like a defective typewriter and her pregnancy rumours, although one thing I noticed for the first time today was product placement (a Reese's Peanut Butter Cups billboard ad in the opening sequence and Jan eating a Twinkie at Frenchy's slumber party). The songs made the film go quickly and they were broken up by the various antics of the T-Birds and the Pink Ladies whether they were hanging out at Frosty Palace or partaking in a car chase. I also remember the up-and-down relationship between the two protagonists very fondly.Overall this is a thoroughly enjoyable musical that has sheer nostalgic value and I'd undoubtedly like to see it time and time again. 10/10.",Grease
126,stormhawk2021,The best musical movie that I ever seen,10,6 August 2018,"I don't know how many times I could have seen ""Grease"", but I don't know how many times I'll see it again. And I liked too much this movie, since the time when I performed this musical when I was in the elementary school.Very few are the films that with the viewings don't lose attractiveness and this is the great achievement of this fantastic musical.Starting from a very simple script, we see the typical tough boy, Danny Zuko, (played masterfully by John Travolta) and his problems for combining his fame with his love for Sandy (played masterfully by the adorable Olivia Newton-John), with an agile rhythm, fun, unpretentious and really enjoyable.A funny side where I would highlight Rizzo and an unforgettable soundtrack, which I still hear on weekends in many clubs have made this movie a classic, never surpassed by a movie of the style and that didn't deserve that second part.",Grease
127,The_Core,"Fun, silly and cheesy...",6,27 February 2004,"Entertaining, silly and cheesy/goofball late 70's ""classic"" musical about (supposedly) 1950's high school students.  To me, this film has much more of a late 70's ""feel"" than anything else, despite the 50's hairstyles and cars. Characters are likeable enough to get attached to by film's end, despite lots of stereotypes and near zero character development all around.  I was 14 when this came out in theaters, and certain lines (even tone of voices when uttered) still strike a chord, although this film fails to evoke a nostalgic feeling.  ""Sandra Dee's"" sudden transformation at the end is totally unconvincing, which doesn't help the film any.  Lots of ""gratuitous smoking"" (not a terribly good message for kids), although given when it was made and the time period it's meant to portray I'm not terribly surprised. Overall, a feel-good musical from a more innocent time (1978), great for those who get a nostalgia kick from it but little else. 6/10.",Grease
128,SMLA11,Cool musical,10,24 May 2002,"This has to be probably one of the only musicals that I enjoy a lot.  John Travolta made himself worthy of being called a great actor in this and Olivia Newton John proved the same that she is a great actress.  They can both sing wonderfully and so can the others.  The songs are very creative and the writers of this movie must be geniuses.  The whole cast is really cool.  Stockard Channing did good as the leader of the ""Pink Ladies"" and all of the other woman in the ""ladies"" were cool.  All of the other guys in the ""T-Birds"" were all cool and I enjoyed them.Overall the songs are great and the actors and actresses sure do know how to sing them.  Rating 10 out of 10.",Grease
129,CriticsVoiceVideo,A musical romantic comedy classic.,9,26 February 2021,"Made in 1978 but set in the 1959 high school Rydell High. They say it's America's favorite musical. It's a classic, that's for sure. Catchy tunes, attractive cast, good choreography. Followed up by a good enough sequel.",Grease
130,meathookcinema,A masterpiece musical that deserved it's huge success,10,2 July 2021,"Along with most other households in the UK for members of Gen X (the best generation by the way), we had the soundtrack for the film Grease. When the film was finally shown on UK TV I recorded it and watched it fat too much. It was a 'go to film' for a time when I was young.But this was stopped when I asked my brother's new girlfriend if she liked the film and soundtrack. She frowned and said 'It's a bit tacky...' This stayed with me. How could I have been into something so lacking in sophistication and tacky?! My love for Grease abruptly ended.I found myself recently revisiting the film when it was shown on TV again. Would I cringe and snigger whilst wondering how I could have possibly have watched such rubbish as a child? No! I loved it!For those who have been living under a rock since 1978, the film concerns the holiday romance between Danny Zuko and Australian Sandy Olsson. As Sandy finds that her family are staying on in America rather than returning to Oz she starts at Rydell High School, not knowing that Zuko attends there. She also doesn't know that he is the leader of a greaser gang known as The T-Birds. This leads to the tough and streetwise Danny she meets rather than the sensitive and caring Danny she knew from her summer holiday. Sandy is taken under the wind of a girl gang known as The Pink Ladies led by the inimitable Rizzo.I love how theres another layer to the wit within the film that completely went over my head when I was a kid. Grease is full of filthy references as the teenagers characters (most of whom look like they're actually at least 35) are unabashedly full of hormones and lust (except the pure and virginal Sandy). And so we get fantastic 'blink and you'll miss them' gags such as a car door being slammed on Danny's erection at the drive-in after he tried to get it on with Sandy and the appearance of the cling film during the Greased Lightning sequence.And then theres the music which is just as steeped in nostalgia and a lost era as the film's visuals and narrative are. And just like the rest of the film, the songs are just as funny. Possibly the greatest of these is the Beauty School Dropout sequence resplendent with Frankie Avalon. Surreal, hilarious and utterly inspired.But there are also poignant musical moments such as Sandy singing Hopelessly Devoted To You and Rizzo's There Are Worse Things I Could Do. This isn't a one note movie.Grease originally started as a stage musical on Broadway in 1972 and was instrumental in a revival of all things 50's Americana in the 70's which continued with American Graffiti and Happy Days. The film imbues the same wistful nostalgia which is gleefully part fact, part fiction as times gone by normally are when viewed through rose-tinted glasses. This doesn't matter a jot however as Grease is still a fantastic piece of escapism.In fact, theres very little difference between this and say, John Waters' Cry Baby which just goes to show what a fantastic era both films draw inspiration from and how close to the bone and risqué they are.Grease has also been the subject of many different kinds of film analysis. My favourite is the one that sees it as a lesbian text with Sandy being 'femme' and Danny being 'butch'.Grease is a film that was the highest grossing of 1978, with the soundtrack being just as successful when it came to record sales. And it was utterly justified.Watching Grease after so many years was like being visited by an old friend.",Grease
131,antagonist117,The best bit of musical nostalgia for the hot-rod generation,9,9 January 2014,"With more hummable songs than ""West Side Story,"" and a lot more humor, ""Grease"" is probably the most fun musical tribute to '50s teen culture. It studiously avoids falling into the buzz-killing sinkholes of melodrama and social commentary. When a main character has a pregnancy scare, she responds not with self-pity but with defiant independence. That arc leaves her a little deeper, a little wiser than before, but no less lighthearted. The principle romantic pair, played by John Travolta (good actor, lousy singer) and Olivia Newton-John (the inverse) are often kept apart by the artificial social barriers of high school, and they each do the silliest things to try to change for each other, but at no point does anyone act as if any valuable lessons have been learned. In another movie about pseudo-rebellious greasers, like ""Rebel Without a Cause,"" the car race scene in the final third would have resulted in a shocking death that changes everything; not here, because ""Grease"" is smart enough to know what kind of movie it is. It's just fun-loving, winking nostalgia. The final number has all of the characters, even the ones who never got along, declare that they will be together forever. The audience knows that they won't, because life doesn't work like that, and the movie knows that we know, so spelling it out would be pointless. In addition to the pop songs and fun plot, ""Grease"" is kept fresh by well-drawn, instantly-iconic supporting characters like Rizzo and Frenchy.",Grease
132,nowego,Brings Back Memories,7,19 June 2018,"Every time I see this movie it brings back memories of the first time I saw it. It was my first year away from home at boarding school. Most teenagers loved Olivia Newton-John, well I did anyway being a 13 year old Australian.It was probably one or the first movies I saw away from my parents and it has stuck with me ever since and I am by not stretch a fan of musicals at all. In fact I rarely ever watch them, but this one I have seen more than a few times.There are few films that have had such a lasting impact on popular culture and it is one of the few films, that are parodied and remembered as well.John Travolta and Olivia Newton John were in my opinion very good portraying the cool, streetwise 1950's teenagers, although both at the time were well into their late twenties. While neither are the greatest of actors, but they don't need to be. Grease is all about the song and dance.Some of the most memorable songs ever to be put on film are here. ""You're the One that I Want"" ""Grease"" and ""Summer Nights"" are songs that are unbelievably catchy and songs that are known by pretty much everybody from the first line to the last.This movie always makes me smile and at the end of the day that is all that is important to me, I enjoy it each time I see it.",Grease
133,wnterstar,Enjoyable and adorable,9,21 April 2006,"Grease is one of the movies I have to watch whenever it comes on. The cast is all wonderful, especially John Travolta, Olivia Newton John and Stockard Channing. The plot is great and is still somehow relevant today. The script is fantastic, full of the best one-liners, ever. But it's the musical numbers that truly shine. The title song, as well as Summer Nights are classics! In most musicals, I come out singing one or two songs, with Grease, I was humming them all! Add in some great cinematography and you have a winning combination for a movie. This is a great movie that deserves a nine out of ten. It is a movie everyone should see!",Grease
134,son_of_cheese_messiah,Bubblegum for the masses.,4,8 October 2010,"When this came out in 1978, I had just hit my teens, so just about the right age to enjoy it. But I never understood the appeal, even then. A series of 1950s pastiche songs permanently in the charts made this the last film in the world I'd want to see. It was one of those inexplicable and inescapable pop culture phenomena which annoyed the hell out of everyone who was not enraptured by it.Seeing it for the first time all these years later, I have tried to take as unprejudiced a view as I can. I have tried to watch it a few times before, but always found it leaden and predictable. The music is not the only cliché-ridden thing in it, indeed it consists of nothing more than a series of 1950s clichés strung together. Two rival gangs (safely sanitised naturally). A school dance. A drive-in movie. A car race. Looks like the authors watched Rebel Without A Cause and Westside Story and blended them together. Minus any of the threat inherent in those works of course. Danny's gang sound and act like Top Cat's gang from the 70s cartoon.It might be said that these things have become 50s clichés because they were so prevalent at the time. Fair enough. But these scenes have no organic connection with each other. You just feel the writers say ""what shall we do now? I know, let's have a song about a t-bird, they had those in the 50s."" Nothing has any real consequence in this film nor is there any character development. One girl has unprotected sex and for a time thinks she's pregnant. Then it turns out she's not. Yippee.Sandy wants to be respected by Danny. But has a volte-face after seeing him win a car race. She then turns into the local skank and comes onto him, which would drive most men to run a mile. Its lucky this is set in the 1950s when the worst vice was smoking; if it were set today, she would turn into a crack whore.All of this could be countered with the fact that this is not a plot or character driven film but a musical, and the plot merely exists to hang a series of set pieces on. After all many musicals of Hollywood's golden age have laughable plots merely designed to frame spectacular song and dance routines. So that brings us back to the quality of the songs themselves. Are they good enough that we can overlook the film's obvious faults? Well ""Summer nights"" and ""You're the one that I want"" are good songs and produce the most memorable scenes. There is nothing spectacular or even inventive about them in the manner of old Fred and Ginger numbers, however. The other songs are largely forgettable but I do like the production ""beauty school dropout"" which is the most imaginative thing in the film.Worst of all is the title track which stands out like a sore thumb. It is a disco-era song, completely at variance with the rest of the music. And its lyrics are incomprehensible. ""Grease is the time, is the place, is the motion and grease is the way we are feeling"" would rank high as the most mindless ever written.Ultimately this is very non-threatening entertainment. Agreeable enough but it says a lot about public taste that something so derivative has been such a sensational and so widely imitated.",Grease
135,Sober-Friend,A Classic Film That Almost Everyone Loves,8,10 April 2017,"In 1978 Hollywood seem to be the best year of produced movies since in 1939. Many films in 1978 became templates for their genres that later other films copied. Films released in 1978 include ""Animal House"", ""Magic"", ""The Boys from Brazil"", ""Dawn of the Dead"", ""Superman: The Movie"", ""Heaven Can Wait"", ""Foul Play"", ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"", ""Every Witch Way But Loose"" ""Halloween"" and ""Grease"". All the above films still are still popular. They all sell millions of dollars worth of DVD Sales each year. ""Grease"" of course out sells them all. In case you didn't know the story ""Grease"" is the story of ""Danny and Sandy"". They are both crazy for each other and yet they are polar opposites. The catchy score has now produced classic tunes. If you missed out on the original theatrical release that is sad. The film had such a high energy level that you left the movie theater wanting to sing. The major criticism about the film was that ""They all looked too old to still be in high school"". Well that is true but I would rather see talented performers playing roles than untalented age apposite actors. This film is family safe but today the film would be rated PG-13. There is some very adult jokes in the film but, it will go over most children's head (and some adults). My complaint about the film is that it has never had a great Blu- release. Yes there has been releases that had ""Deleted scenes"" but not all of them. There is still plenty of deleted footage that has never been released and I would love to see them. I would also love to see a documentary that explores the making of the film. There has been one done and released but it wasn't interesting.",Grease
136,PCC0921,The 1950s From a 1970s Perspective,8,13 January 2021,"Grease (1978), leaves a good feeling in a person's heart. From beginning to end, it is a good time that is spent watching these kids go through their senior year in high school. The interesting part to this film is the fact that you are watching a film about the 1950's, that was made in the 1970's. It produces all the images and colors that capture the essence of the 1950's. Along with those images, it tackles topics much more prevalent in the 1970's such as birth control, and pregnancy. This mix of image and content is what creates the flavor of the film. It gives you the song and dance that is expected from a musical of this kind, and at the same time it throws in topics that make this period piece something more tangible in this day and age.There are some scenes that are silly and none of these actors look young enough to be even college students, but if the film was completely serious than it probably would not have accomplished what it wanted to do. It gives you the images and scenes found in Happy Days, and it gives you the energy and spark found in Footloose. Some of the most wonderful images found in the film are those scenes with 1950's icons such as drive-in movies and drive-in restaurants. The acting and singing works fine and the songs are perfect for each scene. Stockard Channing gives an excellent performance as the rebellious Rizzo and it was very refreshing witnessing two legendary faces from film and television in the guise of Eve Arden and Syd Caesar.8.1 (B MyGrade) = 8 IMDB",Grease
137,lyubitelfilmov,A good girl meets a bad boy or a Boring and disappointing cult musical with cult status,6,16 May 2020,"Musical. A screen version of the stage musical of the same name by Jim Jacobs and Warren Casey, from which some social subtext was removed and the sharp edges were smoothed out. I looked at the picture again on the recommendation and ... however, about that after. I note that this picture has a cult status in the West, which has not subsided so far, which has become news to me if I have garlic, but despite this fact, I will still judge it by my personal impressions that arose me while watching it. And here is my brief opinion - a frustrating and boring musical. Quietly, without nerves, dear and respected fans of the picture, I will explain my position and intend to describe not only the minuses, but also the advantages of this movie, for which it is deservedly loved and appreciated. Let me begin, then.
So, the pros:
1. Atmosphere - what is wonderful in this picture is just that. The picture is filled with a light, romantic mood, which will completely freely disperse the melancholy of dull gray everyday life. And I'm not joking right now. If you do not believe me, then check it yourself. Yes, I watched this picture on the recommendation, but I myself had a desire, which only accelerated. After watching a war movie, I wanted some lightness and musicality - and in this regard I was not deceived!
2. Fifties - Elvis, a special style of youth, cars of the thirties, skillfully remade by these very guys into something special, summer, romance, and most importantly - the music itself, the influence of which cannot be overestimated. All this is, it all looks almost perfect. What to do, because the fifties for America really stood out calm and musical at the same time. What else to do, how not to love and be loved?
3. A simple story is the classic love story of a bad boy and a good girl, before which various and such familiar to everyone obstacles come up, ranging from different circles of interest, moral views and ending with a radically different look at the future. Of course, the ending of this story is predictable, and this is good. For the genre, this is it, because the emphasis is on something else, which will be the next plus.
4. Songs - why love this picture? Yes, it's for the songs, light, romantic, vulgar (as without it), but so emotional and sometimes even touching. Songs from this picture occupied the highest places, and some were even nominated for the then-prestigious Academy Award. One title track is worth it!
5. Dancing - there are a lot of dances in the picture, and a lot of extras. Moreover, the characters dance so flawlessly and expertly that it causes genuine admiration even today, in the age of high technology and computer graphics. Some dances are already unknown to a wide range of viewers, because the fashion for them has passed, so this picture can be safely used as a history textbook on dances of the fifties. They are vulgar, sometimes very - but very shocking, you can't argue with that. I especially want to note the patience and work of the masters in choreography, because what frame do not take - movement, plastic, everything is almost perfect. And given the number of dances in the picture and extras - this is really an achievement.
So cons:
I warn you, now I will whine and find fault with the cynicism of the pathologist! I warned.
1. Not hooked! - I love musicals, although there are hundreds of us in Russia, if not tens, of the same kind, for example, among my acquaintances and friends, no one likes this genre. So, I watched both old musicals and new ones, and in each I found something special, usually a song, or several. There were times when the musical was well shot, but the songs are a complete failure. But here is the bottom. The songs are completely unremarkable, despite the good performance by the actors. Melodies - similarly. Everything seems to be monotonous, sometimes crumpled, torn, and most importantly - uninteresting. At one time, I criticized ""The Greatest Showman"" for everything except the title track, so here it is not. Already in the twentieth minute I wanted to turn it off, but I restrained myself, because there was still hope inside, as when watching the picture ""Spike Island"". There I waited for a sweet and touching scene, after which the picture began to sparkle with new colors, but this did not happen here. As at the beginning the picture was dull and uninteresting - by the end it remained the same. The dummy that I spent two hours of my time on. Well, it happens.
2. Vulgarity - the fact is that they did not show the picture in the Soviet Union, because censorship did not pass, considering it to be ""vulgar and licentious"" - and this is true. No, there are no explicit scenes here, but hints, movements, some dances clearly indicate the object of desire. I didn't like this, and if I forgave Spike Island due to good, sweet, touching and dramatic scenes, I won't forgive Briolin, because he has no such excuse.
You can throw tomatoes, apples at me, but I'm telling the truth. I have no one to crouch in front of, I am frank with you. I wanted to enjoy the picture, but in the end I only paid tribute to its technical part, which saddens.
A little about the main characters:
1. Danny Zuko performed by John Travolta is a bad boy, the leader of the school company, not indifferent to the weaker sex. Having met a new girl, I realized what the strange word ""love"" means. It is changing before our eyes. Young Travolta is admirable. Dancing, singing, playing - just great. Well, appearance certainly plays a key role!
2. Sandy Olsson, performed by Olivia Newton-John, is a good girl who fell in love with a boy who turned out to be a little not as romantic as she knew him. A naive, radiant, beautiful girl that Olivia brilliantly performed. Her Sandy turned out to be a classic good girl, but this image has always been, is and will be popular. Good girl!
As a result, we have a boring musical with cult status, with a simple and memorable story, great atmosphere and aesthetics of the fifties, famous songs and magnificent dances. The duet of Travolta and Olivia is wonderful!",Grease
138,ThomasColquith,Good and Bad,5,20 September 2021,"""Grease"" is not a good film in terms of plot, development, supporting characters, etc. But it does have some great musical numbers and dancing which make me give it a 5/10 instead of something lower.

With Travolta and Newton-John in their iconic roles as Danny & Sandy, you can't help but join in the fun and sing along happily. Personally I feel that this movie shouldn't be over analyzed, as I feel it creates a darker tone than what the movie tries to convey, after all it is a musical.The music is, in great part, the reason I love the movie. Combining the great performances and script with the perfectly synced dances and beautifully sung pieces only makes for a more enjoyable experience, especially with a musical nut such as myself. Among the memorable soundtrack my 4 favorite tracks are Summer Nights, Greased Lightning, You're The One That I Want and We Go Together.

Sure some have come very close to topping it off at My Number 1 Favorite. But Grease Is Special to me.How special? Well, I have the DVD, I Have The 25th Anniversary VHS With CD and Script and Tape of the film. I sing all of the songs when watching. Also, This is one of the few films that I want to be one of the characters, the few films that make me want to be one of the main and supporting roles in the stage musical that inspired it, its that special.One of the reasons Grease is perfect is because of the characters. Danny and Sandy stand out as one of the greatest couples in film. The casting of the characters is perfect! Also, There is an excellent amount of emotion. Not too much soft dialog, not to much rough dialog, the script knows exactly what to do with the characters.But I want to talk about the music. It is cherished by everyone around the world and is what made the movie so famous and a smash hit at the box office and earning an nomination at the Oscars for Best Original Song for Hopelessly Devoted to You. The songs have a awesome beat, clever and original lyrics, and some of the best choreography in a musical ever. If I had to choose my favorite song, it would be all of them! You just can't pick one.The Televised Dance Sequence is one of many show stoppers. I have never been amazed this much at this amazing sequence with such memorable songs such as Born To Hand Jive. It ends with a very funny scene that everyone will laugh out loud at.The movie portrays the 50's as a hot time with cool cars and gangs and high school chicks with fancy diners with jukeboxes and pregnancy rumors flying around town. The art direction is amazing and I wish I could see the production pictures made by Art Director Phillip M. Jefferies.Everyone will love Grease. Even Your Friend next door who is denying the fact that he hates it! Grease is the most special movie in the world for me. It is still to this day the highest grossing musical of all time and for a good reason.100/100 A+",Grease
142,torrascotia,Late to the party.,8,6 February 2020,"I had managed to avoid watching Grease for 44 years. The reason being that Grease is primarily a movie for girls. The reason I say that is that even as a child I can vividly remember girls reactions to the movie which was basically the same as they would to a boy band. This response is guaranteed to repel any male.
Not to mention its basically a love story from the female perspective and the males are basically goofballs along for the ride. All of the main characters are female, dont believe me? How many males versus females get their own song?
There are some very odd complaints about this movie which are common. First is they thinks its anti-women. Which is impossible being a female focused cast. The other so called ""anti-feminist"" belief about the movie is that they think the message to girls is they have to change for a man. This is bizarre. We know that both the lead male and female make superficial attempts to change for each other. So to argue that its only the female who makes an effort to change is easily proven wrong. Not only that but if anyone genuinely believes that changing your clothes and hairstyle (which they both did) means a change in personality then psychological science has it all wrong. Everyone has to make allowances for their partners but in this case it was basically two people who made small changes in order to be closer and in effect try and take on some of the others' personality or likes, to be together. The thing is it was obvious that this wasn't actually required of either of them.
What made me actually watch this was the current trend of live orchestral music during a movie. This is not a cheap option as its basically attending theatre (with theatre prices) while a movie plays. This is expensive event cinema. Luckily for me I obtained a complimentary ticket and attended, so this review is from someone who caught this as a movie with live orchestra which greatly enhanced the event. Basically without this I was unlikely to watch this on a big screen.Other odd complaints are that it feels dated (it was set in the 50s) or its not serious enough. If you want serious there is always Rumble Fish. This a musical comedy and supposed to be fun. Which it is. The enthusiasm of the cast and their joy on screen is what elevates this movie. Basically the grumps who dislike this are basically saying they don't enjoy watching people have a good time. Yes these people exist.
The music is iconic and the performances perfect, yes we all know that they arent kids in this movie but hey, if it was it wouldn't be as good.
There isn't much else to say about this apart from if you havent seen it you should as its part of the best American movies ever made. If your a guy, try your best to avoid watching it with large numbers of females (because they will get overly excited and sing along). And if you do get the chance watch it with the live orchestra, it brings a whole new level of enjoyment.",Grease
143,Jakemcclake,"Not a good message, but, sometimes fun",6,21 June 2010,"Well where do I start, it is far from my favorite movie. The songs were heavily overplayed in 1978, and ever since. It does not have a good message.It also has one good and very upbeat song, that they play during the dance-off. (I really don't know why that did not get played on the radio. I liked it a lot more than, ""Hopelessly Devoted To You"", ""Summer Lovin"" and ""You're The One That I Want"") This movie had not too great massages: fitting in is very important, and a girl has got to make a guy jealous, if she wants attention from him. A guy should change himself and become a jock for the sake of getting the girl.I really did not get the Travolta-Newton John magnetism either. Neither did many others, judging by the number of people who saw or even recall that they made a second movie together, six years later. (There's a Trivia Question)However, I watched it a number of time. There must be something about this movie that makes it palletable, when I have nothing else to do.",Grease
144,boyinflares,"Fun for everyone, but does it send a bad message?",9,17 November 2005,"Perhaps the best musical of all time, surely right up there with ""The Wizard of Oz"" and ""Chicago"", this 1977 film set in the 1950's and based on the play of the same name is fun from the opening credits until closing - and beyond.The musical numbers are outstanding, ""Summer Nights"" ""Hopelessly Devoted To You"", ""We Go Together"", ""You're The One That I Want"" and ""There Are Worse Things I Could Do"" are among my favourites. All the cast sing well and the dancing is amazing. Everyone looks great in the 1950's style outfits too, and the hair is awesome.Of course Olivia Newton-John, John Travolta and Stockard Channing are the stars of the show and are each amazing in their own right, but the supporting cast is terrific too. In particular, Didi Conn who plays Frenchy and, my favourite Dinah Manoff as the sultry Marty. Watch for Susan Buckner and Lorenzo Lamas in smallish roles as the school over-achiever and the school jock respectively. And let's not forget about Eve Arden and Dody Goodman as the school principal and her assistant, both so very funny.The one problem I see with this film is that it seems to send the message that if you want to be accepted by a new group of people then you need to change how you present yourself. All throughout the movie, Sandy (Newton-John) was never truly accepted by the Pink Ladies (except Frenchy), and Danny (Travolta) couldn't act like he liked her in front of his friends. I realise that those are genuine issues that take place at school, but the end result is disappointing, for Sandy changed her appearance and attitude, so everyone else could stay (mostly) the same. Still, it makes for a amazing movie.",Grease
145,neenahhh,Grease is the word,8,27 January 2011,"Great musical. All the songs were great and catchy. My favorites were Grease, Summer Nights, Look at Me I'm Sandra Dee, Hopelessly Devoted to You, Greased Lightning, You're the One that I Want and We Go Together. I'm glad Glee introduced Summer Nights and You're the One that I Want. Definite favorites.The plot wasn't really that superb, but it was good enough considering that it was a movie made in 1978! Now, this plot is sort of the ones you see in fan fictions. Bad boy falls in love with innocent girl. Not that unique, but whatever. It was an old movie! And I seriously cannot get over the great quality of the songs. I was really impressed. They're all so catchy! Such a great musical. I only wish I could see the play, for real.After watching the ending and that last dance scene, I thought that it reminded me of High School Musical. I think that the ending was so cliché. (SPOILERS) Did everyone really have to get paired up with the group of friends from the ""other group""? So unrealistic. Speaking of unrealistic, what was up with that flying car scene?! That was so out of place.The ending, where Danny let go off his bad boy image and Sandy changed from her cute innocent self to a ""bad girl"" wasn't the greatest. I didn't like it. I liked Sandy more as the pretty quiet girl. I'm sure it was meant to be an unexpected sort of twist, but I'm sure that there were people who got offended by that. (/SPOILERS)If you have nothing to do for 2 hours and want to spend it watching a musical filled with great songs, this is the movie for you! Grease is totally the word. It won't disappoint.",Grease

I mean, this kind, sweet, innocent, naive young woman (Sandy) changed her personality just for a man who, honestly, mistreated her horribly (Danny). The sexism in Grease is horrible in today's standards and an insult to girls and women that they need men to save them. I am disgusted that Grease tried to romanticize that idea.So don't bother watching this.",Grease
148,MUFCOK,One of the most iconic musicals of all time,7,17 July 2014,"Let me start by saying that I do not normally like musicals, in fact with Grease being a musical it put me off watching it until i was well into my 20's. Having watched it last night I can only say that I am disappointed that I didn't see it sooner. Plenty of iconic songs, superb dancing & choreography and an incredible cast.The story is simple and has the classic high school love story vibe, Boy and Girl like each other & boy doesn't want to admit to his friends that he is in love. 1) The music Everybody knows the main Grease songs such as Summer Lovin', Grease lightning and The one that I want. But believe me, there are many more fantastic songs that just those 3, there are maybe 10-12 songs over the duration of the movie and every single one fits perfect to the picture.2)Dancing & Choreography What can I say about John Travolta, it really surprised me how much of a great dancer he was. The whole cast put in great performances and the stages/scenes are created perfectly offering really interesting and sometimes outrageous dance scenes. 3) The Cast John Travolta and Olivia Newton-John are fantastic as leads in this movie, I couldn't fault them one bit. There on screen chemistry, especially when dancing is perfect. The supporting cast do their job and bring depth and excitement to the scenes.Overall i was thoroughly impressed with Grease, I went into it not expecting much as I said before, I don't usually like musicals. I would recommend this film to anyone looking for an easy watching, feel good film with a great soundtrack!",Grease
149,xbrad68,I danced with a Lady to Hopelessly Devoted to You,9,30 January 2006,"Grease is a romantic film. Within the past year I met a lady bass guitarist who told me she could take four if you know what I mean. Another lady made a very loud moan when I stood near her. All remind me of classic intelligence honeytraps. At least my Fiancé doesn't call the press when I offer proof that I am the American Shadow Vice President. The mainstream press is too afraid of making news of one Mans opinion usually anyways. American Shadow President Jack Kennedy is Godlike and still youthful looking in his 80s. Thats a fact Mister President I am not trying to ingratiate myself to you. I just happen to have the loyalty gene and thats why I keep a supply of Heinekin beer cold for you in case we talk face to face again like in 1997. Your message to me Hughs Uncle MIB Atoll ship was neat. I once had a beer and toasted with Goth rock lady singer Maria Del Mar at the Hideaway Bar. I told her that her opening act All Good Children sounded a bit like U2. I wished her and her band lots of success with their new album courage that was followed by Wildseed.

But is also has a massive appeal in a lot of other areas.Grease's charm lies mainly in the fact that it doesn't take itself too seriously. It is happy to be a goofy musical about a time that never really existed - it presents the 50's like a silly cartoon but makes it work and takes you along for the ride. Just sit back and enjoy.Parents be warned - there is more vulgarity in this movie than its sugar-coated surface would let you believe. (Trivia - Sonny mumbles something at the principal in dialect Italian. Any guesses? He ain't complementing her perfume).I love Grease - its ham-handed, corny, silly and 100% pure fun. ***1/2 out of ****.",Grease
151,jed-estes,Good Dance Movie.,10,17 August 2006,Great movie. The Soundtrack is even better. I love listening to the music. John Travolta made a great transition from Welcome Back Kotter on T.V to this a major motion picture. I hope that he one day comes back and does a proper Grease sequel with Olivia Newton John. I know they would probably be little old for this but with Travolta doing a new musical version of Hairspray maybe he can find this character in himself again and give us the sequel we deserve. The film however is great. Jeff Conway rocks as the bad boyfriend of Stockard Channing's character Rizzo and I love it when they kinda make up at the end. The supporting cast is very talented in there performances and it shows that they are talented dancers in the numbers that they perform. I say watch this movie when ever you can.,Grease
152,Richard_Alex_Jenkins,Surprisingly Entertaining,8,29 October 2021,"I remember watching Grease as a kid and loving it, but then growing up and going into denial and classifying it as cheesy nonsense, even the music.Then, a few years ago, I rediscovered the title track 'Grease ' by Frankie Valli, which bookends the movie and was written (did you know) by Barry Gibb? It's a fantastic song in its own right.I never considered watching this movie again, but one day just stumbled across it and gave it a whirl for old time's sake, only to find myself totally entertained with its mix of good music, friendly vibes, fun and jokes and great choreography. I never expected it in a million years!Maybe, like the original Star Wars or The Sound of Music, old flicks that were brilliant then, still remain fantastic today: great casting, scripting and dynamics that age really well.There are a few slow points in Grease, not all the music is perfect and not all the singers are top class either, nor will I conscientiously make an effort to watch it again, but Grease is a very enjoyable and uplifting experience.",Grease

I mean, it's better than most movies I've seen before. It's fun to watch, and the chemistry between Danny and Sandy is all so innocent. It has really great musical numbers sung by Olivia Newton-John, John Travoltra, and the rest of the cast, and it became a cult classic film, which will live forever.  Even today, the ""Grease"" legacy lives on!  Not bad.",Grease
154,frankwhat,Adorable,9,13 September 2004,"I hated this movie when I was a teenager and I'm so pissed at myself because of that. Looking at this movie now in my 20's I can appreciate what a fun-loving view of life this provides. All the songs are of at least decent quality but three of them in particular are just amazing. This is hands down one of the better musicals out there. The choreography can't be more well done than shown here. It's funny because I liked ""Saturday Night Fever"" better when I was younger but now I don't care for that movie and the exact opposite happened with this one...go figure. Olivia Newton-John is just gorgeous, why she didn't star in many movies afterward I'll never understand and god what a voice!!! John Travolta was great, and everyone else (especially Stockard Channing) were all fabulous. Oh and if you ever go to a Karaoke night make sure you do the ""Grease Megamix"" sometime throughout the night as it'll get the crowd pumped guaranteed.Final Synopsis:Movies : I did see this when I was in high school because it was re-released in the late 90's in theaters but stupid macho me back then didn't care for it.

So what's the problem? Answer: check the birthdates of the actors against when this movie was made.The cast was so far beyond high-school age when this movie was filmed, and it showed. Putting on high-school clothes and acting immature are not enough to wash away this terrible oversight. It's not like there aren't good actors of high-school age, and it's not like most movies don't cast young twentysomethings as high schoolers, but this movie went way too far.Stockard Channing as a sexy 17 year-old? She was THIRTY-THREE when this film was made, and she never was that sexy. Travolta was 23, Olivia Newton-John was 29, and Jeff Conaway was 27. There was plenty of good teen talent around at that age, but I suppose the musical requirements limited their search.The age problem ruins what was otherwise a great movie that should have been entitled: ""Grease: The Left-Back Years.""",Grease

157,ijonesiii,A Splashy Adaptation of a Broadway Hit,9,4 January 2006,"1978'S GREASE is the nearly perfect screen adaptation of the 1971 Broadway musical with a score by Jim Jacobs and Warren Casey. The musical centers around the romance between cheerleader/exchange student (Olivia Newton-John)and a hood (John Travolta). Travolta and Newton-John are charming leads but the film is practically stolen by Stockard Channing, in her knockout performance as Rizzo, the leader of the Pink Ladies and Danny's ex. The musical has been ""cleaned up"" for the big screen (the Broadway show was WAY raunchier) with sharp direction by Randal Kleiser and imaginative staging of the musical numbers by the stage show's choreographer Patricia Birch. Musical highlights include ""Summer Nights"" Danny and Sandy's duet on how they met. ""Greased Lightning"", ""Beauty School Dropout"", a very funny fantasy number led by Frankie Avalon, ""Born to Hand Jive"", and Channing's solo ""There are Worse Things I Could do"". As is the case with most Broadway to Movie Transitions, songs were cut and added. Some of the songs cut from the play can be heard as background music if you listen and ""Grease"", ""You're the One that I Want"", ""Hopelessly Devoted to You"", and ""Sandy"" were written directly for the screen. For many years, this film held the record as biggest moneymaking musical film ever and the validation is up there on the screen. It's a little corny and predictable, but you can't help but get caught up.

It's a cute '70s interpretation of the '50s, which was fun to watch back in 1978, and just seems to get better as time goes by. Everything from the songs to the '50s fashions, and the little sexual innuendos throughout, make this film memorable and endearing.  I am glad to see that it is available on DVD, but even if you opt to go for the VHS version, this movie will not disappoint.  The VHS version is mastered from a digital transfer, so it looks great!

160,Gambitt,"Entertaining, but sends the wrong message",5,15 November 2001,"Grease: the ultimate sell-out movie.As entertaining as the dance, song, cheesey sketches, etc. etc. are, the ultimate message of Grease is a bit disturbing.Basically, Sandy completely sells out.  After suffering rejection, she changes in the end.  She changes her clothes, her demeanor, her hair, even takes up smoking.  NOW she is accepted.  NOW she is cool.  NOW she has conformed.  NOW she is safely seated on the bandwagon.  And they live happily ever after...Don't young people have enough pressure and insecurities in life?

161,AzSumTuk,Boring,3,15 February 2010,"Well...I don't know what to say. I love musicals. I think John Travolta is a great actor. I love the song ""You Are The One That I Want"". I had never seen the movie until that night a few weeks ago when they aired it on the TV. I don't think I should hide it. I barely succeeded to watch the entire movie. It was just plain boring. I guess it was supposed to be a slice of the 60s teenagers's life but it just failed. The story was dumb and the acting was uninspired. All of the actors looked too old for their roles. It was kind of disturbing for me to see a 35 years old looking woman trying to act as a teenage girl. Come on... Stockard Channing looked old enough to be a teacher in that school, not a student. The same thing could be told about Olivia Newton-John and about every other teenage character in the movie. Of course this was not the only problem of the movie. It was not the biggest problem of the movie too. The story was idiotic and boring. What did they try to show us? Some boy and some girl in love? The conflict between the two bands? The teenagers' growing up? Whatever they wanted they didn't achieve it. The characters were one-dimensional and plain dumb.The songs were... Well, one of them was nice. Guess which. The others...

But then a film like Grease comes along.  I hate myself for liking it.  I hate, hate, hate myself.  But dammit, I do like this film.Grease is one of those rare creatures, a musical with a genuine heart.  It is effective. The characters are somewhat engaging, the music is downright infectious, and I really can't stand to say it, but the story is actually kind of fun.I am not a lover of fun movies.  I tend to like dark, sardonic comedies and darker dramas, but then there is something about boyant innocence of Grease. It is a fun film that actually succeeds at being fun.  I don't know if this is just because my older cousins (girls) used to play the soundtrack and lipsynch it to me when I was little.  Of if it was because of my love of 50s rock and roll.  Or even if it is because Olivia Newton-John looks hot as Sandy.  I don't know, but Grease is, and always will be, one of my guilty pleasures.",Grease
163,jrs-8,"Sizzles when the music is on, fizzles otherwise",7,3 August 2004,"It's simple to describe ""Grease"". When the musical numbers are on the screen the movie sizzles (for the most part). When the music is gone the movie fizzles, especially when John Travolta is not on screen.
On the whole ""Grease"" is an enjoyable film. It's not without its flaws though. A few of the musical numbers are downright awful. I especially dislike both of Stockard Channing's songs and since Channing is such a strong actress one must put the blame on the material itself. I have never been a big fan of the ""Beauty School Dropout"" number but it has started to grow on me through the years. As I said the film nearly washes out everytime the music stops and the story tries to move forward. One major flaw in the story has Travolta abruptly changing his mind about hanging with his friends to try and win Olivia Newton-John back. I don't mind that but the script gives Travolta no reasons for this change. It just happens. Another flaw is that these high school ""teenagers"" look too old to be believed.On the plus side are the terrific musical numbers. The dance contest sequence is far and away the best in the movie. As for the songs ""Summer Nights"" and ""You're the One That I Want"" take top honors for me with ""Sandy"", which takes place at a drive-in, and ""Hopelessly Devoted to You"" come in a close second.It's clearly obvious why Travolta became a superstar. He lights up the screen everytime he's on it. And when he sings and dances all bets are off. He's a captivating performer. One may wonder why Travolta chose to do ""Grease"" following the blockbuster success of his first major film, ""Saturday Night Fever"". The answer is simple. Travolta signed on and shot ""Grease"" before ""Fever"" was released. I have a feeling had he known the phenomenon ""Fever"" was going to be he would have either done another project in between or turned this down all together.""Grease"" is an enjoyable romp but far from the classic some have touted it as being. I say watch and enjoy and you'll be humming some of the tunes for days after.",Grease
164,Putzberger,Grease is the Worst,2,14 April 2007,"Post-""Welcome Back Cotter"" and ""Saturday Night Fever,"" John Travolta was the biggest star on Earth in 1978. The teenyboppers would have lined up around the block if someone had filmed Travolta picking his nose for two hours. Unfortunately, he did ""Grease"" instead.""Grease"" bears little relationship to the fun, modestly-scaled stage musical from which it takes its name. It looks a lot more like a late-70s ABC TV special with a gargantuan budget. All the elements that made ABC such a pandering, lowbrow success are present: a phony, sugar-coated portrait of the 1950s (a la ""Laverne & Shirley""), smirking double-entendres (a la ""Three's Company""), and, of course, Travolta. The musical numbers even look cadged from a variety show -- the camera is so static during the ""Beauty School Dropout"" number you'll think it's a colorized episode of Ed Sullivan. And thematically, it's all about the importance of being cool -- could there be a more TV-worthy message? Add in special guest appearances by a battalion of TV has-beens (poor Sid Caesar) and you have an insanely overwrought sweeps-month special splashed onto the silver screen for a filmgoing public which had its collective standard lowered by ""Happy Days."" The plot, such as it is, involves John Travolta falling in love with Olivia Newton-John, and the pair encountering a handful of easily overcome obstacles, the greatest of which seems to by Livvy's penchant for straight hair and cardigan sweaters. Travolta has made a career of looking comfortable in ridiculously contrived circumstances, and as Danny Zuko, he's perfectly believable belting out an angst-drenched torch song in front of an animated hot dog jumping into a bun. The lovely Miss Newton-John fares much worse. She can't act and she's a very limited singer (please note ""Have You Never Been Mellow""), and up to this point she had survived on her sincerity and sweetness (again ""Have You Never Been Mellow""). The transformation of her character Sandy from sap to sex goddess neatly parallels Olivia's not-wholly-successful attempt to do the same with her career: she spent the years after ""Grease"" trying to be sultry, kind of a pre-Madonna Madonna, and all she wound up with was a million-selling aerobics anthem (""Physical""). As for the supporting cast, it's a pretty mixed lot. There are bona fide talents like Stockard Channing, who plays Rizzo, leader of the girls' gang the Pink Ladies, and is far too old for the role but brings real sassiness to ""Look At Me, I'm Sandra Dee"" and real sadness to ""There Are Worse Things I Could Do."" And there are pieces of human scenery like Jeff Conaway, who plays ""Kenickie,"" the world's least threatening thug. And there are slumming pros like Eve Arden and Joan Blondell, who add nostalgia appeal and look happy to be getting a paycheck. The songs, save for the obscenity-sprinkled ""Greased Lightning,"" are pretty bland and sound like overproduced cover versions of 50's R&R, plus, the musical sequences in the film are utter yawns to a generation raised on the jump-cut editing of MTV. If your attention doesn't wander while Livvy is wandering around a back yard warbling the Connie Francis knockoff ""Hopelessly Devoted To You,"" you have superhuman powers of concentration. So why do I know so much about this movie, which I dislike so much? Well, I was a tween in the late 70s, when pop culture was boring put flawlessly promoted, so people my age were force-fed bilge like ""Grease"" and swallowed it whole. (Please note, at least we gagged on ""Sgt Pepper's Lonely Hearts' Club Band."")",Grease
165,Cylex,Enjoyable musical with great cast,9,8 December 2002,"Everyone in this movie from the main stars to the hundreds of dancers clearly enjoyed themselves and so will you. My favourite character was Kenickie played by Jeff Conaway. (He also plays Bobby in Taxi.) He was the coolest in my opinion and he really ought to have sung Greased Lightning, saying it was his car. At least he got some cool dance moves to make up for it. The T-Bird trio were fun to watch, providing a steady run of practical jokes & gags. John & Olivia had great chemistry especially during the fantastic end sequence. The songs stick in your head, especially Summer Nights, You're the One & We Go Together. The dance routines were electrifying and well worth seeing again. The plot is thin but who cares? It's the music & actors who make this film what it is. 9/10",Grease

Kids in my school where all into the Grease fashions & we would practice the Grease dances in the school yard at break time....Oh how times have changed! I often wonder why this classic, fun film is never re-run on TV anymore (I am in the UK) as it hasen't been since the early 80's & the simple answer is that it is not ""progessive"" & shows a time the socialist elite like to call ""past mythical nostalgia"" which may upset ""global citizenship"" neoliberal state education, so I must add a word of warning to our gentle youth. Grease is not for the PC minded, diversity, inclusive, female empowerment brigade & who will find Grease's primary message of ""girl must dress up like a tart to get her man"" will be decidedly disturbing!Yet for those of us who can remember a time of fun, entertainment, enjoyment & free thinking, Grease is & will remain a sublme, exquisite peice of entertaining JOY! A down to earth age old tale of boy meets girl with excellent song & dance numbers which may still be played today. There is no underlying message or agenda in Grease as it is simply a movie to put a smile on you face, sing a long to the tunes & tap your feet.

When the powers that be got around to doing the film version they blew it up out of all recognizable proportions into a bubble gum cartoon that (to everyone's surprise) captured the essential insouciance of the original. It was buoyed by the canny casting of a number of performers (not least John Travolta's Danny Zuko) who had prepared for their roles in various stage productions.All well and good as far as that went, and the movie with its (dishonest to the period and piece) overlay of Bee Gees music and re-orchestration of the stage score became an enormous commercial hit as well.Viewers discovering the piece today will undoubtedly have a ball with the broad thesping of Travolta (newly shorn of the baby fat so in evidence in his early Broadway run with the Andrews Sisters in a musical called OVER HERE and subsequent TV ""Sweathog"" role on WELCOME BACK KOTTER), the bizarrely cast but delightful Olivia Newton John (""Sandy's"" supposed to be a transfer student but from Australia!?!) and Stockard Channing's Rizzo (not yet having played her career defining roles in SIX DEGREES OF SEPARATION or THE BIG BUS), but those who love the original musical will always lament a bit that the solid success of the movie bodes ill to forever distort potential audience expectations and prevent a honest revival of the superior but small original stage piece.GREASE has been back on Broadway once already at this writing (a long run revival top billing Rosie O'Donnell and later Brooke Shields, both as ""Rizzo"") and at this writing is scheduled for an ill cast (by a national ""reality show"" elimination contest) summer revival during 2007. BOTH revivals were designed to be pointedly closer to the unsubtle aesthetic of the movie than the original Broadway staging. Productions like this have to be about making money as much as about making art, but if the movie had been a bit more about making art (as the occasional superb SUCCESSFUL movie musicals since GREASE - think CHICAGO - have been), the stage revivals would have been far better and probably more successful.Fun film, but one can't help thinking of the old (inaccurate) joke about Chinese food - an hour later you'll be hungry for some real intellectual stimulation.",Grease
168,EmDee-427-469344,Too slimy to be grease,1,17 January 2016,"This is a sexist piece of rubbish. The girl has to get into tight clothes and talk about shaping up to be with the guy who supposedly likes her as she is (as long as his friends aren't around while she is as she is). Way to tell girls they need to be fake and put on prostitutes clothing to get a boy and way to tell boys how to treat girls and what to expect from them.The songs and script also degrade girls. Any girl who has a boyfriend and everyone knows she is ""putting out"" is labeled a tramp and teased while the guys get to dance around dry humping on the pussy wagon like cave men and celebrating while sharing stories of their conquests (even fake stories i.e. that in ""Summer loving"" from his perspective).A really unattractive and sleazy adult male is able to pick up a minor female student at a dancing contest purely because he's on the radio and no other adults care or notice. No sex offender registry for that obvious repeat offender with his smooth ""I'm in your bedroom"" line.I'm not the first to mention this but the actors are so old most of them should have been playing the parents of school kids. Stockard Channing even had freckles obviously drawn on her face with an eyeliner pencil to make her look younger. It didn't work.Overall the songs are catchy and if you don't listen to the lyrics you might think it's a cute love story. Listen to the lyrics and you'll see what the real message and purpose of the movie is. Encouraging young people to change themselves because they think what someone else wants is more important than what they want. A fake greasy life they will regret later dressed up in a flying car.",Grease
169,annmason1,Don't You Wish,10,23 November 2005,"A really good movie. I have news for the critics who find it childish and adolescent and inane. We are talking the 50s here. What do you want, substance? Relax and enjoy.John Travolta is at his best. The whole cast is matched and to watch this film brings back memories you never had of high school to start with. Yeah, you wish you did.I like Grease because it is escapist, as all good movies are. You come away having been away from your daily life. The music is fun, the situations not impossibly like those of that era. Whoever wrote Grease sure was there! There has not been another musical like it, and it is better than just an American Grafetti with dance numbers. It is really more like that time of history than Lucas came up with.Well worth watching.",Grease
170,johnm_001,This was a hit?,1,5 October 2000,"The dumbness of this film, and its mediocre production values, make its hit status an utter mystery.  Like the television show, ""Happy Days"", ""Grease"" is a 70's version of the 50's.  Not for a second are you lost in the decade in which the film is set.  It is far too 1970's in its feel, for that. The film's only appeal comes from its two stars, the only cast members who look young enough to be in high school.  The rest of the over-the-hill gang mugs and overacts, shamelessly.  It is horribly directed and the musical numbers look like rejects from a much better show.  The film of course isn't entirely to blame.  The stage production of ""Grease"", is just as bad. Perhaps worse.  It's all a matter of taster. So if ""Grease"" is the word for you, then by all means, enjoy.  I didn't.",Grease

172,shinedowness,Obnoxious Characters,5,29 May 2017,"I found myself appalled by Sandy's transformation from good girl to edgy wanna-be. Even though this film has the edgy T-Birds, I found Danny to be the guy to be hiding his nice boy feelings. I felt Danny and Sandy were superficially acting to fit in with the popular people. To me, Danny was only ""cool"" when he was dancing and singing. Otherwise, Sandy and him annoyed me. Rizzo did not annoy me. I liked her singing, dancing, and naturally whimsical attitude. Though, I dislike how she disguised her vulnerability with humor to cope with her situation to Kennickie. Musically and choreographically, this film is top notch on my end. Characterization-wise, I would say that this film is not suitable for educating people on how to have healthy relationships, though.",Grease
173,thehappychuckler,Great Mix of Music/Comedy/Romance,8,12 April 2021,"This classic musical/comedy/romance has two big things going for it. One is the great music as there is not one bad song in the bunch. Very catchy and people are still singing to this day. Number two is the plain fun you have watching it.Two teens Danny Zuko (John Tavaolta) and Sandy Olson (Olivia Newton-John) have fallen in love during the summer. When school starts up again the two have each gone their separate ways. So Danny tells a few fibs about his summer and the girl he met. Sandy though ends up at Rydell High where Danny is for the school year. Danny acts differently around Sandy and is not the same caring, warm boy he was in the summer. So Danny must get himself back into shape or show the true person he is or he will lose Sandy forever.The film is also loaded with sexual innuendos and I would suggest to forget how old the actors appear to be. I mean yes they all look like they are pushing 30, but the whole point is to enjoy the musical numbers and laugh. Also starring Stockard Channing who plays the memorable Rizzo who is the gang The Pink Ladies that Sandy later joins, Jeff Conaway as Danny's best buddy Kenickie and even a musical number from Frankie Avalon. A winner and not to be missed if you are a fan of musicals, Newton-John or Travolta.",Grease
174,lukecon-63436,"The first 30 minutes are excellent, and then...",6,21 July 2021,"30 minutes into Grease, I enjoyed it. Rest of the film, I kept thinking to myself: Where has this once-promising story gone?The problem with the film Grease is that it starts out great, then doesn't seem to do much with what it has accomplished in the first 30 minutes of it. Essentially, Grease doesn't bother to advance the rest of its runtime into something that could quite have been possibly great, but instead ignores its story in favor of unnecessary scenes that don't advance anything.These scenes are littered throughout the rest of the runtime, and unfortunately don't advance much of the story. However, that being said, there are some great musical numbers you'll find in Grease, with an excellent number of ""Summer Nights"", which happens early in the film.The film is very engaging in the opening scenes, and it manages to draw your attention as a result. John Travolta and Olivia-Newton John are very good in their roles, but otherwise, I didn't see a whole lot special about this film.Also, the film has mixed messages in terms of the conclusion. For some reason, at the end of the film, Olivia-Newton John changes her appearance from being her normal self to changing into a completely different self. So much for ""being yourself"". I thought that's what the film was supposed to be about.Of course, this new appearance Olivia-Newton John dons attracts John Travolta, which then leads to the closing musical number that ends the film. And, that's when I think to myself: I thought this was one of the greatest musicals of all time. I'm sorry, but I see it as a little too overrated.",Grease
175,films-22537,Prefect! Despite not really being a movie.,10,24 February 2020,"At times it feels more like a collection of music videos than a movie. With paper thin characters, no real plot, forward movement, drama or conflict. Sure, things come up that seem like they put our heroes in a difficult spot. Pressure to have sex, dropping out of school, teenage pregnancy, a potential deadly drag race, a gang fight, but then you look down at your phone for a text or tweet and you completely missed the 5 seconds of runtime the filmmakers took to resolve said issue before the next musical number. So why do we or I all love this movie so much? I think when you have really likable characters you don't want to see anything bad happen to them, especially teenagers. Because we've all been at that point in our lives where our future is ahead of us, we think we know it all, we think the friends and loves we have at that time will be there for the rest of our lives. However, we now know almost all of those things are false and our parents that we rebelled against so much for telling us what to do were right about almost everything they warned us about, but man oh man wouldn't it be cool if our past selves or these characters were right? So yeah, much like, ""may the force be with you"" and ""I'll be back."" ""Grease is the word!""",Grease

177,larrysmile1,RYDELL HIGH SCHOOL - CLASS OF 1959,9,27 December 2001,"In 1959 I was 17 years old and a junior in High School. How do you cast actors to play 18-year-old high school seniors about to graduate? You don't look for actual high school seniors  - that's how! Because, the industry would not have such acting talent available with the experiences of singing, dancing, and acting to make this film. Solution? You cast, 34 year old Stockard Channing, 30 year old Olivia Newton-John, 31 year old Annette Charles, 28 year old's Jeff Conaway and Michael Tucci, 27 year old's Didi Conn and Susan Buchner, 24 year old John Travolta, 22 year old Kelly Ward, 21 year old Eddie Deezen, and 20 year old Dinah Manoff to play the roles of high school seniors. Believable? YES.
You can get away with the 45 year old Edd Byrnes as Vince Fontaine and the 38-year-old Frankie Avalon as the teen idol. Joan Blondell was a 72-year-old waitress! Eve Arden was a 70-year-old principal? Dody Goodman was 63 and still a school secretary. Sid Caesar was 56 and still coaching? Alice Ghostley was a 52-year-old auto shop teacher? No kudos to TBS who broadcast an edited version on 12/26/01 eliminating some of the great sophomoric comedy scenes from the film. An example is Sid Caesar's ""admonition"" to the senior class at the gym before the dance was to be televised. The comedy was that he ""laid down the rules"" and the students in student fashion broke them during the dance contest. But, this scene was not shown. Edd Byrnes scene trying to ""put the make"" on Marty Maraschino was also cut as well as some of the attempts by Sid Caesar to find a sport that John Travolta could ""letter"" in. High school comedy is replete with ""innocent sexual innuendoes."" Such is a transition from juvenile to being an adult -- which is what high school is all about, anyway! Don't eliminate them for the sake of a ""G"" rating. Just show Grease after the kiddies go to bed!Now, although the entire cast garners praise for this movie performance back in 1978, the real show stopper is Stockard Channing. Without her Betty Rizzo character as a subplot there would be major weakness in this screenplay. Ms. Channing's performance is the strongest acting of all the ""student"" players. She brought to the role the struggles of typical high school students who don't always fit into the peppy, socialite, ""Patty Simcox"" roles where everything is provided to spoil the student; where her daddy doesn't buy her a fancy car; where her clothes are functional and not typical ""coming out"" wear. But, Stockard Channing makes this role believable. She is sympathetic to understanding her character. She is a decent person trying to find her identity on the brink of adulthood. She is searching for a good love relationship and absorbs the heat thrown her way by fellow female students who are ""boy teasers."" Rizzo is real. Ms. Channing's rendition of the song, ""There Are Worse Things I Could Do"" solidifies her character in song. Without that song there would have been a terrible ""gap"" in this film. Ms. Channing ""carried"" all her scenes and deserves the ultimate praise for helping to make ""Grease"" the hit movie that it is! When you watch Grease again, make sure you catch an unedited version to fully appreciate it!If a cable station is going to play ""marathon"" movies back to back then there is no reason to make them fit into a neat time slot. Fit the commercials in, if one must, but let the movies run full time! Cutting films is not the act of ""preserving"" good quality motion pictures for future generations!Once again, the highest accolades to Stockard Channing. She will always be remembered for her Rizzo role in Grease! Well done, Ms. Channing.When I was a senior you were a sophomore... hummmmm!",Grease
178,bellabanana93,Amazing Soundtrack,10,20 October 2017,"I've been in love with this movie ever since the first time that I saw it over a decade ago. It was a great classic then, and it's still a great classic now. I have all of these songs on my Spotify playlist and for good reason as they never get old. The first song and Greased Lightning are my favorite songs of the show, but it is a hard choice since all of the songs are amazing.This movie just makes me happy every time I watch it. I love the beginning scene with Danny and Sandy on the beach. I love how Sandy is introduced to the pink ladies. I love the ending of the movie and I love the sense of humor in the show. Sonny, Frenchy, and Rizzo are amazing supporting characters. No matter how sad I am- this movie puts a smile on my face. If you like musicals and romance movies, you are in for a treat.",Grease

Grease was on my list too, but just later. Anyway, I didn't expect to love the movie, it's from a different era, an era I did not exist in. But it is enjoyable. It bought back all the songs I've loved so much and didn't know were from Grease! And Olivia Newton-John (Sandy), is a charm, an angel. I am currently singing Hopelessly Devoted To You on repeat! The movie is entertaining, sweet and has lots of dancing. Maybe it's outdated for my tastes, but it's not a bad watch and if you want an idea of what the 70s looked like, it paints a nice picture.I love musicals but here the songs are better than the entire movie and that isn't a good sign.",Grease
180,BeccaGudd,Grease deserves more than 7,10,9 November 2018,Grease is a classic and a movie that never gets old! I think most people have seen it but just incase well it stars Olivia Newton John as Sandy Olsen who has come to Rydell High in California from Australia. She spent the summer with Danny Zuko played by John Travolta. The movie shows Danny trying to win back Sandy and the experience along the way with lots of colourful characters. It's a musical so there's lots of singing but the songs are fantastic. I think the dance scenes were choreographed really well and the actors perform so well. Especially John Travolta in the Greased Lightning routine. Great film and great soundtrack too!,Grease
181,CalvinValjean,The Moral Corruption of Sandy,7,28 March 2007,"Grease definitely has a fun energy to it, and all of the cast has great chemistry. That's the main reason that this film, despite being nearly 30 years old and set 20 years earlier than that, still manages to appeal to young people of today who laugh and have fun with it, and of course, sing those timeless songs. So hats off to Grease for that.Now that being said: the movie is incredibly stupid! It's basically a 90 minute episode of Happy Days or Saved By the Bell in which we follow various plot lines in a high school, strung together by the fun songs. We're treated to such stupid dialog as: ""This year, I don't take no crap from nobody."" ""Yes, ma'am. No, ma'am."" ""Hey, it's Eugene!"" In one plot line, Frenchy (who's a memorable character but dumber than a bag of nails) becomes a beauty school drop out. However, aside from being an excuse for Frankie Avalon to sing that song, the plot line goes nowhere and she still magically graduates high school along side everyone else. Who knew it was so easy to drop out and get back in? But then there's the main plot line: two youths named Danny and Sandy fall in love one summer, which is just fine in the real world, but once back in high school, they realize they're in different social cliques; he's a greaser and she's a goody-goody. Throughout the school year their relationship takes several turns, before arriving at an absurd ending in which all problems are magically solved by Sandy getting a makeover and becoming ""cool."" The message here is so superficial that it's actually funny: ""Give in to peer pressure and be whatever kind of person you need to be to make your boyfriend or girlfriend happy."" Considering Sandy has been celibate through all of the movie till now, I think it's implied Danny will get a nice surprise that night; a message to give to young girls, ha ha.So, to wrap up this little review, Grease certainly has its moments, and IS a well-made movie musical, or else it wouldn't have the audience it does. It's a feel-good movie; it just has zero substance.",Grease

183,jennifer_litchfield,Star rating: 5 out of 5,9,11 February 2003,"Grease is everything a musical film should be.  It is a visual and aural feast that has captured the imaginations of audiences for over 25 years. Everything is larger than life and the action occurs amidst a riot of 1950s colour.  Who cares if the cast is largely composed of 30-somethings playing teenagers?  The key to Grease's success is not realism, but the enormous amount of infectious energy exuded by the cast. This zest for life is particularly apparent in the lively and eminently sing-able chorus song-and-dance numbers.  The tunes of retro party favourites such as 'Greased Lightning' and 'You're The One That I Want' will probably be familiar to many viewers, but lesser known songs, including the short and sarcastic 'Look At Me I'm Sandra Dee' and 'Beauty School Drop-Out' (with Frankie Avalon in the role of guardian angel) are also fun toe-tappers.  Musicals work best when, like Grease, they concentrate on the music rather than the plot; however, the story here is completely adequate.  Sandy and Danny had a summer fling at the beach, but at school Danny has an image to uphold - which Sandy doesn't really fit - so their senior year at Rydell High is spent in a daze of ""will-they-won't-they"" teenage angst.John Travolta and Olivia Newton-John set the screen alight as Danny and Sandy; there are some fabulous character roles in the ""Pink Ladies"" and ""T-Birds"" school cliques, and some very funny cameos - particularly the pairing of Principal McGee and Blanche the office lady.  There are sexual innuendoes aplenty if you look hard enough, and despite the fact that the movie is set half a century ago, the viewer is led to conclude that teenagers have been, and will always be, teenagers.",Grease

At one point she says ""Beauty school sure wasn't what I thought it would be"" and gets the reply ""Nothing ever is."" At the school dance she says ""How do I look?"" and her partner replies ""like a beautiful blonde pineapple!""

The soundtrack is fun, safe, sane, well taken care of in the distribution of the musical notes. One of the most intelligent scenes is at the house where there is a well staged scene of a ""pajama party"". The boy though is not feature in the ""pajama party"": he is racing cars -a la REBEL WITHOUT A CAUSE-, an error of the movie perhaps. The final scene is a -rock opera- enthusiast of safe entertainment: the boy though is not well is those black leather pants, but the overall scenery is acceptable.

186,hokiemo,That's entertainment!,10,14 November 2005,"""Grease"" is a quality musical with a tremendous cast. Danny Zuko (Travolta) and Sandy (Olivia Newton-John) meet at the beach during summer vacation and fall in love. Sandy has to return to Australia, but then her family unexpectedly decides to stay in the USA. She enrolls at Rydell High School having no idea that Danny attends there. When they finally run into each other, Danny acts differently because his friends are watching and he has a tough guy image. Sandy is very upset by Danny's behavior and although she tries to get over him, she can't deny her feelings for him. Danny is a sweet guy at heart and does his best to win Sandy back. The entire cast is well chosen and the chemistry between John Travolta and Olivia Newton-John is perfect. The choreography is excellent, especially in Greased Lightning and the dance-off contest. Some viewers have commented that they don't like the fact that Sandy changes her image at the end of the movie. I didn't think this was a big deal, but I guess one could interpret this as a result of peer pressure. I think Sandy was waiting until she was confident enough to deal with the consequences of an adult relationship with Danny. Sandy sings that she's scared and unsure of herself shortly before her transformation. Another viewer comment I read is that the viewer thought it was bad that the Pink Ladies never accept Sandy as one of their own. The Pink Ladies not completely accepting Sandy is extremely realistic of cliques. I think it is positive that Sandy strived for the relationship she wanted with Danny despite the comments and jabs from the Pink Ladies. If we all waited for the acceptance of other people before pursuing something, most of us would still be waiting around 20 years later.I'm glad casting decided to choose 2 leads who can sing instead of picking non-singers to lip sync. The film gives you a good idea of what going to high school in the 1950s is like with the peer pressure, cliques, music, clothes, etc. I wouldn't change a thing about this movie.",Grease
187,Michael1958,How you view this film may determine your love or hate of it!,3,15 September 2002,"Okay, I am not a big fan of this film. The first time I saw it-I found it apalling, repulsive and downright idiotic. However, with age-I now look upon it in a slightly different light. It is to the musical-what Ed Wood's Plan Nine From Outer Space is to the horror genre. It is so bad, it is funny. Remember, this film came out in a time in film history when it was at it's lowest. Very few films made in the 70's are what you could call classics. Yes, there are some-but this ain't one of them! The music overall is terrible, the dance numbers even more wretched and the acting-arghhhhhh! Still, if one watches it from another angle and that of such an awful film that it is funny-then it has much to offer. Travolta was and is about the worst actor to ever have been able to secure a lead in a big film. He ranks up there with such other film legends as Sonny Tufts, Lex Barker and Jock Mahoney. Yet, he does entertain with his unique style of being awful-especially in this movie. His role in this film is only topped by his horrible performance in Urban Cowboy-that film and this can only be explained as a way Hollywood wanted to reach out to redneck americans.  If you liked this film I am sorry to be so harsh. After having seen so many great musicals-I cringe at the thought of this being lumped into the same genre.

190,karenlynn1,See the stage production. not this disco version.,2,13 February 2006,"If you're going to do a revival movie of the 50's. By all means, do a revival movie of the 50's.GREASE is not a 50's revival. It mixes two decades, the fabulous fifties and the groovy seventies. And it pulls it off--oddly enough--successfully. That is, to the large population that love the lead actors, and are not frequent Theater patrons. For me, the only TRUE Grease is the Broadway Musical. I dislike both movies, and was reluctant to see the Musical. However, when my cousin took me to see a recent performance for my birthday I truly appreciated the experience. What's the difference? well despite the fact that the movie stayed relatively close to the main story, the music was all wrong. They've replaced a lot of 50's do-wop songs with updated disco numbers. ""You're the one that I want"" replacing ""All choked up"" ...a disco version of the Bo Diddley classic ""hand jive"", and Sandy's vocal solo ""It's Raining on Prom Night"" (which in the musical, is key to the plot since Sandy was not at the dance) becoming a background track, barely noticeable in the Prom scene. Another huge difference is that the movie is less funny than the stage production. Many of the funnier scenes were omitted or completely revamped. For instance, in the prom scene the character Cha-Cha wasn't a hot Latina in the play, but a chubby girl who Danny was plagued with at the prom. THe mooning scene was an entire musical number, with the T-birds singing about their favorite prank. and the ending was just more fun. And now let's talk about the acting. These actors were way too old to be Seniors in High School. While I truly enjoy Stockard Channing's acting she looked as if she would have children in high school--not a high school girl who wonders if she's with child. Well all of them acted well, they still looked way too old to play their characters--even Newton-John and Travolta. But it was a big career boost for the then-disco king, and the pretty Australian songstress. It paid off for both of them.But it cheapened the musical for me by ""updating"" too much. It worked with 50's do wop numbers, and I found the disco style songs (you're the one that I want, and Grease) totally jarring. In short: If it isn't broke, don't fix it. I give it 3/10.",Grease
191,Jaymay,Hey Putsie...15 minutes,10,4 September 2004,"GREASE was on AMC tonight and I happened to catch it.This movie is so great. There's no pretension to it. It is really hard to make a movie musical that isn't pretentious and uppity. Has anyone watched ""Chicago"" lately, even though it got all those Oscar noms? Yeah, I thought not.Sure, everyone's seen the movie. But here are a few facts about it you might not know.The original Broadway production was a hit, but the music was REALLY hokey and many of the songs were different.Can you imagine a movie musical being made today from a musical where new songs are added that are BETTER than the originals? Grease (the opener), Sandy, Hopelessly Devoted and You're the One That I Want are all new for the movie, and all are now classics.It's fun to watch the Pink Ladies scenes knowing that Stockard Channing was 33 and Dinah Manot, who played Marty, was only 18 when the movie was being filmed.(Side note -- if you haven't seen Dinah Manot in Ordinary People, watch it -- you'll be amazed at what a good actress she was).Another interesting cast note: the woman who played Jan (brusha brusha brusha) basically was in this movie and that's it except for like three tiny cameo roles in other films. How's that for a film career -- one movie and it's one of the biggest hits of all time! Not bad!When you talk about the movie version of Grease, you have to talk about Travolta. Seeing the bloated, bad actor that he's become, you have to go back and watch this movie to realize that this guy is one of the most talented all-around comedians who ever hit a screen. He can sing, he can dance, he's funny as hell, and he has a style all his own. I dare you to find a young actor today who pops off a screen as much as Travolta did. Unbelievable.The thing I love most about Grease is that it was such an underdog as a project.Helmed by a 31 year old TV director Randal Kleiser (who was George Lucas's roommate at USC, and apparently wrote his own IMDb biography, so maybe he'll read this and correct my mistakes), Paramount didn't expect much out of this movie, and they kind of left the young cast and director to do their thing. There's a fast-and-looseness to the movie, an almost improvisational feel at times, yet the comic timing is always DEAD ON.This is a movie that respects comedy. Sid Caesar, Eve Arden -- these are giants of comedy that were at a career ebb around 1977, and the director shouldn't have been able to get them, but he did, and they make the movie hugely better.But it's all about the young cast. You can tell that this is a group of actors that really felt like friends and were just having a good time. You've got actors in their late 20s and early 30s playing high schoolers, but somehow it's the best of both worlds -- there's plenty of sophomoric humor, but when Stockard C. sings ""There are worse things,"" she gives it a depth Christina Aguilera never could . You've got actors like Jeff Conaway who never really did anything even close to good after this but he's brilliant as Kenickie. You've got a screenplay written by some woman I've never heard of who, once again, dropped off the face of the earth after this movie -- but how many classic lines are in this movie?! It's just amazing.I salute every one who was a part of Grease. I loved it as a little kid and I still love it today.JM",Grease
192,joltjohn,A good movie with even better musical numbers,8,3 November 2002,"Grease as a movie is a  good movie.  Just like Footloose, it is the songs and the dancing in it that make it so enduring and rewatchable. I think the acting is okay for the most part. The best performance comes from Stockard Channing as Rizzo the leader of the Pink Ladies.  She has the most complex character to play and she pulls it off very well. I think the actions of the T-Birds minor players, Doodie, Sunny, Putzzie are immature and stupid and don't seem to fit in with Danny   and Kenickie coolness and take away from this movie; just like Jar Jar  ruined Star Wars everytime he was in a scene.  Look even their names are dumb. THe least enjoyable song and dance number was ""Beauty school Dropout"" because i thought it was an unneccesarry  detour in  the movie. The best song and dance number was ""You're the One I Want"" because I liked Oliva Newton John in that black outfit and ""Summer Nights"" because of  the way Danny and Sandy are singing together. I was more interested in following the relationship between Rizzo and Kenickie which had more layers and complications to it thAN OF Danny and Sandy which was simply a love story of bad boy and good girl falling for each other. There are  a lot of subtle and not so subtle references to taboo stuff, like teenage sex, oral sex, condum use, pregnacy, corutption of a minor by a tv personality, underage drinking and smoking, street racing and how the best way to get someone to love you is to change who you are even if that means dressing like some street walker; which I found surprising in a movie from the 1970's aimed at it's target audience of young people. So overall this movie is enjoyable and gets 8/10 in my books",Grease
193,stephen7272,Musical Masturbation,6,14 April 2013,"However much sugar you coat this with, Grease is a movie about teenagers expectations for future sex. The film is essentially split into two components. The first is the pre- puberty story of boy loves girl with sugar coated candy floss. The second, the post-puberty, part of the film only takes up the last 15 minutes, is about boys and girls doing the stuff they do prior to back-seat copulation.As a musical the songs essentially come from the pages of a girlie magazine for 13 year old wannabee love hearts. But as adults we view this with nostalgia, for those days before we had to go to work, take out mortgages and bring up families of our own. It reflects that short period of exciting sexual frustration and freedom that society soon inoculates us against until we rediscover it somewhere around our mid-50's.More socially importantly, this is a movie about the beginnings of the Baby Boomer generation.",Grease

195,SilkTork,Whose Tongue In Whose Cheek?,7,2 August 2003,"Surprisingly edgy, rough, and naughtily tongue-in-cheek, this is a great feel good movie that, well, makes you feel good. This is not smooth, flick and over-polished, it is a take it or leave it rough house of a movie. Nothing is ever pinned down, nothing is ever taken seriously, it just flickers  from one set scene to another, flashing knickers, posing, sticking out it's tongue like a bunch of schoolkids making a home movie. Great fun and great songs. My only complaint is the miming of the songs - for such a rough diamond I'd expect the singing to be as unpolished and dirty as the rest of the film.",Grease

197,Evolvist,Re-visited,6,22 July 2003,"The songs are wonderful (all but the `Sandra Dee' number), the scene with Travolta trying out for the different sports is top notch, and this musical/movie has been an inspiration for many.  The last 15 minutes of the movie is pure musical brilliance (except for possibly the dumbest scene in musical history: when the car started to fly).  Personally, I had not seen this movie in 18 or 20 years, and I must admit that it has tarnished quite a bit for me over time.  In fact, I can only give it a 6.8/10Bottom line, I think most people must have a sentimental attachment to `Grease' in order to like it after all these years.  Too much fluff for me, but I can see why people dig it.  Not that I cannot get into syrupy type movies; however, I found myself loathing the parts where it sounded like everyone talking at once.  There was very little breathing space and only so many leather jackets and 30-year-old teenagers the eye could take.  Also I am more of a film-as-art critic than I was the first million times I saw `Grease"" )back in the early eighties).  Don't get me wrong. I mean, I am of the generation in which this movie came out; nevertheless, I have since become a firm believer in keeping stage productions off the silver screen.  Combining the two genres has done nothing but muddy the waters a bit.  It is like 99% of the time when a band covers a song it is never as great as when the original artists did it. What's more, it does not really seem like art to me when a Director or a Producer takes an existing stage production and trys to pass it off to the film crowd as something new.  If all it takes to make a box office smash is to take someone elses work, add a few extra lights, nifty camera angles, and a few big names, then hell, I want a piece of that action!  It is a lazy man's game and it does not support artistic integrity.  A case in point, take any opera, film it, put it on DVD...a few people will buy it, but most of the purist will snub their collective noses at it. Then again, the movie going public (in general) do not SEEM to be so pure in the search for excellence in their chosen genre. *NOTE* I am not so much talking about ""Grease"" here, but a certain movie named after the Windy City, that won a best picture Oscar. What a travesty  But, hey, if people never mixed different styles of art together then we would not have nearly half the music that we have todayso who am I to complain?Nonetheless, as pure film/art I think `Grease' would have been better off on Broadway.  And I bet John Travolta was not even driving that car in the big car race scene (ha) (Not really funny).Fun to watch 68% of the time.  6.8/10I could say so more, but nobody reads this stuff anyway.",Grease
198,aristofanis,reflected an era,8,7 January 2004,"I grew up listening to this film's soundtrack and observing pictures from the movie. Later, when my parents let me see it, it did not live up to the expectations my childish imagination had set. Twenty five years later, I realize that the music and some of the dancing is what salvages this somewhat dumb scenario.  The film is a compact package of images and archetypes of a certain US culture  (50s mixed with some 60s and 70s in them). Cars, leather jackets, american sports, american fast food restaurants, american high schools, competitiveness... He/she who has more of all this is the winner.  Typical of this agenda is when Sandy sings near the end ""Look at me I'm Sandra-dee"" as a mourning of an identity she has to give up.  She will be rewarded when she uglyfies herself proving that she is capable in conforming.  Danny also has to prove himself. One wonders what could had happened had they had not done otherwise! Like in most simplistic movies, there are good and bad guys and complicated teenage situations such as pregnancy are dealt with superficially simplistic solutions. Not to be taken seriously. 6/10 for its musical aspects and for my admiration to Olivia Newton John.",Grease

201,gracegibson,A fun movie to watch (and sing along to...),8,24 August 2005,"The songs are great and the plot is classic. Those two qualities alone make ""Grease"" a memorable movie. My favorite song is ""Grease is the Word"", played during the opening credits. It's the 1950s but more musical! Sure it has its clichés, but somehow this movie is anything but corny. If you haven't seen this movie, PLEASE go out and see it! However, this movie is not perfect. There are two things wrong with it. First of all, I hate it when Sandy goes from a perfectly nice, sweet girl to a raunchier (and less classy) Marilyn Monroe. What was wrong with her previous nice girl persona? Did the writers feel that there was something WRONG with nice girls? That there should be less nice girls than raunchier (and less classy) Marilyn Monroes? I think it should be the other way around. It also didn't quite fit into the storyline. Second of all, what was with the car flying into the sky into the end? That didn't fit into the movie at all! Since when did it become a magical, Herbie-like flying car? I think it was the writers' desperate attempt to put something ""magical"" and ""romantic"" into the movie. That's the one (very) corny part in the movie, as well as hopelessly out-of-place. This movie is good, but it would've been better if there had been better writers.",Grease

I first saw it when i was but a little girl and it had me singing ""we go together, like..."" for days and days. Musicals are such a brilliant part of the film industry, but sometimes the plot is overshadowed by over done, unbelievably bad music and actors and actresses who don't seem to be there for any reason other than the money involved. But then you watch Grease and you understand what it's all about. BANG! Music, tension, romance, car races, brilliant plot... Need i go on? Olivea Newton-John is so talented and so pretty, while John Travolta is the guy of every girls dreams from that time; Bad boy, with a good heart and over styled hair. So, it is the best musical of all time. Even men can like it with out being accused of being gay. And that's saying something. Grease is the word!",Grease
206,rscafanever,Busy and simple musical,5,28 October 2016,"Inspired by and inspiring film successes like Pulp Fiction and many persons to sing songs at karaoke bars early in the night, expectations were high. Too high.First, the plot is razor-thin. Boy falls in love with girl, by chance they end up in the same school and try to get back together. Some other subplots develop, but they're not much more complicated than the main story.Second, the film is almost two hours of noise. There are no silent moments, and it's irritating. Dialogues follow each other up, and in between there's music. Even when the music plays, you are left wondering why and which background noises, like footsteps, are mixed in the audio. Third, the visual noise is giving headaches. The screen is always filled, often with colours that pain the eyes, and often with too many actors and extras.Fourth, acting is as thin as the plot. Almost no character development. Too many caricatures with no meaning. Humor that resembles too much to slapstick.So why give it five stars? Despite the excess of actors, choreography is very good. It must have taken a lot of time to put all those actors and extras in the right order. Also, a look at greaser culture was interesting, as well as the car scene in the sewers.If you're into busy, superficial musicals: give it a try. If not, just leave it.",Grease
207,yuenw003,Touches home to all,10,23 March 2018,"This movie strikes a cord to all because of its universal theme. it reminds us of the adolescent days of middle and high school when life was like a sitcom world with our friends and classmates. It was life before the matrix world when all were equal economically and infatuation flourished with the opposite sex. The pranks, slumber parties, drag racing matches, and the intermixing of subgroups of greasers, pink ladies, nurds, good boys and girls, jocks, and teacher's pet types were all part of the ongoing effort to, ironically, define one's self. The finally carnival scene captured the enthusiasm of a sad but understandable parting of that world for seniors when one, from here on out, would get in character each day with a work face and demeanor for the adult world of the stage.",Grease

You can even hear some of the songs in this film on radio now and again. However, I simply did not enjoy this one. I always get the feeling when I watch it that it's a girls fantasy movie. I know a lot of men who enjoy it but that's just my opinion. The set design, costumes and music are really good and seeing Travolta in this type of a film is priceless, and the film still holds up today.

The acting is clunky, the story has more holes than swiss cheese and it's just as cheesy! That would've been fine and I would have just called it a mediocre flick. Though that's not the end of it. The music is lacklustre at best and downright tone-deaf at worst. Not the music from the actual 50's, no, I just mean the music they come up with themselves. The two songs I believe are actually good are Greased Lightning (though I don't like the fact that John Travolta sings it, as Kenickie is the one who sings it on stage, but that isn't too big an issue) and Born to Hand Jive as it works well with the moves the characters are singing on screen.

He plays Danny, who falls in love with Sandy one summer at the beach. I really shouldn't waste the reader's time because they all know the story. I only want the young generation of guys who might think that Grease is just a movie for girls to stop and think. As a young man, I realized that by watching and liking Grease, I stood a 50% better chance of picking up women.

But nobody remembers Grease. If you ask me, High School Musical is a 21st century copy of Grease.If you want a good movie, than it's Grease. It is not rushed like many movies, or stretched like others. It tells the story at it's own pace, which is why it is such a good movie.I would recommend this movie to all of you people. Trust me you will not be disappointed.",Grease
212,Amigard,A very NASTY word,3,2 October 1998,"I've never been a great fan of musicals and this movie prooves why I won't change my mind. It is always predictable the moment when they start to sing. You hear some music, the actors shut up for a moment, and then.......LaLaLaLa etc. Get a life! I'm trying to watch a movie here and I am not interested in some actors who can't sing! And there is really something wrong with the time-setting, like ""early 60's mixed with late 70's"". I really can't get that idea out of my head. Also the movie brainwashes you with the US-high school-look so much that you almost forget how it was at your own (non-US) school.

Well, it's 40 years later and the 4K version was a pretty cheap stream so I figured I'd finally watch it.There are few movies that I've ever rated below 4. But this is an utter piece of drivel to me. It may have been intended to be a parody on the 50ies (was it?) but jeez. What a collection of dumb empty kids. Perhaps people who'd enjoying watching Brad Kavanaugh drink brewskis with his sexist bully friends are fans, but for me this a great reminder of why I hated the stereotypical teenage years. Boy am I glad that the idiotic backwardness that was still prevalent in the 50s-70s will never come back.Two stars for some decent musical-style music. But I would have rather not seen this.

Then the re-release came out in 1998 and I saw it for old's time sake. I ended up seeing it three more times while it was still in theatres because it brought back the same feelings plus new ones from having watched the film from an adult perspective. On the one hand, it's easy for me to watch it so many times because it's a musical and when you find the tunes catchy you can't resist it. But it's not just that. Much to my surprise, I remembered every line of dialogue. What makes this movie a classic is that it is still great even if you cut out the songs. How many musicals can you say that about? The dialogue and one liners are so colorful and energetic and the movie works as a 50s comedy. It's funnier than I remembered and it is without a doubt the raunchiest PG movie ever made. Parents be forewarned, especially the Greased Lightning song. All in all, a film that should be re-released every twenty years so a new generation of children and teenagers can watch it, not just because it was one of the last great musicals but also because it truly captures the essence of what it was like to grow up in the 50s. This ranks just below Back to the Future (another 50s type movie) as my all time favorite.",Grease

Instead of showing some National Grandstand of dance at some high school gym, why not present some students working towards winning some international championships of some math/physics contest, or some design contest.  For a few minutes I though Danny was about to go into some sports and win Sandy back through his achievements, but instead Sandy returned to him through his flop on his hurdle running track!  Quite motivational, isn't it?  ...and then Danny's pursuit in sports ended in the movie right there!Maybe I am well beyond teenage years when I watched this movie, but I can't help but notice a complete absence of parents in this movie except Frenchy's brief mention of her Daddy as the only man (male) she trusts.  No wonder the kids in the '50s loved it.  How every youth wished they could be just doing what they wanted, like in the movie, instead of being ""ordered around"" by their parents and teachers!  Well, that was my few cents of cold words.  Still, the movie is worth seeing, to learn about what the kids in 1950s did and liked.  I rated this movie 6/10.",Grease

There's lots of posturing, high school humour and a great musical number featuring the King of Beach-Blanket Music, Frankie Avalon.

It had a fine cast who even though they were much older than teenagers - think Stockard Channing was 35 at the time and hers is one of the best performances of the film, - played their roles with conviction.With regard to John Travolta for me personally it's not his most major role, I think he hit the jackpot in this respect with Saturday Night Fever, however it's the role many people remember him for and will probably continue to do so.

The movie (and play) tell you that you're not good enough as you are; that to have people like you, you have to change.  The final scene makes it clear that being yourself isn't good enough.  You have to conform to the will of others in order to be happy.  And making the woman the one who has to change is sexist.  Then, misogny backhands you like an abusive husband by sexually objectifying the change.  Look, now she has to be a hussy to have a happy ending.Simply disgusting.

And back then, every theater kid loved the hell out of Grease. We all saw it multiple times in the theater, wore out the soundtrack, then watched it over and over on HBO until we could recite the dialogue by heart. So what if the ""teenagers"" in the film were almost old enough to be our parents and the portrayal of '50s gang warfare was more than a little sanitized? It was a candy-colored carnival with great songs well sung, fabulous dancing and eye-catching costumes - Olivia Newton-John's costume in the finale launched a fad for Candies, backless wooden spike heels with leather straps.
Caught the film recently, many years removed from my theater kid days - and found that, surprisingly, it had lost little of its charm. The songs sounded as good as ever, the dialogue was just as snappy, and the film's mashup of '50s and '70s pop culture gave it an odd sheen of timelessness. Plus, as an adult, I could better appreciate Danny Zuko's crisis of identity - trying at once to please his straitlaced girlfriend and his car jockey friends. We've all been there. So if you were a fan back in the day, give it another spin. Heck, you may even want to show it to your theater kid offspring.",Grease

230,estebangimpe,"Grease is not just the word, it is the greatest musical of all times",8,17 September 2008,"You can hate me or you can love me all you want for this review. At the end of the day, all that should matter is your opinion.Grease is not just a 70's fancy musical, it is a symbol to an era, an era when you could make a musical that had enough character to be great.Today there is High School Musical, Rock Camp etc. I have been fortunate enough (sarcasm) to watch all of these musicals, and I can't even begin to explain how much I hate them. They lack of two basic things, originality and being fun. And what a coincidence! because those are both of the mayor elements that makes Grease such a great movie. Released in 1978, Grease left a mayor print in the whole world. Well, there are many movies that have done that, so why does Grease stand out more? Honestly, because the film wasn't that good.I mean think about it. What is the plot in this movie? a guy that spends his whole high school year trying to get back together with his summer love while doing annoying things along the way. Not much of a plot is it? And the moral? being a jerk who gets into fights, ignores his friends and doesn't do anything at school will help you turn your summer crush into a smoking cool girl who ends up with you in the end despite all the times you tried to get into her panties? Not a very great moral, in fact, most of High School based movies usually have the cool guys being the bad guys and in the end they lose. So by now you might be saying, How can you say at that this movie is great and then trash its plot and moral? Well, if I may continue, I'd have to say that the greatest thing about this movie, is that you don't really care for the plot or the moral. You watch this movie, and you have FUN!The songs are great, the dancing is great, the humour is great and you'd think that without a plot the movie could be impossible to watch, but no; you are so entertained while watching Grease that you wouldn't care if someone's child dies in the middle of the film. By the way, for all of you who haven't seen the movie, that doesn't happen.Yes it's very corny, the actors that are suppose to be in their teen years look like they're thirty and the character development is not very deep. But I'll say it again, you WON'T CARE! and that is why this movie is considered to be one of the best musicals of all time. It manages to take the incredibly picky movie critics out of us and makes us sing and dance along with it, WITHOUT COMPLAINING!!Nowadays, directors have tried to create a musical which has the same power as Grease. Most of them have failed miserably to try and hide the lack of plot or horrible acting, leaving them as cinema failures who only the eight year old girls will like. HSM and many others may have a great commercial success for kids, but its Grease which truly makes a cheesy school musical enjoyable for the whole family.Grease was, is and shall always be the word10/10",Grease
231,iloveUGA123,Love this movie and especially the music!,10,19 February 2013,"This was seriously my life as a child growing up! I first saw this movie with my parents when I was 5 and clearly didn't understand really anything, but I loved the music! I'm now 15 and have owned the CD since I was probably 5-6 years old and asked for the DVD for my 7th birthday! I still love listening to the music and know every word to every song because I've listened to this music for about 10 years now, and I still do all of the time. It's such a good movie, but I literally saw it 100 times as a child, so now I'm kind of sick of watching it, but I will never be sick of the music! What makes Grease is the music! I love musicals and yes I like the actual storyline and all but the best part is the music! A must see! You will love it!",Grease
232,Brit_in_Malaysia,Charming classic,10,25 January 2020,"This movie came during a nostalgia craze in the late 1970s.Now, the flow, the music, the exuberance and humour encapsulate what we then thought the 1950s may have been like to an earlier generation- but seen through the haze of happy nostalgia.On watching it again recently - it remains a gem. Everything clicks. A time capsule of fun.Worth a watch and see if clicks with you.",Grease
233,danielrachael,One of the finest musicals,7,1 October 2019,"Grease was a major hit and the musical still remains one of the most popular films of its kind. John Travolta was catapulted to the top shelf of fame after the duo of Grease and Saturday Night Fever came out, and its easy to see why- the man is charismatic, can sing well and has the moves. Grease boasts what all successful motion picture musicals have: likable stars, a simple but not trivial plot, and a lot of enjoyable music. Familiarity with the soundtrack is undoubtedly one of the reasons for the film's popularity - several of the songs have achieved pop hit status. Grease works as a musical, a comedy, a light romance, and a gentle satire of teenage life during the '50s. In part because of its persistent high spirits, it's a delight to watch, even 20 years after it first appeared on the screen. If you enjoy musicals than Grease is a great film, even though it is decades old- nothing has changed with the passage of time, and the film is as entertaining today as it was in 1978.",Grease

It's a great film which will touch you at some point along the journey. Everyone has their own story and this movie will capture at least one moment in your life which you felt was yours and yours alone.

237,dudemisra,Timeless,8,25 November 2019,"I wholeheartedly believe that this film and musical will never fade away due to its iconic cultural influence today. Sure, the prevalent character and plot niches are corny and cliched, but these aspectes don't discourage the film at all. The music score, setting, costumes and the casting of characters has been very well done to fit the overall theme and aesthetic of this film.John Travolta, coming off the Saturday Night Fever hype, performs tremendously, showcasing his prime musical repetoire. He is pretty much the star of the film because everyone, whether they like to admit it or not, wanted to be like Danny Zuko one way or another at some point in their life.The songs are very catchy and fun, especially 'Greased Lightning' considering the dirty foreplay that is hidden underneath the lyrics! Some other classics include Summer Nights, You're the One That I Want and Hopelessly Devoted to You which showcases the beauty and charisma of Olivia Newton John as she encapsulates the role of good-girl Sandy Olsson.Overall, there is no doubt Grease will remain a timeless classic whether you're 5, 15, 25 or even in your 60s, this film is for everyone because everyone needs to see it!",Grease

239,Joolz,Is Grease still the word?,9,6 January 1999,"Of course it is! Twenty years on from its original release, good to see it doing the rounds at the cinemas again to rave reviews. I think that it was probably the last great musical that will ever be made, a thought which saddens me....but times, attitudes and financial considerations have changed. The cast of the film perform as one unit....the interplay between the various character parts is at times electric. The songs and dance routines are simply marvellous. All the ingredients of a cinema classic are there for all too see. It is my mother's favourite film, my favourite film and my childrens' favourite film. Three generations can't be wrong!",Grease
240,miketh,"sometimes funny, but mostly painful",2,31 March 2001,"I should admit from the start that I'm not a huge fan of musicals. I was forced to watch this movie by my girlfriend, possibly in retaliation for my having made her watch three Jackie Chan movies in a row. So, take this review for whatever it's worth.Grease's status as a classic is, for me, quite perplexing. It's just a formulaic love story set in the 50s around a bunch of high school students (most of which, incidentally, appear to be at least in their mid 30s -- some, like Riz, look about 50). Although funny in parts -- the Frankie Avalon song, and the sequence where John Travolta tries to be a jock come to mind -- it largely just consists of stilted, cheesy dialogue and some of the lamest songs imaginable. (""Ramalamadingdong"", anyone?) This movie might work if seen as an over-the-top satire, I guess, but that doesn't make it any less painful to watch.As a mode of vengeance for girlfriends, then, this movie rates a 10. Guys beware.",Grease

People are still comparing musicals to it. Also people are still talking over it. I think that it has some of the best music that I ever heard. The songs were very original and people are still basing movies on them such as High school Musical. Also people are still singing the songs till this day. Studios are still putting it on the cable and satellite channels. Such as ABC Family which is a big hit with most family's an younger children.

A flying car ending? Whinging characters hard done by in their songs,morale of the story seems to be is to change yourself to make other person happy, Dress up as a tart to get the bloke interested who won't themselves change,maybe that was suitable then but in this day of age why do schools do this musical I've no idea.People should never change for anyone.

With many scenes overstaying their welcome.Overall, it's far too camp. The men in the film feel like gay men trying to act straight, and it's awful.The narrative: that Sandy has to act like a tramp to get Danny's attention is a terrible lesson for young women. Films like this should have a moral centre, and this one sorely lacks one.For a classy musicals, start with these:

245,Nik-64,A superb movie enjoyable by everyone,10,7 July 2000,"I first saw this movie about seven years ago, aged roughly 13. At such a young age, there were parts of the film I didn't comprehend, but it didn't matter. The singing and dancing are well-produced and the majority of the dialogue CAN be comprehended by kids. Over the past two years I've watched it several more times, because there is a lot more to get out of it. It is both a movie for kids and a movie for adults.Firstly, each character is unique and endearing in their own way. Stockard Channing's performance as Rizzo, the bad girl, is a particular stand-out and believeable. True, she is nearly twice the age of the character she plays, but I doubt an 18-year-old could done it anywhere near as well. Sandy (played by Olivia Newton-John) can be a bit sugary-sweet at times, but it contrasts well with Rizzo.Incidentally (some may not find this paragraph of interest) I find it puzzling how Sandy is described by other reviewers as a 'good girl' and 'virginal' and contrasted with the Pink Ladies. From what I can see, while Frenchy, Jan and Marty are 'cool', I didn't find anything particular suggesting they were 'bad girls'. Indeed, at one part in the movie, when the T-Birds are outside the window, Rizzo describes the others as 'goody-goodies', and the other girls appear oblivious as to her intents.In my opinion, Kenicke (Jeff Conaway) upstages Danny (John Travolta) at times in terms of being slick and cool and he doesn't slip up once (although some of it's contrived); I would rate him as the standout male character. Contrast Danny's 'cool-guy' image with the real him that you see at the beginning  and when he sings 'Sandy. Leo (leader of the scorpions) does an impressive job also in his relatively minor role as leader of the Scorpions. The other 3 T-Birds are very much followers, although Doody comes up with a lot of funny lines.Events that occur along the way are those young adults could relate to: a major formal (where a few of the dancers play up), a car race, a drop-out of high school and a colourful celebration at the end, to name a few. Indeed, most of the film is very colourful, the costumes are stylish and emphasise the kind of lifestyle these people enjoyed.If I could make any criticism, it would be on some of the songs:'Hopelessly Devoted To You' could definately have been omitted as it is just emphasising a point, and there are a few others that weren't really necessary. However, some songs fit in perfectly, like 'Summer Nights' where the lead guy and girl tell their respective sides (and versions) of their summer holiday; 'Look at Me, I'm Sandra Dee' is very funny and shows how Sandy doesn't fit in; I prefer to fast-forward through 'Greased Lightning' but it has a lot going for it nonetheless. I shouldn't be too critical of the songs; it is, after all, a musical.This production represents a successful conversion of a musical into a movie and has everything the way it should be for a classic (and should never had had a sequel, which, fortunately, I haven't seen). The sort you can watch over and over again. In fact, one of the few movies I give 10/10.",Grease
246,katstar1982,The word? Grease. Always and forever.,9,29 December 2007,"There are a precious few American females born after 1966 and before 1996 that have not experienced a pure passion for Grease at some point during their early adolescent lives. My sister and I used to rent and renew this film just about every weekend for two years when we were kids. It would have been much more practical to invest in our own personal copy. But then again, there is nothing practical, sensible, or particularly constructive about a young girl's feelings for Grease. Hundreds of dollars spent at our local video store just to wear out their copy should serve as testament enough to that fact. But Grease is more than mere fodder for hysterical, girl-culture consumption. It is the king, actually, of such articles. Here is a fun-hearted, very benignly naughty musical about ""good girl,"" Sandy Olsen who falls in love with ""bad boy,"" Danny Zuko, the leader of a drag-racing, greasy-hair-combing, leather jacket wearing, foul-mouthed (well, they're not really foul-mouthed, but they try) gang of aspiring delinquents. The trouble? She's a square who completely lacks a healthy sense of unruliness while he works hard to maintain his bad reputation. In order to stay together, one of them has to change. The ensuing plot is precisely why Grease is the kingshit of girl-culture staples. I have heard (chuckle) parents complain about its message. Some don't like that the social powers that be (the Pink Ladies and their T-birds) put so much pressure on one another to fit in with the clique. These are the very folks who are responsible for the watering-down of the stage version of Grease, which I was horrified to find, has been censored so much it is only barely recognizable. Apparently, the film version of Sandy's physical transformation from the poster child for teenage abstinence and all-around wholesomeness to something more resembling a streetwalker with ratted hair, painted on spandex, and an affinity for cigarettes ""sends kids a darn sleazy message."" Anyone who feels this way has forgotten how immune children are to politically correct bullshittery. No 12-year-old girl wants to watch something that condescends, that moralizes, that jumps through hoops and loops to send the ""right"" message. Grease doesn't do that. Instead, it reflects authentic sensibilities. I should also point out though, that there is a moral to be found beneath all the jokes about Annette Funicello's ""jugs,"" Sandy's virginity, stolen car parts, and 5-year-old broken condoms. After all, Rizzo demonstrates one of the many possible consequences of unprotected sex in a subplot that is unique to a pre-AIDS movie going era. And in the end, Danny proves willing to clean up his social identity for Sandy. She just beats him to the punch. And really, she's the same old squeaky-clean dufus who isn't sure what to do with a cigarette. She's just wearing hot pants. So if you really want to get technical, the ""darn sleazy message"" is not that one must put out to be accepted. One must only LOOK like one puts out. There, now. That's not so bad, is it? Besides, and this is its main point of differentiation from the hideous sequel, it is a damn good movie. In fact, watching Grease 2 before watching Grease makes this completely clear. It is as a musical should be. Unlike the meaningless tripe passed off for songs in Grease 2, the songs in Grease advance the narrative and provide ample, necessary information about its characters. As a period piece, the 1950s setting is also made useful as a symbol of innocence, simultaneously false and genuine, about to be lost. It represents the mindset of the teenage characters and their place in American history. Whereas, Grease 2 evokes the 1950s about as much as Rock-N-Roll McDonald's. No. Rock-N-Roll McDonald's is more competent in its depiction. The characters in Grease are complex. They are stock archetypes with inner conflicts that don't always jive with their personas. The characters in Grease 2 are flat, vacant nothings that are only vaguely reminiscent of the archetypes that ought to make up the gang. Still, one needn't compare the original to its sequel to see that Grease is charming, fun, a bit corny, harmlessly bawdy and, in general, the perfect slumber party, girl movie.",Grease
247,rekcilorf,Overblown and overrated,5,2 January 2018,"I can't believe the incredible raves this travesty has received
I saw the original stage play in the mid-70's and it was nostalgic, understated and even a bit quaint by today's standards. This film exaggerates all of the story and characters. The only part I really liked was ""Summer days, summer nights"" which was staged beautifully and brilliantly. But the rest -- ugh!
Some reviewers did point out that all the ""teens"" were in their 20's and even 30's. This is not unusual -- remember 90210? Some did complain about the sexual innuendos, but what teen movie doesn't deal with sex? Teens have sex, whether their adults like it or not. It's part of growing up.
One other difference from the play is the slutty makeover of Sandy, which was not in the original.
Other gripes include the prom dance. What school would let girls in high heels dance of the gym floor? My high school dances were in the cafeteria with tile floors. And no high schoolers I ever knew danced like these kids. Much too choreographed to be real.

As for the rest of the film, oh dear...My wife saw it when it first came out. My daughter has watched it, by choice, many times. I was required to watch it as a family evening.
It was rubbish.The acting is lacklustre.
The plot is paper thin, land continuity or purpose.
The themes are banal, dipping into either irrelevance or being morally unacceptable.
The characters are unlovable, two dimensional, unbelievable. Worse, they are not developed over the course of the film. Many of them are jerks. Few are sympathetic.
Most of the set pieces are irrelevant to the plot.
There appears to be no effort to get the actors to try to sing in time with the recorded musical pieces.It's some of the worst writing I've encountered.There are some good bits. The school principal and school secretary are nuanced, funny and well acted. Some of the dances are good.If it were released today, it would be panned more than Cats, and rightly so.

The New Yorker observed at the time that nobody involved with this movie was alive during the era it was supposed to depict, but they clearly had a fine time with the music. Yes, the scenes were clearly from sunny 1970's California, but this didn't bother the kids who saw this in 1978, and enough time has passed that it shouldn't bother us who remember that it was supposed to be in Brooklyn, in the '50's.Have fun, kids.",Grease
260,Insincere Dave,"I apologise to fans, but this is as honest as it gets.",1,6 September 2000,"Based heavily upon the stage-show, Grease is an up beat, feel-good musical that has spawned an appalling sequel, countless CDs and a larger fan-base than most premier league football teams. But why don't I like it? With the exception of the Blues Brothers, I'm not a fan of musicals, I find them shallow, ill conceived and heavily dependent upon merchandise, but that's just me. The main reason I avoid all things Grease is that I saw the stage show before the film. It was in the London west-end, nearing the end of its run in a small theatre, with an unknown cast and no big star. And despite myself, I didn't find it disagreeable. The songs were acceptable (even amusing at times), the characterisation was incredible for a stage musical (in a cartoon-character kind of a way) and the comedic moments were actually funny. I was amazed that there was no taste of bile in my mouth, and that I had no need for therapy afterwards. So when my friends finally managed to get me to watch the film (as part of a deal: I would watch Grease if she would watch Blues Brothers, she got the better deal) I didn't complain too loudly. I wish I had. 	Despite being an almost direct adaptation of the stage show of the day, somewhere along the line, something had been lost. The characters seemed less cartoon like, and more two dimensional; the songs packed less of a punch, and at times made me desire the fast-forward button and the comedic moments just weren't as good. I don't know if it's because twenty-odd years have passed since the filming, but it just seemed . . . tame.	The songs are famous to get toes tapping at `any' party, there's Summer Loving, Greased Lightning, that one with the line `You'd better shape up' and those other ones. Out of an entire musical, only three songs are actually that memorable (I know I'll be criticised by all of you who know the lyrics to every single song in the film, but hey, everyone needs a hobby), taking up about 8 minutes of the film. That's kind of pathetic when you factor in at least two yawn-worthy songs (about 6 minutes) and the film seems less of a musical and more of a chore. 	Now, I wouldn't complain about the music if there were some decent filler material in between warblings, but the film was lacking in this area too. Dialogue was cheesy at the most, or as I like to call it, just plain bad. Today it seems ridiculous to watch John Travolta and Olivia Newton-John exchanging some lines that wouldn't seem out of place in a twelve-year old girls love story. If you're someone who likes to hear actors in their thirties play kids in their teens, spouting seventies dialect in the fifties then this is the film for you. If you like to watch over-ripe, then don't let me stop you. If however, you have a shred of taste in your body (and/or a Y chromosome) then stay well away.",Grease
261,pegmeg,absolutely brilliant!!,10,27 October 2006,"This my favourite film of all time!!! I love it! My fave character is Frenchy she is so funny and quirky. Firstly all of the songs are brilliant and so memorable, my favourites are summer nights and greased lightning. When the film starts off it immediately gets your attention with the opening scenes with Danny and Sandy on holiday and John Travolta has lots of sex appeal in this. When we get to the school we meet some fantastic characters Kenicky and Rizzo and all the others! The first song summer nights is fantastic, watching them not knowing the other one is there! Then there's the sleepover scene which is so funny "" Twinkies and wine your full of class Jan"" "" Says right here is a dessert wine!"" The dance scene is my favourite i think, i just love all the dancing from the 50s, like the twists and the lifts! I like so much about this film its a timeless classic and will always be my favourite!!",Grease
262,pessimistic_girl,Used to be a lot funnier...,7,10 August 2002,"I first saw this film when I was 10 years old, and loved it. As I watch it today it makes me realize that there were a lot of things I enjoyed more as a 10 year old; like jumping rope or building sand castles. This is not to say that Grease is a drag, quite the opposite in many ways it's a charming movie.The songs are catchy and the choreography is very nicely done. They've also managed to pick out a team of actors that work well together, playing off each other superbly. So what's missing?In the simplest term; decency. All the characters are more or less shallow and are possibly the OLDEST high schoolers I've ever laid eyes upon (and I've seen Beverly Hills 90210). That's the first mistake, the second is that everything is so stereotyped. Rizzo = slut. Kenickie = height of cool and very aware of it too. Jan = the chubster (where?). Frenchy = loveable ditz with heart of gold. Danny = cool guy but really a big softy. Sandy = scared, meak girl far away from home. These elements are portrayed immensely and get old really, really fast.Then of course the old clichés start kicking in. (SPOILER warning) Boy likes girl. Boy is tough, girl is not. Boy's friends don't approve. Boy acts like an idiot and looses girl. Girl decides to change her life just so she can be with boy. This, sadly, is a pretty accurate description of Grease. I do realize that it takes place in America in the 50's and that attitudes were different then than they are now. Still I can't see it without thinking how awfully dated this story is.Leaving the dating aside, the movie is very well made and flows easily between the different stories. And my, my, my is John Travolta dreamy! ;)Final rating: 6 / 10",Grease

Yes its corny, yes its a bit pointless but that is what makes it so good!! If it wasn't for Grease John Travolta would not be famous, he would not have millions of dollars. Grease made him who he is today. The first time i saw Grease i fell in love with the movie and i fell in love with John. Every time i watch it, it just keeps getting better and better!! Long live Grease!! They have made those ridiculous High School Musicals now and that annoys me because they are trying to match up to Grease, but Zac Efron and his Stupid ""Crew"" will never be able to beat Grease.

All of the characters have there own vibe and problems in high school and they reveal it in a healthy manner! I love the way that the characters sing. Sandy and John Travolta really outdid themselves, probably one of John Travolta's best movies. For real. He needs to make another one like this but I don't know how that's gonna work now hahahaha. I would have rather been in high school around that era because the kids back then seemed so much more fun and out going and healthy. Nowadays all kids wanna do is get effed up and text or get on facebook. But amazing movie, I love it, which is why you should watch it. Whoever hasn't watched Grease is missing out.

All the actors are amazing.Everybody knows that they were much older then the characters, but you really believe that Olvia N.J. IS a teen-ager girl, and sexy Travolta is a high-school boy!

267,Crane_94,Nostalgic Nostalgia Fest Maintains Its Superficial Bounce,6,24 September 2008,"It's hard to think of a bigger slice of 1970's Hollywood kitsch than this candy-coated, mega-successful 1978 musical comedy. Capitalizing on the tidal wave of Eisenhower-era nostalgia pervasive on both big and small screens at the time, it manages to be stridently artificial and mindlessly entertaining at the same time, although it still boggles the mind that it has had such an afterlife, including sing-along versions playing at art-house movie theaters. Part of the ironic amusement is watching actors obviously in their late twenties and early thirties pretending to be teenagers. Credit should be given to director Randal Kleiser for his unapologetic stance on maneuvering the contrived silliness with spirit if not much finesse. Set in a period of the 1950's that existed only in Hollywood and lacking any semblance of reality or dramatic conflict, the threadbare plot focuses on greaser Danny, the cool leader of the T-Birds, and wholesome Sandy, a good-girl Aussie blonde enjoying a summer romance on the beach prior to senior year at Rydell High. Sandy was supposed to move back to Australia, but she ends up staying stateside and attending Rydell. With image being of the utmost importance, Danny initially rejects Sandy - now a cheerleader - when they meet again, and we follow all their romantic complications over the course of the school year until graduation. There is also the ongoing power struggle between the T-Birds and the rival gang, the Scorpions, as well as the peer-pressure shenanigans caused by the T-Birds' girlfriends, the Pink Ladies, headed by sleep-around tart, Rizzo. All of this merely provides an excuse for the various musical numbers, the most energetic being the ensemble pieces like the cleverly edited ""Summer Nights"" and the stylized ""Jailhouse Rock"" knock-off, ""Greased Lightning"". Most of the numbers are from the Broadway show, though there are some deliberately anachronistic insertions such as Barry Gibb's disco-accented title tune and the peppy funhouse duet, ""You're the One That I Want"". John Travolta is perfectly cast as Danny, even if his singing voice threatens to evaporate from his sincerity. Olivia Newton-John has the right manner and looks for Sandy, though she is hardly challenged to develop a compelling character here. The standout is Stockard Channing as Rizzo, the only character that has any connection to the reality of the times, and she expertly sings the mocking ""Look at Me, I'm Sandra Dee"" and frankly outdoes Newton-John on the touching ""There Are Worse Things I Could Do"". Several familiar faces fill out the cast - Eve Arden in Miss Brooks mode as Principal McGee, Sid Caesar rather constrained as Coach Calhoun, Joan Blondell equally pallid as malt shop waitress Vi, Edd Byrnes as a Dick Clark-type lothario, Alice Ghostley as the auto shop teacher, Dody Goodman as the ditzy school administrator, and of course, Frankie Avalon serenading ""Beauty School Dropout"" to squeaky-voiced Didi Conn's Frenchy. Serious examination of the film is useless since it is more a cheery variety show with superficial references to the sexual politics of the 1950's. The new 2006 ""Rockin' Rydell Edition"" DVD package comes with extras that should satisfy fans. There is an insightful commentary track by Kleiser and choreographer Patricia Birch; eleven minutes worth of deleted scenes in black-and-white; a nostalgic ""Grease Day"" featurette that contains interviews with Travolta, Newton-John and producers Allen Carr and Robert Stigwood; and coverage of the 25th Anniversary DVD launch party, which includes spirited performances by Newton-John, Travolta and the remaining cast.",Grease
268,johno1100,"Awful. Just another ""popularity"" Movie.",1,23 February 2008,"The feel of Randal Kleiser's Greae is basically just to be the same as everyone else. To be a pathetic teenager who doesn't know his shoe size from his IQ and that the most important thing in the world is making people like you. All the values are utterly pathetic. The clever thing for Kleiser was that because the movie was released in the seventies and the target audience was people who had went to high school in the fifties and because it was the seventies when most of these people will have been in their prime years at the time so they went to see it. What a pathetic time to be a teenager (Although it's awful now with movies like ""Bratz"" And ""High school musical"" I'm fourteen myself and hate these movies) These movies seem to base themselves around the pathetic idea that you have to be another idiot high-schooler to have friends or be happy. 99.7% of teenagers are idiots. In conclusion if you want a good musical try something like the lion king or if you're feeling nostalgic try the wizard of oz and if you want a funny musical try South Park: Bigger Longer & Uncut.",Grease
269,CerebralInTheCity,A great musical,9,29 January 2009,"Director Randal Kleiser knocks it out of the park with this musical. Personally, I don't find the 1950s era all that interesting. All I've seen are leather jackets, greasy hair and a superficial gangster type of attitude with the bad boys.But Kleiser takes all of those elements, which ultimately was written by Jim Jacobs, Warren Casey and Allan Carr and Bronte Woodard, and has a whole bunch of fun with them. That translates real well on the screen.Also contributing to the fun and energy of GREASE are its main characters, portrayed beautifully by John Travolta, Olivia Newton-John, Stockard Channing and Jeff Conaway.The music is fantastic all around. All of the songs seem to capture an era gone by.The choreography is one of the most amazing things about this movie, and it is by the very talented Patricia Birch.",Grease

The songs are catchy (even for a Heavy Metal fan like me!) and the feelgood mood is amazing here. The plot is pretty predictable, and you can guess how it all ends already after five minutes, but who cares? Cause the movie takes you there in a fantastic way! Travoltas acting is good and some of his facial-expressions are incredible. The 50s feel Grease have is also very good, and the characters in this movie are all likable. And the way Olivia Newton John looks in ""You're The One That I Want"" is incredible. That part makes the whole movie worth watching by itself. There are many other unforgettable moments to. Like ""Greased Lightning"" and much more. See this movie, even if you're not a big fan of the genre, you might end up liking it. Cause it got humor, songs, drama and heart.

I was wrong. This movie was fun in a way appropriate not just for kids, but for adults too. Back then, movies just put a smile on your face, this movie is a great example. I have loved musicals my whole life and this has got to be my favorite one ever. Annie was my favorite musical before Grease came along. Think about it, a musical better than Annie, it's got to be pretty good to beat a masterpiece like that. Ever since I saw this movie I have been a huge fan of John Travolta.

The only problem I have with the movie is the actors look old, most of them were in their 30's. Stockard Channing (Rizzo) was 34 when Grease was released! Maybe they cast so many old actors for historical reference, since many were teenagers in the 1950s.The movie has become a classic, and despite the aging actors epitomized the 1950s, especially since during the 70's many people who grew-up in the 50's were nostalgic for those days. Travolta became an even bigger star as a result after having skyrocketed into stardom from Saturday Night Fever. All in all a great film.

Not a criticism at all, just an observation.All in all, the direction, the choreography, the music and, of course, the cast all came together for a tight match.John Travolta and Olivia Newton John headed up the very talented cast.

I have to admit, I had a TINY crush on John Travolta during the film, and I still find myself very attracted to him. He and Olivia Newton-John have perfect chemistry, and I'm so glad that they ended up together. This film teaches a lesson that, if you really love someone, you should be willing to sacrifice everything for them. And I am a huge believer of true love.

Nineteen-fifties mayhem ensues, with greasers, girl gangs, jealousy, dance contests, and rivalries. I know all of the questions about Sandy turning ""bad"" to get a man, and whether or not the movie is a bad example for children. Those are questions about parenting, not good or bad movie-making. I saw this movie when it was initially released; I was a kid! I really loved it then. Yesterday, it was on TV, and I was somewhat disappointed. The dance numbers were not nearly as tight as I remembered, especially the TV dance contest number, and ""Beauty School Dropout."" Stockard Channing's role was not done as well as I had remembered, but Dinah Manoff was really beautiful. I had forgotten that she was such a knockout.The soundtrack is brilliant, and ""Hopelessly Devoted"" is absolutely classic. Newton-John's voice is spine tingling, definitely deserving of an Oscar.

The Innocence and Colour of the 50s has been captured excellently in this movie, and what I found most refreshing about this movie is that there are no dark sub-plots and no real twists and no surprises. Critics nowadays would think it's a lame musical, but there is such a lot of good to be taken from a happy musical like this..Oh, and did I mention the music? From the very start to the brilliant closing number, the music was captivating, and almost always, it's feel-good music. 11 stars out of 10 for giving happiness. 9 out of 10 stars for storyline. 10 out of 10 for the music.",Grease

Well, let the images do the talking. I just didn't catch the movie way back in the seventies and kept away from it in the eighties and nineties, but heck, you certainly run out of luck one day and you come to see this... (fill in your favorite gut revolver). As some popular character said, ""we were idiots back in the fifties"", and it would be great for the movie to point it out; problem is that it celebrates the whole idiocy of the times, making satire only to the clichés and actually selling the real misery of social uses and customs as nostalgic empathy. The whole macho pose on which the supposed conflict is based finally rears its ugly head in all its disgrace and there is dance and joy everywhere to enthrone it. As entertainment it also lacks punch and, of course, intelligence, for the purpose seems to be an exhibition of pseudo-romantic gags and ill-conceived phoney humour. On the other hand, the movie is excruciatingly dull even skipping the sung parts. Not difficult to categorize with an adjective or two, but from my personal point of view, the ideal film to watch while you write the note to the judge and proceed to hang yourself.",Grease

For those of you that hate this, you need to know this: (1) It's a MUSICAL, so what do you expect? In a MUSICAL, people are expected to sing and dance when they're supposed to because it's called ACTING. It's not supposed to be a real thing. (2) Everyone in the movie can act and sing, and that goes to John Travolta too. (3) At least it's not the same thing as High School Musical. What lesson do you think HSM teaches you? Grease teaches you that love is all about making sacrifices for the other person, because that's just what love is. Those of you that hate this are completely missing the point of what it truly is about.

I found myself rooting for/against certain characters and feeling like I lost when when events did not happen the way I wanted. One of the few movies I have felt that way about. There are many up and downs, but I think most people can relate in one way or another to some character in this movie. Whether you were the cool guy, geek, easy girl, protected child, class clown, etc. there is a part most fit in. This movie is a more girlie than manly, but watch and don't judge until you have seen it at least twice.",Grease
295,SetzersGretsch,Believe The Hype.....Grease Is STILL The Word!!,10,24 October 2005,"There's nothing much one can add to the plaudits already reaped by the highest grossing musical in cinematic history because ""Grease"" truly is a remarkable movie. The way it encapsulates a ""feel good"" aura to enthral the audience isn't something that happens very often, especially when the movie offers only a very simplistic script acted out by (back then) relatively unknown performers. In spite of the fact the movie version is much tamer than the original stage adaptation (something that was slightly more violent and superfluous with it's sexual innuendos - both of which have been lost in future stage productions since the release of the movie), ""Grease"" has all the right ingredients to justify the phenomenal success it's achieved over the years.The movie's main plot is the basic ""boy meets girl/boy loses girl/boy tries to change to win girl back"" tale - a storyline that's not exactly anomalous to Hollywood - nonetheless, it's the kind of plot that most can relate to because we've all been in Danny or Sandy's situation one time or another during our lives. And it's ingredients such as that which make this movie 'believable'. Moreover, ""Grease"" epitomises the teenage angst experienced by the characters so well (the sub-plots of expressing teenage lust, being socially accepted and fears of making the transition into adulthood are prime examples of why the story of ""Grease"" is as relevant today as it was in the 50s when it was set, and in the 70s when it was written.)Be that as it may, ""Grease"" wasn't meant to be a thought-provoking movie, and the emphasis is most definitely the on fun factor offered. It is comedic more than anything else, but there are several tender moments portrayed mainly through the songs, ""Hopelessly Devoted To You"", ""Sandy"" and ""There Are Worse Things I Can Do"" which are as well-remembered as any of the goofiness displayed by the movie's misfits.In the face of the fact a very simple script doesn't necessarily make a great movie, I'm sure there would be no legacy attached to ""Grease"" if it wasn't for the songs included on the soundtrack. Those were the catalyst to combine all the essential ingredients in the script to really make ""Grease"" shine. Upon reflection, it's quite bemusing that a movie (or story) set in the 50s didn't have more quintessential rock n' roll songs featured (sans the contributions from the 50s revivalists, 'Sha-Na-Na"", of course). But the ones used have quite rightly become 'sing-a-long' classics nevertheless. From the disco-influenced title track, the feel-good ""Summer Nights"" and ""You're The One That I Want"", and the high-energy ""Greased Lightning"" (not to mention the ballads that reflected the movie's more tender moments), what you have is a soundtrack that enraptures feelings that not even the best script ever written could garner. So praise for the success of this movie should surely also be credited to Jim Jacobs, Warren Casey, John Farrar, Louis St. Louis and Barry Gibb for their brilliant musical offerings.The on-screen chemistry between John Travolta and Olivia Newton-John is complimented perfectly by the strong supporting actors, Jeff Conaway (Kenickie) and Stockard Channing (Rizzo) - two characters who, in my opinion, could've easily made this a great movie without the insertion of the Danny & Sandy characters. However, I'm not so sure that, in reality, the ""T Birds"" who were supposed to epitomise all things ""cool"" would've allowed Doody, Sonny & Putzie to join their gang, but it did explain the unwritten ""T-Bird"" code that their members had to date the ""Pink Ladies"" (which, in turn, explained the inclusion of the lesser members of the girl gang). However, that's one flaw to be easily overlooked in a movie that's not supposed to be taken seriously, I guess. Saying that, what can't be overlooked is the fact some of the actors playing 'teenagers' looked too old to be doing so. Michael Tucci (Sonny) and Annette Charles (Cha-Cha) appeared to look way beyond their teenage years.The rest of the supporting cast played their roles ever so well; from the comedic performances of screen veterans like Eve Arden (Principal McGee), Sid Caesar (Couch Calhoun), Dody Goodman (Blanche), Alice Ghostley (Mrs Murdock) and Edd Byrnes (Vince Fontaine); the menacing leader of the rival Scorpions gang, Leo (the late Dennis C Stewart); the obnoxious and not-so-innocent Patty Simcox (Susan Buckner); the ultimate 'high school jock' - and for a while, Sandy's love interest, Tom Chishum (Lorenzo Lamas); the one guy that epitomised the term 'geek', Eugene (Eddie Deezen); and Barry Pearl, Michael Tucci, Kelly Ward (the ""T-Birds"") and Didi Conn, Jamie Donelly and Dinah Manoff (The ""Pink Ladies"").""Grease"" isn't above criticism though, and there were several things that could've either been elaborated on more or removed to make the story better. I'd have liked to have seen how Danny & Sandy met (I felt his was too rushed at the beginning of the movie); the ""Chitty Chitty Bang Bang""-inspired ending removed the movie's credibility; the ""dream sequence"" with Frenchy and the Teen Angel was just too boring; and the 'Thunder Road' scene would've been more plausible if the director hadn't tried to copy a scene from ""Rebel Without A Cause"". Still, those are all minor gripes in an otherwise brilliant movie.All in all, if you haven't seen the movie - and despite my spoilers, the outcome of ""Grease"" is as predictable as night following day - all I can say is I recommend you to do so. Watch it, and understand why this movie has achieved so much success and positive reviews over the years. There's also ""Grease 2"", but please, watch the sequel with caution as it's nothing.let me say that again..it's nothing like the original.",Grease
296,marylandflower,A must watch,10,29 October 2017,"The movie Grease is a required viewing for me. The way the movie plays out is done very well. Olivia Newton-John plays Sandy very well, portrays her as the innocent person that she is. While John Travolta plays the bad boy Danny and does that very well. Aside from the fact that the movie was made a while so it is a little weird, it is still good. As a teenager it portrayed what being in high school is really like. Everyone cares what you think and does whatever it takes to fit in. Also the music in it is very genius. They got people who could hit the high notes. Some people that you cast in musicals could not hit the high notes. The movie has a lot of sexual innuendos which pull people in and if they are in high school like me provide a little laugh. The music is brilliant especially the song ""Hopelessly Devoted"" because it explains exactly how a girl feels about her crush in high school and how bad it can get when you like someone that much. ""You're the one that I want"" is also a very good song because it shows that in the end some people can get together if you have a strong enough connection. Even with the fitting in, Sandy just wants friends not so much fitting in just wants to make some friends out of the whole experience. Frenchie later decided that she wanted to follow her dreams, but in the friend group no one ended up caring about that anymore. The movie does deal with some serious topics. As in people wanting to have sex so that they can fit in is a huge problem. Rizzo faces maybe going to lose her friends if she does not have sex it shows this vulnerable side of her that we had not seen in the rest of the movie. I don't think that Rizzo knew exactly what would be the consequences if she went through with this only thinking about the friends that she wanted to keep made her do that. The fact about doing that to fit in was okay shows the difference between high school then and then you see now where it has that, but has been amplified and worse. I feel that Grease can tell a story about the hardships, great ending or not it still shows the struggle of what you have to do if you care about someone enough. Sandy and Danny they were a couple I doubted a lot but they ended up fighting and were able to come through with so much experience. Even though the friends may have judged them they still liked each other enough to make it work. I feel that all the pressure put on can fall off if you watch this movie you can see people that really care about you versus who is using you. It is hard for people to see who is there.",Grease

Again another film I've been watching since I was a kiddie - probably why I never tire of watching it! I love it - the colours, the actors, the songs and music.I know every single song and most of the lines. I still to this day can't quite believe that, that is the same Sandy (Olivia Newton-John) at the end, all dolled up with her permed hair, fag in mouth, pierced ears and very tight catsuit (which she apparently had to be sewn into!) You can't help falling in love with Danny (John Travolta) as he is gorgeous, you know, the type of cool good looking guy that every girl wants to go out with.I don't have a favourite actor or actress in this movie because they are all brilliant. Sorry if I sound like I'm gushing! One thing I didn't realise till I was an adult was the amount of sexual innuendo and rude comments made.

To this day it is my favorite movie of all time. My best friend and I paid to see this movie 37 times the first year it was out. We used to act out scenes when we played. It gave me a love of musicals that has only grown over time. It made me a lifetime fan of John Travolta (I had seen him before I was a big ""Welcome Back Kotter"" fan). Same goes for Olivia Newton-John and Stockard Chaning to a lesser degree.There was something about this movie that touched me to the core back then. It is fun, wholesome entertainment. Almost everyone loves a good love story but this one provided fun, great music, and John Travolta in a killer leather jacket.Now, in my family, it is a tradition. We have passed it down to our children and they have become fans. I have a picture of my godson dancing with John Travolta to ""Greased Lightning."" It's the cutest thing you will ever see.

305,Snaked_Dog,Grease Truly is Kool,10,20 July 2003,"I loved Grease. I thought it was the best movie i've seen in a long time. The main reason 'Grease' was so successful was because it was set in the 50's and who could forget the swinging 50's!! The time where pop culture or teen Culture was born. In America at least anyway. Another Reason which makes this one of those true Classic Movies of all time is it's Cast. Who could forget that adorable lil Olivia Newton-John playing Sandy. Grease has one of the best supporting cast team ever. Then there's Keniki, Danny and Rizo. It's just the way High School was meant to be. Happy, Fun and well forfilled, as in not wasting a second. I think Grease will be watched by many generations for years to come.

Then I caught my eye on the chemistry between John Travolta's and Olivia Newton-John's characters. It was really something else. I had to see the movie over and over again.Then there was a break of something like 5 to 10 years. Until some year, I'm not sure if it was 2001 or what, I had to buy it for myself, as a Christmas present, because I had seen some movie from Travolta and had liked it.

327,ggrodzinsky,"Decent movie making fun of the 50's with no ""bad"" message",7,9 June 2007,"Two comments. First, some reviewers are taking the movie too seriously, it is supposed to be a caricature of the 50's. One earlier reviewer cited Sandra Dee and James Dean parallels, etc, no need to repeat it. While it had fun dance music and hits (although I am usually not a Bee Gees fan, even when I was younger) with several famous and soon to be famous actors, the reason I give it a 7 versus something higher is that it gets a little too serious regarding Sandra and Danny (inconsistent with the rest of the movie, even the possible pregnancy is taken less seriously) and it did not keep true to the original musical.Second, the comments regarding sending bad messages was bit confusing. I don't see this message. One of the earlier reviewers talked about losing virginity as a must based on this movie. Well, to start this is inconsistent with the pregnancy issue where the character is mocked for being ""knocked up"" and even referred to as trash. The character tries to defend her actions by saying it's better than being an insincere flirt, but you can see she really regrets what she did inside. It also shows how virginity was still the vogue back then and that all the other provocative women were putting on a show. Next there are the comments about Sandy conforming to Danny's (and the T-birds/Pink Ladies) behavior, look etc in order to be accepted. The movies clearly shows that she was accepted before she made the alterations. One of the pink ladies befriends her, and Betty thanks her for her support. Danny letters in track and tries to change HIS LOOK for her in a mutual sign of affection. Sandy is not conforming to Danny as much as it may seem. She is mature in that she is kind to everyone and is responsible. However, she is immature because she lacks confidence in herself and how to deal with Danny. At the end she matures in that department by asserting herself and getting her man. She changes her dress, look and attitude not to conform but to get Danny's attention that she really wants him, and that she is the one in charge, not him. She now is asserting herself, showing confidence and at the same time saying she is willing to accept him for the way he is by ""dressing up"" for a day. It is interesting though that no one mentioned Danny putting on that awful sweater with the letter on to conform to his image of Sandy. Sandy knew that Danny's jacket, T-bird routine was just a ruse for whom he really was and she figured to play the ruse with him....Lastly, several commented on the women's roles issue and minorities. It appeared to me that the women had the upper hand in these relationships and a woman was a principal of a school in the 50's, etc. As for minorities and their appearance in the 1950's Rydell was in California. Was there segregation in California? I wasn't aware of any. Secondly, anyone know the percentage of African Americans in a typical LA well to do high school in the 1950's (or the 1990's for that matter)? Let's just say it was really low. So, it was realistic. I do agree that it is not nostalgia for the 50's I feel in this movie, it mocks the 50's. It to me is more nostalgic of the 1970's and the actors who became the stars later on and the music that I heard when I was a kid.",Grease

329,honeydip_brown,Great but did it give out the wrong message???,9,30 April 2007,"I loved this movie, even when I watched it at the age of five and didn't understand the theme; the dancing and singing were great.I've watched Grease and Grease 2 (both totally different but same in some ways). The reason is: Danny and Sandy met at a beach, fell in love, then parted their ways at the end of summer. Then comes high school, which coincidently, they both have. Danny is someone Sandy would had never expected and does he seem to change his ways from the bad boy look (the T-birds)? No. And despite the original and great vibe this gives out, the romance, comedy, bad boy, good girl kind of thing, it kind of sends out a bad message.Only because people are being or rather pretending to be things they are not for the love of others, i.e Sandy, whom at the end was an official Pink Ladie and she was smoking or whatnot, whichever the case. And even though it was good, it was great, really (!), it just had you thinking; ""like wow, is that forreal?"" And Grease 2 did the same but i didn't watch the last thirty minutes of it so I won't say, maybe Michael decided to actually be true to himself and realize that Stephanie was just not his type. ""You can't force love"", duh.Well anyway, overall, BOTH movies were great and I recommend it for anyone who likes the 60's themes. I give this movie a nine; only because it was dumb love. :P",Grease

Maybe even look for the movie ""Grease 2"",also. I also really enjoyed the music it is really good to roller skate to and dance to also. I love everything about this movie and the soundtrack as well. They both are very awesome. The movie ""Grease 2"" is almost as good as the original.

They even cut more of the song where they are dancing around the car. This movie is now not good to watch. They also cut out the seen of the sleepover where Rizo is singing a song.

I have seen Grease many times and I always enjoy the songs, the funny moments where Danny tries to impress Sandy by joining sports teams. I recommend this movie to everyone. It has very cool dance scenes which is a nice change to todays booty shaking.Grease has something for everyone, for the girls we have John Travolta and for the boys there is Sandy and trust me the ending is a pure delight for for both boys and girls.Overall a very fun movie to watch...and besides who doesn't like to see John Travolta singing and dancing.

342,elitephoenix,Better than it's rated...,9,31 January 2007,"If this movie was made in todays era it may not stand as strong as it does now but you must keep in mind that it is a film that is almost 30 years old. It is a staple in American pop culture. It is a cult classic if nothing else. A timeless one at that. Please don't get me wrong... I'm not one of those that is just ""ALL ABOUT"" this movie. This movie came out the year I was born for crying out loud. But there is a place in everyone that can relate on some level to this movie. Whether it be the music, the attitudes of the sexes or the time itself. Good acting, awesome soundtrack and one of the most beautiful women of her time Olivia Newton-John. It's down right stupid that this film has such a low rating by the viewers that have voted. Again let me restate the fact that I'm not some dorky kid that wishes he would have grown up in the fifties, or some individual that has Grease posters up on all my walls 'cause I don't (not that there is anything wrong with either). I'm not even 29 years old and I'm saying this. Everyone I know feels pretty much the same way including my girlfriend who is only 23 by the way. It truly is timeless... I encourage all to see at least once! (JUST BEING HONEST!)",Grease
343,rowan_86,"Excellence, last true musical ever made",10,18 February 2007,"The last REAL musical ever made. A timeless film that generations will love for ever. No other musical made since had can stand up to this type of quality. Though films such as Moulin Rouge and Chicago have been made since they are not the same type of musical as this. Greese is the last in the same category as the likes of 'On the Town', 'Hello Dolly', 'The Sound of Music', 'Kiss me Kate', 'Meet me in St Louis' etc. Grease encapsulates the change between era's of film/TV. This film will always remain as one of my all time favourites! Not only does the story line interest most generations but the music is catchy and helps tell the story. The scenes are spectacular, no film today actually uses entire casts to create a scene, we rely upon computer generated crowds and copies, and thankfully Grease has none.",Grease
344,mighty_magpie,Grease.. a very poor film in my opinion...,1,4 June 2007,"Having seen this film I am of the opinion that it is one of the most over-rated films ever. Its basically juvenile piffle, a very weak story line is compounded by equally poor acting from the entire cast, this is a film that should never have got further than the cutting room floor.n The storyline has been done so many times and in the case of this film results in a truly awful film of epic proportions. As per usual, it aims to portray the American way of life as squeaky clean and the soundtrack is so poor, it beggars belief that the songs released into the pop charts fared so well. John Travolta proves once again what a one-dimensional actor he really is, whilst Olivia Newton John shows no ability whatsoever. I truly recommend anybody who has not yet watched this puerile trite not to bother",Grease
345,John-ITC,Great movie,10,18 March 2009,"ReviewTitle : Grease since : 1978 main act : John Travolta , Oliva Newton genre : romantic comedy musical. Character : Danny, Sandy When I was adolescent, accidentally I gained this movie. It released before I was even born. I will narrate about Grease's contents.Oneday, Dany and Sandy meet on the beach in vacation, and they fall in love each other. but they should detach because a time was finish to travel. but Sandy transfered her school to his school by accidentally. however Sandy was too innocent and Dany was not good natured student. he'd must bluff because he is leader of Sunderbird (gang group) and she couldn't apprehend about that. finally he realized that The Thunderbird is not as important as her and he determined to change his temper. however she also thought about same thing. In graduation, she changed her attitude and wearing. and finishGrease's pointYou mustn't lose John Travolta's dance. I couldn't keep laughing while I watch the movie. this movie made John Travolta celebrity after that all of the movie with John used to succeed where ever and whenever. If you can afford to watching movie and if you want to find the movie for John Travolta, you'd better select ""The fever of Satherday night."" you also can see the John's dance skill.",Grease
346,forthisreason52,Can't deny the great music.,8,4 April 2009,"I really enjoy watching this movie and always have. The music is amazing, the dancing is hilarious and energetic...entertainment, is what it is. :) Anyone looking for morals will be sadly disappointed, but anyone who looks for morals in Hollywood is kind of a fool anyways. Although I do have one thing to say - a lot of people get all huffy about Sandy's big transformation at the end. They say it was about fitting in and ""putting out"". But I disagree. I obviously don't know what the movie makers were going for, but based on what I see I come to a different conclusion than some other people. First off, Sandy doesn't show any signs of trying to fit in with the Pink Ladies or the cheerleaders or anyone else. She's just nice to everyone and doesn't like conflict. I mean she doesn't quit cheerleading or anything! And smoking was a little different in the 50's and even the 70's, I'm pretty sure - it was so much more common and not such a big deal. Next, when she sings to herself, she describes the Sandra Dee personality as ""so scared and unsure"". So when she says goodbye to Sandra Dee, she's saying goodbye to being ""scared and unsure"". When she walks out with that new look, the most noticeable thing is her confidence. She's showing Danny (and herself) that there is a confident woman inside that shy little girl; that there's more to her than meets the eye. She's getting his attention and showing him and everyone else that she can and will fight for him. Also, note that she sings ""you'd better shape up"". Which, incidentally, he has tried to do by lettering in track (and in other ways). She's not saying she'll be anything he wants and have sex if he'll take her. She still shows a more rounded, aware version of the ""Sandra Dee"" wholesomeness by demanding a *man*. They are both trying to understand each other so that their supposedly different worlds can come together - he is trying to show that he can be depended on. She is trying to show that she can understand and embrace the rebel side of him, and that she isn't a rug to be walked on. She's more demanding respect than compromising herself - as others say. It's more of a meeting in the middle of two people learning how to understand each other's differences than a good girl mindlessly pandering for a bad boy. Still no sparkling moral message, but not, I don't think, the shallow chauvinist tragedy some see it to be. I always cheered for them - shy Sandy blooming for her man, and immature Danny laying down his pride for his girl. :)That said...is there anyone who doesn't love the music in this movie? Whole reason I watch it, that's for sure! ;D",Grease
347,Numba1GreaseFan,I'd just like to say...........,10,30 April 2003,GREASE IS WONDERFULLL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Before I used to think I was mad for watching Grease everyday without fail but it seems like you nutters are doing the exact same thing as me! If only school was actually like that. When Grease ends and the car goes into the sky and it sounds like chipmunks are singing it makes me wanna CRY! cos I know its over *sobs* When will they ever make a follow up to Grease so I know that Danny and Sandy are still going strong. Oh I pray for a Grease 3. If Paramount don't make one then I'll be forced to make a rip-off version in my own school with real teenagers that cant act. Anyway hopefully they'll be putting Grease back into the cinemas for the 25th anniversary. PLEASE!!!!!!!!!!,Grease
348,kokdemir,Means a lot of thing for our generation.,10,23 July 2003,"Grease is much more than an ordinary movie. As Travolta said before ""it cannot be exchanged for anything else"". Grease is consisted of full of passion, joy, energy, and friendship. After 1978, I could not remember any musical that influence audience so much. Form United States to Europe, Asia, and Africa many people got the chance of tasting the Grease. In Turkey, when we are teenagers, Travolta was one of the our idols, and of course we felt in love with Olivia Newton John. Now, writing a comment on Grease inform me that we are getting old :)",Grease
349,paulwohler,One of the most annoying movies of all time...,1,6 August 2003,"I guess if you like the whole nonsensical feeling of musicals and the bland white bread humor of Americas Funniest videos you would probably like this movie too...  Personally, I hate musicals (except for the Blues Brothers). Thank God that John Travolta learned how to act later in his career.  I guess this is supposed to be a classic, but I have never been able to stand it.  Horrible over the top acting broken up by ridiculous song and dance numbers...  UGH!!!",Grease
350,Wildthingncc1701,Funniest part of movie,10,13 March 2006,"The funniest part of the movie lasts about 1 frame or so. It's where Cid Ceasar tells John Travolta he'll have to cut his smoking down to 2 packs a day pulls a cigarette out of his mouth and gives him a look that was so funny I totally cracked up. I even stayed to see it again but I missed it! I've watched ""Grease"" many times since and have never seen that look again but I know it's there. I guess it's Ceasar's timing that's so spectacular. if you can catch the look, it's the best part of the whole movie, and the whole movie is just terrific, really typifies the 1950's and the music is stupendous, and Olivia Newton-John's voice is as lovely as she is. The cast was perfect, the story line was really fantastic. The spark plug in the tail pipe of the car looked so awesome at night.",Grease

352,movie_manRedux,Grease (1978).,7,8 April 2013,"There's basically no story structure, the film is episodic and really kind of plot less. Most of these characters are paper thin and the words on the page basically just introduce situations into the screen with no breathing room. The film is so borderline campy it edges on the ridiculous, there's not enough scenes between Sandy and Danny, and don't even get me started on Sandy's late act switch from naive schoolgirl to sultry bombshell (although Jim Jacobs' explanation for this change is very interesting, it doesn't come off in a convincing way on screen). And yet...it works. There's an infusing energy in this film that can only be chalked up to its pitch-perfect cast, who breathe life into these caricatures, and to Randal Kleiser's underrated direction. As far as musicals go (a genre that, I'll admit, I'm not a fan of), this is one of the most entertaining offerings, particularly because it doesn't take itself so seriously like so many modern musicals do. Jeff Conaway and Stockard Channing are scene-stealers, Olivia Newton-John is a charming presence, but it's Travolta's spirited and hilarious performance that takes the cake as MVP.",Grease

It was the highest grossing movie of 1978 and the most successful musical ever. Yet it didn't win any Oscars that year. Instead some crappy less popular movie that no one remembers won. For the one or two people who have never seen it, here's a summary. Sandy and Danny meet the summer before senior year. Sandy was from Australia and was supposed to go back. Turns out she was able to spend a year in the USA going to Rydell High. She meets up with Danny, and he acts like a jerk. They get back together and he acts like a jerk again.

It may be just a musical, but it touches on a lot of different subjects, not just high-school romance. the acting is unforgettable, the sets are all very nice and representative of that era. and who can forget the songs? the songs are just the icing on the cake. and, oh, what a sweet, sweet icing it is! Olivia-Newton John and John Travolta had such an on screen chemistry that made the movie come alive. How else do you explain that this is still one of the most popular movies out there, even today? That's a testament to Any movie, let alone a Musical. If I had to sum up what i think about this movie in one sentence, i would have to say, ""Grease is the Word!""",Grease

So bottom line: i love Grease! Best movie ever made:D And in the end of the day it is hard to find a so delicate movie as Grease because it tells a whole story mostly through songs and expressions. As the old saying: one picture( in this case many pictures) can tell more than a thousand words..The main character in the movie are perfect for each other and learn very much from each other.

357,egyptian_noble,3 things about grease,8,26 July 2005,"Grease is one of my favorite musical movies ever. it gains strength out of three important causes: 1-historical , as it archived the era of crazy sixties in America and the rest of the world . rock'n roll, clothes, hair style,dance moves, cars, and even slang.. i really enjoy watching and recollecting memories out of this movie than a dull documentary one..2- musical:some of the best songs ever composed and performed were introduces in grease 1 .. actually the soundtrack alone is a very interesting masterpiece.songs of romance,heartbreak,challenge and dance are all included..i really appreciate the efforts done by the actors to sing and dance along the music.. believe me it's not easy at all 3- the spirit:when i first saw grease I thought it was shot in a real public school.with students, teachers, contests and parties.. the spirit you find in grease is ultimately a teenagers' spirit.. and that what's great about it though it's difficult also... how to hunt this spirit and introduce it on screen without getting dull through the process of screen writing or directing or even editing...it's always there..eventually. it's amazingly entertaining movie, regardless dancing sketches which are not thoroughly done and/or dancers' movements which are not so synchronized .Oh ,and I like so much the animated entrance of the movie... it's very funny 8 out of 10",Grease

359,samcr95,Grease is the word that you Heard,10,4 July 2013,"Grease is the word. There are many musicals in the world but not one compare to the musical that is Grease. You have the T-birds and the Pink Ladies and new incomer Sandy Olsson, who overall take the story through twists and turns. Good girl Sandy and Greaser Danny must make life-changing decisions on whether being who they are now is worth loosing the one they most care about.Like most musicals, Grease tells their audience the story through song engaging the audience. With the song ""Summer Nights"" we are introduced into the background information on how exactly Sandy and Danny met during the summer. With the two stories not adding up we get a feel on the personalities of bad boy Danny and sweet and innocent Sandy. After running into each other at a pep rally for the football team, Sandy runs off crying after being humiliated by the bad boy Danny in front of his fellow T-birds and Pink Ladies. Throughout the story we see the numerous attempts by both Danny and Sandy to show one another whether it be changing from a leather jacket to a letterman jacket or dating a jock in attempts to make him jealous. Through ""Hopelessly Devoted to You"" and "" Sandy"" the couple show that no matter what they are going through now they cant and wont stop loving each other. While the Danny and Sandy are trying to make things work, Danny's second in command Kenickie is out to beat T-birds rival gang The Scorpions in a race were they will be racing for ownership papers of the cars or what they call ""Pinks"". Though a series of unfortunate events and Kenickie is incapable of racing he asks his friend Danny to take his place. After winning the race and defeating their rivals we see that Sandy has been watching the race from afar. Asking Pink Ladies' Frenchy for a makeover we see that not only did Danny make the transition from leather jacket to letterman but also Sandy went from innocent to Pink Lady newcomer. In the final scene Rydell High School has rewarded the graduating class with a senior carnival. Here we get the first look at new and improved Danny Zuko who has indeed traded in his T-bird jacket, but he isn't the only one who made a drastic change. After reassuring his fellow boys that this change in jackets didn't mean the end to their friendship, Danny is soon interrupted by the new Sandy Olsson. ""You're The One That I Want"" is the final song number the couple sing showing that they both changed their ways to be with each other and in the end it worked out for the best. The final number the T-birds and the Pink Ladies perform is the song, "" We Go Together"". This number gives the audience the final feel for the movie and the two groups of friends as they part ways. Yes the movie isn't the most relevant and up to date movie, but it still has what it takes to be a classic. With the love story that Grease takes us on, we take a trip when not just the girl has to change for the guy but also the guy goes through endless activities to be with his one true love. This movie is one you can't get tired of. The more you watch the more the songs stick with you and with the songs it just adds in to the affect that comes with watching Grease. Grease really and truly is the word. And it's a movie that is worthy enough to be considered a classic.",Grease
360,JMTyria,"Good movie, but not as good as the play on which it was based...",6,9 January 2005,"While I agree with most of the posts that ""Grease"" is a cool movie, there are a few things the writers did to bring it to the silver screen that really distorts, not enhances, Jim Jacobs and Warren Casey;s original vision.I know that when adapting a play or musical to the screen that it ought not be a word for word copy of the stage version, but I do feel that at least most of the songs should be used, with new ones added by the original composer(s).To illustrate what I mean, I thought I would type a quick scene synopsis of the stageplay, and for those who are only familiar with the movie, you'll see just how much it was changed from the original play. You'll also notice that songs like ""Grease!"", ""Hopelessly Devoted To You"", ""Sandy"", and ""You're The One That I Want"" were never in the stage version. Also, the songs that they did retain often were sung by different characters, and they were in the wrong place. To glaring examples is ""Greased Lightin'"", which is Kennickie's song on stage, and ""There Are Worse Things I Could Do"" which Rizzo sings to Sandy on stage. Two more points before I share the synopsis. The stage play opens with a class reunion then flashes back to 1959. That would have been easier to execute on film than it is on stage. On stage Danny's gang is called ""Burger Palace Boys"" not ""T-Birds"" :ACT ONE:Scene One:REUNION ""Alma Mater""...Eugene, Patty, Ms. Lynch - ""Alma Mater Parody""...Burger Palace Boys, Pink Ladies/ Scene Two: CAFETERIA AND SCHOOL STEPS ""Summer Nights""...Danny, Sandy, Burger Palace Boys, Pink Ladies -""Those Magic Changes""...Doody, Burger Palace Boys/ Scene Three: PAJAMA PARTY ""Freddy, My Love""...Marty, Pink Ladies/ Scene Four: STREET CORNER AT NIGHT ""Greased Lighting""...Kennickie, Burger Palace Boys/ Scene Five: SCHOOLYARD ""Rydell's Fight Song""....Patty and Sandy/ Scene Six: PARK ""Mooning""...Roger and Jan (Roger is known as ""Putzie"" in the film) ""Look At Me, I'm Sandra Dee...Rizzo ""We Go Together""...Burger Palace Boys, Pink LadiesACT TWO: Scene One: KID'S HOMES ""Shakin' At The High School Hop""...Burger Palace Boys, Pink Ladies - ""It's Raining On Prom Night""...Sandy, Off-stage Radio Voice/ Scene Two: SCHOOL GYM ""Born To Hand-Jive""...Johnny Casino, Ensemble/ Scene Three: BURGER PALACE ""Beauty School Dropout""...Teen Angel, Frenchy, Salon Chorus/ Scene Four: DRIVE-IN ""Alone At A Drive-In Movie""...Danny, Burger Palace Boys/ Scene Five: JAN'S PARTY ""Rock 'N Roll Party Queen""...Roger and Doody - ""There Are Worse Things I Could Do""...Rizzo - ""Look At Me, I'm Sandra Dee Reprise""...Sandy/ Scene Six: BURGER PALACE ""All Choked Up""...Danny, Sandy, Burger Palace Boys, Pink Ladies/ FINALE ""We Go Together Reprise""...Full CompanySo, as you can see, it went through quite a lot of changes to make it to the big screen, and IMHO, I feel the stage version is better, but the movie is good as it's own material. It's a totally different beast than it's stage counterpart.",Grease
361,elbonio-1,Vibrant reminder of what musicals are about,9,25 January 2005,"Yes it may be cheesy, yes it may be predictable. But it's a feel-good film, as most musicals are. There are not many musicals that don't have a happy ending of some sort and boy this has the mother of happy endings.With quality songs and stunning choreography throughout, Grease is full of style, culminating in the finale which as i said - is happy ending mode on speed.With two of the best songs - ""You're the one that I want"" and ""we go together"" back to back with some stunning choreography and a real sense of chemistry between the energetic players, the ending leaves you feeling good - the happy gas is so strong it even makes the car fly into the sunset at the end! It's a classic example of the feel-good musical, which is why people love it so much.",Grease
362,Palini,The musical of my life,10,5 February 2005,"This movie is just excellent, more than that. I love it since the first time i saw it, because is such a happy movie, is like a dream. And the songs are really good.This movie is set on the 50's This movie is about, Danny Zuko, and Sandy Olson romance (John Travolta, Olivia Newton-Jones). He's a T-Bird boy, and she's a cheerleader.He's a rebel, he and his friends wear black leather jackets, and they walk in an arrogant way. She's, like the perfect woman; blue eyes, blonde hair, thin, and she's very polite and correct. Stockard Channing's role;Rizo, has a strong personality, and is careless and very sarcastic. She as Marty, Jan, and Frenchie belong to the pink-lady's sorority. I think the best song of the movie is 'There are worst things i could do', performed by Stockard Channing, who has got such a beautiful voice. The best moment of the movie, i think it would be the National Band Stand ball. That's the moment when you see all dancers, dancing and jumping as fast as they can. John Travolta's, Olivia Newton-Jones, and especially, Stockard Channing's performances are brilliant. They sing as well as they dance, and act. The music is the best. The rhythm of some songs, like, You're the one that i want, make you stand up, and dance. I can't compare this movie with an other, but let me tell you that Grease 2, isn't as good as this one. I truly recommend to all that people who had never seen it, to buy some pop-corn and cokes, and hire Grease at the movies shop. Is worth of seen it!",Grease

The leading actors in this film are John Travolta and Olivia Newton-John.The story is about two young people in a High School. It is a love story between a girl coming from a rich background and a boy who is the leader of a school gang.All the film is rhythmed by lively musics and dances. The subject is entertaining but the end is too predictable there is no real suspense. It isn't a gripping movie but it is rather a girlish movie.Today Grease is a reference movie. There were a lot of adaptations in musicals and we can still listen some of the famous songs on the radio or in parties.Even if it is not a sensible movie, we recommend you to see it for your musical culture.",Grease
364,annalise_24,The Most re-watched film in my collection!!,10,7 March 2005,"One of the best musicals of all time and most certainly since it was made in the late 70's. I watched it in the cinema as a child and have re watched it hundreds of times since, i know children of all ages who can watch it today for the first time and still have the enthusiasum and enthraulment i had and still have!! There aren't many movies that can keep hooking in audiences over several generations and still get them coming back for more!!! A classic with perfect casting acting and directing!! Stockard Channing outshines all with her portrayal of Betty Rizzo, a classy, sassy unbeatable performance!! This will always be my favourite all time film :)",Grease
365,snoopy27,Awesome,10,16 April 2005,"I absolutely loved Grease, both one and two. Perfect pick with the actors. Couldn't have picked a better bunch of people. I love the clothes, the hair, and the songs. They get stuck in your head. Best song is Summernights. I would like to know where the movie was filmed? I would visit the spot. What are the other actors doing now, what other movies have they done, besides John? But it is a shame that John and Oliva were not in Grease 2. Would have made it even better. I am a love of Musicals. John and Oliva work great together, almost like they are a real couple. I would watch any movie with John in it. Do John and Oliva appear in any other movie together? But Grease is my all time favorite movie.",Grease
366,Theater_Princess19,Grease Will Always Be The Word...,10,31 May 2005,"How do I start? I love this film! It has a great plot line and incredible music. It is a fun musical that makes you want to get up and dance.Grease is the story of Danny Zucko and Sandy Olsen (or Dumbruski) two high school seniors who fall in love over the summer. They have a wonderful summer together and are sad to see it end. The first day of school arrives and little does Danny know him and Sandy would soon be reunited. But Sandy is shocked to find the nice guy she meet at the beach is the leader of a greaser gang called 'The T'birds' Meanwhile Sandy is trying to fit in with her new ""friends"" the T'birds female counterparts The Pink Ladies. Will Sandy and Danny ever be together again? Along with this plot comes song that will be stuck in your head for centuries. Such songs include Summer Nights, Beauty School Dropout and the now famous song Greased Lightining. Grease is a timeless classic that will have you singing and dancing by the end of the movie.",Grease
367,lysraypec09,This movie is the best..... a true classic,10,26 June 2005,"Since I am still just a teen, I know that many others might say I am not one to criticize a movie, and in most cases I might disagree, but with this movie... what is there to criticize? The atmosphere of the movie, the charisma of the actors, the addiction to the awesome songs in it, even the what could have been outdated costumes instantly became a Halloween fave... I myself dressed up as ""new"" Sandy when I was little... and I still wish I could have been in the movie. I admit, the sequel to it seemed horrible to me after watching the original, and I wished they had kept all of the original actors, and well, not tried to even make the sequel, but, well a movie like that can only be made once I suppose. Anyways, I just want to give my props and admiration to all of the directors, actors, and others who helped with this movie, (being an ITS member myself and LOVING acting) I think that anyone who has not seen this movie needs to go right to the store and find it.... otherwise they really missed out. :)Thanks for reading this, hope you agree!",Grease
368,sjlaplant,Still the best!,7,22 March 2015,"Grease is the story of two teenagers (Danny Zuko, played by John Travolta and Sandy Olsson played by Olivia Newton-John) who meet the summer before their senior year of high school. At the end of the summer, they are both sad because Sandy is supposed to head back to Australia. Little do they both know at the time that Sandy's father is staying there for work and she will be attending the same high school as Danny. Danny is the leader of a group of boys that go by the name of the T-Birds. They portray themselves as a tough group who hang out with/date their female counterparts, the Pink Ladies. Sandy is portrayed as a wholesome, sweet, naïve girl who is the complete opposite of both the T-Birds and the Pink Ladies. The film centers on the challenges that Danny and Sandy face to try to make a relationship work while overcoming their differences. By the end of the film both Danny and Sandy try to transform themselves into something more like the other. Danny joins and letters in track to try to become more ""wholesome"" like the both Sandy dates during the movie. Sandy transform herself into a cigarette smoking, big hair, leather pants wearing girl that she thinks Danny prefers. The films subplot centers around the other members of the group, focusing mainly on the problems with a couple of the Pink Ladies, Frenchy (played by Didi Conn and Rizzo (played by Stockard Channing). Frenchy decides to leave high school and enter beauty school. She ends up having a tough time with it and comes back to high school. Rizzo is the tough acting one of the group and ends up having a pregnancy scare that she tries to work through on her own. The costume and makeup designers did a great job making you feel like you were really there in the '50s with the actors. The clothing was realistic throughout. The on screen chemistry between all the actors is fantastic. You get the sense that they all enjoyed working together that came through on screen. And you can't talk about Grease without talking about the music. The songs are still enjoyed as much today as they were when the movie came out nearly 40 years ago. The film does a good job in showing that friends stick together through problems and trials and tribulations of going through high school and surviving any way you can. Overall, Grease is a great feel-good movie musical that will have you watching it time and time again.",Grease
369,patchouli-lover,"Friggin' ""A""",10,7 July 2005,"I am 23 years old and I freaking love this movie. The first time I saw it was when I was 10, and I loved it. I remember it took a while for it to come out in DVD, so I had it recorded on a VHS. I bought the DVD when it first came out. I know the songs by memory. My favorite song is You're the One that I Want. Can anyone say black leather outfit. Olivia Newton-John. HOT! Anyways, the movie is about Summer flings, first loves, and innocence. Something of which there is very little these days. So if you're in a nostalgic mood, or just want to relax and watch a nice family movie I highly recommend this movie. As Sonny from the T-Birds would say Friggin' A!",Grease
370,abz_zarb,Family-Fun Movie Flunk,6,4 December 2015,"Over 37 years ago Grease came out as a family movie but because of the way this movie talks about the issue of sex, it fails as a family movie. Looking at the scenes of making out in cars, the way it handles the issue of accidental pregnancy, and the raunchy lyrics of some of the songs all suggest this gets an 'F' as a family movie.The movie opens with a scene on the beach. Danny Zuko (John Travolta) suggests that sex will make his new found love with Sandy Olsen (Olivia Newton-John) complete. Comments from the T-Bird gang throughout the movie talk about sex in a physical, vulgar way. This is seen specifically in the Drive-In scene when the camera panos a display of teenagers making out in cars, Danny and Sandy being one of them. Danny makes a move on Sandy by grabbing her breast without her consent. This is an issue because Danny doesn't consider how Sandy feels about their physical relationship which coincides with their emotional one as well. Continuing with the film there is a school dance scene where the dancing is sexually suggestive, Rizzo and the Pink Ladies gang go off with random guys in cars and the T- Birds look up girls' skirts on the bleachers. Visually, in this movie, there is a lot of foggy car windows, horizontal kissing, and overly composed high school scenes, giving this movie less credentials to be deemed for the family. Yes, in high school there are things your kids will see they are unfamiliar with regarding sex, but Grease over dramatizes the high school scene and suggest that the only way of dealing with sex is to sleep around and go until you are pushed too far.Of course, in all family movies there is the pregnancy scare--NOT. The central argument of this film and how it handles the issue of virginity which later advances to the conflict of a pregnancy scare objectifies the female characters. The dialogue Grease and how it talks about this pregnancy scare might be a problem to contemporary viewers with its representation of women: rather than showing women as powerful figures who take charge of their circumstances, Grease's women are ""beauty school drop-outs,"" ""hopelessly devoted"" to abusive males, and characterized insultingly as skanks and sluts--except for the most virtuous of them, who is ""lousy with virginity."" The music performance is what makes Grease a family favorite and this is where contemporary audiences justify Grease as a family-fun movie. Some the of lyrics to the soundtrack include: ""lousy with virginity,"" ""I'm losing control,"" ""I need a man who can keep me satisfied,"" and ""she got friendly down in the sand."" The lyrics and performances continue to press the issue of sex, and the raunchy lyrics suggest the topic of sex should just be tossed around only for pleasure and fun and game.Subliminal messages and sexual content is seen all over the screen. From Rizzo's getaway from the sleepover and pregnancy scare to the rampant sex scenes in the cars, the constant theme of sex is widely distributed in the film. One might argue this is a family movie because of Sandy and her strong values but that argument only holds true right up into the end. Sandy drops all morals and standards to be with Danny. Yeah, that's the message we want for all our daughters. Passed generations have celebrated Grease as a family fun movie but contemporary parents, based on the world we live in that is more open to talking about issues regarding sex, should be more skeptical of Grease's sex crazed characters.",Grease
371,aafowlks,"A ""Greasy"" Reputation",3,6 December 2015,"Have you ever met a person who is completely different when they is around their friends? Well, that would describe Danny Zuko (The great John Travolta) right on the mark. Danny is a teenager who is driven by his reputation of being the coolest kid in the school. This film provides an excellent view on the issue of reputation. It argues that having a reputation is more important than developing a relationship with the person whom you fell in love with. During the first song, called ""Summer Nights"", you can see the difference between Danny's real personality and his personality when he is with his friends. During the song, all the guys sing about is what they did sexually, and asking how good she was, and all that stuff, whereas Sandy and her friends sing more about the ""falling in love"". Sandy describes the lovely things that they did on the beach, and all the fun they had playing around in the water and watching sunsets and such. I think this song really sets the tone for what happens later in the movie, and is foreshadowing the separation between Sandy and Danny. Another time when we see the issue of reputation is when Sandy and Danny first meet after the Pep Rally for the football team. When they first see each other, it's almost like they are genuinely happy to see each other, but then Danny takes a look at his friends, and immediately changes. He acts very stuck up and full of himself, just like his friends expect him to do, which leads into him saying some really stupid, snotty jokes to Sandy. Danny is known for treating girls like toys, and acting like he is the most important person in the relationship. He can't let this sweet little girl ruin his image! This is the first real time where we see the issue of reputation, and how the film portrays it; as something more important than love. This issue is also apparent when they go to the diner. Danny doesn't want to go in, since he doesn't want his friends to see him alone with Sandy, but she insists. Danny is a completely different person when his friends come up and sit with him. He makes jokes and rejects Sandy when she asks him if he wants to meet her parents for tea. In this particular scene, it is apparent that Danny is afraid to show who he really is. He doesn't want his friends to see him love another person. As you can see, there are many scenes in this film that really show the issue of reputation. I get it, your reputation is a big part of high school. You care a lot about what others think of you, and you want to keep your friends, but does this aspect of a reputation mean that you should lose the girl you fell in love with? I don't think so. That is why I do not agree with how they presented this issue. It teaches kids the wrong idea about how a relationship should work.",Grease
372,milleniumjeph,Awesome!!!!,10,9 October 2005,"I may be young, but this movie was so good that even I could relate. It reminded me of something that I would want my life to be like when I got into high school. John Travolta and Olivia Newton-John are an awesome combo. The movie is so ironic, hilarious, and fun. It shows teens that even though high school can be drag and make you want to stab your eyes out, it can still be great fun. I was raised watching this movie with my mom, and I still enjoy it to this day. It never gets old no matter how many times you watch it. It's a classic. I don't know anyone who does not absolutely love this movie. If someone does not enjoy it, they must be lacking a couple of brain cells. This is a movie that will go down in history.",Grease
373,dxiv,Sweet sump oil is just false 50's nostalgia,2,4 March 2018,"A shallow, accessible big studio trifle which had the right songs, the right stars and the right 'feel good' vibe AT THE TIME for the comfortable, uncritical (mainly) white, middle-class audience that it was expressly made for and hyped to in the late 70's. As a light, frothy, inconsequential film which thoroughly entertained its undemanding demographic audience, it was a marketer's dream. The film does not stand up to any sort of critical scrutiny, but it was never meant to. Phony situations, lazy plotting, forced tension, pretentious drama and most of all a naive and ignorant knowledge of teenage culture at the time combine to make this the perfect 'false nostalgia' film (ie. a clever lie) - we are drawn in to pining for a guilt-free innocent past that never existed. 'Grease' treats its characters and 'story line' in a camp, jokey way without ever taking the leap into satire, which would have made for a much better film. Rizzo's persona & worldly cynicism is what a better film might have explored; this is why she feels like the most authentic character in this.
The filmmakers treat the story's participants as silly, which undercuts any kind of believable tenderness and tension between the main characters, so any attempt at meaningfully exploring what 'real' teenagers actually go through (peer group pressure, finding identity, discovering romance, breaking up, making up) is lost.
What's left? 'Grease' is primarily a catchy soundtrack over which pretty, innocent, meaningless pictures and story are laid - you are in effect 'watching' the soundtrack, like an extended MTV-style music clip, which this film helped usher in via 80's pop culture.
Want something better, with good songs, but also believable drama? Watch 'American Graffiti', or even better, find ""American Hot Wax'' and see what a good filmmaker did with similar source material. '..Wax' was my 'Grease' of 1978; better made, gritty, knowing and believable......that's why it found a very limited audience. Enough said !!!",Grease
374,looramogilenko,Truly great,8,28 June 2018,In my opinion this musical is one of the best musicals.It shows that Sandy and Danny both are willing do change themself do be with eachother.,Grease

376,Dyedmusic88,Best English Homework every for a Pink Lady :-P,10,22 March 2006,"Grease is my favorite movie ever; it's awesome to the max and beyond. This 1978 musical play turned movie could make anyone want to go back to the times of Thunderbirds and the Hand-jive. It makes Rydell High come alive, and the audience feeling like a pink lady or T-bird.This movie is set in Rydell High School, in the 1950s and follows two groups of friends through their senior year. It's a love story, a musical, and a comedy, rolled into one. It's main characters, Danny and Sandy, struggle with the pressures of their peers while trying to pursue a relationship, despite their very different social groups. It's a classic story of love and peer pressure in a 1950's high school world.I will judge this movie on the following criteria. The first thing I will judge this movie on is, the storyline/plot. The next point this movie will be judged on is, trueness to the era. I will also be judging on entertainment value, and musical quality.The storyline/plot was very believable and fun to follow. You could really understand why each character reacted to decisions of the others the way they did, and rooted for the Danny/Sandy relationship to work out. They were very true to the era, having each song, even in the background (like from the jukebox in the dinner), and the movies at the drive-in, from the right dates. They even had simple little things that could apply to any time, like teenagers drinking and smoking. This was a very entertaining movie and could be watched for years to come without losing any of that value since the main concepts are relevant to any time period.Each song in this movie is catchy and easy to remember the words to; therefore making the movie even more enjoyable each time you watch it.Basically, everyone in the world should see this movie and love it. Then they should all work together to make a time machine and go back to Rydell High, so we can all enjoy the carnival and drive off in the very hot flying car at the end. Also, we could all learn the same dance and enjoy the sounds of Sha Na Na (as Johnny Casino and the Gamblers).Favorite Quote: Frenchie-""Doody, How do I look?"" Doody- ""like a beautiful blonde pineapple""",Grease
