0,bkoganbing,Sheff Family Values,9,13 November 2018,"Beautiful Boy is a film distilled from the memoirs of both father Dave Sheff and
son Nick Sheff. Steve Carrell plays the father and Timothee Chalamet the title
role in Beautiful Boy.Drugs are so pervasive in our society I daresay there aren't any of us who doesn't
know someone who is either dealing with it themselves or as a family member who is. The hardest thing is when someone has great talent and potential and
is not realizing same because their lives are lived from day to day from fix to
fix. Such is the case of Chalamet who is a writer like his dad and who might
write the great 21st century novel.That is if he can conquer the multiple addictions he has since he was just past
puberty. Beautiful Boy is one of the first films that emphasizes the failures
happen more than the successes. There are a lot more Beautiful Boys out
there than those who did get the Monkey Off My Back.Chalamet is the product of a broken marriage as well. Carrell and Amy Ryan
have two little ones and Chalamet is the son by Carrell's first marriage to Maura Tierney. Some of the best scenes in the film are with Carrell and Tierney engaging in some long distance calling and the temptation is too easy
to blame the other. In the end you're not sure even if Carrell and Tierney were
together how that would have changed anything.Timothee Chalamet who got a Oscar nomination for Call Me By Your Name is
as appealing in that role as he is in Beautiful Boy. Two very different kind of
parts, but Tim is more than up to it. I can see a nomination for this one.Additionally one for Steve Carrell who up to now has done comedy. He shows
some real drama chops here.Beautiful Boy will definitely be in the running for Best Picture so try not to
miss it.",Beautiful Boy
1,SnoopyStyle,repetitive suffering,6,16 January 2019,"David (Steve Carell) and Vicki (Amy Ryan) are divorced parents of drug addict Nic Sheff (Timothée Chalamet). David has his second wife Karen (Maura Tierney) with two younger kids. He struggles to deal with Nic's addiction.There is a repetitiveness to the docu-style similarity to this father son relationship in the first forty five minutes. It's Oscar bait adjacent. The first truly intriguing moment comes with David buying food for a street kid. For me, that's the first new moment of the movie. It does keep going back to druggie Nic and quietly suffering David. It's a static relationship except for a couple of intriguing surprising turns. For example, I did not foresee Karen chasing after Nic. For those moments, I would recommend this movie. Overall, this movie is relying on and expecting Oscar worthy performances to carry this rather flat depiction of the devastation of drug addiction. The performances are great but there is more drama in a Lifetime movie.",Beautiful Boy
2,Horst_In_Translation,(Much more than) A strong father-son movie,6,3 February 2019,"""Beautiful Boy"" is a new American movie from 2018 directed by Belgian filmmaker Felix van Groeningen and he is also a writer here. Will this film surpass the popularity of the Oscar-nominated ""The Broken Circle Breakdown""? We shall see. Time will tell. Going back to writing, this film is based on two books actually, one of them wearing the same title like the film and written by the father in the film and secondly a book written by the son from the movie. Which shows you that the son will live in the end. Which is in fact a bit of a huge spoiler because eventually you see the son inside the toilet room at the ground and you think he is ODing. Okay, but no more spoilers now. One of the strengths here is certainly the acting. This refers to basically everybody involved, but most of all Carell, who once again proves he can also cope well with very serious material (like his Oscar nom), Chalamet and also in a smaller role Maura Tierney from ""The Affair"". Chalamet by the way scored a great deal of awards recognition like a Golden Globe nomination and an SAG Award nomination, but he did come short at the Oscars and did not manage a second nomination in a row. A bit surprising. But honestly not completely wrong. He isn't bad, but best-of-the-year worthy I don't know. I think a lot of the appreciation he received here also has to do with the makeup showing him suffering and wasted from the years of drug abuse behind him. Certainly a very baity role for him. And again, the approach to his characters being liked by the girls, being smart, highly intelligent in fact and enjoying the sweet sides of life is one we saw from him next to Armie Hammer too, so there are some parallels.But back to this film here. The maybe best moment goes to Maura Tierney. What happens when she follows the two in the car. Will she get them? Will she talk reason into them? Obviously not. That would not have made any sense. It was a hopeless endeavor from the beginning and we see her desperate in the car realizing it's not gonna happen at all. This is a reference back to the idea that there is only one person who can save him. Himself. Very smart and touching scene. And this also resulted in Carell's character pretty much giving up eventually not being willing to take him in because it won't change anything other than the boy making everybody around him as unhappy as himself. Sure, the girl OD'ing during the same ride was a bit too much and I also kinda doubt this is actually exactly how it happened, but it is okay overall. I must say I have read neither of the two books. What else can I say about this film? Oh yeah, it runs for 2 hours, even slightly over, so it is not a short film by any means. But it feels shorter, even if admittedly they were certainly 10 minutes they could have cut. Maybe in terms of the jumps in time that did not always feel coherent. But I did like those way back into the childhood that really seemed heartfelt and I liked the recurring inclusion of the two showing their love and appreciation to each other through one single word. Actually I liked that more than the title reference, but that may just be personal taste. Overall, a pretty heavy movie subject-wise and also graphically. If you can deal with that, it is worth seeing. There were some moments I struggled with topic-wise like the father trying drugs to know how his son felt (despite his own past history of drug abuse and what they turned his son into), but I guess they would not have included this moment if it hadn't happened really like that. And it is kinda nit-picking too. There are many many more superior and even some slightly memorable moments that may haunt you for long after the closing credits roll in than weaknesses this film has to offer. It is not a film where a whole lot happens. It is basically the son being struck between addicted and clean phases and the family (mostly the dad) suffering with him, but it does work. Not the the extent where I would call it best-of-the-year material, but good enough. Go see it. By the way, Brad Pitt is a producer here, you see him much more often in that field nowadays than acting it seems. Also thanks for reminding me once again how great a song Neil Young's Heart of Gold is, even if it did not go too well together with the scene for which it was used.",Beautiful Boy
3,Sleepin_Dragon,"It's a very, very good film.",8,25 February 2021,"This is such an interesting film, and one I suggest that parents of young teens watch, and one that is shown to students.It doesn't preach, it doesn't dwell on melodrama, it gives you a very real, raw story of addiction. Addiction can come in many different forms, here it shows you drug addiction, and one father's struggle to do right by his son, you'll see denial, frustration, anger, relapse and joy.It doesn't take long before it gets going and open up, the film begins the story very quickly.The acting is excellent, I really did enjoy the performance of Steve Carell, he's such a good actor.Well worth watching, 8/10.",Beautiful Boy
4,classicsoncall,"""When you mourn the living, that's a hard way to live.""",8,24 February 2019,"We all know the devastation caused by the abuse of drugs within families. ""Beautiful Boy"" makes the statement that it can happen to anyone without regard to family status. What's particularly insightful watching the Sheff's deal with son Nic's (Timothée Chalamet) addiction, is that they never lost sight of who they were in relation to each other, and seeing the love that existed between each of the family members even during the darkest periods in Nic's life. I wasn't aware that this story was based on the real life history of David and Nicholas Sheff, drawn from the writings of both some time after Nic eventually became clean and managed to persevere, one day at a time, as drug users are apt to identify. This could have been a formulaic movie, and in some ways it is as it seems to prepare the viewer for the eventual tragedy that many times is the result of hardcore addiction. The most honest message that comes out of the story occurs when David eventually comes to the understanding that there was nothing he could do for his son. Each individual has to come to the realization themselves, that addiction is a one way street and the destination is nowhere. It would be rewarding if a movie like this could make a powerful enough statement for anyone contemplating drug use to just say no, but as Nic's own experience suggests, an underlying sense of alienation and self doubt is often stronger that one's will power.",Beautiful Boy
5,jboothmillard,Beautiful Boy,6,25 March 2021,"The leading actor, best known for comedies, made a great serious debut in Foxcatcher, and I recognised the young actor from Call Me by Your Name, I liked the look of it seeing the trailer in the cinema, so I looked forward to it. Basically, David Sheff (Steve Carell) is a writer for The New York Times. His teenage son Nicholas (BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Timothée Chalamet) goes missing, only returning home two days later. David sees the obvious signs that Nic has been using drugs and takes him to a rehabilitation clinic. Nic makes progress and is transferred to a halfway house, with the agreement of his doctors. Days later, Nic disappears, and David finds him in the streets. Back at the rehab facility, Nic reveals that he has been taking numerous drugs, including crystal meth. Nic eventually completes his rehab program, and seeing his improvements, combined with wishful thinking, David allows him to go away to college on his own, to become a writer. Nic's newfound freedom and sobriety start well, he is a good student, and he starts a relationship with his classmate, Julia (Stefanie Scott). During a happy family dinner at his girlfriend's parents' house, Nic finds a bottle of pills in their medicine cabinet and takes one. Following this incident, he slowly relapses, causing Julia to break up with him, and his substance use to escalate, until he is using heroin. During this time, David has become suspicious of his son's changing behaviour, and decide to read Nic's dairy. To his horror, Nic has filled many pages with colourful descriptions of his growing addictions, including worrying words and disturbing animated drawings. On one of the pages, Nic describes difficulty getting meth, but managing to score heroin. Returning home, David senses that Nic is using again, and Nic leaves, feeling claustrophobic from his dad's suspicions about his drug use. David and Nic finally meet up in a café, and Nic asks him for money, so he can go to New York. Knowing the money will most likely be used to get drugs, David refuses, and Nic angrily leaves. David later gets a call from a New York hospital saying Nic has overdosed. David flies there to see him and talks to his ex-wife and Nic's mother Vicki (Amy Ryan). It is decided that Nic will live with Vicki in Los Angeles. Nic has a fresh start in Los Angeles. He attends meetings, spends time with his sponsor Spencer (Andre Royo), and even works at a drug clinic to help other patients overcome their addiction. Fourteen months sober, Nic drives to visit David and his family. Seeing Nic improved, interacting happily with his two younger half-siblings, David is proud of his son's newfound sobriety, as is his wife Karen (Maura Tierney). However, while leaving their house, Nic has a sudden surge of depression, resents his sobriety, and fears relapsing. Spencer gives Nic moral support over the phone, but later that night, Nic gives into temptation and drives into San Francisco. There he meets fellow druggie Lauren (Kaitlyn Dever) and, despite being clean for some time, wants to ""party"". The two buy various drugs in the streets, at Lauren's place, they proceed to inject them together and have sex. When he learns Nic has gone missing again, David prepares to look for him, but Karen protests that he has done everything he can for Nic, and cannot do anything to fix him, which David heartbrokenly accepts. While the family are not home, Nic and Lauren break into David's home to retrieve some valuable items. The family come home, and the two quickly depart. At first, they go undetected, but David's other son Jasper (Christian Convery) notices Nic, and both David and Karen go to find them. Karen chases them in their car but stops and lets them drive off. Lauren overdoses, but is revived by Nic and, despite his objections, taken to the hospital by an ambulance. Nic tearfully calls David and asks to come home, but his father declines. Nic continues to plead, but David hangs up and breaks down in tears. Despairing, Nic overdoses, but he survives. David and Vicki visit him in the hospital, and David and Nic tearfully embrace. The epilogue reveals that Nic recovered and has been sober for eight years, and it would not have been possible without the love and support of his family and friends. Also starring Timothy Hutton as Dr. Brown, Oakley Bull as Daisy Sheff, Jack Dylan Grazer as Nic Sheff (12 years old), Zachary Rifkin as Nic Sheff (8 years old), Kue Lawrence as Nic Sheff (5 years old), and LisaGay Hamilton as Rose. Chalamet is splendid being both vulnerable and rebellious, and Tierney is good as the concerned stepmother, but it is indeed Carell's emotional yet restrained performance that stands out the most. It is a simple but effective story of how drug addiction can affect a family in many ways, concentrating on the father-son effectively, including flashbacks of the lead character as an innocent boy (the title is based on the John Lennon song, which the father sings to his son), and it avoids using too much sensationalism or melodrama, it is a moving and terrific drama. Good!",Beautiful Boy
6,CinemaSerf,"Way, way too earnest...",7,30 November 2019,"Telling the story of a father (Carell) trying to reconcile himself with the behaviour of his wayward son (Chalamet) who puts himself and his family through hell on an almost continuous basis. The relentless battle between one trying to ""save"" the other is portrayed well by both, but in a little too assiduous a fashion. I couldn't help but think that if they gave each other more space to actually be themselves, the problems might abate slightly? Maura Tierney adds some welcome distraction from the emotional intensity on occasion too, but in the end I was just a bit too drained to enjoy this. Perhaps that was the ultimate triumph for van Groeningen; that sheer exhaustion - regardless of the intent - can just lead to people giving up, even on those they love!",Beautiful Boy
7,ferguson-6,the nightmare of parenting,7,26 October 2018,"Greetings again from the darkness. There is absolutely nothing that compares to being a parent. Sorry, pet lovers, it's not even close. And I'm not referring to the romantic notion of having one's DNA live on as legacy. Rather, nothing compares to the weight of never-a-break responsibility felt in keeping a helpless newborn alive and properly nourished. And later, teaching the right life lessons so that it's not your kid who bullies others in school, or steals, or damages the property of others. Someone's kid is going to do those things, and most of us try our darndest to prevent it from being our kid. The reality is, that even the most attentive and best-intentioned parents can sometimes fall victim to a force beyond their control. Such is the situation in writer-director Felix Van Groeningen's film (co-written with Luke Davis) based on the two memoirs penned by father and son David and Nic Sheff.We open on David (Steve Carell) disclosing to a physician (Timothy Hutton) that his son Nic (Timothee Chalamet) is addicted to crystal meth, and asking two questions: 1. What is it doing to him? 2. What can I do to help him? The quiet desperation and pain is plainly evident on David's face. We know immediately that this Steve Carell movie won't be packed with laughs.What follows is the harsh reality of drug addiction. Rehab - Relapse - Repeat. Much of the story is dedicated to David's struggle and devotion to helping his son Nic in any way possible. He's a helpless father who refuses to give up on his son, despite the constant desperation and frustration. Every glimmer of hope is soon crushed by yet another lie and more drugs. The film is such a downer that it makes LEAVING LAS VEGAS look like an old Disney classic.Bouncing between timelines is a device that works for many stories, but here it seems to take away some of the poignancy and depth of some scenes. Just as we are being absorbed into a crucial moment, the film often breaks away to an earlier or later time. This is effective in getting the point across about the never-ending struggles, but we lose momentum on particular segments.Supporting work comes courtesy of 4 talented actresses: Amy Ryan (as Nic's mother and David's ex-wife), Maury Tierney (as David's current wife), Kaitlyn Dever (Nic's girlfriend), and LisaGay Hamilton (involved in rehab). It's a bit odd to see the mini-reunion of Ms. Ryan and Mr. Carell from their time on ""The Office"", but mostly the on screen time is pretty limited for all four women. The reason this film works is the devastating work of two fine actors - Steve Carell and Timothee Chalamet. We never doubt dad's commitment, just as we never doubt son's helplessness in getting clean.The soundtrack acts as a boost to the dialogue with such songs (perhaps a bit too convenient and obvious) as John Lennon's ""Beautiful Boy"", Neil Young's ""Heart of Gold"", and Perry Como's ""Sunrise, Sunset"". It's debatable whether it's possible for a movie to look ""too good"", but it's a bit off-putting to admire the camera work while someone is struggling on screen with drug addiction. The downward spiral of drug addiction feeds on the misery, and while we all enjoy beautiful cinematography, this is the rare time that it's distracting - possibly preventing viewers from going all in. The inherent lesson here is that we can't always save people from themselves. Knowing what to do isn't always possible, and sometimes there is simply no right answer ... even with ""Everything"".",Beautiful Boy
8,phd_travel,Too much jumping around in time,6,11 March 2019,There have been a couple of movies about parents and children handling drug addiction recently. Ben is Back with Julia Roberts and Lucas Hedges was easier to follow with a simpler more sequential story. Beautiful Boy is wider in scope with lots of flashbacks. I found the jumping back and forth confusing excessive and unnecessary. Tim Chalamet looks gaunt and scary as an addict. But the impact of his performance is lessened by jigsaw puzzle format. Steve isn't that convincing.Some good points are the research into the effects of the drugs.,Beautiful Boy
9,deloudelouvain,Chasing the high.,8,22 January 2019,"This is the kind of movies I would show my kids, if I had any, to show them the hard reality of what it is to be addicted to a drug. Well it depends on what kind of drugs of course, as I don't see cannabis as a drug. Nor do I believe there is such thing as a stepping stone, starting with cannabis to end with hard drugs. Kids will always try the forbidden things, so it is essential to show them the pros and cons from every drug. In a Beautiful Boy the 'bad' drug is crystal meth and that's a drug that can and will ruin everything in your life and in the lifes of people that care for you. Timothée Chalamet did an exceptional good job playing his character. At his young age he's already been in real top movies like Interstellar and now Beautiful Boy. In Call Me By Your Name, an Oscar winning movie, I wasn't too impressed but that's only because I hated that movie. Beautiful Boy is a story seen and told by the addict and seen and told by the parents. Personally I wouldn't have taken Steve Carell to play the father. Nothing wrong with his acting, but to me he's just better in comedies and he should stick at that. As a Belgian I'm a bit proud of Felix van Groeningen, for this excellent movie about addiction and how everyone deals differently with it. To make it even more realistic I would have put a bit more lying and stealing, as this is the norm with addicts. Drug addiction is something some people just can't cope with, the eternal chase for that perfect high, a high that will never be as good as the first time. It's a vicious circle and you have to be damned strong to beat this. Beautiful Boy, a must watch for users and for parents of addicts.",Beautiful Boy
10,blanbrn,"The battle and struggle for hope while dealing with pain, emotion, and addiction.",7,11 November 2018,"""Beautiful Boy"" is based on the real life memoirs of father and son David and Nic Sheff, and the movie is well done and in depth and detailed in flashback like form of their relationship. David(in a tough turn from Steve Carell) who's a remarried successful man who loves his first son very much that being Nic(Tim Chalamet). Thru it all the film shows the high and low points of family life as you the viewer embrace the scenes of Nic growing up and being loved. And still you see as when he sees his original mother the feel of distance from her. And harrowing and blunt are the scenes of his drug use from his passing out and nearly overdosing to the gross marks on his arm from heroin use. And this guy was so big into the it thing that he was a crystal meth user. You see the pain, drama, and emotion that it causes all as this film's message is a cause and need for hope with those that are battling the demons of addiction. Overall worth a look as it does give a message of caution and recovery.",Beautiful Boy
11,Pjtaylor-96-138044,Overstays its welcome.,6,19 January 2019,"Because of the nature of its story, 'Beautiful Boy (2018)' is repetitive. It tries its best to replicate the vicious recovery-relapse cycle that most addicts go through, and initially succeeds in doing so, but it ends up overstaying its welcome by quite a long while, marching past its presumed end to noble yet detrimental effect. On the whole, the film feels very long, especially after it exceeds this natural end-point. Plus, its actual ending is at odds with the near novel-length 'text ending'. I feel as though a few of the relapse periods, especially early on, should have perhaps been truncated - or, even, totally removed; this way, the piece would maintain its purposefully non-conventional, almost frustrating structure without (as much of) its repetitive pacing. The structure itself is a little strange because the picture plays around with time in some counter-intuitive and, frankly, unnecessary ways. Occasionally, these time-jumps are confusing, if not jarring, and they only serve to further distance us from the plot's events. Another issue with the picture is its soundtrack, which is often played distractingly loud and feels as though it's being used as the sole emotional manipulator. The soundscape usually goes for this annoying faux-'punk' feel meant to embody a disenfranchised youth, but this seems incredibly on-the-nose and the actual song choices are sometimes strange, as well as obvious (if you'll forgive the juxtaposition). The fact that the music is meant to elicit emotion more than the scenes themselves - or, at least, it overpowers the scenes themselves - is a bit of an issue, especially since the flick didn't affect me at all, despite its 'heart-wrenching' narrative. Indeed, aside from its function as a realistic, anti-drug biopic, it functions mainly as a tear-jerker, so it is a bit of a problem that not a single one of my tears were ever close to being jerked (and it's not like I have a heart of stone, either). You engage with the experience more with your head than your heart. It all feels rather distant, to be honest. The piece's major saving grace is its lead performances. Both Carell and Chalamet really are great. They believably portray the relatively compelling father-son dynamic at the heart of the story, differing greatly while also having many similarities (aspects of their relationship which aren't highlighted as much as I'd perhaps have liked). The other players are all good, too, and compound the flick's events as occurring in the 'real world'. The performances and this grounded vibe keep things more than watchable, even if the overall result is slightly underwhelming. This isn't a bad effort, just a somewhat hollow one. 6/10",Beautiful Boy
12,ThomasDrufke,The Road to Recovery,7,30 October 2018,"Movies about addiction are typically incredibly difficult to watch, my mind always drifts to movies like Rachel Getting Married or in an extreme sense, Requiem for a Dream. Just brutal movies to get through, and Beautiful Boy seemed poised to take the next slot in that group of films. While it's not exactly as powerful as either of those films, it features to stellar performances, and one that should get Timothee Chalamet his second consecutive nod for best actor, unless of course they put him in as supporting. But it's his turn as a young adult addicted to Meth, among many many other drugs. And as I just said about 'Mid90s', this film (likely because it's directly based on two memoirs) feels entirely authentic. Something that can't always be said about Oscar bait movies like this one. And while at times the film feels jumbled and uneven, those performances are what keep you invested. Make no mistake, they are Oscar worthy material.7.6/10",Beautiful Boy
13,Cineanalyst,Sad Soundtrack,3,30 January 2019,"Yet another movie about drug addiction, ""Beautiful Boy"" suffers from poor plotting, including numerous interludes where the musical score fills in for a lack of narrative development and a narrative structure that interweaves the present with past scenes--none of which tends to be especially illuminating or interesting, but, instead, seems aimed at covering up for the general lack of a story. What story there is is the usual drug-addiction spiral, complete with a bland public-service-announcement type message. Moreover, the young white male who's the addict this time comes from an affluent middle-class family. Basically, it's ""The Basketball Diaries"" (1995), to name one such similar picture, had that film's young up-and-coming actor played a character who started off with a better family and educational situation. And, perhaps, Timothée Chalamet is a bit more subdued than Leonardo DiCaprio was, with his tendency to overact back then, but, unfortunately, the most remarkable part of Chalamet's performance is that he is a ""beautiful boy"" even when he's depicting drug use, homelessness and general melancholy. It's not a compliment to say that shooting up crystal meth may never have looked as pretty as it does here.Also undermining any potential for an enlightening message is the lack of clear causes and solutions to the movie's drug and narrative problems besides the obviousness of crystal meth being very bad for you. Why does this boy with an exceptionally well-off background turn to drugs in the first place? There's little offered here besides the story hinting at the usual suspects of divorced parents and a new family started by his father, both the permissiveness of drugs by his father combined with his pressuring him academically, a scene of dad and son sharing a joint suggesting marijuana as a gateway drug and just an unspecified sadness brought on by, perhaps, all or some combination of all of that and, perhaps, just because he's a teenager-turned-young-adult or read too many sad books. And, as unfulfilling as all of that is, the conclusion is even less satisfying for anyone looking for more than a pretty face being put on a two-hour-long PSA.",Beautiful Boy

15,eddie_baggins,A touching tale of a father and son,8,16 June 2019,"Finding great dramatic success with his critically lauded 2012 feature The Broken Circle Breakdown, Belgium based director Felix van Groningen returns to the gritty genre once more with his similarly heavy hitting Beautiful Boy, based on true life stories and books by its real-life subject matters David and Nic Sheff.An uncompromising and often raw examination of the bond between father and son and an unflinching look at drug addiction, Beautiful Boy is not the stereotypical awards baiter it seems to be as Groeningen never allows his untypically structured feature to go for the easy emotional wins, instead employing the quiet power of his two lead performers to deliver considered and powerful performances, that in any other year would've attracted serious awards recognition.Desperate for an Oscar, Beautiful Boy once more sees Steve Carell forgo his comedic sensibilities to play it straight as grieving father and freelance writer David, a dedicated and loving family man who is struggling to come to terms with his once bright-spark son Nic's drug addiction, that is setting the young adult up for a life-time of pain and regret and potentially an untimely death.It's arguably Carell's best turn yet in an increasingly drama heavy career, with David offering the actor a brilliant chance to showcase his humanity and relatable persona to great affect and when teamed up with Timothée Chalamet as the up and down Nic, it allows Carell to ply his trade against a young actor that continues to impress in the early stages of his exciting career.Nic isn't a particularly loveable or likable character, his a privileged child that has unfortunately found himself in a hole that's hard to escape from but thanks to Chalamet's care and understanding in his role, Nic is still a sad and haunting figure, with his attempts to become clean and his various relapses giving the film a heart wrenching pulse that you can't turn away from. It's a brutally realized turn and equal to Chalamet's impressive performance in last year's Call Me By Your Name.With the two leads impressing in their respective roles, Groningen to instills his film with an energy and visual vibrancy (much like he did with The Broken Circle Breakdown) that too helps bring this material to life, with the only strong letdown feeling coming from the fact that at times there was more emotion and feeling to be mined from certain situations that come and go a little too quickly with Groningen's style of flashbacks and time changes, which at certain stages throughout the film take us out of particular moments that deserved more of the airtime.Final Say -Heartbreakingly played out by both Carell and Chalamet, Beautiful Boy is a unique and powerful examination of addiction and the bond between father and son and while not always an easy watch, Groningen's film is an impressively realized true life drama.4 Bubbles on a bike out of 5",Beautiful Boy
16,howard.schumann,Passionate and committed Oscar-worthy performances,8,9 November 2018,"Directed by Belgian director Felix Van Groeningen (""Belgica"") and adapted for the screen by Luke Davies (""Lion""), Beautiful Boy is the heartbreaking story of Bay Area journalist David Scheff (Steve Carell, ""Battle of the Sexes""), a devoted father who is relentless in his determination to save his son Nic (Timothée Chalamet, ""Lady Bird"") from his addiction to the potent narcotic Crystal Meth, but his powerlessness to effect change stirs up feelings in him of inadequacy and guilt. The film is based on David and Nic's real-life story as told in two memoirs, ""Beautiful Boy"" and ""Tweak"" that describe the bright and articulate eighteen-year-old high school senior's descent into a world of self-abnegation. Raised in an upscale home environment in Marin County, California, Nic did not lack for material or emotional support.His only explanation for his addiction is that it was the best feeling he'd ever known, so he did not want to stop. The film, however, does not explore his emotional state any deeper and the impact on him of his parent's divorce and remarriage remains unexplored territory. It is clear, however, that there was a void in his view of the world that he was unable to fill in socially acceptable ways. David, a writer for Rolling Stone Magazine, maintains the cool detachment of a reporter: Interviewing sources, gathering information and data on Crystal Meth, but no amount of scientific study can get through to Nic. In numerous flashbacks, we see Nic as a young boy and the close relationship he had with his father - sharing a joint together and surfing at a California beach where David loses Nic among the waves, only to spot him joyfully riding a big wave.Some flashbacks are displayed as overlapping images of the past and the present that reveal the impact of David's memories, but the timeline is often confusing. Though the main focus is on the father-son relationship, the film also makes clear the devastating effect that Nic's addiction has on the whole family. David's wife, Karen (Maura Tierney, ""Semi-Pro""), their two children, Jasper (Christian Convery, ""The Package"") and Daisy (Oakley Bull, ""Thanksgiving"" TV series), and ex-wife Vicki (Amy Ryan, ""Bridge of Spies"") do not have much screen time but make their presence powerfully felt; Karen in a harrowing scene where she follows a runaway Nic in her mini-van, and Vicki when she refuses to follow her husband's direction to let go of Nic and allow him to find his own way. How much the children know or understand about Nic's condition is not addressed.There is little plot and, while it can be frustrating to the viewer, the repetitive nature of abuse, recovery, and relapse that mark an addict's roller-coaster ride accurately reflects the cycle that most addicts experience. For Nic, many avenues to recovery are explored but nothing takes hold, neither going to rehab, attending college, or having a relationship with girlfriend Lauren (Kaitlyn Dever, ""Detroit""). One of the rare scenes in Beautiful Boy that breaks out of this cycle, however, is when David attends an AA meeting where he and Karen listen to the story of Rose, a distraught parent (LisaGay Hamilton, ""Take Shelter"") who speaks with heartbreaking honesty about how she has had to disown her self-destructive child. It is a testimonial that moves them to tears, David fully comprehending that every fix Nic administers could be his last.Both lead actors deliver passionate and committed Oscar-worthy performances. Steve Carell is sensitive and affecting in an understated way in his role as the beleaguered father, but he has a steely determination that belies his calm demeanor. As Nic, Timothée Chalamet delivers the same nuanced, emotionally mature performance that marked his Oscar-nominated role as Elio in ""Call Me by Your Name."" In a powerful scene in a café that the young actor handles with exceptional skill, David asks Nic, ""Who are you?"" and the boy lashes out at his father ""I was this amazing thing,"" he tells him, ""your special creation, and you don't like who I am now,"" suggesting not too subtly that his father's motivations may include feelings of embarrassment.Beautiful Boy succeeds in offering an honest and authentic depiction of how the scourge of drug addiction can affect, not only the life of the addict, but an entire family and community. Groeningen's choice, however, to mainly focus on the effect of Nic's addiction on those around him rather than on the physical and emotional depths to which he has fallen dilutes any deeper emotional connection we may have to his character. Ultimately, the film's willingness to play it safe and avoid taking risks in both style and substance limits our ability to feel the full extent of the pain.",Beautiful Boy
17,TheMovieDiorama,Beautiful Boy captures the raw intensity of drug addiction and a beautiful family bond.,7,20 January 2019,"""Once an addict, always an addict"". A phrase I used to hear quite regularly, and one that I used to adhere to. The feeling of obsession or addiction is one that is uncontrollable, with drugs being a major contributing factor to untimely deaths in this current society. David and Nic Sheff are two real individuals, father and son, who have battled through the turbulent force of addiction. Within this harrowing story, Nic's uncontrollable desire for crystal meth is damaging both his physicality and his mentality. His father is unable to help him, despite his best efforts. In the end, he simply watches his son slowly kill himself. The film references a structure called ""The 3 C's"" which is aimed towards the parents. They are not the cause of this addition, they cannot control it and they are unable to cure it. Parents automatically assist their offspring, it's the paternal instincts within all of us. So for David to eventually realise that he must not help his son makes for an emotional conclusion that, fortunately thanks to a well-written screenplay, does not resort to melodrama. Much like its fragmented narrative structure, the story often repeats itself. Nic consumes high volumes of meth, requires assistance, goes to rehab and eventually relapses. But it consistently felt engaging thanks to the topic that is being addressed. It's not 'Trainspotting' where it almost glorifies drug consumption to a certain extent, it's far more hard-hitting. The plot is told through the father's perspective which allows the characters to become more personable. As if looking through a window into a fragile family on the brink of witnessing the self-destruction of a member they love. It's touching, yet often depressing.A family-orientated story can only be as powerful as its cast. Chalamet was outstanding and continues to grow as an actor. He is able to show emotional vulnerability and instability through simple facial expressions, but it is the confrontations with his father that truly felt captivated. He was able to battle against Carell, an already established actor, and come out on top. Also the drug injection scenes, although hard to watch, were very well acted. Carell plays a stoic figure, a father who must stay strong for his family. I've read criticism towards Carell being miscast, but I disagree. Aside from a few scenes where he overacted to laughable results, he played a character I instantly connected with. The lack of emotion means that any scenes where he does break down, give off even more power. I would've liked more inclusion of Nic's mother and David's partner, but respect that it solely revolves around their own relationship. The soundtrack however, I had problems with. It was unnecessarily loud and drowned out many of the more emotionally charged scenes. The song choices were generic and feel like they came out of a feel-good drama such as 'The Kids Are All Right'. Fortunately though, this beautifully told story about an unattractive topic is one that contains a lot of heart. Subtle direction, powerful performances and an engaging script. ""Everything. Everything"".",Beautiful Boy
18,paul-allaer,Outstanding drama will move you to tears,8,3 November 2018,"""Beautiful Boy"" (2018 release; 120 min.) brings the story of father and son, David and Nic Sheff. As the movie opens, David is sitting in a doctor's office, asking for more information on crystal meth, Nic's drug of choice (among others). We then go back to ""One Year Earlier"", when Nic is 18 years old and fails to return home for several days after a drug binge. When Nic returns, David forces him to go to rehab, much to Nic's chagrin... At this point we are 10 min. into the movie but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this movie is directed (and co-written) by up-and-coming Belgian director Felix Van Groeningen. His 2012 film ""The Broken Down Circle"" was nominated for the Best Foreign Language Movie Oscar (and by all means, should have won). Here he makes his English language film debut. He and co-writer Luke Davies adapt the memoirs published simultaneously back in 2008 (has it been that long already?) by David (""Beautiful Boy"") and Nic (""Tweak"") for the big screen, but tellingly the movie is called ""Beautiful Boy"" and not ""Tweak"". I have read both memoirs, and sure, there are elements of the latter in the movie, but the movie feels mostly as being David's side of the story. What we witness is a hopeless dad's sheer desperation yet also boundless love for his addicted so. David's worry for Nic is all-consuming, possibly at a cost to David's wife Karen and their two small children. The movie is helped immensely by the devastating performances by both Steve Carrell (as David) and Timothee Chalamet. Beware: this is not an easy movie to watch. Even with the outcome known beforehand (Nic lives! and wrote a memoir!), I wanted to yell at the screen ""don't die, Nic!"" on several occasions. Bottom line: this is a fantastic film, an outstanding drama that will move you to tears (literally--I admit welling up on a number of occasions).""Beautiful Boy"" had a limited release some weeks ago, and went wide(r) this weekend. I couldn't wait to see it. The Friday early evening screening where I saw this at was attended only so-so (maybe 15 people), much to my surprise. No matter, this is one heck of a movie, and worth watching by itself for the gut-punching performances by Steve Carrell and Timothee Chalamet. I'd readily suggest you check it out, be it in the theater, on VOD, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray, and draw your own conclusion.",Beautiful Boy

20,CubsandCulture,Romanticizes drug addiction to tell a common story of family dynamics,5,12 January 2019,"The only thing in this film that seems to work is Carell's performance. He is engaging, emotive and the heartbreak of the dealing with an addict is written on his face to a painful degree. Unfortunately, a ton of the film is working against him. The biggest issues is the film attempts to solve the cyclical nature of addiction by breaking the narrative up. There is a ton of flashbacks, scenes shown out of temporal order and this leads to disjointed sense of narrative momentum. This doesn't make much sense as the story is told almost exclusively from Adam's perspective. It would have made a stronger choice if Nic was the protagonist. Nic's sense of time would be more disjointed one would think.On that note, Chalamet and the characterization of Nic, unfortunately, doesn't really work. I guess Chalamet gives a ""good"" performance but his gawkiness in charm and features makes it far, far, far to easy to sympathizes with him. Nic comes across as tragic hero-a white middle class youth of wasted promise. But that really isn't the face of drug addiction. A far braver film would ask us to sympathize with the poor, the people of color and the LGBT+ (and others) folks who use drugs due to minority stress (and other reasons). Too much of the grit and grime of drug addition is left out. We don't see Nic turn to sex work (as the real Nic did) to support his habit. We don't fully see the overdoses. We don't see the physical changes that occur. The film isn't interested in exploring addition per se.It is interested in exploring why someone of Nic's background would use drugs. The answer the film gives-family dynamics and his father's love smothered him-is pat and predictable. The film is lesser for it. This was a super disappointing film.",Beautiful Boy

24,peterp-450-298716,Believe me. The emotional impact was enormous.,10,10 January 2019,"Relapse is a part of recovery.8 Years ago I found myself in a similar hopeless situation. With my back against the wall. Desperately searching for a way out. Knowing that I had to change my way of life drastically. Or else I would be admiring the roots of green grass till eternity real soon. The will to change was there. The courage too. Only I couldn't do it. And now, after all those years, I'm happy I made the right decision back then. For me, ""Beautiful Baby"" was a bitter pill to swallow. I didn't think I would have a hard time watching it. It wasn't crystal meth or something similar I had problems with. But there were so many similarities with my situation in this impressive film that it seemed like the story was about me. You'll see an avalanche of feelings in ""Beautifull Boy"". Pride, trust, distrust, despair, upheaval, hope, happiness, grief and discouragement. A hopeless battle that demands inhuman efforts from both camps, leading to an unavoidable outcome. Either the person succeeds or those who surround him must passively watch as he drinks, injects, blows or swallows himself to death. Well, the movie shook me up.The nice thing about this movie was that it didn't only focus on the addict Nic Sheff (Timothée Chalamet), but also on the people surrounding him (his father David Sheff played by Steve Carell and stepmother Karen by Maura Tierney). As an addict, you don't have any clue what grief you are causing to relatives during your heydays. Everything revolves around getting what your body yearns for. It's not like in ""Christiane F. - Wir Kinder vom Bahnhof Zoo"" and ""Animals"" where you witness the gradual decline of the addict himself. Both physically and psychologically. It's not that Nic looks spic and span the whole movie. Towards the end, you can see the terrible consequences of the daily use of methamphetamine. That hazy look and a gray, unkempt appearance. But mainly his changing moods and aggressive behavior towards others are terrible to look at. His begging and making promises are nothing more than an excuse to get some extra cash to buy the drug he needs.The only thing I could say to my wife afterward was: ""I hope we'll never have to deal with this with one of our two kids. Because this is a real nightmare"". As a parent of two children growing up, the thought this could happen to us scares the hell out of me. No matter how much you try to protect them from the evil outside world and you overload them with love and attention, the moment they give in to the things that seem to make their life rosier, you know that you are going to have an unequal battle. A fight where, against all your parents' feelings, you might have to throw the towel in the ring at some point and have to confess to yourself that you've lost the battle. Losing a child is terrible. But breaking the bond with one of your children, pretending that they no longer exist and hoping that they get out of that period unscathed, is dozens of times worse I think.""Beautiful Boy"" is impressive. And not only because of the theme. The acting of Steve Carell and Timothée Chalamet is also unparalleled. You simply feel the desperation of Steve Carell who tries to help his son and always realizes that this isn't possible. A father who tackles the problem and like an investigative journalist tries to understand what the notorious drugs do to his son Nic. As a comedian, Steve Carell never convinced me. With this role, however, my respect for the actor has only increased. Timothée Chalamet's performance is certainly Oscar-worthy. You don't get the feeling that he's the acting rising star in the Hollywood firmament. It feels authentic, sincere and unforced. These two protagonists may already prepare their tuxedo for the Academy Awards.And director Felix van Groeningen (Yes, he's from Belgium) can also join these gentlemen on the red carpet. Thematically, the film lends itself perfectly to make an exaggerated Hollywood spectacle. But he manages to keep it serene and realistic. Artistic images are processed in an idiosyncratic montage with a lot of back and forth jumping in time. Flashbacks follow each other and the memories of both Nic and Davis flow into each other. I sometimes didn't know where the story was situated on the timeline. But that's the only flaw that I can think of in this otherwise impressive film. And all this with a tasteful soundtrack. I never expected to hear ""Territorial pissings"" from Nirvana in a movie.Some film viewers will probably just say it's a family drama about addiction. Maybe they also find it monotonous because of the endless cycle of reviving and relapsing. On me, however, it made an overwhelming impression that unleashed a lot of emotions. I hope that every person who falls into the trap of any drug also can fall back on a loving, supportive family full of understanding and support, so they can escape from it eventually somewhere in their lives.",Beautiful Boy
25,aidanratesmovies,"Terrible pacing, in what could have been a great awards like film",8,23 March 2019,"Steve Carell and Timothee Chalamet shine in an otherwise overdone film. The editing is a bit confusing toward the beginning of the film and the pacing slows to quite a crawl at times. Though what this film does right is show its true colors, and displays quite a brilliant picture of emotion and the struggles one holds with addiction and the effects it has. The Brilliance of the film comes when it sticks to what is hardest to do, and that's what makes the film so impressive. The look of the film is otherwise encrypting and the feel is done in quite a respective and yet accurate way.

26,valleyjohn,Great performances,8,21 February 2020,"Being a father of two teenage boys , the issue of drugs is a worry. Most people who experiment with illegal substances get it out of their system at a certain age without any lasting affect but Beautiful Boy shows what can happen if your body or mind ( or both) can't cope and it's a real eye opener.Based on the best-selling pair of memoirs from father and son David and Nic Sheff, Beautiful Boy chronicles the heartbreaking and inspiring experience of survival, relapse, and recovery in a family coping with addiction over many years.If there is ever any doubt that Steve Carell can do straight acting then they are washed away here. He and Timothée Chalamet are fantastic as father and son in turmoil .
The selfishness of the son is so frustrating and you can't help but despair at what he's doing to his family but it's the drugs doing the talking.
Although I've seen much more gritter films about addiction , this hits home hard because this family is so normal. Not unlike my family or families i know.Apparently this took 9 months to edit and had many re writes and normally when you see a film that has had those kind of problems , you can tell.
With Beautiful Boy you can't.",Beautiful Boy
27,truemythmedia,"Drugs are bad, M'kay?",6,15 July 2019,"Over the years, I've seen plenty of depictions of drug use in media. Some depictions focus primarily on the immediate or fun effects: the rush of whatever drug it was the user took; the party they attend; the neon lights and warped sounds (there are plenty of movies like this- take your pick: ""Spring Breakers"", ""Pineapple Express""). Other depictions show drugs use as a sort of journey- an awakening of the senses, a new experience for the mind that will leave it altered (""Enter the Void"", Netflix's ""Maniac""). But out of all of the drug depictions I see in film, the most common depiction is that of addiction and the depravity that comes with it; films that show a person grappling with their own demons and wrestling to survive (""Trainspotting"", ""Requiem for a Dream"", ""Heaven Knows What""). Films that depict addiction are often harrowing pieces of work that are about as fun to watch as a snuff film, but those films can teach us things. They can act as harbingers to those who might go down that road, or just inform us more about the dangers of that kind of lifestyle.The problem with this kind of film is that there are quite a few of them, and really, no matter what kind of addiction, no matter what the details of the story, no matter how well acted the movie is, the point of the film really just boils down to one thing: In the immortal words of Mr. Mackey of South Park Elementary: ""Drugs are bad, m'kay."" There needs to be something there that elevates the story above what it is about for it to really stick out.I almost gave this film 3.5/5 Stars because the acting is honestly that good. The problem is both the script and directing are just too static. The director wants us to feel every single emotion without putting in the work for us to do so. The acting is there; the story, underneath the layers of schmaltz, is there; I just don't know if Felix van Groeningen was the right one to tell this story.For our full review of Beautiful Boy and hundreds of other reviews, articles, and podcast episodes visit us at True Myth Media!",Beautiful Boy

30,jadepietro,A Harrowing Story of Drug Abuse Vividly Told,8,1 December 2018,"GRADE: BTHIS FILM IS RECOMMENDED.IN BRIEF: Timothée Chalamet's remarkable acting as a recurring drug addict gives this well made film even more authority.JIM'S REVIEW: Beautiful Boy shows one family struggling with addiction. Directed with skill by Felix van Groeningen, the film depicts the frustration and angst that touches each family member as this well-to-do family slowly becomes undone.Nic Sheff is a typical teenager who enjoys his ideal life. Talented and good-looking, his future looks bright. One slight problem is his dependence on drugs which are becoming his obsession. His experimenting with marijuana has led him to a vast array of other drugs, such as alcohol, LSD, cocaine, and crystal meth. Discovering his son's problem is his concerning father, David, who takes him to a rehab facility. Thus begins endless months of therapy, hope, and despair.The film doesn't shy away from the continual ups and downs of an addict's life. Rehab, sobriety, relapse, rehab again...the cycle continues in Nic's life, as his family tries to intervene with varied results. Although the film is flawed, the end result is deeply moving.To his credit, Mr. van Groeningen does not avoid harrowing scenes of addiction. They are graphically shown. The director focuses on the physical and emotional damage caused by drug abuse on one family. But in that area, he needs a bit more restraint in overstating the obvious. Happy childhood moments are shown as loving and idyllic while the later years are only full of misery and stress. The before and after contrast is effective and far too manipulative in its imagery. It also doesn't help matters with an intrusive music soundtrack filled with lyrics that tend to preach or telegraph the storytelling just in case you missed the message. The director should have trusted the power of the story itself and his terrific cast that he assembled.The screenplay, co-written by Luke Davies and the director, is based on the memoirs from David and Nic's true experiences. The film captures the frustration and heartbreak, although numerous use of flashbacks interrupt the action rather than enhance it. It also glosses over some facts such as how Nic financed his drug habit while on the streets for many months, only hinting at stealing and prostitution as ways to sustain his costly lifestyle.Essentially the film boils down to the father and son relationship. Powerful performances are given by Steve Carell and Timothée Chalamet as the father-son duo. Mr. Carell seems to have left behind his comic persona in favor of more dramatic opportunities and he is building an impressive film resume. He is excellent as Nic's obsessed father, David. Mr. Carell plays this common man as a helpless pawn forced to ignore his wife and other children in order to cope with his oldest son's destructive behavior. He shows the unconditional love of a parent with a genuine honesty. Maura Tierney and Amy Ryan play the mother and stepmother respectively, but their roles are pared down to supporting status. One wishes that their roles would have been greatly expanded which would have given the film a greater impact and established more balance to the family dynamics. In a small role, LisaGay Hamilton as a grieving mother of an addict, is very memorable.However, it is Mr. Chalamet as the sad confused teen that is a revelation. This talented actor carries the emotional tragedy of an addict's life and its devastating effect on his family members. His gut-wrenching scenes literally depict the highs and the lows of a boy hooked on drugs with such a fierce intensity. This haunting portrayal deserves many awards and it would be a major injustice if this great performance is overlooked by critics or the moviegoing public. It is quite remarkable to behold.Beautiful Boy unflinchingly depicts the ugly side of drug dependency. It is a disturbing film that takes a serious subject which affects many families and renders this global epidemic in the most realistic terms. Go see it.NOTE: During the end credits, Mr. Chalamet narrates a portion of Charles Bukowski's poem ""Let It Enfold You."" That is quite fitting for this film about drug abuse to use these words as a means to highlight this plight. Stay to hear it.",Beautiful Boy

32,martimusross,A Beautiful Boy But Not A Beautiful Script,4,11 June 2019,"Beautiful BoyThis movie tried to look at drug addiction from a different angle, namely that of an intelligent father, played by Steve Carell, and how he reacts to witnessing his son's descent into the abyss and degradation of becoming a junkie. Secondly it tried to balance the emotional context within a family, trying to carry on family life for the sake of younger children inspite of the threat presented to that family by a drug dependent member.After watching this movie I could only conclude it had failed in its intentions. Yes it told a story, so what, was that story worth telling.Why this movie was so appallingly mediocre;1, as Charlotte Bronte said ""knowledge hath no power to lessen pain"", the father's search for understanding, even resorting to experimentation, did give him knowledge. But he failed to act upon what he had learned, was this human frailty or indecision or indeed just not clever.2, we had two manifestations of addition presented, firstly it suggested that there are individuals with a proclivity to use drugs, yet this point was left hanging and I will address this point below. Secondly we were shown how addiction caused humanity to descend into both venal and feral behaviour and yet this was presented as a surprise to both the father and the audience, when indeed it is not.Quite frankly there was just nothing new here, this was just a hotch-potch of jumbled thoughts with little suggestion of any way forward or any reasoned analysis as to the root causes of addiction of which I find deeply frustrating. It presented the same key message we saw 20 years ago, ""drugs kill you and damage everyone around you""My analysis, this movie had the perfect opportunity to explore the reasons that often lay behind addition as its locus was the ""relationship"" between father and son, this should have allowed a chance to really look at the psychological background of the characters and their connections. Whilst the movie successfully demonstrated the need for a proper self-support system it failed to address the primary reasons for drug addiction and thus became shallow and even indulgent.Even a junior psychologist/man in street would be familiar with the work of psychologist Hans-Joachim Maaz, where he argues the damage done to children and their development when they face ""terror, absence or abuse"". As in this case, the father fails to provide true empathy and rather applies pressure on his son while the mother seems to be absent and thus unreliable as an ""attachment figure"" or parental counterpart during the early childhood of Nic. Within the movie we have ""father-terror"" and ""mother-absence"" that leads to an addictive and ultimately criminal behaviour. The only insight we have in the movie is where Nic in rehab states he fills the ""black hole"" within him with drugs and alcohol, indicating perhaps what the real issues are all long.This movie tries too hard to underline the emotional aspects for my taste after all ""beautiful boy"" misses the opportunity to look behind the obvious drama which could've been much more insightful and educational.I must comment on the acting, Timothee Chalamet and Steve Carell did I fine job but their talents were wasted on what was not a very beautiful script.",Beautiful Boy
33,jromanbaker,Unbearable,3,10 October 2019,"This film is unwatchable, and I do not mean because it is too hard to bear. I do mean unbearable. This is a rich boy who is as boring as a drunk who tries to collar you and tell you his hard luck stories, But this is not drink but drugs, and the dialogue is pitifully thin and relentlessly dull. Why this film is considered good is beyond me, as this is wealthy pain written and directed strictly by numbers. Not a shred of creativity in this film at all and that is very largely the director's lack of focus. I gave up caring after Chalomet left the expensive rehab facility ( credit card on display here, as big as an advertisement ).
I do not ask for Ken Loach, but can we please see more - let us say - poorer people in ' problem ' films ? Before I am attacked by various countries for being a socialist I would like to state that in our current climate this is a cliché question in itself. But we do have a lot of people in this young man's situation. They are to be seen on the streets and homeless, and they do not have a well off daddy to help them. So why am I giving it a three ? I hesitated on a 2 and I was kind of moved when Chalamet asks for money in a moment of extreme need. Perhaps only those old enough to remember Don Murray in ' A Hatful of Rain ' will probably agree there is a void at the heart of this film. For those who do not like needles in arms avoid.",Beautiful Boy
34,Jeremy_Urquhart,A somewhat flawed film that nonetheless has very good intentions,6,1 December 2019,"Is it strange or even disrespectful to say that movies about addiction are somewhat addicting? It's a tragic, fascinating fact of life that there exist substances in the world that literally no human being is able to resist; some of these are legal and perhaps not as irresistible, but if one gets properly hooked on something like tobacco or alcohol, it can still shatter a life almost as viciously as the other, harder stuff.Beautiful Boy most certainly deals with the harder stuff, as Timothee Chalamet's character goes from pot to meth to heroin, the last two proving particularly addictive and difficult to properly stop using. To show the process of addiction and recovery and relapse and how often this cycle repeats itself for a drug user, the film opts to have a rather repetitive, frustrating loop of the main character doing just this. Over and over again. Using, not using, tempted into using, using, swearing he won't use again, eventually using again anyway etc...It works as both a strength and also the film's biggest weakness, as the repetition while thematically effective does not make for as engaging a story. There have been many other movies about addiction that have structured themselves in a far more compelling fashion, whilst also driving home how difficult the cycle of drug use is to break. Perhaps the fact that there is this wealth of better movies with similar subject matter makes this one shine a little less bright.Also disappointing is the way the film skids to a halt and sort of just ends out of nowhere- I guess being a real life story, these two men are still living their lives and sorting things out, which makes true closure all but impossible to honestly achieve, but it doesn't make for a great film ending. Also, the closing titles just before the credits about how bad addiction is and how there isn't enough support out there for addicts are well-intentioned, but they come out of nowhere and as such feel preachy. They're the kind of thing that would seem a little ham-fisted at the end of a documentary about drug addiction, let alone a feature film.At least the two lead performances are quite good. Chalamet shines here and you really do feel for his character at least as much as you may be frustrated by him, and Carrell is good too, although when his character gets passionate and yells I couldn't help but feel like I was hearing Michael Scott yell about Toby or something. Poor guy, playing such an iconic character in a show as big as The Office- he may never fully escape that role for the rest of his life (Foxcatcher aside, although I guess the huge prosthetic nose helped him there).Flaws aside, this movie is sure to help the people who might need it, and that alone is enough to justify its existence. It's a relatively honest- albeit not always engaging in terms of plot progression and structure- look at addiction, growing up, and the bond between father and son. It's pretty decent, and there's enough here for a mild recommendation (oh, soundtrack's pretty great too, I should add), although as said before, it's far from the best movie about drug addiction out there.",Beautiful Boy
35,muamba_eats_toast,Terrific performances but overall product feels like it missed the mark.,6,28 January 2019,Firstly Carrell and Chalamet were both excellent performance wise but the finished product just felt like it missed the mark a little. At some times it felt like it wasn't hard hitting enough and rather fluffy in parts whilst also seemingly heavily waited towards the fathers viewpoint rather than the sons in comparison to the source material. The last 15-20minutes especially missed the mark for me. Overall though it was still a captivating watch thanks to the two leads but it would be better with a greater viewpoint from both sides than predominantly the one and a lot more powerful also.,Beautiful Boy
36,aciessi,Comfortably Numb.,8,23 September 2020,"Beautiful Boy is all about the tragedy of addiction. Also, it's about a dad who goes to the ends of the earth to take care of his son. For the most part, it's visual poetry. We see the passage of time between these two characters, as well as a comparison of what was and is now no longer. This film strikes you right in stomach with its power and you'd be an emotional stone to not feel what it wants you to. Timothee Chalamet is fantastic here. Steve Carell is tremendous. Normally, a showman's comedian, Carell plays a man who's very soul has been sucked out of him. Carell has shown how effective he can be as a dramatic actor and Beautiful Boy is yet another example. If I were to criticize anything, it would be the film's ending or lack thereof. It just sort of stops. Onscreen texts complete the rest of the story. That to me was very cheap. For so much of the time here I was invested by story because of how it was told visually. Beautiful Boy goes out with a whimper, instead of a bang. But I can forgive that. Beautiful Boy makes itself so easy to forgive, especially when you take into account how well this film hits its emotional targets.",Beautiful Boy
37,rockman182,Beautiful Boy (2018),7,14 October 2018,"Everyone is waiting and watching to see what young Timothee Chalamet does next. He was in two of the best pictures of last year (Call Me By Your Name and Lady Bird), which also happened to be my two favorite movies of 2017. Now he comes back in a film which is monumental because its a reunion of the one true pair on The Office, Michael Scott and Holly Flax. I liked this film more than I thought it was because I feel like its a truly accurate portrayal of drug addiction and the impact it has on loved ones. It's also a timely piece because the drug epidemic and mental illness are prevalent today.The film is based on the true story of a father and son who have a strained relationship because of the son's drug addiction. The son is addicted to crystal meth and has moments where he attempts to recover but relapses. The father tries his best to understand and seek out help but becomes frustrated by the process and the mental toll his son's well being takes on him. The film also flashes between different stages in the pairs life and covers a range of the dynamic in the relationship.The performances were good as expected. Its a little odd hearing Steve Carell yelling and getting angry, I guess I'm just too used to him in a comedic capacity so it feels weird to see him emote so seriously. I felt like the film was such a real and harrowing portrayal of a person suffering from a drug addiction disorder. I am a substance abuse counselor in my non film reviewing life, so I definitely can attest to the realness of addiction and how the lines of it being a disease and a choice. Its not easy to quit and its so easy and common to fall into relapse.I don't think the film shows off the emotional connection between the characters very successfully which is weird. However, I think overall the film is an impressive tale of the ups and downs (mostly downs) of substance abuse and the wide range of effect it has. On a side note, I would have been mad if the film didn't utilize John Lennon's Beautiful Boy and it is safe to say that crisis was averted. That's about as big a spoiler as I'll ever give in any of my reviews.7/10",Beautiful Boy
38,cultfilmfan,Beautiful Boy,9,2 December 2018,"Beautiful Boy, which is based on a true story of the relationship between a father and son, where the son is going through a serious drug addiction is a film that at times is frustrating, exasperating and even maddening, but in all honesty, I would not expect a realistically done film about drug addiction to be anything else. The film gives us no easy answers and I appreciated that because with a sickness, or addiction like this, there is no truly easy answers for it. People could argue till the cows come home about why this son who seemed to have a promising future and a loving family would turn to a life of narcotics, but again maybe it was no one single thing that triggered this and nobody, or nothing is to blame in this instance, or even outside of the film as well. It could be argued that people do it out of desperation because of something missing in their life, whether it be due to stress, trauma, loneliness, or many other issues, but at the same time there are also millions of people who have stressful, or intimidating lives at home and at work who are not addicts and would never consider doing so, so henceforth I think there is no concrete answer to how this kind of a situation starts and I think we would all love a simple explanation, so the type of tragedies with this type of addiction as we see displayed in the film could be prevented, but in a lot of ways it is truly out of our hands and even with the best parenting and teachers, unfortunately there will always be a few who will slip through the cracks and become an addict of one kind or another. The frustration I mentioned earlier comes about as we witness the downward spiral this character goes through and how reluctant at times he often is to both admit that he has a problem and also be willing to accept responsibility for it and further do things to help himself. In this case the character in question truly does have a loving and caring family and perhaps in a lot of ways he would have been worse off without that type of support and when the film becomes maddening, albeit in a good and effective way is when this character seems to be doing well and making progress in his recovery only to later suffer relapse after relapse and the problem becomes even more deadly and serious. At one point the character's father is told that battling a crystal meth addiction is very tough and often the success rate can be in the single digits percentage wise. The portrayal of the son played by Timothee Chalamet is a very on spot performance showing the literal ups and downs of this character both while he is on substances, when he is in withdrawal from them and even during the peaks and more successful stages of his sobriety. The performance must have been draining to play and here Chalamet portrays a character that at times we have genuine sympathy and compassion for and at other times we are so frustrated by his lack of success at other times and repeatedly falling into the same traps over and over again. It's a powerful performance as also is Steve Carell as the father who is very devoted and loving to his son and wants to do anything within his power to help him, but at other times he realizes the extent of the addiction and that if there is ever going to be a breakthrough he will have to show some tough love and make hard decisions as well as not giving in to every whim and need of his son. We see in this film how drug addiction can truly tear a family apart and hurt not just the addict, but others who love them as well. Overall this is a film about finding that strength both in yourself as well as having a supportive group of people who will help you to overcome and ultimately achieve your best. Sometimes a success like this can take years even decades and it truly is a tormenting battle for everyone to go through, but as the film suggests there is hope out there and also various means of support and places people can go to who are suffering similar things. This is a powerful film that is one of the most realistic about this type of issue to come along in a while, as well as showing a family bond and showing that perhaps love can conquer all. The eclectic musical score was appropriate and perfect for the type of emotions for each scene and Carell and Chalamet deliver wonderfully genuine and affecting performances in a film that can be a draining watch, but also well worth it.",Beautiful Boy
39,bankofmarquis,"Well acted and directed...and very, very dour",7,5 November 2018,"The advertisement for BEAUTIFUL BOY says that it is a ""heartbreaking and inspiring experience of survival, relapse and recovery of a family coping with addiction"".Heartbreaking, yes. Survival, relapse? Yes. Inspiring? Not so much.Telling the tale of the true story of David and Nic Sheff (based on their memoirs), BEAUTIFUL BOY stars Steve Carrell as David and the wonderful Timothee Chalamet as Nic. It chronicles their relationship and David's attempt to help his son who has descended into addiction to drugs up to (and including) crystal meth and heroin. This is a tough tale, told rather unflinchingly and with great love and affection. It is also grim and dower. The highs are not really all that high and the lows are really, really, really low.Which makes for a tough film to watch - it's a very good film - written, directed and acted well - but it's a tough film to sit through.Let's start with the performances of the two leads. We view most of this film through the eyes of the Father, played by Steve Carrell. We start the film ""in progress"", meaning that Carrell's character of David has already come to the realization that his child is in the grips of something that he might not be able to get out of. Because of that, Carrell's character starts sad and somber and goes down from there. It is a well acted performance, but he is not asked to do much more than be sad and somber, punctuated by moments of frustration and anger and is somewhat overshadowed by the showier role and performance by Chalamet as the drug-addicted son.I have now seen Chalamet in 4 films - INTERSTELLAR, LADYBIRD, CALL ME BY YOUR NAME and now BEAUTIFUL BOY, and in each one of these he was an actor that required your attention. He has a way of drawing you into his character's thoughts and feelings without saying or doing much. He is a ""quiet"" performer with a strength that is appealing and is no different in this film He was nominated for an Oscar for CALL ME BY YOUR NAME and I will not be surprised if his name is called again this year.Joining Carrell and Chalamet are Amy Ryan and Maura Tierney as Nic's Mother and Step-Mother. Both are equal to the task that is given them - to be supportive, worried and sad - all at the same time. It would have been interesting to flesh out these roles in this tale, but that would have made this film something different than what it is intended to be - a tale of a father's inability to help his son, no matter how hard he tries.Ultimately, the issue with this film is there is no variety to it. It stays, for the most part, on one emotional note throughout the course of it's 2 hour running time - somber and sad. That constant feeling of dourness makes this rather slow running film seem even slower, causing quite a bit of rustling and shifting in the chairs.It's an important film about an important subject - I just wish they would have varied the pitch of it from time to time. Well acted, well written - and dour.Letter Grade: B+7 1/2 (out of 10) stars and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)",Beautiful Boy

41,bob-the-movie-man,Trying to climb a slippery pole.,8,13 December 2018,"As John Lennon's lyrics go:""'Cause it's a long way to go,
A hard row to hoe
Yes, it's a long way to go""And so it proves for young Nic Sheff (Timothée Chalamet). For - based on a true story - Nic has progressively worked through the encyclopaedia of drugs until he has arrived at ""C for Crystal Meth"" where he is working through a recurring nightmare of addiction and attempted rehab.What's harder... being the victim of drugs or being the caring onlookers desperately hoping that this attempt to climb the slippery pole to recovery will be a successful one? This is reflected as a key aspect of the film, and as a parent it makes for a very hard watch. The 'caring onlookers' in this case are Nic's father David (Steve Carell), his girlfriend Karen Barbour (Maura Tierney), the couple's natural children Jasper (Christian Convery) and Daisy (Oakley Bull), and David's ex-wife and Nic's mother Vicki (Amy Ryan).This is only the 2nd English-language film from director Felix van Groeningen (after 2012's "" The Broken Circle Breakdown"") and the film has its fair share of impressive directorial flourishes such that Felix might need to get added to that elusive list of ""famous Belgians""! Not least among them is the use of flashbacks. The film starts with a 12 month flashback, but then throughout the story David flashes back to scenes of his boy's childhood. Many of these reflect the regret in perhaps failing to identify ways he could have done things differently to avoid the current crisis.While many of these flashbacks are sudden and unexpected, I didn't find them confusing to follow although I can see how they might annoy some viewers who prefer a more 'linear' storytelling approach.Above all, it is the acting performances that make this film, and the four key cast members all turn in memorable turns. It's excruciating watching Carell's parental anguish and then (like a blast of light) his realization of a truth he'd been avoiding for a long time. It's Chalamet though who truly shines, delivering fully on the realization of the tortured and self-torturing Nic. Already nominated for a Golden Globe, I would have thought another Oscar nomination is assured for this. ER's Maura Tierney also excels in a quieter supporting role: something that generally seems to be her niche at the movies.This is most definitely a gruelling movie from beginning to end - especially for parents of young teens - and as such it feels a lot longer than it's 2 hour running time suggests. But it is well worth the effort. A drama that really delivers on its message: ""just say no"". It rather frustrates me that the film is a UK 15 certificate. Not that I'm criticising the BBFC here, since with graphic drug taking, a lot of choice language and one (not overly graphic) sex scene, the rating is appropriate. However this would seem to me to be required viewing by every 13 year old, since if Chalomet's performance can't drill the message home to not climb onto that pole in the first place, then noone can.(For the full graphical review, please check out One Mann's Movies on the web and Facebook. Thanks).",Beautiful Boy
42,tm-sheehan,The Heartbreak of Addiction from both sides,9,27 November 2018,"Based on two memoirs by Father and son David and Nic Sheff Beautiful Boy is a powerful very disturbing movie beautifully acted and directed.Timothee Chalamet shows his incredible acting range playing the young addict Nic after his Oscar nominated role Ellio in the coming out movie Call Me by Your Name ,if he doesn't get another nomination for this far superior performance I'll be amazed.
Steve Carell as David his father is also splendid in this role as is Maura Tierney as Nic's Step Mother .Warning- if you have lost a relative or someone close to you due to Drug or Alcohol abuse you may find this movie disturbing but if you have a Drug or Alcohol abuse problem , go see this it may open your eyes to recovery.The director has managed to portray in equal proportion the desperation and despair of the addict and the anxiety and powerlessness that family that goes through ,especially after relapse after relapse till hope is eventually snuffed out.Latest stats in Australia of Drug and alcohol deaths, it's a heartbreaking waste of life..Harmful drug use continues to be a serious public health issue in Australia with 1,808 drug induced deaths registered in 2016. This is the highest number of drug deaths in twenty years, and is similar to the number recorded in the late 1990s, when a steep increase in opioid use, specifically heroin, led to deaths peaking at 1,740 in 1999. Although the number of drug induced deaths is the highest on record, the death rate per capita of 7.5 per 100,000 people is lower than that in 1999 (9.2 deaths per 100,000 people).",Beautiful Boy
43,Alexander_Blanchett,Good but almost great,8,12 January 2019,"I liked it. And it was one of my most anticipated films of the year. An interesting movie not only about drug abuse and the aftermath but also about a very beautiful father son relationship that is going to be challenged. The acting is generally very good. Steve Carell once again convinces in a dramatic role and it was a very soft and gentle performance. Kind of subtle in a way. A very sensitive job by the comedian. I am glad he chose the path of doing more serious work these days. Timothée Chalamet once again proves that he is one of the most interesting, talented and fascinating actors of his generation. And if he keeps on track he will do legendary stuff. This is just the beginning. And while his performance was not as brilliant as ""Call Me By Your Name"" he once again showed us a new facet of him and his talent and really brought Nic close to us. There are two scenes in the film where he is truly stunning. Maura Tierney and Amy Ryan both give her good support.
There are just two reasons for me why this film is not a masterpiece it maybe deserves to be. The direction by Felix van Groeningen was not very good. It was too much over the place. The screenplay also deserved better work as it was often a bit cliched. Oh and there were some weird soundtrack choices. Anyway, the actors could make up for most of it but sadly it did not become one of the best films this year, as I would have expecteded. Still a good film and worth to see.",Beautiful Boy

45,apryla-58795,Devastating & Depressing,8,18 January 2019,"""If you could take all the words in the language it still wouldn't describe how much I love you. I mean if you could gather all those words together it still wouldn't describe what I feel for you. What I feel for you is everything.""I was extremely fortunate that my only child made it through his teenage years relatively unscathed by drug use and is now in the U.S. Military doing quite well. I never did drugs. I don't even smoke or drink. I don't have any family or friends who have gone through addiction. The closest drug usage hit home for me was through a neighbor we only saw in passing. One day we realized we hadn't seen him in a long time. We started doing research and found an obituary for him online. Cause of death - overdose. He was young and left a wife and 3 kids. Even though I didn't know him really at all his death still got to me. It wasn't just a random thing happening ""out there somewhere"". It was happening on my street and we live in a well to do area and this guy was a family man and not some ne'er do well. It was upsetting so I cannot imagine the grief and hopelessness people go through when a family member is an addict. This movie really portrayed that well.I think Timothee Chalamet is a great actor whose talent we have only just begun to see. It will be interesting to see his career unfold because obviously he will have a long one if he wants it. Even still I don't think this was his best work. He did fine but I wasn't blown away like I have been by his other performances.I do like Steve Carrell but try as I might I just can't see him as a serious actor. He did a great job in this but even when he's serious I find myself laughing at him because he tends to sound the same whether he's joking or not.Although they are good actresses and their performances in this were strong Amy Ryan & Maura Tierney seemed wasted in this. The focus really was supposed to be on the father-son relationship though so they pry shouldn't have had really meaty roles.Maybe the performances weren't that strong BUT the message was very clear. Addiction ruins people's lives and the movie portrayed that very well. The woman speaking in the support group for the loved ones of addicts said it best when she said that her daughter just died but in a way she had been mourning her for years due to the ravages of addiction. The daughter's death was like a relief to the mom as she now knew the daughter wasn't suffering anymore.I used to be very judgemental regarding addicts but now I see that it's not so black and white. I can see how difficult it would be to have to finally reach a point where you tell your child you won't help them anymore even if they are crying and begging for help. I can see the conundrum. An addict can't help themselves after awhile so they do need help. As a parent you don't want to see them suffer so I get why the dad kept going out to look for him. I get why the whole thing consumed him and kept him from his other family. This movie really portrayed how addiction can tear families apart. It portrayed the struggle a parent goes through when it comes to being there for a child who is an addict. How do you act around them? Where do you draw the line? What finally pushes a parent over the edge? Do you stop helping them? Are you supposed to stop helping them? How do you deal with feeling like you did something to cause this problem? How can you live a normal life if your child is out there somewhere and you can't find them? How does one process all of that?I felt the last scene was so moving. As I was watching the dad help the son walk down the hall I was practically sobbing and I kept saying, ""There is no way I could do that or go through that.""Earlier I stated that I didn't feel this was Chalamet's best work. Overall his acting throughout seemed good but not great HOWEVER that very last scene right before the screen fades to black was Oscar worthy. He isn't even speaking-he's just sobbing uncontrollably as the heaviness of what he's done has hit him. You feel his absolute devastation, hopelessness and complete brokenness. It's heartbreaking.If you have children who avoided this awful problem you should stop and take a moment to realize how fortunate you are that your child did not subject you to the pain this father went through with his son.My heart really goes out to all of the parents going through this.",Beautiful Boy

From the start, it's clear that Beautiful Boy is all about Nic's struggle with crystal meth addiction and David's attempt to help him. The difficulty of shaking addiction, the effect it has on those around him, and the effect it has on Nic emotionally are thoroughly explored. It is relatively narrowly focused, only focusing on all the effects addiction has and studying Nic and David as characters. Perhaps it's a bit slow, and the first act is definitely the strongest, but on the whole its unwavering focus makes the emotional effects of the addiction that much stronger. The script and cinematography are patient and intentional, giving the characters space and allowing them to dictate the pace. The narrowness of just focusing on the effects of addiction, and less how it happens or what's going on inside his mind, coupled with the overwhelming bleakness (it's hard to feel uplifted by the ending saying he's been sober when the whole movie showed the deadly cycle of addiction, and the bright imagery only further emphasized the dark places Nic has gone to from such bright origins) make it a hard movie to purely enjoy. There's no doubt it's well made and exceptionally acted, and is potent in picturing drug addiction.",Beautiful Boy

52,baileycrawly,Extremely Well Done,7,26 December 2020,"This isn't an easy movie to watch, and it isn't because the acting is bad. On the contrary, this is one of the most well-acted dramatic films I've seen in a long time. The film tackles the horrors and helplessness of drug addiction head-on and isn't afraid to show how disheartening it is to see an addict that is suffering, that wants to get sober and do better for themselves, but are just so dependent upon the drugs that they just can't seem to completely break free.
Moreover, this film is based on a double-memoir, written from the real-life father/son duo David and Nic Sheff, so this film is unique from other films about drug addiction because it also shows the situation from the father's perspective, of raising a child that suddenly isn't the person they knew. To do their best to help but to ultimately still end up coming up short. It shows the guilt, shame and depression from the other side, as well as the necessary tough love that sometimes needs to be implemented in order to truly help someone get better.
This is a beautifully made film, respectfully showcasing drug addiction without being preachy or trying to smash the audience in the face with an anti-drug message. This is just the story of a real-life drug addict who went to hell and back before finally getting his sobriety in the end (no spoilers on real life).

It tells the true story, based on a memoir from each of them, of a father trying to save his son from drugs that are tearing his life apart. I was super excited to see this but it never came around to theaters near us. It is currently on Amazon Prime. The movie got mixed reviews but that didn't stop me. I loved this movie! It had so much to say and with the great performances, Timothée Chalamet getting nominated for a Golden Globe and most definitely for the Oscars, it made it an emotional roller coaster that I didn't want to end. As I said before, the performances were absolutely amazing. Steve Carell does very well in his serious role and I hope he continues to be apart of movies more like these. In my personal opinion, I think this is. Chalamet's best performance beating his portrayal of Elio in Call Me By Your Name. Maura Tierney was also very good as Karen Barbour, Nic's stepmother. The story had so much too it. There were times when I thought it was all going to end but something would happen to make it go even deeper. There were uses of flashback scenes that I thought added to the story. At some part the editing was a little weird so I couldn't tell if it was still a flashback or back to the present time. Felix van Groeningen did very well at directing this piece. He and Luke Davies adapted both books and made the screenplay wonderful. There wasn't anything really special with the technical aspects. It's more of a film where the story and performances stand out. I don't understand why this has such mixed reviews because it's a story that's both heartbreaking and sweet that needs to be recognized. It kind of just fell out of the Oscar race. The only thing it really is being talked about is for Timothée Chalamet. I wish Steve Carell was taking into consideration for his performance. The ending shot with both of them just made me love it even more. The chemistry between them was perfect. I would definitely recommend this film.

At times however it feels more like the story of his father David's quest to help him. Steve Carell gives an, at times, too intense performance as the father who has always tried to be the perfect parent in raising his son, but who realises that he is ulimately powerless to stop Nic hurtling towards a cliff. On multiple occasions. That is what the story is about. Having to admit powerlessness, for your own sanity. Maura Tierney is once again wasted as a largely mute stepmother to Nic - when will she get her own movie and not just be the nodding spouse to the male lead? Screenwriter Luke Davies was once a heroin addict. He is in familiar territory here and so he doesn't judge Nic. When Nic is being manipulative and unfeeling and self mutilating, it's the addiction taking over.
There are lots of metaphors (the 'in too deep' surfing scene was a little too obvious) but overall everyone seems to have their heart in the right place, and I felt the film worked in the end.

57,jamiedarlow-37510,An achingly melancholic and haunting drama,8,5 March 2020,"Focusing on Nic Sheff (Timothee Chalamet) and his father David (Steve Carell) throughout Nic's horrific drug addiction. Based on the memoirs by the real-life father and son, it's an incredible detailing of their experience and extremely well adapted for the screen by writer Luke Davies (who previously fantastically explored this type of material with the equally heart wrenching film Candy) and director Felix van Groeningen. What I admired most about this film was it's honest depiction of the situation; the relapse and recovery we have seen many times on screen before. But the reoccurring relapses are rarely explored which are certainly done here. It focuses on a young man who has had a normal and decent childhood but descends into addiction through the anxious and isolating feeling of growing older; a feeling that passes but is tragically elongated through the drugs that made him feel ecstatic at the beginning. This aspect is what has caused a lot of complaints from some viewers due to him having a 'privileged' childhood, but I think this just made it an interesting view of mental illness as well. Although nothing particularly horrible has happened to him, he gives in to his psychological strain. I spent the majority of the time internally screaming 'NO, DONT DO IT!' to Nic and similarly feeling heartbroken for both him and David. I think what stayed with me most was his fathers undying love and desire to help even if it's a painful decision to make. From a cold and paranoid millionaire (Foxcatcher) to a man on the brink of an affair with his brother's girlfriend (Dan In Real Life) Steve Carell has an incredible knack for making some potentially unsympathetic characters very engaging and sympathetic. He's just a beautiful screen presence and he's on a winning streak recently with Marwen and now this; definately another of his best performances! In this case, the character is naturally relatable and you can empathise from the start but Carell makes the role shine and it's going to stay with me for a long time",Beautiful Boy
58,deexsocalygal,Why such high reviews? It wasn't that good.,2,16 September 2021,"There wasn't anything in this movie that was worth watching. There's no way this is worth a 7 rating. And this isn't a movie about a drug addict it's an instruction manual on how to be a codependent & keep your druggie using. It shows a spectacular father who is a WAY better parent than I ever had. He verbally expresses his love for his son & goes surfing & hiking with him. Pays for him to go to college, just a fantastic father. Better than my parents. It shows him going through all the emotions a codependent goes through when their son is using. The son keeps lying & verbally abusing his father. I didn't like the music in this because it's like they tried too hard to match the different songs to each scene depending on the emotion & it just got to be too much. Not only that but the music was TOO LOUD!!! I would of rather the actors had some lines than watching so many scenes where no one talks & you just see someone driving around or spacing out looking out the window with a song at mega 100 decimal levels too loud. In my opinion this is a dull film nit worth watching.",Beautiful Boy
59,WalkdenEntertainment,This heartbreaking journey is worth your time...,6,14 November 2018,"The film follows a father named David (Steve Carell) and his son, Nic (Timothee Chalamet). These two go on a heartbreaking journey which will challenge them as Nic becomes heavily addicted to drugs (including crystal meth).For those who are not aware, Beautiful Boy is fact based on the best-selling memories of a father and his son.The best moments in this film involve the relationship between the father and son. David is a father who is willing to never give up on his son no matter the cost.Beautiful Boy gives the audience a glimpse into both the past and the present as the film goes back and forth. We see many scenes of the father and son sharing innocent moments when his son was just a small boy and then in the same location a scene becomes a challenging moment in the present. The timing of these scenes is not always obvious and I found these cuts going back and forth in time rather distracting as I was often trying to work out if I was about to watch something from the past or the present.Steve Carrell does manage to deliver many memorable moments on screen, but if I'm honest, his true potential as an actor is also missed in many key opportunities. I was rather impressed with Timothee Chalamet's performance. He delivers so much emotion on screen, portraying a young man in pain and suffering emotionally. Even his bony appearance makes himr look damaged physically and mentally broken due to the effects of drugs he has used over time.The reality is movie lovers will respond to this film differently regarding the emotions and drama presented on screen. I personally can't relate to the themes of drugs but I understand the struggle of anyone being addicted to something and trying to defeat it. On the flip side, I personally have a baby boy on the way (my 1st child). And watching a father care so passionately for his son, wanting him to be safe and beat his addiction really got to me.Overall, Beautiful Boy is a dramatic tale which will test the relationship of both father and son. The performances are solid, in particular Timothee Chalamet's and Steve Carell. The film's creative way of telling the story by going back and forth can be distracting. There are themes here we can all relate, even if you're not a fan of films that discuss drugs. Some addictions in life can kill or ruin you.6.5/10

60,michael-kerrigan-526-124974,Wonderful acting,7,14 February 2019,"Timothy Chamolet (drug addict son) and Steve Carrel (loving father) are both great in this true story of the merry-go-round of addiction, rehab and remission. The film has received some criticism for its apparent over-sympathetic portrayal of 'poor little rich kid'. I'm we socialist as the next person, but addiction affects people from all walks of life. Indeed it was fresh to see a film about drug addiction which wasn't 'explained' by upbringing, childhood trauma et al. I've never been a user myself so I can't comment on the realism (or not), but you couldn't help but feel sympathy for both father and son. 7 out of ten",Beautiful Boy
61,austin0731,A masterpiece in performance and story telling,9,13 November 2018,"Beautiful Boy was a heartbreaking exploration of drug abuse and family dynamics, the film focuses on teenager, Nic Sheff played by Timothee Chalamet and how his father, David Sheff played by Steve Carell tries to save him from his own descension into drug abuse. It was a very different kind of coming of age story, that is intense but subtle. Another brilliant example of Steve Carell's transformation into a serious actor.Perpetuity
Perpetuity is a theme that the film absolutely nails, the film portrays this vicious cycle of drug abuse, rehabilitate and relapse in a brilliant way. The whole film felt like a constant cycle with each relapse being worse and worse, both in Nic's actions in terms of the severity of the drug use and in terms of the emotional toll it takes on both Nic and David Sheff. The song choice and music also helps to emphasize this perpetuity, each time Nic returns to the house the music choice was uplifting versus the intense and angsty choice of music for when he relapses. One song in particular really got to me, 'Heart of gold' by Neil Young, it was almost perfect for the story of Nic, trying to do good, and trying to not be this 'disappointment' to his father but just failing to do so.Growing up and letting go
Personally, I saw Beautiful Boy as a coming of age story, that focuses not just on the child transforming into adulthood but also in the parent learning to let go. It was a beautiful mirroring and metaphorical exploration of this dynamic. The film would cut from scenes of Nic's drug use to Nic as a child engaged in laughter and play. The film's title: Beautiful boy almost felt like something that was pressuring Nic, the idea that he didn't live up to his father's image of him was what led him to his descension. There was a scene in particular where Nic asks his father 'are you proud of me now', you can see the angst of David, just wanting to tell his son that regardless of who he is he is loved. The film Explores how Steve Cowell's David Sheff has to let go and stop being the controlling parent that he is. In one of Nic's final relapses, David finally said he's had enough and that he can't help Nic, this was a moment of heartbreak but also a moment of realization, to me I see this as him breaking the perpetuity and the cycle, it was his character's transformative moment. I think the film round this up beautifully when in the final shot we see Nic after a near fatal overdose is weak and frail, presumably at a rehabilitation center, with David by his side holding him. It was a beautiful shot to end the story at. Concluding this idea that David, as the father is no longer trying to 'control' Nic but it doesn't mean he has given up on him either, he's simply supporting Nic regardless of his decisions, it was this sense of unconditional trust, because no matter what, he would always be his Beautiful boy.The 3 leads
As mentioned, Steve Carell further solidifies himself as a serious actor, he gives a performance that is so subtle but with bursts of uncontrollable emotions in a very very impressive outing. While Timothee Chalamet furthers his highly impressive resume with the likes of 'Call me by your name'. The third lead, Maura Tierney who plays the step mother was equally as impressive, you see how her character was a stern figure, a rock that kept David from drifting too far into trying to bring Nic back the whole time, her performance was subdued and intricate. It was all the most impressive when you finally see her let loose and seeing the tears roll down her face for what seems like the first time, in one of the saddest and most emotionally intense car chase scenes I have seen.Beautiful boy was a really good film, that explores serious topics that happens to a lot of people, ourselves, people around us could all have suffered similar situations. The film explores this and discusses the importance of family and support in a subtle and beautiful piece of work.",Beautiful Boy

Personally I'm not a drug user. Clubbers advertise drug use, but they tend to forget to mention the disadvantages. I'm pretty sure the highs are fantastic, but so are the kickbacks.

in the other hand vicki was a little bit late to show her sense. idk maybe because karen character was already make us felt her present from the start.but the flow for how this movie was told are not really clean,at first i really enjoyed the phase but after a while it kinda make me lost the actual timeline in the middle of the movie. make me have to build the flow again from the start.",Beautiful Boy
64,Bertaut,"Earnest and heartfelt, but narratively awkward, and emotionally unengaging",6,29 January 2019,"Based on the memoirs Beautiful Boy: A Father's Journey Through His Son's Addiction by David Sheff and Tweak: Growing Up on Methamphetamines by Nic Sheff, written for the screen by Luke Davies and Felix van Groeningen, and directed by van Groeningen in his English language debut, Beautiful Boy is a film about the horrors of addiction, told from the perspective of both an addict and his father. Focusing primarily on David's attempts to understand and fight against his son's addiction to crystal meth, the film aims for a no frills sans-sentimental authenticity (Davies is himself a former heroin addict, who based Candy: A Novel of Love and Addiction on his experiences). Serving as something of a showcase for the two lead actors, (Steve Carell and Timothée Chalamet, both of whom are exceptional), there's little in the way of plot, with the film instead adopting a non-linear cyclical structure designed to mirror the repetitive nature of addiction-rehab-relapse-addiction-rehab etc. And whilst it is certainly heartfelt and respectfully told, there's little in the way of emotional engagement.Living in Marin County, Nic Sheff (Chalamet) is an intelligent, popular, and kind teenager, who has a close relationship with his father, David (Carell), his stepmother Karen (Maura Tierney), and his two younger half-siblings, Jasper (Christian Convery) and Daisy (Oakley Bull). He is less close to his birthmother Vicki (Amy Ryan), who moved to LA after she and David divorced. David is a journalist for the New York Times, and Karen is a painter, with the family enjoying a comfortable bohemian middle-class existence. The film begins as David attends the offices of a drug counsellor and psychologist, Dr. Brown (Timothy Hutton). Explaining that Nic has become addicted to crystal meth, he wants to learn everything he can about the drug in order to best help his son.The most notable aspect of Beautiful Boy is the structure, which is both cyclical and non-linear - the film is made up of a series of high and lows following Nic and David through relapse and recovery, whilst at the same time, there are multiple flashbacks, with scenes in the present giving characters occasion to think about moments from the past. For example, as David sits in a diner waiting for Nic to arrive, he thinks back to a much happier meal he had with his son in that same diner many years previously. This technique is used throughout the film, often flashing back to happier memories of Nic's childhood. The problem with this is that it's overused; there's barely a scene that doesn't have some kind of temporal cutaway. This overuse also dulls the impact of such editing, as after 45 minutes, you're just yearning for the film to stay put for a while.As regards the repetitive nature of the story, I understand what van Groeningen was going for - it is supposed to mirror the back and forth nature of addiction (""relapse is part of rehab"" as David is told), a two steps forward, one step back staccato motion. However, the film falls into a pattern of Nic showing up looking a little more dishevelled than he did before, followed by David doing everything he can to help, followed by his failure to get through to Nic, followed by Nic disappearing, followed by Nic showing up looking a little more dishevelled than he did before, etc. And whilst this may lend itself to a certain authenticity, it doesn't make for very effective drama. In any case, other filmmakers have found ways to depict the repetitive nature of addiction without compromising the story, not the least of whom would be Darren Aronofsky in Requiem for a Dream (2000), who constantly uses a quick montage of the characters doing drugs to suggest the habitual nature of addiction.Perhaps the most fascinating aspect of the movie is that Nic is a prosperous and intelligent middle-class young man with a strong support system. He is a child of divorce, yes, but he has a good relationship with both of his parents. This is a far cry from the typical addict we see in film and TV, who are usually at the extreme ends of the monetary spectrum, either poverty-stricken and destitute (such as, say, Bubbles (Andre Royo) in The Wire (2002)) or extremely wealthy and high-functioning (such as Caspar (Geoffrey Rush) in Candy (2006)). Nic first tried drugs to see what they were like, and when he liked how they made him feel, he kept on doing them. There was no precipitating event, no great emotional trauma which made him turn to narcotics; his addiction is just something that happened, a disease to which anyone could succumbA major theme is that of the father-son relationship, and this is well-presented. With both actors giving superb performances, one really sees the bond between the two, and how much Nic's addiction is destroying both of them. In this sense, the real tragedy of his situation isn't the rehabs and relapses, it's seeing him drift further and further away from a man who would literally die to protect him. Given the source material, one does wonder a little if the relationship is idealised somewhat, but irrespective of that, Carell and Chalamet give a masterclass in acting.With lesser performances, the film would have crumbled under the weight of van Groeningen's heavy-handed direction. Thankfully the performances are strong enough that the style distracts rather than undermines. That said, the benefit of the non-linear storytelling is that it allows Chalamet and Carell to really drive home how much their relationship changes, with their playful and happy earlier scenes contrasting heart-breakingly with the fraught and destructive times of later years. Chalamet's is the more physical of the two performances, conveying so much via his body language as he completely inhabits the character, alternating between playing Nic as a sweet, loving, almost immature teenager, and a stressed addict, old before his years, and capable of anything to get money for his next hit. When he is rehabbing, there's a regret and humility in his performance that is nowhere to be seen when he relapses, as he becomes more manic and unpredictable, and much less self-aware.Carell, for his part, does most of his best work with his eyes, conveying the sadness and desperation he feels. His helplessness is written across his face, conveying how little he can actually do for his son. He initially approaches the problem in a logical manner (he does methodical research on crystal meth to better understand it, he snorts cocaine to try to put himself in Nic's shoes), before eventually realising there is no logic at play here, and tackling the subject as he would an article for the New York Times is not going to work. Carell plays David as confused, haunted, and desperate, with Nic's addiction having as profound a psychological effect on David as it has a physical effect on Nic.Despite all of these positives, however, as indicated above, there are some significant problems. For one, van Groeningen chooses not to present some of the darker aspects of Nic's story. For example, he turned to prostitution at one point to fund his addiction. Additionally, as his hits from crystal meth continued to diminish over time, he started shooting it up, which is insanely dangerous. Leaving out aspects such as this gives the film a kind of sanitised feeling, as if we're looking at addiction through a gauze which the director refuses to pull back to let us see it directly. This kind of heart-breaking sordid detail would have helped the film immeasurably, especially in relation to its lack of emotional engagement.This lack is probably the most egregious problem. A film of this nature, detailing something like this, and based on a true story, should be an emotional rollercoaster, but the audience is always removed, the emotions are seen rather than experienced, as if we're looking at the rollercoaster instead of riding it. Because the film introduces us to the characters mid-crisis, and because there's literally not a single scene that isn't either related to Nic's addiction, or a flashback from a scene related to his addiction, we never really get to know David or Nic outside this situation. Any sense we have of them as people comes almost entirely from the acting, and even then, although you certainly feel empathy and sympathy for them, you don't feel a huge amount else.This dearth of characterisation is even more pronounced in relation to the two women, who may as well not be there. Karen has nothing to do but wander around in the background painting trees, whilst Vicki doesn't even get that much - she's a disembodied voice on the phone most of the time, and although I know she appeared in a couple of scenes, by the next day, I'd forgotten what she did in either of them. It's a real waste of two extremely talented performers.There have been some truly great films about addiction; The Man with the Golden Gun (1974), Days of Wine and Roses (1962), The Panic in Needle Park (1971), Drugstore Cowboy (1989), Trainspotting (1996), Leaving Las Vegas (1995), The Basketball Diaries (1995), Requiem for a Dream. Beautiful Boy is absolutely nowhere near anything of this calibre. In fact, it's probably more successful as a kind of instructional installation for relatives of people going through addiction than it is as a film evoking emotions. Told from the perspective of people living through this nightmare, the story is incredibly straightforward and forgettable, when it should be shocking, disturbing, and emotionally devastating. And whilst the film is definitely heartfelt, its lack of emotional engagement, its repetitiveness, its distracting structure, its lack of a plot, all serve to grate against the incredible performances.",Beautiful Boy
65,MarcoParzivalRocha,Fighting the worst enemy,7,21 February 2021,"Based on two books, one by the father and the other by the son, Beautiful Boy is a portrait of the drama of a family that faced the problems related with addiction for several years.Chalamet and Carell are the strong points of this film, they play their roles on point, with superb chemistry.There are times when understanding the lyrics of the song that plays at a certain point of a scene is crucial for us to acknowledge what's going on, example of 'Territorial Pissing' by Nirvana or 'Sunrise, Sunset' by Perry Como, among others, throughout the film.I found Chalamet's characterization especially important, since the narrative essentially follows the father's vision (Steve Carell), and for him, his son remains that beautiful boy who he was as a child, until we reach a moment in the story, where everything changes.Andre Royo as Nic's sponsor is a great treat for the fans of one of the best tv shows ever (The Wire).The bad thing, for me, is that the film reaches the peak way too soon, in terms of tension and involvement, and from there it goes down, and we no longer care about the outcome of certain issues and subplots.",Beautiful Boy
66,Lewis_Heather787,A tough film to watch however people must!,7,5 January 2019,"To be honest this is gonna be a short review because this film is emotionally tiring and draining, for the appropriate reasons. Thats not the same that the film is bad actually I thinks its good and it is very educational about the subject of drug addiction. Its just that this film is not a bundle of laughs lets just put it that way, which I probably should have seen coming however I didn't.The story is heartbreaking really, about a young man who has his whole life ahead of him gets addicted to drugs and mainly Crystal Meth. The film focuses on mainly the relationship between the son and his father and the toll on that relationship his addiction has. Overall Timothee Chalamet and Steve Carell are absolutely fantastic in the respective roles as Nic and David. So much so that after a while I though was watching a documentary about the real persons' life, the actors did such a great job in making the characters real and the relationship between the believable.The film never addresses why Nic is addicted to drugs due to one very good reason.......It doesn't matter why. Knowing why someone is addicted is personally probably one of the most rational things to want to know. However this film does such a great job in telling you that it doesn't matter why, what matters is how someone can handle and beat the addiction. I thought that this spin on human thinking towards drug addiction was extremely education and actually makes a lot of sense when you come to think of it.Overall this film is good 70% out of 100 or 7 out of 10 it is a good film however its one of the most dark, bleak and depressing films I've seen, you have got to be in the right mind set to watch this and people should. This film shows the true grim reality of drug addiction and how that has an affect on a persons' life and how it affects the lives around them!PS: Hopefully this can go someway to help destroy the stereotype and ignorance surrounding drug addiction.",Beautiful Boy
67,mr_bickle_the_pickle,"Cause it's a long way to go, a hard row to hoe...",8,8 September 2018,"This film is based off the memoir by David Sheff (played by Steve Carell) and Nic Sheff (played by Timothee Chalamet). It follows a father who is desperately trying to help to son and slowly coming to terms that maybe he can't. Let me tell you, this is some powerful stuff that is executed flawlessly by the actors. All were great but in particular Timothee and Steve are standouts. My bet is that the diner scene (""This is who I am"") will be the clip chosen during awards season. But theres also some more subtle nuanced scenes too. In particular there is this scene right after Nic has relapsed by popping some pills and you can just tell he is thinking ""Why did I just do that?"". And your heart also breaks for David when you see him driving around looking for his son.The director does choose with this film to present in a non-linear way. Often times it does show flashbacks. That might not be everyone's cup of tea but I think it works. I think it helps to delve into David's mind and understand where he's coming from. He probably is thinking ""Where did I go wrong?"" I also felt the director did a good job of establishing shots to remind you of a happier time without using flashbacks. For instance there is a scene where Nic is playing with his younger siblings in the sprinkler and then later (after another heartbreaking scene of Nic fleeing) there is a shot of the empty backyard with the sprinkler coming on.The screenwriter was saying that he originally didnt want to do this film as he previously did a drug film (Candy -starring Heath Ledger) which was also based on his real life addiction with heroin. But ultimately decided to do this one as he never really had shown the other side of drug addiction. I thought he did a good job with it. It never glamourized doing drugs, but I also liked and appreciated that Nic was humanized in this. Yes, he is causing his family pain, but he isnt treated as the villain. You feel for him too.Overall, I quite liked this film. And I also thought the soundtrack was on point. I think you will see this film pop up during awards season. Maybe Best Picture and Best Adapted Screenplay, but I think definitely for Timothee and Steve. It would be criminal if they werent there. Another thing I want to note is that about halfway through the credits there is a voiceover done by Timothee where he is reading out a poem that is briefly mentioned earlier. So that might be something you want to stick around for.",Beautiful Boy
68,scb_coldsteel,A beautifully well-acted depiction of the hardships drug use can have on a family.,8,6 December 2018,"So I saw Beautiful Boy at the theater. I was really looking forward to this movie entirely based upon the cast. When Steve Carell wants to he can be a versatile actor and Timothee Chalamet has really been impressing me as of late. Overall it's an emotional very well acted movie with a few flaws that brings it down a few points.The plot of the movie really tells two stories. First is the story of how a young upper middle class boy with a bright future can become addicted to a drug like meth and just how difficult addiction can be. The second story shows what addiction can do to the families of addicts. The movie tells a very human story about the struggles and hardships that addiction can cause in the lives of so many. Not only that it was a very bare-bones realistic look at the struggles of dealing with an addict. Ultimately the film acted as a character study to illustrate the relationship between a father and son and to show just how much harm addiction can cause in the lives of our loved ones.The film really illustrates a stark and painful picture of the realities of drug addiction for everyone. The film chose to depict the impact drug use can have over the course of the film by tracing the downward spiral and multiple relapses an addict goes through in their lives. While many films have depicted the addict, Beautiful Boy also shows the latent dysfunctions a family goes through in coping with a significant other who is addicted in a very powerful manner. Some of the best moments of the film dealt with the difficulties a parent must go through with addiction as they battle with the loss of trust and control of their childrens lives. By showing the extreme hardships of addiction, relapse, and recovery in such a frank and real depiction the movie really painted a portrayal of drug use that we don't see often in Hollywood.Of course the centerpiece of the movie was its acting. Steve Carell absolutely killed it as a concerned and grieving father. His character went through every stage of grief and Steve Carell did a convincing job portraying those emotions on the screen. Timothy Chalmette again puts everything he has into his role. He brought a vulnerability to the role that really made his character relatable. You felt for every hardship and struggle he went through. His ability to emote is quite remarkable for someone his age.While the film provided a stark and powerful depiction of drug use it did have its problems. The director attempted to add more of an impact to the film by editing in different time frames, but ultimately this just made the movie jarring and slowed down the narrative. The film had a bit of a pacing problem that at times brought the plot progression to a standstill. There were also some very questionable decisions made in the soundtrack. I also think the film didn't go far enough in pushing the physical and emotional effects drug use can have on the body. Beautiful boy is certainly no Requiem for a Dream. The film also at times feels emotionally manipulative for the sake of sentiment without digging deeper into the mind-set of addiction.I enjoyed Beautiful Boy mostly for the incredible acting. It's a film that would be incredibly forgettable in the hands of less talented artists. The story at times is jarring and emotional, but still does suffer from directorial choices. It was a good movie, but ultimately loses out to other films portraying drug addiction with more grit and nuance. A 7.75 out of 10.",Beautiful Boy
69,ccorral419,"""Beautiful Boy"" is a powerful movie going experience",9,11 October 2018,"Belgian Director Felix Van Groningen (""The Broken Circle"" 2012 - Winner of multiple Film Festival Awards) brings the best selling pair of memories, ""Beautiful Boy"" by father David Sheff and ""Tweak"" by son Nic Sheff to the big screen with heart-wrenching perfection. Steve Carell steps into the role of David, a father willing and available to help his son through a period he can't understand. Timothy Chalamet (""Call Me by Your Name"") is Nic, a young boy who appears to have it all, only to be dealing with a dark hole feed by drug addicition. The beauty of this film is that the story is told from both father and son perspectives. Nic writes about what was happening in his head and heart, while David writes what it was like to be a father looking in. Van Groningen's primary setting is a family cabin in the woods of San Francisco. Breathtaking in its appearance, surrounded by the forrest and a yard surely once filled with memorable family times, the interior is mysteriously gloomy and dark, warning the viewer something is wrong here. Cinematography (Ruben Impens), and the films eerie musical score, further cement the tense presented on screen, dropping the viewer into various SF locations that grab you and hold you down. Be for warned: The silence within this film is so powerful, that if you're eating popcorn, sipping on a beverage or your phone rings, you do any of these at your own risk. Yet, however strong this film is, something is missing here. The performance are above terrific and touching, the story is current and relevant, and the mothers (Maura Tierney ""ER"" and Amy Ryan ""Birman"") perspective is equally on point. Yet, I found myself unable to fully latch on to the characters in the manner that I'm sure the writers wanted.

The cast is spectacular. I was a nanny for Nic Sheff when he was a toddler. My job was to love him and take care of him and I did. Memories of taking long walks, playing at the park, drawing with and reading to him, peeling grapes, singing, dancing, running, hanging out with the other nanny and his other bright, beautiful boy charge, the sippy cup, brushing his hair out of his beautiful eyes, sleeping over and listening for any sound of need or distress, his smile, his laugh, I loved this boy. The movie was wrenching for me to watch. I left the job because the hours were often 24/7 and I was young and needed to go to school; have my own life. Vicki had let me into her home to help with her son. I liked her a lot. It was a hard decision for me to leave. I didn't want to leave Nic.

The presentation of this film is a bit muddled, and the soundtrack just did not work for me, especially at the end where as good a job the movie was doing to get to feel for these characters, the soundtrack was doing the opposite.

79,JankiSharma,"Addiction: drugs, love and caring",10,21 October 2018,"Director Felix van Groeningen directed the movie Beautiful Boy written by David Sheff. I read the book in 2009 and wanted to see on the big screen the story of caring parent and a boy so beautiful get addicted to drugs . I am very happy that Director and the entire cast did a great job. Steve Carell ( from The Office) plays the role of David Sheff, a writer who has ex wife Vicki Sheff( Amy Ryan again from The Office) and his current wife Karen ( Maura Tierney from The Affair) . David and Vicki have a son Nic ( Timothee Chalamet from Call me by your name)who lives with David , Karen and their 2 cute kids Jasper and Daisy.
There is lot of love and play among siblings. Nic then started using marijuana and progressed to other drugs. Now , Nic is 18 and an addict, in and out of David's life and home. It takes a lot for Karen to tell David to stop helping Nic because he can't help him. The scenes when Nic and his addict girlfriend Lauren (Kaitlyn Dever) break into their home when the family is away for kids school meet are filled with sadness. And when Karen gets into her car and chases Nic and Lauren without even talking to David speaks volume about how Nic is blessed with love and caring people in his life and makes one wonder why Nic wanted to get away from reality . The scene when Nic is clean for a while and speaks to his sponsor Spencer (Andre Royo) is sad. Nic does not like reality and burden of facing reality. Terrific acting by Steve Carell . Great acting by Timothee Chalamet, truly a beautiful boy. Oscar worthy acting and Oscar worthy direction. I am glad Director and actors did great justice to book and father and son relationship.",Beautiful Boy
80,domtaylor,"It has great performances and engages up to a point, but it fails to really connect emotionally.",6,27 January 2019,"'Beautiful Boy' is definitely an acting showcase. All of the performances are great, especially Timotheé Chalamet's, and this gives the film the weight that its narrative is greatly lacking. It tries to be a heart-wrencher, but it never manages to move you emotionally, as every emotion it tries to elicit feels forced and manufactured - largely due to the awful (and overly loud) music choices scattered throughout. It is more successful as an anti-drug film than an exploration of the father-son relationship at its core, though, and this is largely down to Chalamet's performance. Therefore, the film isn't without its merits. Don't get me wrong, it's engaging to an extent and definitely worth a watch for the performances alone, but it does feel really long and it's not all that successful at being a tearjerker. 6/10",Beautiful Boy
81,ginasharp,Beautiful Film,10,14 November 2020,"In my opinion, everyone should see this. It is so beautifully done. The acting was superb, so beautifully written. It opened my eyes to the pain, struggle and sacrifice that addiction causes not only for the person being overtaken by it but for the people who love them. The addiction blinds them to that love but in this case Love prevailed. I plan to watch this again just for the dialog and the beautiful story of love and action that helps to overcome addiction.",Beautiful Boy
82,julieshotmail,Timothee Chalamet nails it,8,8 March 2021,"While Steve Carell deviates from his signature awkward comedy to bring us a very convincing dramatic portrayal of a heartbroken father, Timothee Chalamet only needs his facial micro-expressions to effectively carry the whole movie. The subtlety and realism he brings to this role are nothing short of brilliant. And it does not hurt that his chiseled face in a way does resemble the real Nic Sheff, a testament to some thoughtful casting here. Then we have the scenery, which is showcased in various beautiful shots of the California countryside, giving this movie the feel of a poem. The use of flashbacks to tell the story is effective for the most part, however in certain areas, it feels a bit like corners are being cut and we are shortchanged on the full context, hence the 8 stars instead of 10.",Beautiful Boy
83,varun-25071997,A Massive Letdown,1,5 January 2019,"To say I am disappointed is an understatement. I always wanted to watch this film because of its cast but in most cases they are either not utilised properly or have very underdeveloped characters. There is no coherent structure and in many cases I didn't know what message the director wanted to deliver. The movie is a mix of poor parenting, addiction, spoilt youthhood & toxic relationships but doesn't seem to show any of them in the right manner. It is very exploitative & poorly written, other than a few gorgeous shots nothing seems memorable or likable",Beautiful Boy
84,Equalizer16,"Very poweful, just could be better",7,12 February 2019,"Based off on the memoirs by David Shelf, Beautiful Boy follows David (Steve Carell) from his fatherly perspective watching his son Nick (Timothée Chalamet) deal with his drug addiction. Cutting back and forth between memories and present day, we watch the father and son relationship at it brightest to it's painful strain.When discovering that a film with Timothée Chalamet, by far one of the best things to come out of 2017 (no pun intended if you know what I'm talking about) and Steve Carell, by far one of the most versatile and underrated actors at the moment, were going to be in a film together as father and son, I was beyond excited. As clips and trailers were released, I could see that this biographical drama could be really something. And it defiantly is a film with something, just doesn't quite know how to use that something.With Felix van Groeningen directing his first English language debut, and including producers from Oscar winners: 12 Years a Slave (2013) and Moonlight (2016), there is most definitely some talent behind this film, but it just unfortunately becomes very misjudged in tone and structure.But to lay out the things that Beautiful Boy strives in, one being the performances. Steve Carell doing what I think Steve Carell is very good at, being just an average man. You can feel his tensions and worries as a father, even if you not one yourself, and tell exactly what is on the root of his mind. He is our gateway into the film, as he tries to work out how to help his son, so do we. And from his memories we are shown the strength of his relationship with Nic. But again stealing the show is Chalamet, proving more why he is on his way to an incredible career. As Nic, Chalamet embodies the frustrated young teen so brilliantly, which swirls into dark habit and a twisted mind where his addiction takes over his life. Balancing a fantastic rebellion but still vulnerability we want Nic to be okay but like his dad we become exhausted by continuous cycle of relapse. It truly is Carell and Chalamet's more than convincing relationship that carries the film. And the fact that you do believe in their relationship is what entangles you in this overpowering journey. With some solid, but I felt slightly wasted supporting performances by Maura Tierney, and Amy Ryan the film attempts for more tying threads, but really puts all of its energy into the father and son.However, as Beautiful Boy strives with its performances the way it orchestrates the rest is less of a victory. As the film jumps back and forth from past and present memories, the chronology becomes rather confused. Although establishing the context of it's characters, it becomes inconsistent. This rickty line only lasts through to the second act, where it has been purely centred on the bond between Nic and David where the film is at it's strongest, but then as it passes the middle act of the film, it goes off course and becomes more of a Chalamet film. At this point we briefly loose that central grip between the two characters. There is also a very strong screenplay in their, but it never quite meets it's poniancy and moving capacity but shows potential.It's a film that wants to be real, but choses to use very peculiar soundtrack choices at a number of scenes which only really confuse the film's overall mood. This is a case where if in the hands of someone like Kenneth Lonergan or Richard Linklater, we would have a much more honest and affective film.As the film drifts to it's heart destroying climax you find that all the gooey insides in you have turned rock solid. By the end of Beautiful Boy you feel like you've be flattened by a massive pile of bricks, a heavy experience I have not felt since August: Osage County (2013). For all its issues, the emotional engagement we have with these characters does pay off for its shattering trek.For all the things that Beautiful Boy gets wrong, it manages to maintain it's beating heart through the performances of Steve Carell and Timothée Chalamet. It succeeds very much in bringing it's message across. It disappoints me that there could be a much better film in there, but for what it is, it does an adequate job.",Beautiful Boy
85,christophersarles,Amazing. Spot on.,10,14 February 2019,"I've seen a LOT of movies addressing this issue, and NONE have ever been as truthful. Not all addicts are bad people from poor, seedy families. Some are really good people who are sick. Sick, with a life sentence of trying to fill a hole in them that they don't even know why it's there. Trying to feel beautiful, or whole..or normal.
The price of a ticket for that ride is very very high and sometimes you don't realize that until it's too late.
This movie showed all these sides, and more.. it's a selfish disease but one that the inflicted never realizes is so bone numbingly painful to those who never give up on them. Until they DO give up.. then the hole becomes an abyss.",Beautiful Boy

87,ricky_dry_county,Staggeringly terrible,1,13 January 2019,"1) Steve Carell's delivery is the same whether it's the 40 year old virgin or a dramatic plot like this one.
2) Who the f#ck edited the soundtrack into the movie? They serve to annoy you rather than elevate the already stagnat scenes.
3) Absolutely devoid of a script and relatability. The 'addict' has absolutely no problems in his life before he manufactures some and inmerses himself in drugs for fun.
Really hard to put aside all these factors to last 2+ hours, so I didn't. I don't lust over any adolescent boy (or girl for that matter) so no, that's not gonna be a highlight for me. Good luck!",Beautiful Boy

Nothing that's uttered is out of place. The editing is hard to fault, considering that the story jumps back and forth in time. And the actors really make you feel for the characters. Timothee Chalamet is amazing as the drug-addicted son. To me, his part is written more as a supporting character than lead but regardless of where he is placed, he deserves to be awarded. His is one of the most authentic performances i have ever seen over more than 50 years of watching movies. His Nic Sheff lingers in your mind long after the movie has ended.",Beautiful Boy

I'm a father I and I have my own troubles with my own children but there is a limit for everything. Anyway, it didn't work for me.

90,resireg,"Entertaining, but gives us the wrong message.",7,11 October 2020,"The movie for me reminds me of ""Christiane F."" A German movie from the 70s that was supposed to warn kids against drugs, but it had the oppsite effect. Pretty much this one has a message that drugs are associated with Art, Intellectualism and Sex. Pretty much a young kid (from 18 to mid 20s) who has everything, like an amazing house, he lives close to desrted beaches in California, his family is wealthy and suddenly he embarks on drug use. I know that it happens quite a lot in real life, but I am pretty sure it happens mostly with poor people who become criminals to fuel their habit.In the movie, the main character Nic doesn't explain how he manages to eat, sleep and buy drugs. Does his familg give him an allowance? Is he robbing pr stealing? Nobody answers that.Besides, it shows that if you do drugs, woman will approach you to have sex with them. It is an incentive for virgin males to use drugs as a self-esteem enhancer in order to attract girls. It might be real, but again, the movie is teaching people how to be popular.And there are no consequences. The character screw up his stepmother ans step siblings lives, and there is no retaliation at all. I disaprove the apology to narcotics that this film makes.",Beautiful Boy
91,Zlatikevichius,Disappointed a bit,6,26 January 2021,"Great performances, excellent depiction of drug addiction at young age and the best way to deal with - as a family. But overall, the movie lacks so many things. First of all, especially in the first half, the editing made it messy and made me lose interest and hype about it. Second: the music was too loud and very distracting. And third: I have impression that the whole movie stood in one spot instead of going somewhere, and therefore, I found in unnecessary too long. But, Carell and Chalamet deserves all the praise. And more!",Beautiful Boy
92,mharah,I was disappointed.,7,19 November 2018,"The performances are stellar, and the cinematography is beautiful. The script - whether intended or not (which isn't clear) - proceeds on at least three parallel lines, all periods in Nic's young life. Cutting back and forth between them is sudden - often fleeting, sometimes jarring - leading usually to at least momentary uncertainty. Nic is played by different actors at each level (which is helpful - Jack Dylan Glazer as Nic at 12 is outstanding with very few actual lines). The story itself is based on two memoirs, one by Nic and the other by David, his father. Needless to say, this will result in some disparity of account, forcing the film to choose one POV or the other. (Thank goodness the writers didn't try to do both at the same time.) The result is a rambling, largely pedestrian narrative, which undoubtedly reflects reality but isn't very interesting. Steve Carell turns in yet another terrific dramatic turn as the father (and main focus of the storyline). Personally, I find Carell much more engaging as a dramatic actor (Foxcatcher, Last Flag Flying, Hope Springs) than as a comedian. Timothee Chalamet continues to show us that he is a giant in the making. Moira Tierney and Amy Ryan are terrific in smaller roles. All in all, a remarkable effort hampered by a narrative that is not engaging.",Beautiful Boy
93,willeasyer,Loved it,9,25 January 2019,"This film was such a slap in the face, in a good way. it's ardent and immersive to the absolute. I adored the way the director decided to shoot this tense and cathartic story in a non linear & chaotic way that channels the turbulences a drug addict lives including the torments their families go through; starting with flashbacks, then going back to present moment and suddenly going far into memory to the point you lose the notion of now and you can't decipher the reminisces from the present which makes you as disorientated and lost as our characters and that's very smart and efficient. This film is also a heartwarming memoir about drug addiction all without romanticizing or layering it out, it's as hard and raw as the real life to the point you'll project in the characters even without apprehending what they're going through; another interesting point about this movie is the performance of our star-studded cast, the performances took it to a whole other level timothy, for example, was so convincing and involved in the role giving his character ""nick"" a whole other dimension and Steve Carell who was the main star of the movie in my opinion (sorry timy) was really moving and stirring. And the film is also a great testament about family and the deepness of the father-son relationship and the strength of such a bond; a theme that is rarely portrayed in cinema. this film is a real tour de force touching to the core i was really hyped abut it and i wasn't desapointed. what a nice way to start a year",Beautiful Boy

96,zhivago97,Beautifully made but emotionally painful to watch,10,25 July 2021,"I found the performances and overall storyline to be powerful, realistic and engaging. The emotion felt by these characters is palpable. It was like watching someone's private moments in their life, as a voyeur, rather than watching a movie. So kudos to everyone involved in the production for pulling off a great feat.Yes the plot is obviously sad, but I never felt like the writer/producer/director were manipulating the audience. The whole movie felt authentic - and accomplishing this feat takes serious talent.Warning for people who cry at movies like me: this was difficult for me to not cry while watching.I was particularly impressed with the arc of the storyline. ""Letting go"" as they say is powerful and I thought the evolution of the characters to get to that point was accomplished with great sensitivity and insight. By letting go, I mean both the descent of the addicted son (his letting go of his self control) and the eventual realization by his parents that they have no control over their adult son's life choices, as self destructive and painful as they may be.While the film is not perfect, my criticisms boil down to personal preference. The soundtrack was overpowering at times, rather than being complimentary or mood-evoking. I found myself turning the volume down several times because the sound was distracting.My other main criticism is the technique of using flashbacks. While I think it's a useful and effective technique, it was over used. The constant flipping between present and past became confusing and even a little annoying.Overall this is a great film. It showcases one family's struggle dealing with a very real and growing problem of drug addiction. And it was done with accuracy, insight and sensitivity.",Beautiful Boy

There is no doubt that the acting of all involved is top notch. The emotions brought out in the movie are quite real, and you can't help but feel, not just for Nic (Chalamet) as the addict, but even more so for David (Carrell) his father. Steve Carrell's performance as a father who does everything he can, without enabling, his addict son is heart wrenching. When he reaches a point of no return, it leaves the viewer feeling empathy for him.This is one of the most depressing movies in a long time. Every time you think a corner had been turned it just keeps getting worse and worse. What makes it so hard to rate is something is missing, and I'm not sure what exactly. The pace drags at times, and It just is missing something that should be there.Ultimately, the performances did make me give it the benefit of the doubt.

As someone grow independence and learning to be an adult, this movie really speaks to me. Parent child relationship is not black and white, love or hate. It is so much more than that. We are ultimately two human beings going through different circumstances in life. And sometimes, we can only fix ourselves with our own hands. Love sometimes just isn't enough.The scene that stays in my head is this: ""I'm attracted to craziness and you're just embarrassed because I was like, this amazing thing, like your special creation or something and you don't like who I am now,"" ""Who are you, Nic?"" ""This is me, dad. This is who I am.""I relate to this so much. You know your parents love you. But they maybe they are only in love with the idea of you.

We're just supposed to feel Bad for the addict. Nothing about Chalamet is likable here, he's an unapologetic addict. I don't see what the critics are saying about this film being safe. I can only guess, in my experience as a screenwriter and the critique I've received, they want to see things they're not really entitled to, similar to how people wanted more focus on freddie mercury's Sexuality in 'bohemian rhapsody'.

118,dogmaticdogs,Could Have Been Perfection,7,28 October 2018,"As usual, Timothée Chalamet put in another mind blowing performance. This guy really is one of the best actors of this generation. Unfortunately, he was paired with Steve Carell, a one dimensional comedian specializing in bodily function and body part jokes who was quite good at playing the office clown in The Office but not really ready to play a leading man in a serious drama. This could have been one of the best movies of the decade. Instead, it was just good.Oh well, I still love you Timothée and can envision how amazing It could have been if you were paired better.

But the performances here made me say, ""I kinda get Timothee Chalamet now."" I mean, his frame is suited for this character (those cheekbones and jawline can cut glass), but I got the emotional pull for his character Nic Sheff stuck in a mind that just cannot resist the lure of this addiction. Bright, gifted, and loved, yet, stuck/lost. I didn't cry, but I got the sense of being stuck/lost. I appreciated that and I will call him by his name, Timothee (in my best Stan voice).Plus seeing Michael Scott as David Sheff left me so moved, especially with the relationship with his ex-wife caring for their technically adult child.And let's not forget Maura Tierney's Karen (gosh, I wish she had a different name) telling her son he cannot go into the water with his older brother. How do you maintain levels of love and trust under those circumstances? I mean, trying to maintain some semblance of normalcy for yourself and those afflicted can be so hard (and with little children). That moment said a lot.Very good movie.",Beautiful Boy
120,emailtombuchanan,"A wonderful film about a loving family, and the scourge of drug addition",10,9 January 2019,"I'm blown away by this film about a father and his 18 year old son who is dealing with a crippling drug addiction. Beautiful Boy stars Steve Carell as the father and Timothée Chalamet as the troubled teen. Both give extraordinary performances in a perfectly crafted film that generates surprising empathy for families and addicts trapped in this kind of brutal nightmare. Beautiful Boy tells the story of a middleclass family that finds itself helplessly struggling when the oldest of three children stumbles into addiction, and then tries to free himself. Just when it looks like he'll succeed, he relapses and crashes even harder in a spiraling oscillation. There is conflict, for sure, but always within the context of a loving family trying to save their son. Mr. Carell and Mr. Chalamet deliver amazing performances supported by a strong cast that enhances the conflict and defines the underlying love, without ever getting in the way. The entire production is solid, with an outstanding musical score that perfectly fits the story. The film is based on the memoirs of David Sheff (father) and Nic Sheff (son), and is blended to reflect their different perspectives. Beautiful Boy was produced through Amazon Studios and received high praise at the 2018 Toronto Film Festival, then launched with a limited U.S. release in October 2018. It is now available on Amazon Prime as an included free selection.",Beautiful Boy

At the end there's just a title card that says how bad the addiction epidemic is, how services are underfunded, and then tells you if you are struggling, ask for help.

125,alvesmarceloalves-73751,Fathers and sons,8,8 December 2018,"Perhaps because he´s coming from a more solid career in comedy films and even out of gender bias, we rarely realize how good actor Steve Carell is. His recent choices, however, only serve to reinforce the talent of the ""40 Year Old Virgin"" (2005) as a dramatic actor. ""Foxcatcher"" (2014) and especially ""The Big Short"" (2015) already exhibited its versatility. And when he plunged into dramas like ""Last Flag Flying"" (2017) and the most recent ""Beautiful Boy"" (2018), Carell further justified the choices made by different directors for their work.There are some similarities between these two more recent films. ""Last Flag Flying"" is the story of a father who loses his son in the Iraq war and only wants to bury him while he lives his mourning alongside fellow friends of the Vietnam War. ""Beautiful Boy"" is the story of a father, a family, but very focused on this father, who deals with his son's drug addiction. In both Carell's work is accurate, touching and with the safety of veteran experienced dramatic actors.His David Sheff is one of the strengths of ""Beautiful Boy."" The other is the work of his colleague Timothee Chalamet. At just 23 years old, the actor has been consolidating himself as a strong name in cinema with ever better performances. Chalamet had already drawn attention in the drama ""Call Me by Your Name"" (2017), when it was the young Elio, who fell in love with an American writer, his first love. In ""Beautiful Boy"" he brings the necessary dramatic charge to Nic's story and does not fall into the exaggeration of the daydreams of madness by the use of drugs so frequent in films reporting this type of problem.Nic's pain is absurdly palpable. Your desperation to get out of it too. Depression interspersed with moments of false joy, for it was known how much Nic suffered from within, are alive in Chalamet's eyes.""Beautiful Boy"" is a hard movie to watch. A real story about a family that had everything to be perfect and is dredged by the drug problem. Especially the use of methamphetamine. But at the same time it is of a unique beauty, or perhaps difficult to describe by showing this strength of the relationship between father and son. An almost unbreakable force even when David sees the need to leave the scene to recover. And how beautiful Carell's work is by carrying all these nuances with her.And at this point it is necessary to speak of another fundamental question in the construction of this story. The edition of the film of Felix van Groeningen, the same director of ""Alabama Monroe"" (2012). The idea of building a fragmentary history with bits of past and present mixing together was risky, could cause confusion, but it was very well done. In her, we gradually understood that relationship of love between father and son, the way Nic immersed himself in drugs, moved away from his father, his mistakes, his comings and goings, the bottom of the pit. A structure that brought to the film moments of pure poetry.""Beautiful Boy"" speaks of a very serious subject, the chemical dependency, but without falling into false moralisms. On the other hand, it is also a movie about the force of love. The love of a father for his son, for a whole family for this son and for never giving up. Even when everything seems lost. And it still has an excellent soundtrack.",Beautiful Boy

But please don't think that all problems can be covered with the word ""religion"", and don't assume that all religions are dross because of some religious traditions. The father remained silent about the bullying suffered by his son, probably partly because he believed that the son was wrong, and he received everything he deserved.

Watching this movie reminded me of the pain, frustration, hollow hope and finally resignation that my family and I endured. This movie captures those thoughts and feelings. On the other hand, it gives some insight into the atmosphere of enabling and excusal that contributes to, in the first instance, a young man experimenting with illegal drug use, and the oblivious response to that experimentation by parents. It is inexcusable that a father would laugh about smoking marijuana and then decide to smoke it with his son. It is inexcusable and ridiculous that a father would use methamphetimine or cocaine in a misguided attempt to understand what that son is going through. In this regard, the movie is simply stupid.

I've seen better films and documentaries. This felt flat, the flashbacks were inconsistent and like fillers. The best part is the scenery, but how can you go wrong filming off Highway 1 down the coast of CA? Having read both autobiographies this was based on, I suggest sticking w the books.

They absolutely blew my mind. While I have never battled addiction or really know anyone who has, I can confidently say that Timothée's portrayal as an addict and Steve's as a grieving parent was so authentic and heartbreaking. The rest of the cast was great and helped elevate the film even further, too. Some of the editing was weird and confused me a bit, especially the flashbacks. But it didn't impede the impact of the film. Like I said, even without this cast of actors it would've been an admirable film nonetheless, but because of their performances it took a decent film and made it very good one. #TimothéeOscars2019",Beautiful Boy
138,vinylvanilla,"An impeccable, must-watch movie for anyone who wants to understand more about drug addiction",9,4 February 2019,"A beautiful, devastating and touching portrait of how drug addiction can affect the strongest of the bonds - the one between a father and a son. As someone who has both read books like Christiane F who are real stories about drug addicts, and has had seen and talked to real drug addicts before, I can say this is a very realistic depiction of what drug addiction looks like - sharp, raw, devastating and sneaky. It also comes at a great and appropriate moment to educate American society, since the USA is suffering from a major drug addiction epidemic.Apart from the flawless plot, here we have both Timothée Chalamet and Steve Carrell shining in their roles and giving amazing performances - it's a shame neither of them got an Academy nomination. Chalamet, who in my opinion was just mediocre in ""Call me by your name"" (and, surprisingly, he got an Oscar nomination for that mediocre performance), here shows his full dramatic potential, proving us - and especially me, who used to be really skeptical about his talent - that he is growing into a very good actor.Carrell, on the other hand, is distancing himself more and more from comedy and showing that he's a great, versatile actor who can do almost anything. I'm pretty sure his Oscar is coming, and he definitely deserves it. The way he portrayed the father of Nic was so sensible and realistic at the same time , I saw zero exaggerated reactions there, only a natural, perfect performance. I would also want to mention Maura Tierney's amazing job too, who played beautiful scenes in a small role - the scene in which she drives the car (I won't say more not to give spoilers) is heartbreaking and shows what a great actress she is.Technically wise, this movie is gorgeous, from edition to cinematography and soundtrack. Loved how the soundtrack perfectly matched Nic's mood and decay as he plunged deeper and deeper into addiction.To sum it all up, this is an impeccable movie, and I'm sure it'll be a classic among others about mental issues and addiction - I'm also certain that this movie will be discussed in universities and academic meetings as a way to show students and societies how drug addiction is devastating. This is a masterpiece and so far the best movie I have watched this season.",Beautiful Boy

His performance in Last Flag Flying, Foxcatcher and this one (to name a few) are proof of this. In Beautiful Boy he does an excellent job of being the father who shows selfless, unconditional love for his son. The viewer sympathizes, worries and feels powerless right along with David (Steve Carell). Wish the same could be said about Nic (Timothee Chalamet). I don't believe it's the actors fault. Timothee Chalamet does a great job. Maybe in the writing, they would have shown clearer why Nic went down this road of addiction to begin with. Did Nic have trauma, chaotic childhood or mental illness? This wasn't clear. He was just depicted as the experimenting, emo writer, who just liked to party and get high. To the viewers point of view his life seem to be pretty great. Addiction can happen to anyone, yes, but a better direction why Nic chose this horrible lifestyle. It just would have provided more sympathy for his character.",Beautiful Boy
145,nihalsharma,Such a powerful movie. Highly recommended.,9,29 August 2020,"The movie deals with the drug addiction situation and how it shatters families and takes away a lot of time who are fighting along. The people around you are going to get affected by the choices you make. They have sleepless nights. They suffer along but they don't give up. Sometimes you think nothing is going to work but then there is always faith which keeps you going, there is this bond of love which does not let anyone give up on the others. People fight, they fail but they keep on fighting and they do see the sunshine.The movie is a story of triumph. The father son relationship is really complex. The father, the pillar of the family, has to be strong and he can't let the emotions appear so as to make him look weak. Steve Carell has played such a lovely and a very composed role. Chalamate is just as brilliant. There are a lot of intense tear-jerking moments in the movie that will make you love it more and more. The cinematography is really done well. Good choice of songs to fill in the moments. Its definitely a must watch movie.",Beautiful Boy
146,tracynurzynski-483-915726,Acting is superb!! Storytelling not so much.,7,20 January 2019,"The acting gave this movie 10 stars
Storytelling 5 stars
Overall 7 starsTimothee Chamalet is one of the most talented actors I've ever seen on screen. This is the first movie I've seen him in, and I actually felt his performance. Carell, Tierney, & Ryan are also amazing. I really enjoyed seeing Tierney especially because I loved ER back in the day.While the acting is stellar, the way the story is told is not helpful in understanding addictive behavior. First, the sequence of the story is odd and flips around too much, especially in the beginning. The story also does a great deal of looking back when Nic is a young boy. I feel these scenes were just unnecessary to the story. I understand filmmakers want us to view Nic as an innocent child, and create empathy for David. Still, I would've preferred a more linear storyline.The focus in this story is primarily on the parent's anguish & despair watching their child on the downward spiral of drugs. But the film fails to really capture the parent's struggle. The intense scenes that really show addictive behavior are so scattered it's difficult to connect to one individual character.With that being said, there are a couple of intense scenes that do show what addictive behavior looks like for both the addict and loved ones.One scene that stuck with me is when Nic loses his temper and gets in Karen's face screaming at and cursing at her. While it's a very short scene, it is still powerful because the audience can understand the multitude of emotions that come with being a parent of a drug addict. It evokes a sadness for Nic, but more importantly shows the utter frustration parents of addicts must feel. On one hand, you're sad because you know it's the drugs, on the other you're angry because the parents are doing so much for their child who keeps falling down this dark hole. The other scenes are when Nic OD's and his girlfriend OD's, and Karen chases him in the car. I realize these events may not have happened in that exact order in real life, but for the sake of the movie, they should have strung these scenes closer together. It would've given a better picture of what David was going through and allowed a better connection to the character.Overall, I enjoyed the acting of this movie more than the way the story is told and the progression of events. I also wish it was a tad bit grittier. The acting is so strong in this movie. I hope to see Chamalet in more films.On a side note, the trivia portion states that after 9/11 no one without a ticket is allowed to go to the gate in an airport. This is not true. Parents with an unaccompanied minor are given a pass and allowed through security to be with their child before the flight and to pick them up.",Beautiful Boy

148,ernestoac,"Beautiful boy, Beautiful movie",9,28 April 2020,"Beautiful Boy, a story about the ups and downs of a family hit by drugs, the highs and lows, relapses and recoveries, just as any true story does. Well, it is a true story, based on the memories of both father and son. All tied together with jumps between the past and present so we get more attached.
The movie will be centered on the family, mostly the father, David Sheff (Steve Carrell), and the restless deal with his son, Nic Sheff (Timothée Chalamet), and his addiction.
From the beginning we are presented to a father in the search of help for a son who he doesn't recognize anymore.
This is our start point, now it's time to know our characters as we connect with Nic, a teenager who had passed through the divorce of his parents. He was a seemingly happy boy, had a good relationship with his dad, was smart, sensitive, and bright, or so it seemed.
Just let yourself discover how he felt drugs got him where he felt like nothing else could, how eventually his own father can't recognize him, and the impact he will make in his life and those around him, as everybody has something to learn. Not only him, but his father, who has to understand not everything can be controlled and not everything is as you can perceive.
For me, this movie was a trip of emotions with a slow start in which I got to know the characters, but you keep to get attached to the throughout the movie, as it keeps showing us some of their memories and you see them as they face the consequences of their own actions, like getting into drugs, and those they love.

Beautiful Boy is, in its core, about the fight and the diary efforts of a father's love and devotion towards a son trying to control his dependence. The movie faithfully explores the feeling of inability a father has when constantly losing a son to his addiction, and the incomprehension of it, when knowing what their relationship once was. The sublime acting of Steve Carrell, who has proven his worth in dramatic roles, and of Timothée Chalamet, alongside a strong secondary cast, make us feel the pain of these (so real) characters. The directing and cinematography are intelligent, beautiful, and balanced, keeping us in the ambivalence of what this relationship was, what it is, and what it might or might not become.

155,garyvanb,Bluntly Sad Study of the Hopelessness of Drug Addiction,9,17 November 2018,"As my sister said, very well done film. It's about the true story of a writer and father who begins losing his straight A son with a bright future to drugs. Pot is only the beginning, and Crystal Meth is nearly the end. The film does a great job dealing with the psychology of drug addiction and how it affects those addicted AND their loved ones. Steve Carrell tries everything, including love and reason, and sometimes it works, but not for long, and sometimes it doesn't. In the end - SPOILER ALERT - he and his family realize there is really NOTHING they can do, because love and reason only works for a time, and the drug addict often only uses them to continue doing drugs. Eventually, Carrell must cut his son off and wish him the best. Needless to say, it's a sad movie, with a feeling of dread and hopelessness at it's center to thoroughly capture the essence of a drug addict on a downward spiral. For a loving and caring father to see his beautiful boy become something he never expected and doesn't understand and can't help is tragic. It was a very well done movie, very thought provoking, and any parent of a drug addict would only be helped by seeing it because it does show the reality of the addiction, and that you can't save them by your actions, that it is eventually up to them to make the choice to continue using or stop. And it's a DAILY choice. At one point, he's clean for over a year. Then one night, the addiction hits again, he succombs, drops out of sight, and becomes even worse than he was before. Then he breaks in to his Dad's house to steal money, his girlfriend nearly OD's, and then nearly OD's himself shortly after in a bathroom stall, and Carrell is helpless to stop it because if he tries to intercede, it will just prolong the inevitable. Just sad, and perhaps too sad to give this movie it's deserved A, because it's actually grueling to sit through. There's no denying the script and acting are all first rate, and at least it makes you feel something about real life, and educates you about the psychology of drugs and addiction. It's the kind of movie I do recommend people see, as long as they're prepared going in. In many ways, it has many parrallels to The Exorcist. Both movies are about parents who are helpless as they watch their teenage children enter a downward, deathly spiral.",Beautiful Boy

She said she had read both books, and was disappointed by the film. I however, have not read the books. I thought the performances were both honest & raw, especially Chalamet and of course Steve Carell.

The movie perfectly compares the son's life in the past and the present, and how the parents in crisis can't recognize their children and don't know when did they reached this point and how?... this is very much noticed at the end with the song 'Sunrise Sunset'.

161,LilyWai,A heartbreaking illustration of a father dealing with his son's addiction,9,1 April 2019,"Based on a memoirs of father and son David & Nic Sheff 'Beautiful Boy' gives the uninitiated a real glimpse into the heartache, desperation and battles that occur when a parent is trying to save their drug addicted child. The father David is masterfully portrayed by Steve Carell who gives a engaging and empathetic performance showing the ongoing turmoil, heartbreak and angst felt by the addict's loved ones. Carell's start in comedic roles hid his depths as an dramatic actor, in this role he gets to show his true emotional range and it makes for riviting viewing. He shows the intellectual & emotional journey any parent goes through as they try to understand what is driving their child's addiction; what it is, what led them to this, what can I do to fix this, why isn't treatment working to finally accepting that it is out of his control and not something that he can fix or make better.
Nic, played by the stunning Timothée Chalamet (Call Me By Your Name) starts like so many young people, dabbling in the odd pill here or joint there and very quickly spirals downward to where he is grappling with an insatiable addiction to crystal meth that is pulling him further and further from his family. He is clearly powerless in the face of his addiction and as with most people struggling with addiction he has many attempts at sobriety, mostly facilitated by his father. Just when you think he has managed to overcome it the the weight of his feelings shame and self loathing pull him right back under again and leave him feeling that yet again he is a failure in the eyes of his father.
This movie is at it's heart a film about the unwaning love that a father has for his son and the lengths he will go to get his son back but it also is an illustration of how voracious and indiscriminate drug addiction can be. Nic's story could be any young person in America today and that is possibly the most salient message of all.",Beautiful Boy
162,kadijamarie,A parent's journey,7,29 October 2018,"The best performance by Steve Carell so far (standing by for ""Welcome to Marwen"" which also looks like a performance triumph for the actor). Steve adds a deeply heart rending insight to an otherwise already told story. Addiction narratives aren't rare or untapped, as you can find many films to date with the premise of an addict teetering between self care and chemical self deprecation. What we rarely see is the affects of this addiction on their friends and family, save for the drug induced rummaging for loose change in a family home or brief scenes of parents crying over the children they no longer recognize. Beautiful Boy holds you by giving you a chance to latch onto a character/person that simply doesn't understand addiction, which is common with many people who have loved ones struggling with it. Timotheé Chalamet gives a tremendous performance as a drug addled young man at odds with his father because he ""just doesn't get it"". But the true star is Carell, you'll yearn for Chalamet to come to his senses throughout but ultimately Carell (David Sheff) will have you wanting to call your dad as soon as the credits roll.",Beautiful Boy

I'm a big fan of both Steve Carell and Timothée Chalamet, so I had high hopes. Often, when I build a movie up too much before seeing it, I end up being disappointed, but here I'm glad to say that wasn't the case. The two central performances were nothing short of incredible and you genuinely believed the relationship they had. Some characters make some very questionable decisions, but what's really great is the fact that they remain likeable and understandable throughout. You feel for each and every character on a deep, emotional level. I was genuinely rooting for them and, as you become more familiar with the characters, the scenes of heavy drug use become harder to watch, because you really want to see them come out the other side unharmed. It's a subtle movie, but nevertheless I highly recommend it.",Beautiful Boy

Though some may find the plot to be slow, every element of this movie (except for the soundtrack) is crucial in relaying the frustrations, sadness, and helplessness that comes with addiction. The film emits pain directly through the incredible performances given by Steve Carell and Timothée Chalamet, which truly set the empathetic nature of the story. I think that the repetitive nature of the film is a key element to understanding the hindrance and frustration that follows the journey to recovery. The realism and verisimilitude of this film makes it unlike the other features that have tackled such a prevalent theme. Give it a watch.",Beautiful Boy

170,Sebastien02,A powerful movie,9,17 February 2019,"Based on a true story, this film reminds us that addiction is a disease which does not discriminate: it can hit anybody at any time. Indeed, Nic (Timothée Chalamet) does not fit the stereotype of a junkie: raised in a loving upper-middle-class family, he is a good student and shares a close relationship with his father, David (Steve Carell). However, drugs have been part of his life since the age of 12 (alcohol and marijuana at first). The turning point is when he becomes dependent on methamphetamine, at only 18 years old. From that moment on, Nic and his relatives get trapped in a downward spiral. Despite all the support they give him, they are unable to prevent relapses and fear losing him. This movie accurately describes the harmful effects of drugs on family life. It also explores the limits of parental love.

172,thegazatron,A compelling insight,8,5 February 2019,"Beautiful Boy is based on the true story about a family, who's father in particular, tries to help his son battle addiction to some extreme drugs. The two lead males are fantastic.As much as I think Steve Carell is a great comedy actor, which a couple of times came through in scenes it shouldn't have (this is due to my own personal shortcomings), I think he is equally as adept at portraying roles of this emotional magnitude. Timothy Chalamet once again shows why he won awards for Call Me By Your Name, a film I'm yet to watch.This is a simmering and emotional journey and shows insight into how drug abuse not only affects the user, but, the people connected to them",Beautiful Boy
173,francpsantos,A pleasant and frustrating surprise,8,9 January 2019,"I must admit I was quite surprised with the movie. I was already familiar with some of the work of Timothée Chalamet and Steve Carell but didn't expect such raw honesty from each of their performances. Arguably, I am not the expert to talk about how drug abuse would affect someone's life, but Timothée's performance seemed so real that I will not be the one to question. It is hard not to be affected by the clear conflict of emotions seemingly taking part in every interaction. A good example would be the last scene, which is pretty much self explanatory, if you watch it. As for Steve Carrell's part, it struck me even harder. The evolution of his feelings was portrayed elegantly and, as a viewer, you related to the emotional fatigue of a father helplessly facing his son's crippling drug abuse. Usually, people with the privilege of having a stable life, do not find themselves giving the right value to that stability and this movie serves as a kind reminder that, even a middle class family, such as the one portrayed, can collapse easily. It is as personal and realistic as can be. Even frustrating, in a way that you feel there is nothing that can be done to alleviate the suffering. The anachronistic storytelling serves this purpose greatly, intensifying some of the most poignant situations with all the lifelong previous build up in the relationship between father and son. Visually, while not stunning, it is appropriately unpretentious and the grainy image of the analepses is a smart touch. I feel like appropriately unpretentious is a good expression to describe this movie, which, while riding a bit under the radar, is, so far, one of the most engaging I have watched form this past year.",Beautiful Boy

The flashbacks are so mixed up it's hard to understand. The dialogues were also cut very short what brings me to the next point.It wasn't that easy to build an emotional relationship with the characters. I mean it wasn't the casts fault: Steve Carell is the highlight of the whole movie, Timothée Chalamet is brilliant and Maura Tierneys performance is very good too, but to me it wasn't enough to connect. The very usual story also seemed to be a bit too superficial. I know the movie is based on the memoirs of the two main characters but together with the postcard pictures and the sad Indie music (something I usually like), it felt like the movie is very close to a parody of itself.All in all, it may sound worse than it actually is, it's a solid movie, but that's it.6.5/10",Beautiful Boy

178,Medialawman,Beautiful Boy Review by Wayne Keeley,9,1 December 2019,"Whether art imitates life (or life imitates art), the fact is that there is nothing more engaging and powerful than a true-life story. Hence, just about every film out there, with the exception of those heralding a zombie apocalypse, either state they were based on a true-life story or are inspired by real events; the latter disclosure allowing more wiggle room for fiction-based elements as well as avoidance of potential copyright issues.Beautiful Boy, or should I say ""Golden Boy"" since it is already up for a Golden Globe, is a riveting exploration of the downward spiral of drug addiction. But if it were only about that, then it would just a modern take on Less Than Zero. But the film is so much more than the pitfalls of drug addiction - it is in fact a seamless integration of the direct effect of drug addiction on a father-son relationship and the collateral damage that results to other members of the family. Perhaps this seamless integration is due, at least in part, to the fact that the film is based on two biographical memoirs: Beautiful Boy: A Father's Journey Through His Son's Addiction, by David Sheff; and Tweak: Growing up on Methamphetamines, by Nic Sheff. This two-sided glimpse behind the curtain allows us to see both sides of the issues: from an agonized, loving parent juxtaposed against an adolescent who made critical, life-altering mistakes and is then caught up in a web of his own making.Of course, the brilliant acting by Steve Carell (David Sheff) and Timothée Chalamet (Nic Sheff) also had a great deal to do with the verisimilitude of the film, as did the wonderful direction by Felix Van Groeningen, who also co-wrote the screenplay with Luke Davies. Of course, the authenticity of the film was further underscored by the incredible supporting performances of Maura Tierney and Amy Ryan as stepmother, Karen, and mother, Vicki, respectively.Beautiful Boy is one of those films that haunts you long after you've seen it. As a reviewer, it would seem impossible to get so caught up in a drama that you could forget that the lead actor is Steve Carell, probably best known for his comedic chops; but this is just that sort of exceptional film that will go on to garner kudos and awards. It is within the parameters of those rare experiences where reality is suspended and for two hours, you are not audience members, but voyeurs or perhaps worse, peeping toms, surreptitiously spying on friends or neighbors - because of course, no one really knows what goes on behind closed doors.I found that there was definitely a non-US feel to the shooting, scenes, and camera angles; one can attribute this to Belgian director Van Groeningen's first English-speaking film.Beautiful Boy, despite its serious and catastrophic themes, is a beautiful film which must be experienced.",Beautiful Boy

The cast of this film is phenomenal. I had never seen Chalamet perform and I am beyond wowed by his talents, not to mention the complete 180 of Carnell's usual characters - their chemistry throughout the film is engaging, never lost, and unforgettable.
There was something so unique to this film that has been critiqued - the time lapses - and I have to say these people are wrong to hate on this artistic choice. I love movies that make you think because it keeps with you after the credits have rolled, and Beautiful Boy has done this perfectly. Confusing at times, but the flashbacks and flash forwards paint this timelessness within its linear plot.
Surprisingly, this biographical film has a horrific eeriness to it. The cinematography and music are so carefully carved into the film, it truly highlights the darkest of addiction.
Needless to say, there are many different characteristics of the film that make Beautiful Boy a must-see. I will go buy another ticket to see this movie in theaters - I cannot stop thinking about it!",Beautiful Boy
182,Smith-jordan431,Fantastic performances carry the film,8,9 January 2019,"I was extremely excited to see this film after first seeing a small clip of the diner scene between Timothee Chalamet and Steve Carell. Based off of the clip and the trailer, going into it I knew the film would rely very heavily on the performances. Beautiful boy follows David Sheff (Steve Carell) a father who is trying to help his drug addicted son Nic Sheff (Timothee Chalamet). Carell gives a tremendous performance that makes you really feel for the father and everything he's trying to do to help his son. I've only seen two of Chalamet's films (Interstellar and Beautiful Boy) but he really impressed me in this movie. HIs ability to capture the physical and mental transformation of a drug addict was extremely realistic, especially in the scenes of him interacting with Carell. The movie itself is very hard to watch at times, especially if its subject matter resonates with you on a very personal level. But, with a movie such as this that deals with something so serious it does need to be shocking to convey the harsh reality of what drugs can do to a person and his/her family.Now aside from the great performances and some very deep/moving sequences. The story telling style is where the movie became to jumbled where I felt it took away from the emotionally moving side of the film. The Director decided to go with many flashbacks throughout scenes to show what Nic was like as a kid and compare it to how he was now while on drugs. At times extremely effective and I loved it, but more so it made the story feel extremely jumbled and tried almost to hard to be non-linear and different. I can see what the director was trying to do but it just took away from some scenes I felt could've made the movie a great movie compared to just a good movie.Beautiful Boy is a very harrowing look at drug addiction and its effects, combining great performances, cinematography and a solid script I give it an 8/10, B. Definitely worth a watch, but once again it is a hard film to watch at times but this helps convey the desperateness the father was going through.",Beautiful Boy

185,katmckee1,Fantastic Perspective of Addiction: Pain of Being Disconnected,8,2 November 2018,"I watched the movie, ""Beautiful Boy"" about a teenager addicted to drugs. It was a hard movie for me to watch... seeing a father constantly communicating to the son what he was NOT doing, and how it did not make sense to the father. The father would not allow himself to connect for even a minute to the dark hole the son was sitting in to understand why the drug was so important to him.The father, instead, focused on externalities, like the BEHAVIOR of the son, the SCIENCE of addiction, the PROGRAMS for treatment, but he would not allow himself to suspend his own mental world to be in the world of his son, and that was SO painful for me to watch.I slid down in my seat and put my hands to my face... so uncomfortable. I am an addict myself, related to food and attention... not drugs... trauma in childhood was about being abandoned by both parents for a while, and then ignored by them after their own experienced traumas.I was a bit triggered, and had trouble sleeping last night, having sorrow for all the children that are misunderstood by their parents who have a set of expectations for the child who they think they 'created.'To me, a child is a spirit soul who has come through the parents with their own set of qualities and conditions. They are a flower that parents can nurture to bloom, and how they bloom is supposed to be a joyful process of discovery. Not a craft project.I want parents to learn the skills and emotional intelligence needed to BE with their child in their own unique experience that may not be at all related to the parent's perception. It's the only thing I wished I had as a child.I was starving for connection and understanding. Nic Sheff in this movie, was starving for understanding from his father, and Timothee Chalamet (who portrayed Nic) did the most incredible job of portraying the ultimate frustration of a child that only wanted to be received / accepted / understood in his dark puddle of intense existential pain.When the father told the son, ""I have done all I can do,"" I felt angry, because NO, he did not. He never suspended his world to just BE with his son in that dark, scary, horrible place when his son invited him there. The father 'researched' how addicts take drugs, and science of how it changes their brains, but he did not look at himself or how he was being with his son.Timothee's character laughed in frustration, ""Research??"" To me this was a cry for, 'I just want understanding of ME as a person, in this place right now!'
And he confronted him his dad with, ""Well what are YOU doing?"" and that was my question too! I saw the father avoiding what was going on with his son, not willing to really be with him... and not looking at himself but running away from truly being present for his son in the purely emotional plane.Instead of researching the science and treatment of addiction, he would have better served by learning compassionate communication, how to just be present, and getting his own therapy to get a better look at his own blind spots in his life and in his relationships.This movie opens up the most important conversation about disconnection and isolation that leads to addictive behavior, and I hope people see it and discuss these topics with a light shining on solutions for being open and vulnerable to be with others in their dark spaces with full acceptance and love.I think there is DEFINITELY a sequel to this movie in how the family moves into a space of creating more connection with vulnerable communication and self-reflection... and taking a look at the trauma that Nic Sheff experienced as a young child when his parents split and moved apart... what did that abandonment experience create for that child, when his mother was so far away?#addiction #beautifulboy #timotheechalamet #nicsheff #empathy #communication #vulnerability",Beautiful Boy

187,alanlenihan,A truly heart wrenching tale of drug abuse,8,3 March 2020,"Beautiful Boy (2018) is a true story of a relationship between a loving father and troubled son based on the respective biographies of both the father and the son.The name derives from John Lennon's song ""beautiful boy"". The lyrics of this song embody the role of David Sheff played by Steve Carell, in that a son will always be protected by their father even as they grow, learn and distance themselves, it a truly beautiful entendre. the film brings visualisation to the lyrics in a truly poetic style.The film encapsulates the relationship between father and son in the most divine fashion through both the current time scenes and flashbacks, beautiful and heartwarming, but also heartbreaking. it however doesn't just show the side of Nics parents attempting to stay connected and keep him clean, but also how Nic whilst being a user see's them as surveilling him and being overbearing rather than seeing it as actual care.The emotions through this film are captured and expressed brilliantly through the music, each backing music within the scenes are expressive- anything from the suspense and anxiety David felt at the start of the movie attempting got actively understand Nics situation, to the eventual feeling of guilt and pure sadness Nics relapse had on him. The most clear theme of guilt happens when David comes to the realisation that he on his own cant stop his sons drug abuse, it is briefly glimpsed through the whole film but switches from not physically being able to help to consciously stopping for his own closure.It really shows the true reality of drug abuse and how it doesn't just effect the cliché person, it also affects the people who aren't deemed troubled through the spectrum of their background, family or quality of life in general. it shows drug abuse for what it really is, a disease which clouds people of what they were. What I found most heartbreaking about this film is how quickly relapse can be triggered within those believed to be sober- and how detrimental this sudden turn can be to those most important to you. This chase and aguish is most effectively visualised when Karen chases Nic and Lauren after he had broken into her house to fuel his habit; she began the chase with determination, grit and anger and ended the chase when she got the closest to catching him with frustration and acceptance than she can't stop him.unfortunately one could discuss how western and privileged this story is, as it focuses through the scope of a young, successful, educated white male who had the facilities and money to get the best support and care. However, how could you shift the focus of a true story to highlight a 'more' important consensus.recently I have grown fond of Chalamet and his acting range- he truly can become the script he is given, he is a talent that was born to be what he is. It begs for me the question as to why young talents don't have their own awards within the academy.For me Steve Carell stole the show with his performance- you feel what he feels, the phone call really hit hard, it really did. I believe as like many actors who are known for their comedy, that he isn't as appreciated in his drama roles; ultimately his career being overshadowed by his performances in Anchorman, The Office, and The 40 Year Old Virgin. This man truly does have range, previously we had captured glimpses of this within his film, but I am glad he got free reign within this role.Overall, what I think this film teaches is to not give up on life. when there is life, there is the chance things can get better no matter how dire the situation. Even if there is a glimmer of hope within a dire situation, but ultimately that glimmer is what you focus on and grow into a beam of sunshine. This film has my full appreciation.",Beautiful Boy
188,barneyreidxx,"Sweet, Emotional, Real",7,12 October 2021,"I went into this film with low expectations having read a few poor reviews online but was pleasantly surprised to find a sad, heart wrenching and well made film. Chalamet delivers a fantastic, true to life depiction of a struggling drug addict. He plays it with a Pre use tenderness that allows one to sympathise with his struggles. He well deserved all the awards he got. However I think the under appreciated gem of this film was Carell. He played his role with such subtlety it's easy to forget he's acting. It's yet another example of why comedic actors make for such good serious roles in film. Finally is the sound and visuals. The strange mix of simple shots and odd music creates a strange, dream like effect, almost as if you yourself are on a bad trip. Well worth a watch but be prepared for pretty explicit scenes of drug use and the grotty reality of it all.",Beautiful Boy

Maybe a sentence or 2 of Tweak was in it here and there but it was highly based on David (Beautiful Boy) rather than Nic(Tweak). The movie seems to really ask for the audiences sympathy, where in Tweak Nic doesn't, more so just shares his story as an addict straightforward and raw.

The rinse and repeat cycle many addicts spend their entire life going through, the rehabs that tout success when real results are in the single digits, and the family members that will go to the ends of the earth to help only to realize that they are enabling to name a few. Telling a story about drug addiction that doesn't feel totally foreign to most people has got to be difficult, but I think this film strikes an important balance. Other reviewers have suggested that this enactment isn't nearly bleak enough to represent the real horrors of addiction. I've also seen posts discrediting the movie over some of the privileges the main character has. I disagree with these reviews. This father/son story gets plenty dark and comes based from the real-life memoirs that the father and son both wrote separately.

206,snakekeeper-11956,A frighteningly natural performance,8,21 March 2019,"For the second time in recent weeks, our audience and human emotions are tested by a movie about a teenager, tearing up by drug addiction. While ""Ben is back"" could be described as a family thriller-drama, ""Beautiful boy"" is perceived as a large social project, through which one can and should face the younger generation with addiction problems. Does such a story about a small percentage of society deserve to be voiced in movie theaters? Definitely yes, and this is not only a heart-rending excuse to remove the heartfelt drama. The thought passing through the plot and voiced by the characters themselves makes a disappointing conclusion that the tragedy of one person also destroys the lives of his relatives, friends and even unfamiliar people.If the ""Requiem for a Dream"" was rather a psycho challenge for the viewer, the cinema-grotesque, ""Beautiful boy"" works at a different, less catchy level of getting into the audience consciousness. Almost two hours of viewing pass through one seamless canvas according to your involvement in what is happening. It takes only 20 minutes to stop perceiving the film as an artistic work, and later catch yourself thinking that you are plunged into the story, as if in a reality show. Even the emotional peaks of the tragedy of the main characters do not knock you out of this state of detachment from everything that remains behind the walls of the cinema. You sit on the couch at a support group meeting, tensely peering into the clouded eyes of the enticing teenager, looking away from the scenes with needles piercing the skin.It is not so easy to fit ""Beautiful boy"" into familiar film frames, placing all the obvious features, as on a chessboard, predeterminate in its place. An attempt to fit a film into a classic three-act structure will stumble from a variety of retrospectives, flashbacks, non-linearly submitted scenes. Time after time, our thoughts about how things will get better now are cruelly deceived by the main character. You can evert your eyes from the scene with the needle, but the world does not disappear if you close your eyes, as well as the movie language here, will leave you after watching with a certain aftertaste. At the same time, this very feeling of real history awakens a purely encyclopedic interest to the sensitive topics.Steve Carell has come a long way from the sitcom and ""forty-year-old virgin"" to the status of a sought-after dramatic actor in recent years. His image of the father in the film is frighteningly natural and far from the feigned bold struggle with the problem. It is not the drug killer that walks through his veins, but the tragedy of the son destroys this man from the inside, lowering his voice in the dialogues to a suppressed whisper. You can add the impression of the performer of the role of the son by looking at the interview with the cast. Even leaving the frame of the film, Timothy Shalame frightens by his immersion in the image of a drug addict, at the level of facial expressions, eyes, the manner of talking. Together, the two actors came out deep and, as I wrote above, a frighteningly natural performance, which affected the final quality and perception of the film as a whole.",Beautiful Boy

The chemistry between Steve Carell and Timothee Chalamet here is so strong and wonderful, and I think it is what that makes this movie works so well. The story is a bit nonlinear and a bit awkward for some people, but I personally don't find it hard to watch.My only issue with this movie is that it struggles to find the right personality at the earlier phase. The music choice is a bit off the vibe at some part. For example earlier in the movie when Nic disappeared from the rehab and his dad went out looking for him, and suddenly a Nirvana song came out along with some flashback of them listening to the song in the car, I think it's just a misplaced choice of music and killed the whole vibe of the movie. Not that I hate Nirvana, trust me I love Nirvana and I listened to all their 3 albums. It just doesn't fit the personality of the movie. There are couple more examples but i think I made my point.Regardless of that, it is a wonderful movie, and heartbreaking to watch. It is impactful and I love it.",Beautiful Boy

I really didn't expect this kind of performance from him, he truly turned this into an amazing work of art showing true emotions.

216,Felicia_Voris,You are only as happy as your unhappiest child.,10,14 January 2019,"Beautiful Boy is not an easy movie to watch. This movie is based on the separate memoirs of David and Nic Sheff, telling the story of how the cycle of addiction can destroy a family over years. David is played by Steve Carell. I am amazed at how much I enjoy Steve in dramatic roles; his portrayal of the father who has always been able to solve all of his son's problems is heartbreakingly real. Steve presents David in a way parents know is true- you can only be as happy as your unhappiest child! All the characters in this movie are terrific, with the exception of Nik, played by Timothee Chalamet. As I watched the movie, I kept wanting David to say no to Nik, to stop believing in him. Stop believing the lies of the addict! And each time I would think those thoughts, Timothee's portrayal of Nik kept me wanting to believe him. The movie shows the unbelievable talent Nik was working with, and his earnest attempts to do better for himself and his family. This movie has a run time of two hours. It has been a long time since a movie left me emotionally exhausted (think, The Pursuit of Happyness) and feeling like the run time was twice what I watched. The acting of Steve as well as Timothee, enthralled me to the point I would have sat through four or five hours of the story to find out what happens to the family. It made me cry, watching the cycle of Nik doing well, going back to drugs, doing well, and on and on. The movie does not wrap the story up in a nice, tidy package at the end. Beautiful Boy gives us a hard look at what addiction does to a family, and how a family survives the trauma of addiction.",Beautiful Boy

I saw it, anticipating it ever since summer, and it excelled my expectations. It's a very heartbreaking story and doesn't have many happy moments within it. The performances by Steve and Timothée were phenomenal, everyone did an amazing job alongside them as well. The only reason I give my review a 9/10, I wish they could've contributed more of young Nic, when he actually started getting into drugs and addiction overall, but otherwise, there are no other flaws. I'm hoping this film makes it to the Oscars, and Steve and Timothée claim their awards. See this movie, it's very important, and you will want to hug your family closely after seeing this, no matter their ages.",Beautiful Boy

221,mary28,So much was missing,4,4 February 2019,"Had thought we'd give it a chance after reading a few reviews. We didn't see the high rated film some of you claimed to see. Totally missed the mark on the emotional turmoil the family unit is dragged thru over and over and over again with an addict in it midst. There were no real consequences for Nic's behavior. He stole, lied when confronted and all is forgiven because they didn't want to judge him. That is not real-life. Or I should say, not real for a large majority of families. An argument with the ex on the phone, a very poor attempt of trying tough love, a father making it clear he wants to be a friend rather than a parent and that about covers it. None of us believe this deserve an oscar or an award. at best it is a made for TV movie.",Beautiful Boy
222,The_Mich_,cutting loose,7,19 February 2019,"Many movies can be good, but what really sticks with me are those films that show real life situations and relationships. Where the characters are what give structure to a movie; characters that can show us the complexity of being human, the internal world of our personalities, our strengths and our vulnerabilities.
The acting from steve carell and timothee chalamet is something so great, its heartbreaking. I will never get over the fact that neither of them were nominated for an oscar.
I think the movie as a whole is a bit messy, i got mixed up with the timing. But other than that, this movie holds such an important message. I love the scene where Nick is in a meeting (his dad david is there) and he tells the story of how someone explained to him how whats wrong with him isnt the drugs or booze, but that thats the way he's been dealing or 'treating' his problem. The act of consuming is a symptom, which holds a message of a ghost that i haven't been able to deal with.
On the other hand we see this father, trying to do his best, protecting him, admiring him, loving him more than everything; and thinking that if he is always there for his son, maybe nick will get better. The difficulty of seeing whats right in front of you, the desperation and frustration, the guilt. And finally, he lets nick go, because he realizes that he cant save someone who cant be saved. David puts away his pictures with nic, says goodbye to him because giving up this idea of saving his son is the only way to be a father and husband to the rest of his family. Every decision has an emotional risk or cost.",Beautiful Boy

224,jessiejpb,Liked it a lot more the second time I watched!,8,29 July 2019,"The first time I watched Beautiful Boy I finished it feeling dissatisfied with the portrayal of drug addiction. I felt like it wasn't hard enough or gritty enough and it left me wanting more, but what I didn't take note of until I watched it for the second time (about 5 months later), was that it was actually focusing on how drug addiction is a family disease and how parents need to break the toxic cycle of enabling their children. It portrayed, very realistically, the emotional strain that it can put on families, but especially the parents who desperately try, and ultimately fail, to rescue their children from themselves. It's a perspective that we don't often get to see in depth in addiction movies, and I found it to be very well executed!",Beautiful Boy

This is a powerful story that is carried out to perfection by this cast. There isn't a single wasted scene here in developing each character needed to accurately represent how stories like these impact everyone involved. It's easy to see how this role will start to launch Chalamet into an elite category, specifically off the tail of Call Me By Your Name.With that said, the movie does lack an entertainment aspect that will certainly deter less avid moviegoers. However, it is an excellent character drama that will leave you thinking about the story for some notable time post viewing.",Beautiful Boy

And those aspects hold the film back.,Beautiful Boy
227,charliejwilson17,An Emotional Story That Stays With You,9,6 April 2020,"Beautiful Boy is a film that you will continue to think about long after you have seen it. It is graphic and realistic but never feels forced, and the acting is as good as it gets. Carell and Chalamet both deliver fantastic performances that carry this movie, but that is no knock on the movie.The director of this movie clearly knew that it was a character driven story with the father and son at the center of it. The production was never over the top, and the directing was great in a gentle sort of way. He shot in a way that would allow the actors to really show off their skills and take control of their scenes. There is no fancy editing, no fancy wide shots or camera angles, but assured direction by someone who knew what this film was supposed to be. This is something that I greatly appreciated, because it showed he put himself and his job aside and focused on the best way to tell this emotional story.Now, this should go without saying, but the film is an emotional roller coaster. From the very opening scene an uneasy tone is set that sticks for the entirety of the film. Chalamet's character is so well written and this forces the audience to care about him greatly. We want to see him defeat his demons, but we see how hard he is struggling. Even when the film feels like the narrative has slowed, that tension and uneasiness remains, because they show the horrors of drug use and how difficult it is to overcome something like that. The writers were bold in the sense that they did not hide the disturbing nature of drug use and this can make the movie very uncomfortable at times, but it would extremely irresponsible to not show the true nature of it. It will make audience members scared of ever touching drugs. The cinematography is soft and subtle, and once again this allows a brighter light to be shined on the characters, a decision that does this film a great service. The soundtrack is loud and questionable at times, but overall a fitting one.Carell and Chalamet both deserve Oscar nominations for their work here (granted this review was written in 2020 so I know they didn't which is very tragic and makes the Academy look silly). Carell perfectly plays a father who just loves his son so much and wants the best for him. You can see his heart breaking for his son just through Carell's eyes, which shows how tremendous his performance was. The pain he has suffered is seen through the way he carries himself, and he just looks emotionally drained the entire film. But his love for his son won't allow him to give up, and Carell does an incredible job at displaying that never ending love for his son. Chalamet transforms himself for this role, completely embracing a tormented soul haunted by drugs and the weight of life. Every second that he is on screen it is evident he is suffering. Just through small movements like a twitching hand or wandering eyes, his pain is felt. He realistically portrays addiction, showing how even when you want to get out of it, it so easily pulls you right back in. His discomfort and edginess while sober show the audience how he could believe that drugs are the only things that will give him fulfillment. Carell and Chalamet have amazing chemistry, truly seeming like father and son. Their scenes together are filled with tension and so riveting you can't take your eyes of the screen. They demand your attention. The supporting cast is great as well, all given moments to shine and seizing their moments. There is not one flaw in the acting of this movie.This movie will tear your heart out, but when the credits role you will be glad you saw it and won't be able to help yourself from appreciating the delicate, raw storytelling. You will also have seen two of the greatest performances in recent years.",Beautiful Boy

Indeed, the drug theme might be catchy, film is clearly doing PR to the world-wide problem and rightly so. Steve Carell in serious role has since Dan in real life (2017) proven to me, he can master those and he can master them very well. Timothée.... ah.... what can I say, talent of his kind is born once a generation, in my generation it was just Leonardo di Caprio. As far as the length of the movie is concerned, film was, indeed, a bit on the longish side, but even seemingly long shots did have its reason. The script surprised me couple of times. Where I expected some kind of typical ""hollywoodlike thing"", I was proven wrong and all came at a completely different and unexpected part of scenes as a surprise. Well and the ending - that is somewhat an ungrateful thing. Without giving away any spoliers - all will be wrong - it can be either ""too much Hollywoodlike"" or, on the contrary, ""very little Hollywoodlike"". I think that the script dealt with it in the best possible manner. Who chose the soundtrack must be God. The music intensified the scenes. The only thing that kind of stuck out for me was - the actresses playing the characters on drugs had quite decent make-up and were ""well adjusted"" but Timothée had his flawless, beautiful, alabasterlike skin throughout the whole film :-D Oh well, the beautiful boy will definitely show us what he can do!",Beautiful Boy
231,la_fata_ignorante,Isn't love supposed to be unconditional?,8,8 January 2019,"The story of David Sheff and Nic Sheff, father and son, gets to be on the big screen after they both wrote about what it feels like struggling with loss, despair and failure. Although I didn't read the books - 'Beautiful Boy' by David Sheff and 'Tweak' by Nic - or at least not yet, I'm sure Felix van Groeningen did a great job with his adaptation for the big screen. I trust him with all my heart after seing The Broken Circle Breakdown a couple of years ago. Also, the actors in the leading roles were stunning. I'm in love with Steve Carell since forever - I can't remember a time when I did not love him -, and, like everybody else, I'm starting to get hopelessly obsessed with Timothée Chalamet. Their performances are amazing and could't be happier to see them working together. And now comes the part I didn't get. Isn't love supposed to be unconditional? Especially when it's about parents and their children? I didn't get the feeling that David would give that 'everything' he was talking about when it comes to saving his kid. I mean, how can you say 'no' when your boy asks desperately for help? I understand you may be overwhelmed and aware that you can't help him, but you could always offer support and not hang off the phone. I don't know if that really happened, I should check the books, but that scene blew my mind. That didn't let me click with Steve Carell's character and, somehow, I got the feeling that this movie doesn't give enough time to connect with neither David, or Nic. This being said, I think I might have wanted a film based more on Nic's memoir. I think maybe his point of view would have been more genuine.",Beautiful Boy

This movie goes beautifully beyond the simple narrative of addiction.Beautiful Boy, is utterly enticing because it's portrayal of addiction and those that are affected by it play out as it does in life. Desperate clinging hope switches to calculated distance from the addict. All in the hope that we can help the other.This film won't please the masses necessarily. But it may open the hearts of those that see addicts as disposable, greedy junkies.If nothing else I hope that this movie serves to offer a more sympathetic light on the life of an addict.I have known a good few addicts who didn't make it out alive. I feel this movie may help to see their struggle in a less judgemental light and maybe even encourage support for those that have lost hope.",Beautiful Boy
234,vaniharish-54223,A clear cut reflection of potential altercations in today's world,7,4 April 2019,"Beautiful boy, based on the memoir penned by David Sheff and Nic Sheff, themselves being the protagonists, is a deeply penetrating and insightful record of the miserable and desolating reality among the majority of the budding youth in today's world.Theoretically speaking, no-one is a stranger to the devastating effects engendered by regular use of drugs and alcohol. This movie, in short, does its part in visualising the same.The movie begins as Nic Sheff, portrayed by none other than Timothee Chalamet, a young adult who is at the verge of plunging into the unredeemable world of drugs. Although his father (Steve Carell) does not fail in diagnosing a flinch in his son's lifestyle, his relentless efforts at assuaging the latter's conditions, are seen to go awry multiple times in the due course of the film. At several times the viewers are deluded into believing that our protagonist finally recedes and embraces sober habits, however, our respite will prove to be short lived. Later on after quite a few ups and downs, the movie recedes into a promising epilogue.Barring the esoteric detailing at several points of time and a quite predictable ending, the movie triumphs in conveying a very strong and apposite message to its targeted audience. Besides it is worth mentioning that the performances delivered by its lead cast members, are quite irreplaceable. For instance, Steve Carell, whom we are typically used to see in more frivolous roles, has transcended his popularly perceived limits and proved to be an excellent choice for the delineation of a father in despair. Timothee Chalamet has also executed his task stupendously.Speaking for myself, a little more effort could have been given to the background music, which seemed a little absurd at certain levels. Similarly in the first few minutes of the movie, certain irregularities in the order of story telling could potentially trigger a confusion among the viewers. Barring such negligible glitches, beautiful boy is definitely a must watch for all those who had experienced a grief stricken phase in life, who are currently going through a similar situation, who are at the verge of falling into the pit, or those who know of someone going through hard times, all owing to the tyranny of drugs. The fact that the movie is based on a true story, further helps us identify with and alleviate our situations.",Beautiful Boy

236,ambwrx,Beautiful Boy (2018),8,5 April 2020,"Beautiful Boy is the story of a father (Steve Carell) dealing with the frequent disappearance and drug addiction plaguing his son (Timothy Chalamet). This film is based on the books of father and son David and Nic Scheff.The film shows the desperation of a father to understand why his son is using as many drugs as possible. Carell shows that he can do drama just as well as he can do comedy, and Chalamet's performance shows us why he is going to be one of the best actors of his generation. I also liked the fact that Oscar Winner Timothy Hutton plays a doctor in this film, and although we only get to see him once, it makes us remember his own amazing troubled teen performance in Ordinary People. I also really enjoyed Maura Tierney as the stepmom and Amy Ryan as the younger Scheff's mother.I almost feel like this movie doesn't show us enough of the suffering of a family grieving a child's drug addiction, but I find it is still a well made and well acted drama and one to show to your teenager as an example of the horrifying effects of drugs.",Beautiful Boy
237,ss0187,"Candid, compelling, cathartic cinema",10,18 October 2018,"The best movie I have seen so far in 2018. It is heart-wrenching, compelling, emotionally raw, and authentic. The acting from Timothee Chalamet and Steve Carell is strong and Oscar-worthy. Timothee is proving to be one of the best actors of his generation. It is a no-frills movie that illustrates the struggles and cyclical nature of destructive addiction, relapse, and recovery. It is beautifully directed and poignantly adapted from two memoirs. It also displays the emotional dynamic and turmoil of the father-son bond wonderfully. The cinematography is also top notch and captures the tone of the film. I am honestly baffled by some of the critic reviews. Beautiful Boy deserves a much higher rating. The film is honest and I empathized with the issues because the film explores the pain in such a real way. We witness how the addiction affects the entire family and how average people can be sucked into the black hole that drugs offers. It is relevant in this day and age to show the problems that relatable youth face. In most Hollywood films, we typically see the addiction melodramatically explored with individuals suffering from a specific trauma or living in abject poverty. In this film, we see the torment & despair of addiction powerfully & realistically explored within a middle-class family. Beautiful Boy is a must-see for everyone. It deserves Oscar nominations for Timothee Chalamet, adapted screenplay, cinematography, and directing. The entire cast is exceptional and should receive a SAG ensemble nomination. The movie is so much better than a number of the other acclaimed, flashy Oscar contenders of 2018. Beautiful Boy is candid and naturalistic. Not only does the audience get access to such fine artful filmmaking but also gets served with life lessons. There are a number of tear-jerking scenes and the pathos of it all, hit the core of my soul.",Beautiful Boy

Where to begin....first off there were so many flashbacks in the first half of the movie that I completely lost track of the story (and that's even after being an avid fan of the book , I can only imagine what the normal viewer is suffering through) besides for the fact that there were too many flashbacks , the flashbacks were so different in nature that it totally threw you off! There were flashbacks within flashbacks, flashbacks that only went back a few months , flashbacks that audio began before the actual flashback ......to sum up in one word ....CONFUSING. I know a lot of ppl would berate me for giving an Oscar worthy performance by Steve carrol a 2 but it had nothing to do with him, the movie focuses on the wrong parts of the story l, and the viewer doesn't develop an emotional connection to nick!

The performances are well conceived, with Chalamet delivering another impressive performance. Carell is strong as the role of Nic's dad and delivers a career highlight performance. Groeningen's direction is strong, and choice of style contrasting elements of past euphoria with the lows of drug abuse help enable the audience to feel the impact of addiction.

249,maxiemovies,Chalamet shines but the film itself is luke warm.,5,9 November 2018,"Initially my interest toward this film stemmed from one of the writers, Luke Davies. Luke had previously worked on the screenplay and novel of a film I, and many others, consider a hidden gem, ""Candy"" starring Heath Ledger. Candy shows addiction in raw form, it is haunting; and Davies' writing only complements the exceptional performances from both Ledger and the then newcomer Abbie Cornish.So, given the context, ie. being paired alongside upcoming talent such as Chalamet and van Groeningen as well as a veteran like Carell, it's safe to say I was expecting at least something on a similar scale. Unfortunately, this just wasn't it.The dialogue was clunky and awkward and van Groeningen's editing choices seemed unsure; the flashbacks within the film just didn't work and completely destroyed any kind of narrative or audience/character connection being set-up. It was quite jarring.Carrell is powerful but, ultimately, he doesn't bring anything we haven't seen before to the role of 'fearful father'. The only reason this film is going to be Oscar nominated, and rightly so, is because of Timothee Chalamet's unwavering, intense, heart wrenching portrayal of Nic Sheff; he never misses a beat and allows for a realism to be injected into this story of addiction. If you were in any doubt of Chalamet's destiny to become one of the great actors, he'll shut down all naysaying with this powerhouse of a performance.This film is more of a demonstration as to how good Chalamet is as opposed to what it should have been, a meditation on the struggles of addiction.",Beautiful Boy

I believe that BEAUTIFUL BOY does a great job of defining what is truly like to be an addict. There are no clean and clear lines when you are trying to beat addiction and families that are trying to help an addict are torn between helping that person and the addict needing to make the decision on their own to get better. When you are in the throes of addiction or """"the disease"" you want to stop but feel as if you can't find the power to do so, no matter how many bridges you have burned, people you have hurt or mistakes you have made.I watched the film unfold and as I did, I saw myself in the main character so many times.

As someone whose husband is an addict, this story could not be more real. Some of the lines I've heard verbatim, and watching the parents go through the trauma rang true of my inlaws also. So many lines from the addict though, and particularly the times he went missing, rang so true for me.
One review in the New York Times said it 'glossed over the reality'. No, it showed that ice/meth addiction can hit any family. It can certainly hit a middle/upper class family and the torment of not knowing how to help is so true.After watching the film I read the book and was again moved by the reality it presented

It may explain why the film is centered on the father rather than the boy. In appearance, everything is right in Nic's family, but when one dig a little, one feel something wrong that could explain his inner conflict.Why is Nick taking drugs? Is it an escape that hides the reality of the problems? Why is he lying to his parents about his addiction? Why does he tell them what they want to hear? Does Nick subscribe to the proposed living environment? Is he affected by his parents' divorce? Why did the mother start her life away from him? Why does the father feel close to his boy and does not realize that he is gradually sinking into drugs? Does the father think he has offered everything to get his boy emancipated? Is Nic embarrassed and suffocated by the controlling character of his father? Why does the relationship between Nic and his younger half-brother seem to be one of the most harmonious and sincere?The film has an aspect that could be timeless as to the search for meaning in life from teenagers who do not seem to find themselves in the proposed living environment.

265,dsobski,This movie looked like a solid 7-8 until...,3,13 May 2020,"Until Steve Carrel begins doing research. As soon as this begins the movie turns into a mess. Note that I am not one to usually rate low, but the choices in the movie left me confused. Beginning with Steve Carrel's research we are given a lot of exposition that is not brought up later on. We get a hilariously questionable clip of Steve doing cocaine to understand his son, really?? The use of flashbacks and flash forwards was messy. For example, the story focuses on the relationship between Nick and his father. They struggle with multiple rehabilitation options. This is then contrasted with the introduction of his real mom and a quick flash of over a year of sobriety. Seems to be reached so easily.Moving onto the character of Nick. For a movie like this wouldn't it be a good idea to make the character like able. We are given no backstory as to how this kid started using drugs. All we know is that his parents were divorced, and he dresses goth and listens to metal. Still seemed to come from a loving family, so I would want to know what started this. The responses from Nick on the phone to his sponsor and dad also leave me questioning his character.The last complaint I have is how his dad states that he's giving up, while he does hug him at the end who are we to say that, instantly changes his opinion.What holds this movie at a 2 vs a 1 is the acting, and I was debating that the realism also helped this. If realism was what the director was going for, I think a documentary production would be better. I have more thoughts but it doesn't seem worth it to go on about similar details.",Beautiful Boy

What spoils this movie, IMO, is Maura Tierney.

286,allstarbacon101,"Good, but never really leaves past good",6,12 January 2019,"Honestly, from someone who has struggled with addiction in the past, I found the film to be good. It's a film that I found a level of relatability towards and I'm glad it exists. For the film itself, it doesn't pull anything that's really that extraordinary. It feels like a well written hallmark movie in a sence. It doesn't wow or try to do anything to impress but honestly it doesn't set out to. If might make ya cry it might not. For me the film didn't carry as much emotional weight as I would have liked to. Except for nick and his father no other character seems to be fleshed our. There's two points where the movie would have ended but the film kept going none the less. The film doesn't say anything new nor does it try to. This film probably will hold sole weight for others and if it did for you I'm really glad it did, it just didn't for me. There were some nice shots in the film and both male lead performances do a pretty good job overall",Beautiful Boy
287,maclean161,Moronic failure of a parent ends up with a loser kid.,1,20 January 2019,"If you can stand to watch more than the first half hour, you have more tolerance than me. After watching Steve Carell play a clueless moronic parent who lets his child grow up to be an unrepentant, chronic liar without any sense of responsibility or ability to relate to the real world, the kid does everything he can to avoid life and this ends up being drugs. But it's a movie about the total failure and stupidity of really bad parenting. They tolerate their kid. They don't impose their will on their kid. No wonder he turns out to be such a loser. Too frustrating to watch. 1 out of 10.",Beautiful Boy
288,azerkoculu,"Great acting, ""optimized"" for low-attention span :(",8,20 December 2020,"Good movie and recommended. However, it seems that director had some pressure to make the movie more ""enjoyable"" for people with low attention span. It could have been a masterpiece, if it was slower and going deeper on the suffering of the characters.Steve Carell is one of the best living actors and he literally acts as a mirror in the scenes we're given the chance to watch him. We are given chance to see his great acting for only a few seconds at a time though. In the most important and emotional scene of the movie, all we see is taking down some objects from the wall and it's definitely not a great opportunity for both the actor and the audience.Thanks for making this movie though. The world needs more attempts to reveal the truth. I lived in San Francisco, and it was sad to witness the pain, and the ignorance.Just like books, we need more movies that is not pressured for the attention span of the majority but more demanding from the majority. Give us longer movies. Give us slower movies.",Beautiful Boy

291,jcarrion11,Compelling and Heartbreaking Display of an Epidemic,9,17 November 2018,"As person with a close family member who struggles with drug addiction, this film really hit home for me and I felt a great connection just on that level. Steve Carrell plays a desperate father who is willing to go through Hell and back for his son, and he was able to capture that extremely well. Carrell is a fantastic actor, even though I will always see him as Michael Scott, and I would not be surprised to see him get an Oscar nomination for this performance. Speaking of The Office, Steve Carrell's character's ex-wife is Amy Ryan (aka Holly Flax from The Office). That was an odd casting choice, it took me right out of the movie because of these two actors from an iconic television show.What this movie does well is really get you to care and sympathize with the father, David Sheff, who puts his life and well-being on hold just so he can help his son recover from his addiction. Also, it develops the relationship between David and Nic. You really buy them as father and son and Carrell and Chalamet have really good chemistry together. Chalamet is also fantastic in this film. He was able to capture that isolation and pain that addicts feel and give off, and you really empathize with him. The direction of this movie was pretty well done as well, there's a lot of visual story telling and just overall good camera work that is done here. But the thing that makes this movie work as well as it does, other than the screenplay and direction, is the two leads. Like stated, Carrell really shines here, as well as Chalamet. The pain and suffering between the two actors is so convincing and powerful, so bravo to those two.Now for the not so great stuff. The movie can drag a little at times, some scenes and montages go on for a little long, and while they are trying to develop and show the struggles between the two characters, these scenes, I think, drag the movie a tad. It doesn't bring make the film worse, it's just one of those ""imperfections"". I've seen some reviews on this site complaining about the editing and flashback sequences. I don't necessarily agree with those complains, regarding the flashbacks. I was never confused or lost when these flashbacks were being taken place. The length and lack of white hair in Steve Carrell's beard could give you a pretty good guess. And plus they had an actor for 5 year old Nic, 10-13ish year old Nic and then, finally, adult Nic played by Chalamet. Last thing is the execution of the character of Karen, who is David's current wife. The movie tries to make it seem like Karen loves and cares for Nic, but it's done very glossed over and rushed. There's no scene of just Nic and Karen to build up their relationship, they just kind of expect us to know that there's some sort of connection between those two. Perhaps it was done well in the book, but here's it's done rather poorly.Overall, this a fine movie, with an excellent script and direction, that has two great performances. It's an emotional slow burn, that feels like you're watching real life and a real journey in an addict's life. Personally, having a family member with an addiction problem, it made me cry three separate times in the runtime, just because everything I was watching on screen, I experienced in my real life. It was a fantastic film, that I encourage everybody to see.",Beautiful Boy
292,marytaylor-77988,Disaster of a Movie,2,12 November 2018,"Oh boy... I really wanted to like this movie, but the disjointed, confusing, and out of place elements made it extremely unenjoyable. I will say to begin that both Steve Carell and Timothée Chalamet are two wonderful actors, and did an excellent job working with the joke of a script they were presented with. They did their best to save this movie, but it was a difficult and challenging feat.As many other reviews say, the constant flashbacks in the film proved to cause confusion from the beginning. An actual timeline never seemed to be established, one minute Nic is in rehab, and the next he's at college, and then back in rehab. Huh?Secondly, the writing was extremely sloppy and each scene's dialogue seemed incredibly forced. Even in emotional scenes between Nic and David, it never reached its full potential because of the awkwardness and inauthenticity of the lines. All of the bonds between characters in the film were weak. As an audience member, I never felt the connection between any of the characters because of the way the script was written.I have to mention the music choice. I mean who was in charge of this? There was never a clear tone established through the soundtrack/score - heavy rocky metal music was playing in one emotional scene and then the next featured an opera song. One scene in particular that stands out to me was when David is looking through Nic's drug dream journal, and weird uncomfortable suspense/horror music begins to play. This was so out of place and awkward, I mean, is Nic suddenly a serial killer now and going to appear behind David and murder him?Finally, some scenes just literally did not make any sense. In one scene, David is researching what crystal meth does to a person, trying to understand what it is doing to his son. And then it cuts to a shot of him randomly sitting in his office snorting cocaine? Super weird and random. Also they left many unanswered questions regarding Nic's relationships with his two love interests.Overall, Beautiful Boy had so much potential, and it's unfortunate that I had to write such a negative review. I left the theater feeling like I had wasted 2 hours and dreadfully bored.",Beautiful Boy

2. This movie really shows how distressed and powerless a parent can feel when their child is in pain. You understand that all they can do is give unconditional love and support but that they can't save their child even if they would do anything to.
3. Addiction is a monster but it does not define you, it isnt who you are.

296,Callipygian_Linguist,A sad and well acted rejection of the idea that you can cure people who don't want to be cured'.,9,10 December 2018,"Having never read the book, 'Beautiful Boy' or 'Tweak' and watching the film as part of a mystery screening at my local cinema I did not know what to expect from this film nor even have any idea what it was about. It doesn't grip you with typical Hollywood drama, there's surprisingly few raised voices or dramatic plot twists, rather it continually raises and dashes your hopes, pushing Nic closer to self destruction and David and the Audience further into despair, all the while building up the backstory of the bond between Nic and David.People seem to be critiquing the film on two main points; Skimming over parts of the source material and lack of emotional involvement. I may read the book at some point but it is important to remember that films simply do not have the time and resources necessary to adapt to film faithfully and well a book in it's entirety. As a faithful representation of the source material I do not doubt hat it is lacking in places but as a film representing the hopeless cycle of trying to save someone unwilling to help themselves it succeeds spectacularly.
As for calling the film emotionally uninvolved I think the main problem is that the film is not always explicit in it's representation of people's thoughts and feelings. I personally have little problem with a film using symbolism and cinematography rather than dialogue to convey important information but if that is something you are not used to then the flashbacks can become confusing and there is a lot of detail that can be missed.While I had no idea what to expect I was surprised by this film, it is not a pleasant or light watch, and will likely be uncomfortable for parents but it is superbly acted and truly tragic.",Beautiful Boy
297,melenesalina,a great emotional movie.,8,6 January 2019,I haven't cried like this in a movie in awhile. This has got to be a tough movie for any parent to watch.

298,mapatrick74,A child and mother of 2 addicts,10,7 February 2019,"It took me awhile to watch this film. First, I'm no professional movie critic, but each actor did a very realistic version. It is my life experience twice over. That is what I would call my book, 'Twice Over'.
Watching this, I had flash backs of me screaming back at my son after hearing his appalling physiological and verbal attacks, language and distracting arguments. I've had encounters with my son, unbecoming of myself.This movie also helped me define or articulate the current state I am in emotionally. And have been in for years. That I am grieving tho both my son and mother still live. As neither have yet turned up dead, I'm not officially in morning, but yet....I am morning. Morning the loss of who they both once were and could be again.My personal background: I have few, but fond memories of my mother, loving me, rocking me and singing beautifully. Few sober memories, but I cherish each memory. I have 17 straight sober years of my son.I know my son is using meth (he has still denied this to us), among other drugs and extremely abusive with alcohol. My mother was the same. Miraculously they both live. However, for the first time in my life, I do not know where either are. I know my son lives, because he occassionally talks to one person we know mutually (for now). My mother, I'm actually less sure of. She returned to the streets by choice leaving her home and job April last year. Last word from a ""friend"" saw her was reported in the fall. With her age now, required medications and health concerns, her statistics are expected to finally catch up to her. Odds have always been against her and only due to the families dedication and many miracles, has she lived over 60 years of age now. I am now 44. She had me young. I had my son at 18 myself.I have 3 other younger (now adults, but my son is my oldest) children doing well in life. I was raised by my grandparents, so my childhood somewhat ok, tho....many disruptions, pain, confusion due to my mothers addictions, absence and even painful events when she popped up into our lives. My grandparents did their best to protect me and give me a good upbringing. But, there were times, she had me out on the streets with her, things I saw her do, it is also a miracle I was not raped as a child, abused, or that I live.....my grandparents never knew those things, less was understood in the 70s and 80s and they were naive. When bad things happened during weekend visits with my mom, her and those around her convinced me never to tell anyone or my grandparents will keep me from my mom or police will take me from the whole family.My other 3 children are doing well furthering their education and careers. My home was not allowed to be disrupted when I raised my children. I had already learned a lot, unfortunately my children barely know my mother, their grandmother, but I knew to move far away from all of it, and bring my children up, with out the chaos touching them, but at age appropriate times, told them the truth about my mom. Tried to use her life as example of addiction, its stronghold and that we are genetically prone. I tried to use science too.I grieve them both, my mother and son every day tho they are living. I often feel prepared emotionally to bury one or both of them in close proximity. I just seem to go on, not numb, but not allowing the chaos of it all to affect others that need me or love me.However, initially with my son, my most heart wrenching experiences were watching my son slip away, knowing all to well the world I was loosing him too...I had reacted desperately earlier on. Casing streets with my own gun. A trained Soldier myself, I would have killed someone if I had found him harmed somewhere. Those long days finally broke me. On the last occaasion, as I returned home without my son to my other daughters whom were all frightened for my own saftey or unsure of what awaited me looking for him.
Another time, there was theft in my home while I was in the shower, I almost shot someone I now believe might have been my son, behind a door in self defense. A combination of recently returning from war, news our family addresses and info has been released to ISIS and a son whom left the home with my key and than had his car stolen, with my house key presumably and my address left on mail scattered in his car, I was on high alert remaining armed. When I can hear the break in, I left my shower naked and got my gun & phone. Shaking, I put in the magazine. I was more frightened in my own home, vunerable from my shower, having to reach for a weapon and phone still, than I ever was outside the wire in some of the worst places in Iraq. I never shook like that before when on a mission or during engagements.Still naked and dialing 911, I warned the intruder still downstairs, I am armed and the police are on the way. I heard someone run up the stairs to my door, I was positioned to a side where I was safe from intruder gun fire or weapons, ready to break an arm upon entry to distract and than fire a round in their head to kill. Dispatcher remained on the line on speaker on my bed. I could hear breathing. They backed away, ran down, out the door, closing it behind them or slamming it (which I found odd they thought to shut the door), ran into the woods, to their car and got away only with my great grandmothers silver, before the sheriff ever arrived. It took 18 min for the arrival.When I discovered it was only the silver stolen, which was placed only where we (family) knew and all other specific valuables in sight, easy to grab were untouched....it was at that moment I realized, it was my son or a friend he may have sent, expecting me to be at work and I would have killed him (whomever) if he had opened my door not identifying himself.He never admitted it to this day. I never saw the face of my intruder. But to this day, I can hear the footsteps, coming up the stairs, skipping a couple steps, grabbing my banister to pull their body weight, moving quickly and very familiar to my L shaped stair design, stair landing and directly to my bedroom out of 4 rooms to choose from. Honestly, sounded very similar to all the times my 6' 3"" son did when he often bounded up my stairs, even tho I've asked him not to pull on the banister, and walk quieter when my husband was sleeping. To move quieter to respect others in the home.This movie has stirred up many bad memories, dramatic memories, chaos that does not have common place in my life, but also....my constant favorite memories of him born (he is my first born), born Dec 5th, I decorated the tree all blue bulbs, lights and even tinted blue flocking and danced with him in my arms under the tree. Memories of him walking, running, swings, swimming, bike riding, helping disabled children, cuddling me. Holding my hand in the mall, when I suffered my first major symptoms of my disability. Now towering over me, now capable of caring for me when and if needed.....some memories of his early adulthood were good, but were short lived. I've not seen my son in 2 years. I've not spoken with my son on the phone in almost 1.5 years.The reality of the back and forth of ""getting better"" and cleaning up, were a familiar pattern. During one of his early sober periods, he tested for the Army ASVAB and was found the 2nd highest score in the Nation at that time and was being offered a million dollar position for what at that time was fairly new, our unmanned aircraft and they wanted him in Florida and needed him. He conducted recruit training prior to ship date, went to recruiting station on the regular, was excited, they worked hard to ensure he would succeed, he got invited to new recruiting events that commercialize new citizen Soldiers....than he stopped going. Than the recruiters called me. Than the letter came to discharge him from his obligation and military contract. He never went to his ship date for basic training. And all others events just got worse from that day out. He was so proud of the coin he received, letters of recommemdations....and it was all gone, just a month before his ship date. Those opportunities are now marred from drug related crimes.Ok. So I know this isn't therapy, but I loved writing it and getting it off my chest, to strangers. I needed to better articulate my own thoughts on my private experiences.Whomever read this, sorry it was more personal than a movie review or critique. I know this was not the correct forum. I don't have outlets or programs out where I am. I just have private support that I dont dare innodate with these matters. I'm hanging in. Much else in life to live.",Beautiful Boy

Screen adaptations of books are almost always disappointing, but this one was especially so for this viewer. The book ""Beautiful Boy"" felt so wrenching, deep, authentic. I wonder if the film tried to do too much? Although it touched on a number of important and relevant pieces of the story, it really did not build an emotional connection with viewers. In many of the more difficult scenes, I WANTED to want to cry. But it just wasn't there.I should also say that I've lived in many of these scenes with an addicted loved one. And the depth of the despair just was not palpable, even though I knew what emotion I was EXPECTING to feel. I didn't feel it, and that left me feeling even more hollow than if I hadn't had the actual experience. Did it feel inauthentic? I can't put my finger on exactly what it was.

The flashbacks become jumbled together, and its hard to tell when each scene takes places. I felt like I spent half of the movie trying to piece everything together, that I didn't get to connect with the characters like I wanted to. It's a very ""Vanilla"" portrayal. The main character Nic has a pretty ok life... it was hard to connect with a character who almost has no reason to turn to drugs? As someone who has battled addiction at a young age, I could certainly tell you that his story is a fluke... most, if not all addicts come from broken homes. Also, I find it very odd that people are calling this a ""Sure thing"" for awards season. The film is a C+, B- at best. Timothee Chalamet is good... but in no way is his performance an academy award winning performance... He isn't in it very much, which is disappointing. He spends his 20 minutes crying his eyes out, and that's about it. If he can't win an academy award for CMBYN, one of the GREATEST performances of all time...he certainly isn't going to win one for this. He was constantly over acting.

Felix van Groeningen knows his craft and delivers a movie that portrays a lamented boy and a struggling father - both trying not to lose touch and faith in each other in the face of a personal crisis that affects not only a single family, but addresses a global problem in the bigger picture. Timothée Chalamet and Steve Carell work shockingly well in their roles and constellation as father (David) and son (Nic Sheff).Although the urge for a proper (self) support system is made quite clear, the movie fails to address the reason for drug addiction in the first place, which leaves a stale taste of shallowness. The key message ""drugs destroy not only your own, but the lives of the ones you love too"" in 2019 just doesn't feel up to date anymore - there are frankly much better movies stressing this point, made two or three decades ago. Especially, when considering that the focus on the father and son relationship is per se an extremely powerful vantage point to go much deeper into the psychological background of the characters and their connection.The movie eventually misses the chance to unravel the correlation between a child's behavior and the parents' influence on its development. As in this case, the father lacks to provide true empathy and rather applies pressure to his son while the mother seems to be absent and thus unreliable as an ""attachment figure"" and parental counterpart during the early childhood of Nic. As the psychologist Hans-Joachim Maaz coins it in several of his books, children often face so called ""terror, absence or abuse"" of their parents that will affect their lives in such a way that is in principle well depicted here, i.e. ""father-terror"" and ""mother-absence"" leads to an addictive and ultimately criminal behavior. Nic addresses this feeling once directly by saying that his addiction to alcohol and drugs is not his actual problem, but that the ""black hole"" he feels inside is his real issue.Conclusion: I consider this film absolutely worth watching, especially because of the already mentioned outstanding performances that cannot be denied even though the wonderful score sometimes tries too hard to underline the emotional aspects for my taste. After all, ""Beautiful Boy"" misses the opportunity to look behind the obvious drama, which could have been much more insightful and educational than the otherwise flawless current attempt.",Beautiful Boy
324,Dustin-L-johnson,Eh,5,3 November 2018,"The film was vapid, uncomfortable, and had a wandering milk toast storyline. But there were some positives I took away from the film, mostly targeted at parents: the message about the reality of drug addiction, especially the time it takes between a parent's first hunch that something is wrong and the child getting treatment, the fact that teens lie about drugs, and parents believe them, are all messages I support and make the movie worth seeing. In regard to it's stars, Steve Carell and Timothée Chalamet, I'll be honest, both performances left me questioning the depth of their acting abilities. Even still, one thing is for sure, Timothée Chalamet is unquestionably a beautiful boy (<--- 22 at the time of this writing).",Beautiful Boy

328,britt-rees,A beautiful boy to his beautiful father,7,28 June 2019,"The biggest ""wrong"" with this movie is that it inverts what we expect of it. Something that unfortunately plagues many modern films. A film about a beautiful boy who's life is infiltrated by drugs is less that, and more a film about a father struggling to deal with the loss of his drug-ridden son and the emptiness that leaves in his life. Sure the film can be slow at times, and it's no linear storyline can be rattling and confusing at times (but maybe that choice was made to simulate the rollercoaster of drug addiction) however overall it is a fantastic film that leaves you in a state of emotional questioning. What if that was my son? What went wrong, if anything at all? But most importantly how do we help?",Beautiful Boy

334,daktaristephane,Bollywood feelings,5,24 February 2019,"In case you don't understand the predictable scene, music is reinforcing to caricature the long filmed mimic of the actors. Irritating!

335,tizhashi,Watchable but pretty annoying,4,18 December 2020,"It is a beautiful movie visually with some interesting montages, which are actually a disservice for the actual theme.Yeah, as everyone says, the performances were good. But still, Carell misses the mark in the more intense scenes and Timothy is too charismatic for the role.The message of the movie is not clear at all, it seems more about a self-centered father than the addict son. You really don't know who to sympathize with or what it is trying to say about addiction.
Nic is a rich, white, straight, super privileged guy (not that because of that he couldn't be an addict), but they never give any reason why he became one. There are flashbacks of him smoking pot with his dad and listening to Nirvana, is that supposed to be the explanation? Demonizing pot and punk?
Also, all the female characters are pushed aside, the mother doesn't appear until two thirds into the movie. Even the little sister is always outcasted by the relationship between Nic and Jasper.It's just a self serving movie that takes itself too seriously because of its subject matter. Even when it tried to show the ""ugliness of addiction,"" its need to be beautiful and digestible ruins it.",Beautiful Boy
336,larougenate,Is this movie on Drugs,1,4 November 2018,"I came into this movie with a good attitude, especially for Tinothee Chamelette after his surprisingly good movie, Call Me By Your Name. I unfortunately didn't read the book, but I could easily say that this is one of the worst movies I've ever seen in my entire life.
First of all, why would you call a movie about a drug addict beautiful boy. There was nothing beautiful about it. Movie makes me feel like I'm tripping myself. Timothy wasn't that beautiful.
Second, this movie was supposed to be about Nic (Timothy chamelet) going through his addiction but instead, this movie was 90% about David (Steve Carel) just fiddling around.
Third, there were so many flashbacks; most of which were unnecessary. You had flashbacks of nic when he was 5, 12, 17, whatever; Non of which had anything to do with anything. You also have flashbacks of the family, non of which have nothing to do with nic (who's supposed to be the main character). For example, why would you show us a scene of the younger step siblings of nic going to a recital. It's got nothing to do with the story. You got flashbacks in a flashback.
Fourth, You have the beginning of the audio that's supposed to come from the following scene, but instead placed into the current scene; so we're left with shitty voiceovers,confusing dialogue, and bad lip reading.
Fifth, continuity is all over the place so you're left wondering what's really happening. In one minute you have nic doing drugs wondering how he even got into it, and then the next you see him graduate college without any problem. They show nothing about Nic in rehab or how he got into drugs in the first place, but instead just throw us with more flashbacks about 12 year old nic eating pancakes or going surfing. We know very little about the mother and more about his step siblings.
To all the people behind this movie and in Hollywood, what were you trying to pull here. Were you trying to depict the movie as a sad movie, an adventure or what. What were you trying to do. Because what I saw just looked like a bunch of people jumbling up some random clips together in order to surpass the 2 hour mark (reusing the same shots in some scenes) and to try to make it stick. I don't understand this movie. I don't understand the reasons behind some of the directors decisions. I don't understand the real story behind it. If I could rate it lower I could. Those are 2 hours of my life I'll never get back. Now I need an aspirin.",Beautiful Boy
337,alexandracojocarul,amazing,10,11 April 2020,"Having read the book and loving it, I was very curious to see how they will make the movie and I wasn't disappointed. I loved it. they stuck to the book (even though there were some parts I wished I would have seen on screen too, but hey they covered most of it) and the acting was phenomenal. timothée and steve did such a great job at portraying nic and david sheff that it was very easy to connect with them and feel for them.by the end of the movie I was left feeling empty for some reason and I had an hour long conversation with my parents (who watched the movie with me) about addiction, drugs and recovery and how hard it is to go through something like this. my mom kept saying during the movie ""I have no idea what I would've done if I were in that situation"", so the movie really made me and my parents think about situations like these.overall I just loved it and I have mad respect for nic and david for being brave and sharing their story and also for timothée and steve for successfully portraying them.",Beautiful Boy

344,sindrehaugnes,Heart-throbbing Reality,9,7 April 2020,"This movie really incapsulated in the most real way how addiction of this degree plays out, and uses the most beautiful face to portray it, which i feel is just a way of showing that even the best and most beautiful people with the purest and happiest backgrounds in their life can still go down hill. A perfect execution by Timothée while the acting of Steve Carell feels very flat in the start of the movie, but improves over time and at the end really makes you understand and feel for his character. Over all if you have the heart and imagination to visualise this reality for yourself, which this movie makes you do, then you will feel completely broken.",Beautiful Boy

His portrayal of David an addict going through his demons,hit close to home for me as like my brother he did not come from a broken was filled with love and a stable family yet he fell into this unfortunate disease which sadly I lost him to a few years back. The writing that came from the screen writer was so real and truthful I could hear it like it was my own family saying the words when the fantastic actors brought it to life which at times was hard for me to watch triggering a lot of emotions. The flash backs and style it was filmed was beautiful and easy to follow. Fantastic movie can see the main cast collecting a few trophies for this one.",Beautiful Boy
346,gffoleyy,Timothee is my favorite actor but,6,3 November 2018,"This movie had so many beautiful parts and the story was absolutely heartbreaking, however, I felt many times through the movie that it should've ended way before it actually did. Nic's story broke my heart and my issues with the movie aren't about the screenwriting or plot, but rather the actor chemistry and the cinematography. I felt as though some of the actors in the film didn't click, you just didn't feel their connection as a family. My issues with the cinematography basically stand in the fact that a story this beautiful should have beautiful film. There was ONE shot where I was impressed with the simplistic beauty, which was one of the last ones when Nic was crying in his dads lap outside of the hospital. I just wish the director would have taken a step back and made the movie more atmospheric. I tend to enjoy more artistic film anyway so I am biased, but i just wish a story this serious and heartrenching got its deserved and equality heartrenching camera style.",Beautiful Boy

350,farrellfae,A Must See,10,2 November 2018,"I created an account just to be able to review this movie. It depicts the agony that comes with loving somebody struggling with a substance abuse disorder very well. I didn't know whether to laugh or cry at how eerily similar some of the conversations they were having on screen were to ones I have had with my SO. The scene in which the father is driving around like a maniac in the pouring rain, desperately searching for his son on every street and down every alley, knowing how slim his chances are of actually finding him and yet unable to NOT try hit too close to home.I saw some comments criticizing the movie for choosing to have the son come from a privileged family, citing the fact that most people who struggle with substance abuse come from broken homes. While this was true for my SO, it is important to remember this movie was based on a true story. I honestly think that gives this movie the added benefit of showing people that addiction does not discriminate - it can affect anybody, regardless of socioeconomic status, race, age, gender, or anything else.",Beautiful Boy

Seeing him in this serious heart wrenching performance really made me respect him for his acting ability. He deserves every award he gets for this movie. All the actors were great. The movie's message was intense and accurate and painful and raw. As a nurse we feel helpless with drug addicts too. We are there to save them at that moment but after that passes, if they live, there is no knowing if their lives ever change for the better.

355,joooz,"Raw, effective and heartbreaking",9,25 January 2019,"Before going into an analysis of some minor things, I'd like to confess this: my response to this film was truly visceral. That is to say: I exchanged looks with my brother, squeezed his knee, and wept. I'm not sure what exactly struck a nerve, but the convincing acting (the Office guy and the upcoming Leonardo) and great storytelling must have played their part. This was an emotional trip supported by tremendous music. Some scenes made me slide back and forth in discomfort while my legs twitched in peculiar angles - effective to say the least.Pathos > logos, but here we go: 1) There were two dialogues that felt unsincere and drew me out of the story. 2) I regret the use of Sigur Ros' music for a scene I never associated it with and I hope I won't do so in the future. 3) I might have missed it, but where does Nic's second girlfriend come from? 4) I was convinced the movie was going to finish earlier. This latter part felt as a slight drag and I believe Van Groeningen should have maybe reconsidered things.Overall, this film was a great learning experience about the hurt a drug addiction causes. Or as Spinoza summarized, ""when a man is a prey to his emotions, he is not his own master, but lies at the mercy of fortune.""",Beautiful Boy
