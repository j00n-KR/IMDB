0,TheLittleSongbird,The Not so Magnificent Seven,5,21 November 2017,"A remake of a great film that is a remake of an even greater film (Akira Kurosawa's 'Seven Samurai'), there are worse remakes out there than 2016's 'The Magnificent Seven'. Primarily 'Psycho', 'The Wicker Man', 'Rollerball', 'Ghostbusters' and 'Stepford Wives'.'The Magnificent Seven' has its strengths but fails to live up to its title and one does question the point of it. It is well made visually, with an atmospherically gritty look and an evocative setting. Some of the action excites and the direction has a dark grit that is typical of Antoine Fuqua. While it is nowhere near as unforgettable or as iconic as one of film's all time great scores, James Horner's score here is demonstrative of what a great talent he was and how his tragic far too early death is still a sad loss.Casting is very variable, some of the acting is very good, some of it doesn't work. The best performances come from Denzel Washington, charismatic as ever, Ethan Hawke excelling in an atypical role and Haley Bennett mixing toughness and vulnerability adeptly. The most interesting character relationship is between Washington and Hawke and gives the film the few glimpses of realism and substance. Lee Byung-hun is also good fun.Others don't fare so well, not helped by that most of the characters are not that interesting and sketchily developed. Didn't think either Chris Pratt or Vincent D'Onofrio, both decent and more in other things, fitted particularly well, Pratt especially jarred and his humorous lines lack wit and don't gel. Faring the worst is Peter Sarsgaard, who just isn't sinister or intense enough, even in a severely underwritten role he looks like he's sleepwalking.While there's a lot of blood and violence, there is little soul or heart underneath and some of it is gratuitous. The dialogue is awkward, particularly the humour which falls flat and often feels misplaced. The story suffers from an overlong length, a sluggish pace, a lack of tension or suspense and heavy-handed and pointless political elements. Won't carp about the political correctness like some have but it doesn't add anything. The illogical and anaemic ending underwhelms drastically as well.In summary, has its strengths but not so magnificent and one does question the point of it. 5/10 Bethany Cox",The Magnificent Seven
1,bkoganbing,"Another job, another 7",7,4 July 2019,"The only thing connecting this film with the original masterpiece from John Sturges is that theme which opens and closes this version of The Magnificent Seven. Other than that it's a different cause and a different seven.Denzel Washington heads this group of denizens of the west, some no better than
they ought be. some a lot worse. This is a good mix which also consists of Chris
Pratt, Ethan Hawke, Vincent D'Onofrio, Byung Han Lee, Manuel Garcia Rulfo and
Martin Sensmeier.Recent widow Haley Bennett recruits Washington to in turn recruit some others. The Calvera of this version is industrialist Peter Sarsgard who has hired
an army and can and does hire more as the need arises.The climax is a long one and looks more like a military battle than some outlaws running amuck. And unlike the 1960 version Washington and Sarsgard have some history.This Magnificent Seven can stand on its own and it's got action aplenty. But
it doesn't come near what John Sturges and also Akira Kurosawa did.",The Magnificent Seven
2,Leofwine_draca,Much better than expected,7,15 April 2017,"I had no problem with the John Sturges MAGNIFICENT SEVEN being remade; after all, the original itself was a remake of Kurosawa's SEVEN SAMURAI, and enough time has passed for a remake to be viable for a new generation. The good news is that this version defies expectations and is an engaging, often gripping western made with a decent budget and plenty of well-shot action to recommend it. I've not seen many of Antoine Fuqua's movies, but his handling of the stylistics and the dominant action makes this film a delight to watch.The story is simplistic enough and despite the two and a quarter hour running time it never feels padded or slow. The cast can't hope to hold a candle to the original movie's, but the reliable Denzel Washington holds things together pretty well and the diverse ethnicities of the seven is a nice touch. Highlights include Vincent D'Onofrio's hulking bear trapper, Lee Byung-hun's slick knife-thrower, and Martin Sensmeier's bad-ass Native American. The only misstep is the casting of the overrated Chris Pratt in the Steve McQueen role; he's consistently unfunny in the part.The film is dominated by two big action scenes, the first a small-scale skirmish at the halfway mark and the last an endless battle sequence at the climax. Both are shot very well with the violence hard-hitting despite the family-friendly rating. It says something that the action remains fresh and exciting throughout, never repetitive or padded. For these reasons I give THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN a thumbs-up as a pleasant surprise of a movie.",The Magnificent Seven
3,SnoopyStyle,rework more than renew,6,3 December 2016,"It's 1879 Rose Creek. Robber baron Bartholomew Bogue (Peter Sarsgaard) with his private army is driving out the town's gold-mining folks. With the local sheriff bought, he burns down the church and murders any opposition. Emma Cullen (Haley Bennett) seeks justice for her husband's murder. She travels with Teddy Q to Amador City and convinces warrant officer Sam Chisholm (Denzel Washington) to help. They recruit gambler Josh Faraday (Chris Pratt), sniper Goodnight Robicheaux (Ethan Hawke), knife fighter Billy Rocks (Lee Byung-hun), mountain man Jack Horne (Vincent D'Onofrio), Comanche Red Harvest (Martin Sensmeier), and Mexican outlaw Vasquez (Manuel Garcia-Rulfo) to organize the town against Bogue.I'm trying to figure out why this isn't as magnificent as I wanted. The cast is filled with top level talents. Antoine Fuqua is great at handling action and dark material. This should be a superb sandbox to play with. Nothing is inherently bad. Everything works to a certain extend. Maybe the expectation is too high. I liked cold-blooded Sarsgaard blowing into town and killing the lead character right away. Pratt should have continued that cold-bloodedness by killing the other brother. There is a sense of a copy of old Hollywood westerns which keeps this from being better. This feels like play-acting. None more so than Haley Bennett who has limited facial range. D'Onofrio's doing something weird. This doesn't push the envelop or inject anything new to justify a reboot of this old cinematic franchise. The final act has plenty of fun high-energy action. The main thing that bugged me is some of the missing preparations. One would expect each building to be barricaded and piled high with dirt to make them fortresses. One would expect more for a week. I understand that Hollywood doesn't trip horses anymore but maybe CGI could have been used. It just seems like everybody had fun playing around but it isn't much more than that.",The Magnificent Seven
4,Horst_In_Translation,"Not a magnificent film, but a fairly decent one",6,25 September 2016,"""The Magnificent Seven"" is an American English-language film from this year and the title already tells you that it is a remake of the 1960 western classic with the same name and at the same time also a remake of the Kurosawa film ""Seven Samurai"" from another six years earlier. At over 2 hours and 10 minutes, this is a pretty long movie. The director here is Antoine Fuqua and the two writers are Richard Wenk (worked with Fuqua before) and Nic Pizzolatto (2-time Emmy nominee for ""True Detective""). Fuqua has worked with actor Denzel Washington on many occasions (one of them being Washington's Oscar-winning turn in ""Training Day""), so it's probably no surprise that the two are reunited in here once again. Also in it is Ethan Hawke, Washington's co-lead in the aforementioned ""Training Day"". Other known names in the cast include Chris Pratt, very big star right now, Peter Sarsgaard (plays the main villain, I found him nothing special, but maybe that was the point to show that he was bad, not some kind of super-villain), Cam Gigandet, Vincent D'Onofrio (loved his dying scene, he was the one sitting down like an Indian, not the one who killed him), Luke Grimes, Haley Bennett and a couple more names you may have come across in other projects.I personally enjoyed this film for the most part I must say. I am writing this review as somebody who has not (yet) seen the other two films I mentioned earlier. And maybe that's also what helped me in appreciating this film. It is the story of a man of the law who summons a group of pretty unusual (anti)heroes to protect a village from a violent criminal who intends to exploit everybody living there. The story is pretty simple, but I would say it was well-done. I especially liked the first 45-50 minutes or so when all the characters were introduced and this was probably the best part of the film. With so many characters in here, it is sometimes impossible to do justice to all of them in terms of presenting them to the audience and giving everybody their fair share of screen time, but I felt Fuqua did a good job overall. Maybe the Hispanic guy could have gotten a bit more. He was maybe the least interesting of the bunch to me. Now I already mentioned a Hispanic character and every (Black) actor in Hollywood complaining about lack of diversity really needs to see this film. Hispanics, Asians, Blacks and even Native Americans are represented in the cast here as part of the seven protagonists. This is what equality looks like. It also involves all kinds of other groups besides African-Americans, which is frequently forgotten because they do not complain constantly and loudly about how unfair the industry is.Anyway, back to this film: While I also thought Hawke's character was pretty interesting with his background and he is certainly giving one of the best performances in here, I still must give the edge to D'Onofrio for my favorite performance. I was delighted to see him in here as I always loved him on ""Criminal Intent"". His role of a huge gutsy fighter character, who is at the same time very devoted to the Lord, stays memorable for me. Also one of the finest comedic moments (somebody else saying he'd make a great rug) is entirely based on him. Speaking about comedy, there is a lot in here. Characters like Hawke's and mostly Pratt's of course bring comic relief sometimes, while Washington's and Sensmeier's for example are all about the drama. Yes there are a couple weak moments in here too, for example the inclusion of Bennett's character felt to me only to have at least one female in there as she does not really add anything. Or sometimes, it gets too stereotypical for a western I must say. But still, the positive outweighs the negative and it's nice to see a new (even if based on old material) western film from time to time. People should not constantly complain about old remakes being turned into new movies. If they turn out as nicely as this one here, then it's really good that they have been re-made and if not, at least they make new generations curious about old classics. I think you should check out Fuqua's work here. It's one of the best 2016 films I have seen by now (even if it is a pretty weak year so far) and you don't want to miss out if you like western movies. Thumbs up!",The Magnificent Seven
5,Prismark10,Straight shooters,6,4 February 2019,"Antoine Fuqua goes for a gritty actioned packed remake with some smooth actors.Set in 1879. Land baron Bartholomew Bogue (Peter Sarsgaard) and his group of hired help have become rich by driving out or killing homesteaders.The people of Rose Creek have had enough of this bully. Emma Cullen (Haley Bennett) persuades Sam Chisholm (Denzel Washington) to help get rid off Bogue. It takes some persuasion and Chisholm has had a past run in with Bogue.Chisholm recruits roguish gambler Josh Faraday (Chris Pratt.) Sharpshooter Goodnight Robicheaux (Ethan Hawke) lacks confidence with his aim. His friend Billy Rocks (Lee Byung-hun) is the knifeman. The Mexican outlaw Vasquez (Manuel Garcia-Rulfo) does not have a German accent. Jack Horne (Vincent D'Onofrio) is a bear of a mountain man. Comanche Red Harvest (Martin Sensmeier) brings his arrow game.This is a modern meat and potatoes western. Once the seven players are established, they train the townsfolk, give some stirring speeches and it is on to the showdown.The final battle is well staged and Sarsgaard is having a hoot as the villain. It is both silly and entertaining at the same time.Those who think the casting is political correctness gone mad. The John Sturges version had the Russian-Mongolian, Yul Brynner as the lead.",The Magnificent Seven
6,nogodnomasters,I seek righteousness but will settle for revenge,10,23 September 2017,"This is for the 2016 film. I am saying this because Amazon has a way of combining film reviews with the same title.The beginning of the film starts off with the conflict: Evil frackers, er ah miners poisoning the water for the farmers. They are lead by robber baron Bartholomew Bogue (Peter Sarsgaard) who gives us an early speech...America=democracy=capitalism=God...which is the limit of subliminal political message. After killing a few farmers, widow Cullen (Haley Bennett) seeks out help. Chisolm (Denzel Washington) agrees and assembles a group of skilled killers to go up against Bogue's army of men.The plot is rather a simple western formula. In this case it is the characters that made the film worth watching. Personally I would have preferred a flamboyant Samuel L. Jackson type quoting Isiah over the more classy Denzel, but that is just me. Film had a few memorable lines and scenes. A must for western fans.Guide: No swearing, sex, or nudity.",The Magnificent Seven
7,kosmasp,Update,6,6 June 2017,"Obviously we have a very skilled director at work and some very fine actors here too. One of the main ""stars"" of the original though was the music. And while watching it the first time, I could only distinguish the title song once during the movie. A friend of mine who watched it several times confirmed though that the theme was woven into it more than that, just a bit more subtle, than I personally would like.Then again, when the music hits you (for the second time) during the credits, it's something that may give you goosebumps. Especially if you are aware of the original movie and soundtrack. Having said all that, the movie has many different characters, all helping out for various reasons, all in different stages of their lives. Politically correct when it comes to having cowboys from different backgrounds then.The action is very well shot and the theme still works more than neatly. A good old western then .. just new",The Magnificent Seven
8,classicsoncall,"""We go to fight wicked men. Probably we all die"".",10,24 September 2016,"Had I known how long the epic battle that closes the story would have been I would have put a clock to it. Easily the longest gunfight in any Western I've ever seen, rivaling even some of the best war movies, and that's saying something. Next time out I'll do just that.The inevitable comparisons to the original 1960 Western is something most viewers will make if they've seen both. I'll probably be in the minority here but I think this remake is superior, at least from such perspectives as cinematography, action and reinvention of the characters. Only four of the principals here directly parallel their earlier counterparts; Denzel Washington in the Yul Brynner role, Chris Pratt in for Steve McQueen, Byung-hun Lee going one up on knife thrower James Coburn, and this last one a bit of stretch, Ethan Hawke subbing for Robert Vaughan. The rest of the bunch are interesting, new interpretations of the Seven Samurai characters originally conceived by Akira Kurosawa.I actually got a chuckle from one reviewer on this board who states that Chris Pratt doesn't have the star power of Steve McQueen. For the record, Steve McQueen didn't have the star power of Steve McQueen when he made the original picture. He had just been released from his Four Star TV contract making ""Wanted:Dead or Alive"" so he could appear in movies. To draw attention to himself and irk top billed Brynner, he embellished his character Vin by ad-libbing gestures like flipping a coin, fussing with his Stetson and whistling through his teeth. It served it's purpose to put him on a more equal footing with Brynner's character.You didn't really have that here. Denzel Washington maintains his stature as leader of the outlaw good guys the entire time. He establishes his character early when Emma Cullen (Haley Bennett) attempts to hire his services with what she could manage to scrape up from the villagers of Rose Creek. Had he been a true mercenary, Sam Chisolm (Washington) wouldn't have responded the way he did - ""I want a lot for my work, but never everything"".Besides the obvious tribute to 1960's ""The Magnificent Seven"", I couldn't help but make the comparison as well to 1973's ""High Plains Drifter"", in regard to Chisolm's plan for the villagers to prepare and train for the defense of their town, the same as Eastwood's Stranger. The idea for a battle trench looked like it might have been inspired by the 1972 sequel ""The Magnificent Seven Ride"" with Lee van Cleef at the helm replacing Brynner as the Seven leader Chris.One of the things that really made the picture for me were the inclusion of characters Jack Horn and the Comanche Red Harvest. Vincent D'Onofrio was just a sketch as his character Horn, a veritable 'bear in people's clothes', as Faraday (Pratt) would put it. Newcomer Martin Sensmeier brought a silent, regal bearing to his Native American character, and I thought his was the most creative of the characterizations. The other notables included Haley Bennett's Emma, who in another director's re-imagining might have been part of The Seven, and Peter Sarsgaard as the villainous Bartholomew Bogue. My best takeaway quote in the movie came from Sam Chisolm, opining on the consequences of the Civil War and refusing to look back - ""What we lost in the fire, we'll find in the ashes"". Or in the defense of Rose Creek no matter the consequences. Ultimately, it was magnificent.",The Magnificent Seven
9,lee_eisenberg,I expected a shoot-'em-up movie and got one,5,26 December 2016,"""The Magnificent Seven"" is a remake of a 1960 movie, which itself was a remake of Akira Kurosawa's ""Seven Samurai"". With this movie I expected a shoot-'em-up movie, and I wasn't disappointed. A major difference between this one and the original is that the septet is ethnically diverse (although that would've been unlikely in 1879). I read that Tom Cruise was considered for a role. It's a good thing that they didn't cast him; the movie would've been all about him, as opposed to the story. As it stands, there's plenty of emphasis on the story.I guess that westerns have made a sort of comeback in the 21st century, with Quentin Tarantino's ""Django Unchained"" and ""Hateful Eight"", as well as Kelly Reichardt's ""Meek's Cutoff"". But even so, ""The Magnificent Seven"" comes across as a wasted effort. Aside from the fact that anyone who's seen the original knows what happens, most of the characters aren't that interesting. Denzel Washington is forceful as the leader of the seven, but I particularly liked Chris Pratt's gambler.In the end, it's not a terrible movie, just not anything great. The best version really is Kurosawa's movie.",The Magnificent Seven
10,jboothmillard,The Magnificent Seven,6,25 September 2016,"The original 1960 version, which was a remake of the Japanese classic Seven Samurai, is a fantastic film, I was surprised to find out it via a poster that it was going to be remade, it had an impressive cast, so I hoped for the best, directed by Antoine Faqua (Training Day, Olympus Has Fallen, The Equalizer). Basically set in the 1870s, the mining town of Rose Creek is under the deadly control of corrupt industrialist Bartholomew Bogue (Peter Sarsgaard), a group of locals, led by Matthew Cullen (Matt Bomer), attempt to stand up to him, Bogue slaughters them. Cullen's wife Emma (Haley Bennett) and her friend Teddy Q (Luke Grimes) ride to the nearest town in search of help, they find bounty hunter Sam Chisolm (Denzel Washington), he initially turns down their offer for everything their town can offer, but changes his mind hearing it is Bogue. Chisolm sets out to recruit other gunslingers who can help, he finds six other men: gambler Josh Faraday (Chris Pratt), sharpshooter Goodnight Robicheaux (Ethan Hawke), knife-wielding assassin Billy Rocks (Terminator Genisys's Byung-hun Lee), notorious Mexican outlaw Vasquez (Manuel Garcia-Rulfo), God-fearing skilled tracker Jack Horne (Vincent D'Onofrio), and Comanche warrior Red Harvest (Martin Sensmeier). The seven men arrive at Rose Creek, they engage in a gunfight with Bogue's enforcer McCann (Cam Gigandet) and his men, they drive them away and warn them to leave the town alone. They determine Bogue and his forces will return in a week, so the seven and Cullen train the townspeople to fight against the oncoming army, Robicheaux is haunted by the horrors of the Civil War and fears the people will be massacred, Cullen replaces him when he abandons them. Bogue and his forces arrive and attack the town, but the townspeople ambush them, with traps set up and their newfound gun skills, a shootout ensues, during which Robicheaux returns, Vasquez kills McCann, Bogue's Comanche assassin Denali (Jonathan Joss) kills Horne, and Denali is later killed by Red Harvest. Bogue then unveils his secret weapon, a Gatling gun, which kills numerous innocent people, the seven men realise they are outgunned by the bandits, the townspeople are driven away and they mount their last stand. Robicheaux and Rocks are killed when the Gatling gun is fired for a second round, Faraday approaches the weapon and is shot at numerous times, but in his final moments sacrifices himself to destroy the gun and the rest of Bogue's men. Bogue enters the town, where Chisolm confronts him, he reveals that his mother and sisters were raped and murdered several years ago in a raid by Bogue and his men, the two engage in a gunfight, Bogue is disarmed by Chisolm, he tries to reach for a hidden gun in his ankle holster, but Cullen fatally shoots him. Following the battle, Faraday, Robicheaux, Rocks and Horne are honoured as heroes by the people and buried in Rose Creek, while Chisolm, Vasquez and Red Harvest ride away, with Cullen remarking they are heroic legends. Also starring Jonathan Joss as Denali, Sean Bridgers as Fanning and Billy Slaughter as Josiah. The seven men, including Washington, Pratt, Hawke and D'Onofrio are all well suited to their parts, Sarsgaard is a good nasty villain, and Bennett does well in her moments, the original relied on a well- written script and sweeping action scenes, this reboot sticks with the same premise, you have to wait until the end credits for the famous Elmer Bernstein theme tune, but you get to know the characters well, and the explosive action scenes are the most exciting, overall it is a well-crafted and most watchable western. Good!",The Magnificent Seven
11,ma-cortes,Decent remake about some villagers who hire tough gunslingers to organize the defense their village against a ruthless owner,7,19 October 2016,"This is an acceptable version to superior and enduringly popular film , ¨The Magnificent seven¨(1960) . Enjoyable remake to the classic ¨Magnificent seven¨ is well played by Denzel Washington as a brave gunfighter named Chisolm (Denzel's first western film) who along with Faraday (Chris Pratt's first Western movie) , and their group (Ethan Hawke , Vincent D'Onofrio , Byung-Hun Lee , Manuel Garcia-Rulfo , Martin Sensmeier) set off in rescue some besieged villagers .

As Chris and his buddies , each of whom comes for a different reason , must free a village attacked by heinous outlaws who are devastating the small location . All of them get a chance to redeem themselves . Later on , the group develops a plan to secure the villagers defend it against enemy attack .Chisholm character was compellingly played by Denzel Washington , previously played by Yul Brynner , as Chris , in two occasions and one performed by Lee Van Cleef and George Kennedy . Denzel as a two-fisted bounty hunter is very good . Producer Walter Mirisch had the idea of doing a Western adaptation of Akira Kurosawa's classic , The seven Samurais , but this time performed in the main role by an African-American . The film reunites Denzel Washington with Ethan Hawke and Antoine Faqua whom Washington had worked with on Training Day (2001) , Hawke co-starred in Brooklyn's finest (2009), and Washington starred in The Equalizer (2014) . The story is classic and traditional , following its interesting premise in subsequent sequels , including customary misfit band formed by an eclectic gang with diverse characters as well as speciality . The film gets Western action , exciting riding , shootouts , it's fun and entertaining , although nothing new , being a remake from a famous Japanese picture , but displays a slight as well as violent style . The movie contains some moment of violence and even touching on the relationships between the villagers and the Magnificent . Walter Bernstein did the original adaptation of Akira Kurosawa's film , The seven Samurais , but it wasn't used ; in this retelling Nic Pizzolatto and Richard Wenk -taking parts here and there- wrote the screenplay that is substantially what you see on screen . Here appear several secondary actors who give adequate interpretations , such as : Haley Bennett , Cam Gigandet , Matt Bomer , Luke Grimes , William Lee Scott , among others . In addition , being one of the few Western movies where an actor's ethnicity matches their character's , as 'Martin Sensmeier' is Native Alaskan (Tlingit) and Manuel Garcia-Rulfo was born in Guadalajara, Mexico . It packs a colorful and evocative cinematography by Mario Fiore . Thrilling and exciting musical score by recently deceased James Horner , in fact this was James Horner's final composition before his death . He had previously composed the soundtrack of Battle Beyond The Stars (1980) which was a futuristic remake of Seven Samurai (1954) , which The Magnificent Seven (1960) was also a remake . The theme song from the original Magnificent Seven (1960) by Elmer Bernstein being played during the end credits . Walter Mirish, the executive producer of this film , and one of the most successful independent film producers in Hollywood in the 1960s , was already involved in the previous feature : Magnificent Seven , back in 1960 . Many decades after its release , Mirisch still holds The magnificent Seven in high regard . This John Sturges film (196o) was starred by Yul Brynner , Steve MacQueen , Charles Bronson , Rovert Vaughn , Brad Dexter , is equally remake of ¨The seven samurais¨ (Akira Kurosawa) starred by Toshiro Miphune . After that , followed ¨The return of the seven¨ (Burt Kennedy , 1966), again with Yul Brynner with other surviving members of The Seven as Jordan Christopher , Claude Akins , Robert Fuller , Julian Mateos , Emilio Fernandez , Rodolfo Acosta . It was followed by ¨Guns of the magnificent seven¨ (Paul Wendkos,1969) with George Kennedy as Chris , James Whitmore , Monte Markham , Reni Santoni , Bernie Casey and Joe Don Baker and finally ¨The Magnificent seven ride¨ by George McCowan with Lee Van Cleef as Chris , James B. Sikking , Ralph Waite , William Lucking , and continued with a TV series and a Television movie realized in 1998 , being also produced by Walter Mirish , as usual . The motion picture was stunningly directed directed by Antonie Fuqua . This good Western is a Denzel Washington vehicle , if you like his particular performance , you'll enjoy this one .",The Magnificent Seven
12,Coventry,"The ""Magnificent"" part is very, very debatable",3,5 September 2018,"As well as every normal male (or female, for that matter) film buff, I'm a tremendous fan of the 1960 Western classic ""The Magnificent Seven"". I honestly don't think you can have anything against that film, and you can't even object to the idea of a remake, since the original itself is already a remake of Akira Kurasawa's landmark ""Seven Samurai"". So here I was looking forward to Antoine Fuqua's version, albeit with reasonably low expectations; - just a good two hours of undemanding but exciting gunslinger entertainment! What a major disappointment! ""The Magnificent Seven"" isn't the least bit spectacular or memorable, it's just plain boring and inferior on every possible level. Although I tried hard not to compare, it's just inescapably evident that Hollywood can't assemble a kick-ass ensemble cast anymore like they could in 1960. How on earth do you recast icons like Yul Brunner, Steven McQueen, Charles Bronson and James Coburn? With Denzel Washington? He's okay, I guess. Chris Pratt? Meh! Ethan Hawke? No way! Vincent D'Onofrio? What the hell! The painful truth is that not a single character of the 2016-version deserves to even stand in the shadows of the 1960-version protagonists. That goes for the villainous characters as well, by the way, since Peter Sarsgaard isn't exactly menacing as the supposedly merciless and megalomaniac landowner Bartholomew Bogue. Heck, his minions even must do stuff like spit chewing tobacco on the church's floor to emphasize just how evil they are. Oh, and don't even get me started on how obviously the script is politically correct. Lame!",The Magnificent Seven

Eli Wallach, Charles Bronson and James Coburn. Antione Fuqua directs this two plus hour shoot 'em up. Some say a gimmicky remake, while others call it a kick-ass instant classic. A multicultural cast and a sometime bit juggled script full of emotion and exuberance. Rose Creek is a small town that is envisioned to grow into something huge by megalomaniac Bartholomew Bogue (Peter Sarsgaard), who is buying up land and mining it for gold. He is callous and sadistic and finally the town has had enough, but only one person has the ""stones"" to hire some guns to go against Bogue. After watching her husband be gunned down in front of the whole town, the winsome Emma Cullen (Haley Bennett) gets a reply from her ad from black bounty hunter Sam Chisolm (Denzel Washington). Chisolm will gather a diverse and motley crew to take up the fight against the ruthless tyrant Bogue. There is Goodnight Robicheaux (Ethan Hawke), a Confederate sharpshooter; gambler Josh Faraday (Chris Pratt); a Korean knife expert (Byung-hun Lee); a Texican (Manuel Garcia-Ruflo); a Comanche archer (Martin Sensmeier) and mountain man Jack Horne (Vincent D'Onofrio). These seven will try to teach cowardly townsfolk to shoot and help defend their town against Bogue and his army of capitalistic minions. Plenty of gunfire, precision arrows and slick knife play. Loud and enough action to keep your attention. There is some fun and life lessons to be had. Sarsgaard made for a great villain to hate. I really got a kick out of D'Onofrio and wasn't impressed as much by macho two-gun wielding Washington as I was with Miss Bennett. No doubt, this is a very good movie.

Any number of these ""tagged classics"" have been and will become viable for remake - reboot - reimaging for newer audiences. It's here, it happens and really there's nothing we can do about it but moan amongst ourselves. John Sturges' 1960 The Magnificent Seven (itself a remake of Kurosawa pic Yojimbo) is a much loved film, and not just in Western lovers circles, it's a film that non Western fans are known to enjoy - and rightly so, it deserves its place as a ""tagged classic"" and still enthrals over 50 years since its release. So the big studio big wigs and Antoine Fuqua were taking a major gamble remaking a classic remake with their own remake!Undeniably the shadows loom large over the 2016 version, so much weight of expectation, in fact to some it was a stinker of a film even before it was released! Well, as those who have seen it will attest, both the fans and the dissenters, it hasn't raised the bar for the ""Seven"" formula, but, and this is very key here, the makers wasn't setting out to make a film that down the line would be a perceived a ""tagged classic"", and this is evident in the ream of extras available on the Blu-ray releases. They achieved what they set out to do, to make a blunderbuss Oater for the modern era to sample, and they have done it with much love, much cool and lashings of technical greatness. Add in a cast clearly enjoying themselves and not letting anyone down, and it's a tasty plate of beans.Fuqua updates things by having his seven as a row of differing ethnicities, which works a treat, and crucially he and his writers are respectful of those characterisations, even if a bit more fleshing out wouldn't have gone amiss. Yet nothing is at a cost to honouring the great Westerns of old. Beautiful landscapes envelope the players, the musical score bouncing around man and nature with homaged sweetness. There's closeups, silhouetted slices of panache, superb stunt work (man and beast), glorious set design, and then there's the action. The fight sequences are excellently constructed, a feast for the eyes and ears, death and slaughter unfurled in brutal but hunger appeasing strokes. There's comic relief about the place, and while much of the dialogue wouldn't have the great poets of yore troubled, there is deepness to be found. Intelligence, too, the addition of PTSD to one of the main players is a notable piece of worth, while how wonderful to find a Western lady character of great substance (Bennett excellent), so good in fact she could have been one of the seven!It's a bare bones story, with a pointless motive revelation tagged on for the finale, while some anachronisms will irritate those bothered by such. But if you are able to judge it on its own terms, as a Western entertainment for this era, and to accept it isn't trying to outdo the source of its inspiration, then a good time can readily be had. 8/10",The Magnificent Seven

16,CinemaSerf,"Magnificent is a bit optimistic, maybe more modest....",7,12 April 2020,"This is certainly a far cry from the original, but I think it has enough distinctive differences to merit not just being considered as a straight rip off. The bandits have been superseded by a greedy expansionist businessman; the prey are now ordinary working American citizens and the gang recruited to come to their aid a mix of the good, the bad, the ugly - and the funny. Denzel Washington is the Yul Brynner character and Ethan Hawke has shades of Robert Vaughn's character from the 1960 version, but otherwise the characterisations are largely different. The story to search for the seven takes an age - peppered with some rather mundane mini-plots that don't quite catch fire, and the overall pace of the film - aside from perhaps the last quite exciting 20 minutes, is pretty slow. Chris Pratt steals this as the charismatic ""Josh""; Byung-hun Lee has quite a bit of fun with his lethal bow and arrow and the dialogue is occasionally quite slick and pithy. As remakes go, it is perfectly watchable and although they certainly don't gel nearly as well as the original team, they still make for a decent enough updated western adventure.",The Magnificent Seven
17,zardoz-13,"A Blistering, Bullet-Riddled, But Bloodless Remake",8,24 September 2016,"""Training Day"" director Antoine Fuqua's bloodless, bullet-riddled remake of the classic western ""The Magnificent Seven"" (1960) lacks both its prestigious predecessor's ultra-cool pugnacity under fire and its complex character development. Nevertheless, while it doesn't eclipse the first-class Yul Brynner & Steve McQueen shoot'em up, neither does the new ""Seven"" embarrass itself as some remakes such as ""Ben-Hur."" Loaded for bear, with a triple-digit body count, and rawhide performances by Denzel Washington, Chris Pratt, and Ethan Hawke, Fuqua's ""Magnificent Seven"" qualifies as an entertaining, above-average, horse opera. Shunning a scene-for-scene rehash of the original, ""True Detective"" scenarist Nic Pizzolatto and ""Expendables 2"" scribe Richard Wenk have shifted the setting from Mexico to America, as well as created fresh characters in no way related to anybody else in the three earlier ""Magnificent Seven"" sequels. Interestingly, in changing the physical setting, Fuqua's film resembles the short-lived CBS-TV series ""The Magnificent Seven"" (1998-2000) where the seven defended a frontier town against outsiders. Similarly, in both the television show and Fuqua's version, a woman is responsible for recruiting the seven. For the record, director John Sturges' ""The Magnificent Seven"" was itself a remake of Japanese director Akira Kurosawa's landmark film. If retooling a samurai saga as a sagebrusher sounds bizarre, consider this: Sergio Leone's groundbreaking Spaghetti western ""A Fistful of Dollars"" (1964) with Clint Eastwood was a remake of another Kurosawa samurai slash'em-up ""Yojimbo"" (1961) again with Toshirô Mifune. Furthermore, later in 1964, American director Martin Ritt adapted yet another Kurosawa yarn ""Rashomon"" (1950) into the Paul Newman & William Shatner western ""The Outrage."" Incidentally, science fiction aficionados should know that George Lucas has said that Kurosawa's film ""The Hidden Fortress"" (1958), served as inspiration for his own historic ""Star Wars"" franchise.The original ""Magnificent Seven"" took place in Mexico. Seven mercenaries who were down on their luck accepted a gold eagle--$20--for six weeks to safeguard a destitute farming village from the depredations of marauding banditos. Calvera and his bandits would strike during harvest, but leave the farmers with adequate food to survive until they returned to plunder anew. The ""Magnificent Seven"" reboot relocates the action to a traditional American western town. Malignant capitalist Bartholomew Bogue (Peter Sarsgaard of ""Black Mass"") plans to buy up all the property in the town of Rose Creek to mine gold. As the story unfolds, Bogue visits the townspeople at their church where they have assembled to settle this intolerable predicament. The mustache-twirling Bogue offers them $20 each for their land parcels. Furthermore, he stipulates that they have three weeks either to accommodate him or suffer the dire consequences. Were this miserly offer not insulting enough for the settlers, Bogue draws first blood and shoots some of them in cold blood. Bogue's Native American sidekick derives special relish from burying his hatchet in the back of a fleeing woman. Bogue blasts one dissenter, Matthew Cullen (Matt Bomer of ""The Nice Guys""), at point blank range without a qualm. After grieving over her husband, Emma Cullen (Jennifer Lawrence lookalike Hayley Bennett of ""Hardcore Henry"") approaches bounty hunter Sam Chisolm and implores him to help her fellow townspeople thwart Bogue's ambitions. ""Sir,"" she addresses Sam. ""I have a proposition. We're decent people being driven from our homes. Slaughtered in cold blood."" Decked out head to toe in black on a black horse, Sam Chisolm (Denzel Washington of ""Unstoppable"") queries Emma: ""So you seek revenge?"" The widow replies,"" I seek righteousness. But I'll take revenge."" Sam recruits a nimble cardsharp, Josh Faraday (Chris Pratt of ""Guardians of the Galaxy""), who cannot seem to avoid trouble or its consequences. Clearly, Pratt's character is forged in the mold of Steve McQueen's character. These two spout a similar story about a hombre who jumped off a hotel roof. As the gent plunged past each window, spectators heard him say: ""So far, so good."" Fuqua gets more mileage out of this story than the John Sturges film imagined. Fuqua appropriates one of original villain's best lines for Bogue, who philosophically ponders the fate of the townspeople. ""If God had not wanted them sheared, he would have not made them sheep."" This seven amounts to a rugged multicultural outfit: an Asian gunslinger Billy Rocks (Byung-hun Lee of ""Terminator Genisys"") wields knife with deadly grace; a lethal Comanche archer (newcomer Martin Sensmeier) never misses; a flinty Hispanic pistolero Vasquez (Manuel Garcia-Rulfo of ""Term Life"") displays enviable marksmanship skills, a Grizzly Adams mountain man Jack Horne (Vincent D'Onofrio of ""Full Metal Jacket"") likes to work in close with a hatchet, and a former Confederate sniper Goodnight Robicheaux (Ethan Hawke of ""The Purge"") struggles to conceal the nerve that he has lost. Robicheaux combines the characters of Lee and Harry Luck from the original film, while Billy Rocks is the James Coburn character.Some abhor remakes more than sequels. I saw ""The Magnificent Seven"" during its initial theatrical release in 1960, and I've seen it so many times since I can recite its many quotable lines, savor the slap and draw six-gun scene, and hum the evocative Elmer Bernstein title theme. Happily, as the end credits roll, Fuqua cues Bernstein's two-time Oscar nominated orchestral score. Leathery tough ""Magnificent Seven"" fanatics will applaud this homage. Fortunately, while it doesn't contain as much clever, incisive dialogue as its predecessor, ""The Magnificent Seven"" remake isn't the disaster I feared. Indeed, Fuqua's ensemble shootout ranks as one of the best westerns since the Coen Brothers' ""True Grit."" Denzel Washington, Chris Pratt stand out in a gifted cast. Peter Sarsgaard makes a repulsive villain, but he doesn't boast the cutthroat humor that the original ""Magnificent Seven"" villain Calvera (played by Eli Wallach) had. Nonetheless, what Sarsgaard's villain lacks in dimension, he compensates for with murder. Altogether, despite some idiotic comic relief, the remake of ""The Magnificent Seven"" is worth saddling up to see.",The Magnificent Seven

Better-than-anticipated needless remake of the remake of The Seven Samurai, with Washington as a mysterious stranger who is enlisted by a small town in the Old West to help them from being marauded by evil land magnate Sarsgaard (all sweaty, sniveling brio), and recruiting a requisite motley crew of avengers. While the screenplay by Richard Wenk and Nic Pizzolatto solidly etches the oater mythos of revenge and male bonding it is the epic scope of filmmaker Antoine Fuqua who pumps new life into the hoary genre with some well stocked action sequences including the humdinger finale. Reunited with his Training Day stars Washington and Hawke (channeling his inner Kris Kristofferson as a Civil War veteran sharpshooter with ghosts plaguing him), Fuqua only hinders the film by short-shrifting the lesser known named actors (Lee, Garcia-Rulfo and Sensmeier are basically interchangeable) with little more than exposition of righting a major wrong (the other hand, the ever formidably beefy D'Onofrio gets in touch with his inner Ernest Borgnine as a hulking mountain man).

I knew that there was a Magnificent 7 in 1960 but that movie preceded me and it never made my ""to watch"" list.Still, I am a sucker for Westerns. They don't even have to be all that good. But make them good and star-studded like this one and oooooweeee I'm hooked like a striped bass. At its core, this Western is not much different than any other. You have some good guys and bad guys. You have a wrong, or wrongs that were done that require some good ol' fashioned payback. And nothing is better than some good ol' fashioned payback. The hook is all in how the punishment is meted out.The acting in this movie was fantastic. Peter Sarsgaard (Bart Bogue) played a grade A dirtbag. I hated him with every fiber of my being. Denzel (Chisolm) is Denzel, what more needs to be said. Ethan Hawke (Robicheaux), Chris Pratt (Faraday) and the others were all exceptional but I have to reserve a special appreciation for Vince D'Onofrio (Jack Horne). He was terrific as the religious Davy Crockett/mountain man type.I loved the movie, but like I said, I'm a sucker for Westerns so don't take my word for it.",The Magnificent Seven
21,neil-476,"Not disastrous, but the original hasn't lost its crown",7,21 May 2018,"A ragtag bunch of loner mercenaries join together to defend a townful of innocents against a predatory (and far better armed) force which greatly outnumbers them. That synopsis fits this film and also its multiple forbears, starting with Kurosawa's Seven Samurai and including (of course) John Sturges' seminal 1960 western, and Roger Corman's rather less seminal Battle Beyond The Stars. The villain of the piece here is a property baron looking to extort the population of a town out of their land, using murder when necessary. Denzel Washington heads up the seven, in a nice selection of characters which both echo the original yet manage to be their own characters.That is the mark of this film: it often references its predecessor (the knife fight in the railroad stock yard, for instance) yet it is quite different in execution. I must say that the final reference - wait for the closing credits - gripped me by the throat and didn't let go.It is not without flaws: deaths of members of the seven flash by during the (well-staged) final battle, for instance, without them having the impact they should have. There is a closing voiceover which obviously exists only to have the word ""magnificent"" in it: it is contrived, clumsy and completely unnecessary. And Sarsgard's baddie, Bartholomew Bogue, is either badly conceived or badly performed, with an air of mildly exasperated but languid impatience which doesn't really feel credible.And it appeared to me that much of Fuqua's direction, in the early part, at least, seemed to be based on the assumption that none of the audience had ever seen a western. However, given how long the western has been out of favour, that may well be true.For all that, it is a decent enough movie. Not as epic or iconic as its predecessor, to be sure, but not bad at all.",The Magnificent Seven
22,Uriah43,A Decent Remake,6,15 February 2017,"This remake of the 1960 Western essentially begins with a ruthless robber baron by the name of ""Bartholomew Bogue"" (Peter Sarsgaard) who is not content with simply mining on the outskirts of a town known as Rose Creek but also wants all of the land belonging to the townspeople as well. And he has no qualms about resorting to murder and intimidation to get what he wants. So in a desperate attempt to retain their land and have justice served, two people by the names of ""Emma Cullen"" (Haley Bennett) and ""Teddy Q"" (Luke Grimes) approach a bounty hunter named ""Sam Chisholm"" (Denzel Washington) and plead for his help. Although he normally works for much more than they can afford he accepts their offer and immediately begins to gather up as many good gunmen as he can find knowing that he has to act fast before Bartholomew Bogue can recruit even more henchmen than he already has. After gathering 6 good men he rides out to the town of Rose Bud with the hope of training the local townspeople as much as possible to defend the town against almost impossible odds. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that, in comparison to other Western films, this particular movie wasn't too bad. I especially liked the performances of Vincent D'Onofrio (as the trapper named ""Jack Horne"") and the aforementioned Denzel Washington. However, there really wasn't much to distinguish it from its distinguished predecessor to warrant a much higher rating. Slightly above average.",The Magnificent Seven
23,ferguson-6,sounds good,6,25 September 2016,"Greetings again from the darkness. In this era of endless remakes, sequels and superheroes, I strive to keep an open mind when it comes to mainstream movies. All I ask is that the classics be left alone. Most will agree that there is no need for a new version of The Godfather, Citizen Kane or Gone with the Wind; however, disputes arise in the gray areas. An old guy like me may cringe at the thought of updating this western, though it's easy enough to understand how Hollywood studio types view it as an opportunity to sell tickets to a younger audience. In art vs. commerce, making money usually prevails.The 1960 original, directed by John Sturges was itself a remake/reimagining of one of the greatest films ever made: Akira Kurosawa's Seven Samurai (1954). Both are must-see's for any movie lover. Given the technical advancements in filmmaking over the past 50-60 years, it only makes sense that director Antoine Fuqua (Southpaw, Training Day) would go bigger, faster, louder. What he can't do is match the cool factor of Steve McQueen, Yul Brenner, James Coburn, Charles Bronson, or of course, Toshiro Mifune.Mr. Fuqua does bring a more racially diverse cast with Denzel Washington taking the lead as Chisolm, the dignified man-on-a-couple-of-missions. Chris Pratt basically buckles a holster onto his Jurassic World character and becomes Faraday, the wise-cracking sharp-shooter, who is as likely to cheat in a card game as lay his life on the line for a good cause. The ""seven"" are rounded out with Ethan Hawke as war hero Goodnight Robicheaux, Vincent D'Onofrio as bear-sized man Jack Horne, Byung-hun Lee as knife specialist Billy Rocks, Manuel Garcia-Rulfo as Vasquez, and Martin Sensmeier as native-American outcast Red Harvest. You might think the only thing missing from this culturally diverse group is a woman, but Haley Bennett (and her distractingly terrible hair dye) plays a key role as a recently widowed town person intent on revenge against the heartless robber-baron Bogue, played by a sneering Peter Sarsgaard.Co-writers Nic Pizzolatto (""True Detective"") and Richard Wenk (The Expendables 2) devote so much screen time to Denzel and Pratt that we never much get a feel for what makes the other characters tick. What's not missing is the thundering hooves of galloping horses, steely-eyed glares, and gunfire  lots and lots of gunfire. This is where today's sound technology really adds a welcome element – the cocking of a rifle, the leather of the holster, and of course, the near-deafening chorus from the Gatling gun all benefit from Sony 4k sound.Fuqua's stylistic approach may have more in common with Silverado (1985) than the 1960 Sturges film, but it's important to note that this was legendary composer James Horner's final score before he passed away. While we hear Horner's unique take, we can't miss the influence of the iconic original score by Elmer Bernstein. So while Pratt's ""So far, so good"" joke may be a Steve McQueen re-tread, your appreciation of this latest probably correlates to your appreciation of the 1960 version.",The Magnificent Seven

It isn't a real problem with the film, but some of the narrative makes it stick out like a sore thumb, especially some of the comments they make to one another.But it seems that when Washington makes a film with Fuqua, you can sit back and breathe a sigh of relief, because you know you are going to get something slick from the eye of the director, and you are almost guaranteed that Washington will put in a wonderful performance, even if the rest of the film is a little ropey (He made Virtuosity more enjoyable than it should have been).And it's pretty much what you get with this film. If nothing more, it's harks back to when blockbusters were not the beginning, middle, or part of a bigger universe, when films were big because of it's star power, and when the summer blockbuster season started in July, not April.It's just a great old fashioned action film, that homages Westerns of old with great respect, and has a silly pantomime villain, and the most heroic of heroes you could ask for.Compared to the original, it's not the epic, beautiful masterpiece that Kurosawa gave us all those years ago, but it doesn't try to be, because everyone knows that would spell instant failure for the film.My one gripe with the film is the classification it's received. There is no way on earth that this should have been a 12a, it's far too violent for that. The set pieces are visceral and brutal, and seeing that the final set piece lasts for almost half an hour, and doesn't shy away from the audience seeing blood and death several times.This is one of the rare times that the BBFC got it wrong, which is very surprising.The cast as expected, are excellent. Washington has that effortless swagger that he's had since he was in Carbon Copy, and shows once again why he is considered one of the Hollywood greats.Hawke adds a little emotional depth to his character, and is one of the most fleshed out of the seven, and Pratt, while good, is dangerously coming close to playing the same character in every film he's in.He's still a breath of fresh air at the minute, but he will become annoying in a few films time.The rest of the seven are good, but they feel like nothing more than filler for Washingtons merry men, even D'Onofrio, who plays nothing more than an angry version of Little John. It's the stereotypical God fearing member of the group, who also has sporadic outbursts of violence.But all in all, it's still great to see a summer blockbuster that doesn't try to go over the top in it's grandiosity.It's just a fun romp, and it knows it is.",The Magnificent Seven

The dialog isn't clever in fact it sounds dumb most of the time. The humor falls flat too. There are some silly plot elements and a draggy middle section.It was fun to see them fortify and how their traps worked out. The filming is beautiful and the scenery is more colorful than the usual Westerns.The big battle delivers a huge climax. The machine gun thing was out of place. Sometimes it was hard to make out who was shooting who and who was getting shot.The ending was weak. Why Bogue would just walk in there and have a one on one with Denzel is just illogical. As a modern twist the brown red and black heroes are the ones left standing.The cast is generally likable. Ethan Hawke looks haggard for someone in his mid 40s. Denzel looks trimmer than of late. Chris Pratt could still lose about 20 pounds. Byung Hun Lee is okay. The standout is Vincent D'Onofrio who really acts different in different roles. See him in Daredevil? Cam Gigandet looks like a classic Western bad guy.

While the plot is contrived the original version had a stellar cast, a magnificent score and great locations, but it was ruined by hokey script flaws. For instance, the teen Chico (Buchholz) was able to effortlessly infiltrate Calvera's bandits, utterly fooling them, even though there were only 32 of them by this point (rolling my eyes). Even if Calvera & his brigands failed to make out Chico's face, which is a big IF, his dialogue & accent would've given him away. Keep in mind that Chico was just an unseasoned teen.Another example is the villagers' sudden cowardly turnaround (betrayal), which totally contradicted their earlier resolve. Yes, I realize they learned that the bandits weren't run-off and that they were going to return to the village out of desperation, but there were only like 30-32 bandits left at this juncture and the combined forces of the seven gunmen and the fighting villagers now had the opportunity to annihilate the thugs for good.This version of course eliminates such idiotic writing and ups the ante with the action. The movie's bloody, but no more so than recent Westerns like ""3:10 to Yuma"" (2007) and ""Django Unchained"" (2012). If you like those ones, as well as oldies like ""Duel at Diablo"" (1966) and ""The Outlaw Josey Wales"" (1976), you'll like this one.

The other ones just seemed like side characters just along for the ride. Which is a shame cause few of them, I thought could have had more of an interesting development. Giving some depth to their background, like the Indian member talking with his tribe. Or giving a bit of a flashback for the Confederate gunslinger.

I also thought more dynamics between the cast and the teamwork between all of the seven would have drew me into caring for the characters. Instead it just goes into the recruiting, training and shootout direction.6.7/10",The Magnificent Seven
31,Hellmant,"Despite all it's strengths, it left me wanting a little more.",8,1 October 2016,"'THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN': Four Stars (Out of Five)Director Antoine Fuqua's remake of the classic 1960 western, of the same name; which was in turn a remake of the 1954 Japanese epic 'SEVEN SAMURAI'. It once again tells the story of seven outcast gunmen, that band together to defend a poor town from a ruthless industrialist. The script was written by Richard Wenk (a veteran action film director, of movies like 'THE EXPENDABLES 2' and 'THE EQUALIZER') and Nic Pizzolatto (who also created the popular TV series 'TRUE DETECTIVE', and wrote all of it's episodes); it's based on a screenplay by the great Akira Kurosawa, Shinobu Hashimoto and Hideo Oguni. The film stars Denzel Washington (in his third collaboration with Fuqua), Chris Pratt, Ethan Hawke (in his third collaboration with Fuqua as well), Byung-hun Lee, Manuel Garcia- Rulfo, Vincent D'Onofrio, Martin Sensmeier, Haley Bennett and Peter Sarsgaard. It's received mostly positive reviews from critics (although not great ones) and it's done pretty well at the Box Office (but not great). I think it's a fairly good western remake (but not a great one). The movie is set in 1879, in a small mining town called Rose Creek. The town is taken over by a corrupt businessman, named Bartholomew Bogue (Sarsgaard), and his men; and when some of the townspeople try standing up against him, they're slaughtered. Emma Cullen (Bennett), who's husband (Matt Bomer) was murdered, rides to the closest town, with her friend Teddy Q (Luke Grimes), looking for help. They're they meet a warrant officer named Sam Chisolm (Washington). When Cullen offers Chisolm a lot of money, and informs him that Bogue is the culprit, he reluctantly agrees to help her. Chisolm then sets out in finding six other gunmen to help him.The movie is entertaining, full of colorful characters (and good performances), and it also has some pretty spectacular actions scenes; one shootout is really intense (and well done). The movie is definitely entertaining; there's a few slow moments, but there's not too much really to complain about. Still, despite all it's strengths, it left me wanting a little more. It's definitely not a classic, like either of the films it's based on (or 'THREE AMIGOS'), but it is a pretty good western flick.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIFMQ3xbt9g",The Magnificent Seven
32,thesar-2,The Magnificent 1700,6,25 December 2016,"You want anti-whitewashing? Now, granted, I haven't seen the original The Magnificent Seven from 1960, but that seemed preeettty white to me while this was as diverse as Chris Pratt's outer-galaxy Guardians movie. Kudos to these fellas!Not that we absolutely needed a multi-race seven to be ""magnificent,"" but I absolutely loved the cast and how they used their unique and regional backgrounds to work together to defeat the big, bad boss.The Magnificent Seven (2016) was beautifully shot, truly felt real for the time frame (1879) and the main, main leads truly shined. Namely Denzel Washington. Pratt was fantastic, and hilarious, as usual, but Washington continued to show how he is literally a legend of cinema. You simply cannot take your eyes off him, or ignore how great he was.For the remaining seven, the more notable ones were the badass Billy Rocks (Byung-hun Lee) and Red Harvest (Martin Sensmeier.) Now bothoh, boywere walking stereotypes, but still pretty awesome to watch. And then there was Ethan Hawke – who I have grown to appreciate more and more in his later years of acting, was good here, but unfortunately not as great as some of his other roles. Overall, the movie is as straightforward as it could be. Again, this coming from someone who hasn't seen the original, but I have seen many more Westerns in these last two years than all my years here on Earth. In fact, I was never really a big fan of them until recently, when Westerns really grew up and became deep, thought-provoking and had a ton of action that was both fun and didn't distract from the great story- telling. So, because of that, I've watched probably 9-12 since the beginning of 2015 and loved almost all of them.Unfortunately, though, for this one, it took a step back. Don't get me wrong; I still really liked it. The action was great, the cinematography well done and the characters were fun to watch and laugh with at times. But, gone was the depth, feelings, complexity and originality of a ""magnificent"" Western.Basically, Washington's Chisolm rounds up six other low-lives, albeit great fighters to push out an evil dictator from a stranger's town. There's really not much more to this, other than the obligatory Big Boss doing despicable acts and our fearless (or mostly) Seven training the town in defense montages. There were some slow moments – the movie in no way should've been as long as it was at two hours and thirteen minutes, and the foreseen from a mile finale was just too depressing, but overall, it's enjoyable and worth it, if for nothing else, for Washington and Pratt.Oh, and it's not Adam Sandler's dump on Westerns (and viewers): The Ridiculous Six. For that alone, this movie is a masterpiece.***Final thoughts: Yes, in my headline, I switched 7 with 1700. Not because this movie took place then, but because this was my 1,700th review. 100 reviews ago, I reviewed Murder at 1600. I guess I have a little time to match review #1800 with the appropriate title. Maybe, they'll finally turn Eight is Enough into a feature film! Oy, vey, that means there's 1,800 people in that housethat's gonna be a long movie to introduce them all to a new generation",The Magnificent Seven

34,lost-in-limbo,"Watchable remake, but lacking charm.",6,30 June 2020,"The original 1960 THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN was one of the first westerns I ever saw, thanks to my grandfather, where Saturday afternoons as a kid I would sit there in the lounge room with him watching westerns, so it holds a special place in my heart. Hearing about the remake, I wasn't particularly interested, but over time my curiosity won out, especially with that ensemble cast led by Denzel Washington.While watchable, I found it to lack that sense of big time adventure (well Elmer Bernstein's powerful music score was a big part of that) and the effortless magnetism of the original film, however this efficient reboot (in the second half) delivers in spades the bravado confrontations, blaring shootouts and blazing self-sacrifice in the face of impossible odds. Action is expertly-staged, pacing stays upbeat and an earnestly well-oiled cast (with some standing out more than others) acquitting themselves by bringing few moments of emotional attachment, in spite of the shallow caricature arches and at times forced chemistry. At the core of the mechanical plot, the message and its themes remains the same, although I didn't really understand the need for the out-of-the-blue revenge angle towards the end. Nonetheless THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN is an admirable effort.",The Magnificent Seven
35,wellthatswhatithinkanyway,"Dull, sanitised, unexciting western flop",2,19 June 2017,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning In the mid west, the small town of Rose Creek finds itself under attack from ruthless industrialist Bartholemew Bogue (Peter Sarsgaard), who wants them to sell it to him so he can build a railroad through it. It all seems pretty hopeless, until a mysterious stranger named Chisolm (Denzel Washington) rolls into town. Proving himself adept at handling himself in tough situations, Chisolm rallies the towns-people, including loose cannon Faraday (Chris Pratt), avowed pacifist Goodnight Robicheaux (Ethan Hawke), oriental blade master Billy (Byung-hun Lee) and Haley (Emma Cullen), whose husband was killed by Bogue, to rise up and take down their oppressor, while containing a secret vengeance of his own.The western genre has certainly risen back up again, and holds a more popular place in modern audiences hearts than it did maybe, fifteen years ago, and so this remake of The Magnificent Seven certainly had a lot of potential riding on it. But the first thing to strike you is the befuddling 12A certificate, in a time when Quentin Tarantino has made them as bloody and brutal as anything else, with his offerings The Hateful Eight and Django Unchained both gaining 18 certificates. What's even more perplexing is, this is another collaboration between Denzel Washington and Antoine Fuqua, the team behind the ultra violent Equalizer and Training Day. But then this is just a precursor for a film obsessed with political correctness and not offending any sensibilities, with a multi cultural line up of lead characters and one woman which even though I haven't seen the original film, I just know wouldn't have been conceived of when it first came out.When westerns were all the rage maybe sixty years ago, pretty simplistic plots were enough to drive them forward, but in a more modern time when people expect a little more, this kind of thing needs a little more meat on the bones, and there's just nothing here to give it any extra kick. What results is a dull, tepid film that plods on for nearly two hours and engages your attention none the more, and just wastes the combined talents of an all star cast that really deserve better. Denzel feels cheapened, like he's sold himself short, and a supporting line up including the likes of Pratt and Hawke don't make things any better. Sarsgaard is also a really flat, dull villain.It doesn't take a genius to see this is a little bit of a passion project for Fuqua, like he obviously had a personal affection for the original film, and maybe loved it as a kid. You just have to wonder, given his record of brutal, pull no punches filmmaking, why he produced something as lily livered and boring as this. Not so much The Magnificent Seven as The Magnanimous One. *",The Magnificent Seven
36,ElMaruecan82,"Too ""conventionally"" modern for its own good...",6,22 January 2018,"The concept of ""Seven Samurai"" is so simple that it's hard to believe it took half a century for a director to come up with the mission-team trope. But that's why Akira Kurosawa was such a genius, he made the seminal action movie and it worked so well that it didn't take much for its Western remake to become a classic on its own merits.
 
The ingredients are simple and so is the structure: poor people oppressed by a corrupt and powerful man, the recruiting of the seven, the bonding with the villagers which is the meat of the story, then the climactic battle where four of the seven meet their demise. The success of the film depends on how each of these segments are handled and how the cast manages to transcend the material by making us relate to each player or enjoy their presence and interactions.But it's not as easy as it sounds, the original was a three-hour epic with a clear three-act structure, not only we could identify each Samurai but each death resonated as a mini-tragedy. ""The Magnificent Seven"", less epic but as entertaining, managed to make at least five of them pretty endearing in a briefer lapse of time. Now, the problem with Antoine Fuqua's 2016 remake is that it's obviously admiring the original material and does the best to duplicate its magic, but it never seems to take its own characters seriously enough, not the magnificent, not the villagers, so why should we care?
 
As expected, each of the seven embodies a particular trait, Denzel Washington is Sam Chisolm, the Ace, his establishing moment consists on the 'permanent' arrest of a wanted criminal and a few collateral damages. The scene works but it's so reminiscent of one of King Schultz' deeds in ""Django Unchained"" that it's instantly forgettable. Chris Pratt is the cool one, who enjoys a magic card trick or two and spends half his time delivering a wisecrack. Individually, they're good but together, they're no Brynner and McQueen. Now, I waited for the taciturn one, the third Samurai/James Coburn type. He's a knife thrower played by Byung-Hun Lee, this is an interesting fellow that deserved a more ominous introduction, but as soon as we're finished admiring his skills, we discover that he's only the sidekick of a more legendary sharpshooter named Goodnight Robicheaux and played by Ethan Hawke. Hawke plays the third more three-dimensional member of the seven but I didn't like the way he stole Billy's thunder, relegated to one simple skill.And depth would be a luxury for the other magnificent, Manuel Garcia-Rulfo is a Mexican outlaw who's given a chance by Sam and spends the rest of the time exchanging a few racist quips with Pratt, Vincent D'Onofrio is a religious tracker whose voice is the closest thing to comedy relief, and then there's Martin Sensmeier as an exiled Comanche warrior. They're all colorful and ethnically marked but that's not saying much, the Native is defined by his ability to throw arrows, the knife thrower throws knives the religious nutcase speaks to the Lord, the Mexican is... Mexican. The only oneswho benefit from an extra pinch of depth are Hawke whose troubled actions seem to recall some PTSD shock from the Civil War and Pratt, and Washington. But if you're looking for counterparts to the magnificent seven, don't bother. I didn't expect one but I wish they could have improved the seventh one and made him as a scene stealer as Mifune, but the film didn't even manage to be better than ""Young Guns"", and I loved ""Young Guns"", the film had six protagonists and they were not as expendable as the so-called magnificent. 
This version with Antoine Fuqua is obviously driven by good intentions and the fact that he decided to make a multi-ethnic cast could have given a special texture, but Fuqua also goes for the female heroine trend, and Haley Bennett (the toughest one from the village) is just so bad-ass she overshadows many of the seven. If Fuqua wanted something original, he could have made her the seventh one. It wouldn't have been the least realistic thing about the film, the introduction of the villain had almost killed any attempt to take it seriously.They say a film is as good as its villain, on the basis of Bartholomew Bogue, the film should have been great. Peter Saargard revisits a form of old-fashioned mustached villain that is not uninteresting. That said, I can believe any form of evil exploitation, of throwing people off their land, but that a man would be shot in cold blood in front of witnesses, and a woman being axed from behind and the Marshall, no matter how corrupt he is, would do nothing about it, that's too much. If evil doesn't have standards, then the conception of heroism turns into something 'superhero' binary that doesn't really prompt us to root for anyone, since there's no intellectual challenge. 
But Haley Bennett as the seventh one would've been a challenging twist, but there were more shots on her cleavage than any scenes involving the last three seven put together so I wondered whether her presence was meant to arouse the male audience or to inspire the female one. But the film leaves a little to care about, especially the villagers who're not given enough screen-time or interactions anyway. And since the timing between the entrance and the battle doesn't exceed forty minutes, we couldn't care less about the outcome. 
 
What lacked in the film is a transition between the introduction and the battle, the fact that many deaths left me cold was indicating of how the film was so reliant on the concept that it forgot to tell a genuinely powerful story, it's just about archetypes colliding into each other in a muck of cinematic conventions. It's fun and entertaining at moments, but the rest of the time, I was scratching my head with perplexity.",The Magnificent Seven
37,dromasca,The Magnificent Seven - International Edition,6,2 February 2017,"The Japanese master Akira Kurosawa is credited for the original script (and remarkable movie) Seven Samurai made in 1954. Six years later an American remake named The Magnificent Seven provided one of the exception of that rule too often true which says that Hollywood remakes are much worse pictures than the non-American original movies they are based upon. John Sturges' film was actually very good (in my opinion) because of the presence of great action movies stars like Yul Brynner, Steve McQueen, Charles Bronson and because it translated well the code of honor of the samurais in the rules of ethics that made eventually the lawless Wild West into a cradle of an efficient and lawful society. So the question may be asked - why do another Hollywood remake in 2016. One answer is of course - because more than half a century passed and the Western evolved. The problem is that in processing the script for the 21st century the writers and producers felt the need to add a dimension that was practically absent from the previous 7s - multiculturalism. And so, in two hops, we get from the mono-cultural Japanese saga with samurais to an internationalized (and PC - suspect) story that may fit some of the 21st century taste, but seems less credible in a 19th century setting.The team of mercenaries assembled by law man Denzel Washington to protect the citizens of the city threatened to be taken over by an avid landlord and his army includes almost all the races and nations that populate the America of that time in an 'international' team that will work, fight and (some) die flawlessly. Nice idea, but lacking credibility. Worse - all with the exception of Washington's character lack consistency, they are more the stereotype that they are supposed to represent than real characters we get to care about, even when they are hurt or die.Otherwise, it's a good action movie, respecting the basic rules of the action Western films. One cannot expect Denzel Washington to provide anything but a fine performance. He worked with director Antoine Fuqua in The Equalizer and was lucky for a more consistent and complex role there. Haley Bennett was also present in The Equalizer, here, in The Magnificent Seven she seems to be a little too young and a little too pretty for the role of the beautiful widow who gathers the team of mercenaries. Fine actors as Chris Pratt or Ethan Hawke get too little substance in their roles to be remembered. The action scenes are reasonably well made, but there is nothing special to remember the day after the screening.The 'Wild' West at the end of the 19th century was many things, but what it was not was a multi-cultural and tolerant society. One can describe it as such, but this smells of historical revisionism or political correctness. The West may have been populated by different nationalities, but they were far from equal and far from living and acting in harmony - this is the historical truth. Taking into account that today's American society is as well far from having overcome all its traumas related to its attitude towards race and minorities, maybe such an alternate view can be regarded as an act of balancing. All good, but this does not automatically translate into good cinema.",The Magnificent Seven
38,ThomasDrufke,Great Popcorn Western,7,23 September 2016,"The Seven Samurai and the original remake The Seven Samurai were a part of the first wave of 'team up' and ensemble films. This particular iteration of the classic tale comes out in a time where cinema is flooded by team ups of all sorts, with superhero films taking over. So it's certainly not as special to see a random group come together for one specific cause, but make no mistake, this film is loads of fun.Antoine Fuqua, known usually for more serious action films, seemed like he had a bit more fun here. Some people are saying it's ""Fast and Furious on horseback"", and while I'm not sure that's entirely a good comparison, The Magnificent Seven doesn't take itself too seriously. And that's definitely a good thing. Of course, there are plenty of moments with dire consequences like the epic final shootout, it's very much a popcorn western.Fuqua assembled a very talented cast, but also a very diverse group of actors, which is definitely welcome. The original films are good for what they are supposed to be, but there wasn't a strong push for diversity among skin color or even just personal background. The biggest strength of this movie is by far its diversity. Yes, there are quite a few different races among the 7, but they all have different skills and weaknesses, which makes for a much more unpredictable and fun ride.As far as the actual performances go, I pretty much got what I expected. Denzel Washington is a world class talent, and he puts it on showcase once again in what is I believe his first Western. Chris Pratt's character is very similar to his turn in Jurassic World, and like that film, it took me a while to get on board with his particular take on the Steve McQueen role (even though they are named differently). But once the crew formed, his dynamic with them and witty one-liners won me over. I won't say he has the charisma that McQueen had just yet, but he came close.The rest of the cast, including Ethan Hawke, Vincent D'Onofrio, Byung-hun Lee, and newcomers Manuel Garcia-Rulfo and Martin Sensmeier also give solid performances. Though I will say that D'Onofrio really bothered me. Just like in Daredevil, he tries to do a strange voice for his character and it just didn't work for me. Haley Bennett on the other-hand, who plays the townswoman determined to find people to help her struggling farm village, was fantastic. Being pretty much the only prominent female character, she had a tough job. But I thought she found a nice balance of strength, confidence, and vulnerability. I will say that one of my main problems with the film is that we barely get to know Peter Sarsgaard's villain. He sets the table in the opening sequence, and he's obviously there at the end, but it's few and far in-between. I loved the time spent with the crew, but a movie is only as good as its villain, and that's where this western lacked in my opinion.The film doesn't feel anywhere near as special as the original Seven Samurai, but I do prefer it to the other The Magnificent Seven from 1960. It does a nice job of building the core dynamic between the 7 so that by the time the climactic battle comes around, the tension and emotional investment is there. And boy is that final battle a doozy. We don't get many great Westerns anymore, so ones that are this entertaining should be seen.+Diverse cast+Group dynamic+GREAT final shootout+Horner's last score is beautiful-D'Onofrio doing a weird voice again-Not enough villain screen time7.7/10",The Magnificent Seven
39,secondtake,"A good, fun, action packed ride lacking true distinction",7,27 August 2018,"Magnificent Seven (2016)A movie purposely filled with archetypes (or some would say, clichés). That's part of the fun of it, and it's also part of the limitation because you know, roughly, what's going to happen long before it does. What you savor is how it happens.
And so in classic fashion (like the true movie original to all this, ""The Seven Samurai""--note that Kurosawa is even one of the writers credited here), a group of seven super talented but varied fighters are assembled to wreak revenge on a large and ruthless gang. The ""good"" guys are not all good (they have checkered pasts), but the bad guys are purely pad. So you know who to root for.
The famous twist here is the leader of the Seven is a black man played by Denzel Washington. The novelty of that is not really so novel (""Unforgiven"" brought Morgan Freeman to the Western in 1992), but having such a great actor hold it all together is good news. The gathering of different types of fighters (an Asian knife thrower, a Native American with bow and arrow, etc.) goes step by step and is fun, and the training of the townspeople to help has some humor and tension.
Ethan Hawke and Peter Sarsgaard are standouts among the large cast of main characters, and they help keep the movie quirky and intense. Haley Bennett (as the only female with a large role) is also important.
But mostly this is an action film, with a lot of shooting and dynamic camera and things blowing up. It's fun stuff, well done of course. But as I said, the outcome is kind of known, and so any real tension is missing.

The gun shooting with the climatic scenes sometimes seem to be so blase by contemporary standards. And the set up is something the audience has seen before, again and again. The spaghetti western close ups that have been so effective have been replaced by a more subdued, artistic, but not as stylized photographic style.

However, the film was semi-entertaining enough that I will give it a 7/10 at best.",7,6 October 2016,"Directed by Antoine Fuqua and written by Nic Pizzolatto and Richard Wenk, this movie has the mining townsfolks of Rose Creek seeking help from warrant officer Sam Chisolm (Denzel Washington) and his group of gunslingers: gambler Josh Faraday (Chris Pratt), sharpshooter Goodnight Robicheaux (Ethan Hawke), knife-wielding Billy Rocks (Byung-hun Lee), skilled tracker Jack Horne (Vincent D'Onofrio), Comanche warrior Red Harvest (Martin Sensmeier) and notorious Mexican outlaw Vasquez (Manuel Garcia-Rulfo) in order to help them in their fight against corrupt industrialist Bartholomew Bogue (Peter Sarsgaard) and his group of ruthless killers. While, it's nice to see that director and crew didn't do a beat-for-beat remake of the 1960's original movie with the same name, or the black and white 1954's Japanese Samurai film, 'The Seven Samurai'. The remake still wasn't needed. It really was 'unnecessary'. After all, the 'guns for hire' concept has been revisited several times in various genres across film, TV, and literature for years, now. It's somewhat dated, clichés, and tiresome. Still, I have to say, I was entertained by the new, multicultural angle to a sturdy old story, update violent action, iconic retelling of the classic score by composer Elmer Bernstein's legendary music from the 1960 version and wonderful camera work. Still, I thought this retelling could had done, better in establishing the reasons, why the gunslingers were ready to fight and die for this town. It seems illogically for the group to try to save the town, while destroying parts of it and getting half of your men get killed in a fight that has nothing to do with them. I really didn't get, why they were so gun-ho with this suicidal mission. The film really could had, developed the supporting characters, a lot more than they did. Explain what their code of honor, was. Another thing, while, the movie occasionally acknowledges racial differences and fears, it quickly gets the seven on equal footing, without much, inner conflict. It was very jarring, seeing them get along, so well. This is not the typical group of nine people you see in movies set in the 1870s, especially following the events of the American Civil War. Not so historic authentic. It's seem way too 'SJW' polished at times, both in the language and the story. I would love to see them, fight with each other, a little bit more, before learning to work, together. Despite that, I like the acting. While, Denzel Washington as a African American sworn-in bounty hunter from Missouri, might not seem to be historical accurate to those unfamiliar with the Wild West. In truth, he was; as the character was mostly based on real-life person, Bass Reeves, one of the first black Deputy U.S. Marshals west of the Mississippi River. Anyways, I think Washington did pretty well, to establish himself, as the lead/mentor of the group. He really does have that commanding presence. However, his character's backstory with the over the top 'just bad' villain, seem to come, out of nowhere and forced. I would rather, have them, not know each other. Not every quest should be, about revenged. Also, I found Peter Sarsgaard's performance, one dimensional. His character was just evil for evil sakes. Like who in the right mind, would work for him!? For Chris Pratt, it was the same with his character. The film has him, very much, limited to the fun, joking type of a guy, Pratt normally plays. Chris Pratt was alright in the film, but he's no Steve McQueen or Toshiro Mifune with his acting range. Without spoiling the movie, too much, the ending with him, was somewhat surprising. The writers really had some balls to do that, with his character, knowing how A-List, Pratt is. Ethan Hawke & Vincent D'Onofino's character in the other hand is very predictable. While, both are great actors. I really could see, their character's ending, a mile away. Still, I love their characters as they were, by far, the most developed. Just wish they explore Goodnight's PTSD & Horne's belief in God more. Byung-hun Lee was cool to see in the film, as well. I like how Billy was a knife-guy who spent most of the fights firing a gun. The film didn't go into the stereotypical all Asians know martial arts moves, approach. However, Martin Sensmeier & Manuel Garcia-Rulfo's characters realize so heavily on the one-dimensional stereotypical characteristic that they really don't seem fully developed complex characters. I was really disappointed by them. Yet, I do like how Haley Bennett's character, Emma Cullen was more than a 'damsel in distress' type persona. Haley really does 'kick butt' in this film. Although, I kinda mistake Haley Bennet for Jennifer Lawrence, first time, watching it. Another problem with the film is the tone of the violence. It's not particularly gory, but there's tons of shooting and killing, as well as stabbing and slicing with knives and arrows that has no blood, despite it should be. It's doesn't feel as gritty as it should had with its epic scale. Far too clean. I also have a problem with the high body count. The villain's henchmen seem to come out of nowhere. While, it seem like there is few 30 to 50 men on screen. It's far more than it is, to make believable. Overall: While, Fuqua does his best to update the Western genre for the modern audience, it doesn't capture, the same magic that made those films great in the first place. Yet, I can still recommended seeing this movie.",The Magnificent Seven
46,Reno-Rangan,"The new seven, all unique and diversified!",7,24 December 2016,"Basically, people watch it for either those actors and the director or for an entertertainment. But we all know the story, how it begins and how it ends, since it was the remake of the 1960 film. Actually, it was a successful remake, but not as magnificent as the original. Maybe the youngsters might like this one better.The director's favourite, Denzel Washington in one of the main characters. Not much change in the theme, except the screenplay was little altered, especially diversity in the film characters and their developments. Because nowadays that's a big issue in Hollywood cinema. So it was led by Denzel and possibly there will be a sequel like the 'Ocean's' trilogy.The people from a small mining town decides to hire men with guns to fight the villainous businessman who slaughtered their loved ones. The unusual seven men come together and form a team with a plan to defend the town. So what comes next is the battle between the good and the bad that lasts for the whole final act.The setting was completely refreshing, but slightly disappointing action sequences. All the seven characters were unique and awesome, but the film lacked the great battle scene that defines each one of them. Surely I favour it just for once watch that told from the todays imagination of the 1870s era. Feels like it should have been better, but in the end it is a satisfying film.6.5/10",The Magnificent Seven
47,tomgillespie2002,The Adequate Seven,6,25 January 2017,"Movie fans were predictably up in arms when the announcement was made that John Sturges' beloved 1960 action western The Magnificent Seven was to be remade by Antoine Fuqua, a director who has arguably only made one decent film in his career. Familiar claims of Hollywood running out of ideas and calls for the 'classics' to be left well and truly alone echoed across internet message boards, despite remakes having existed since cinema began and the fact that Sturges' film was itself a remake of Akira Kurosawa's samurai masterpiece Yojimbo (1961). The resulting movie is a perfectly enjoyable and action-packed couple of hours, although ironically lacking in magnificence. The Adequate Seven would have been a more appropriate, albeit less catchy, title.Fuqua's film treads much of the same ground as Yul Brynner, Steve McQueen, Robert Vaughan et al did fifty-odd years ago. Denzel Washington takes on the role Brynner previously embodied, and he strikes a cool and formidable figure as Chisolm, despite sticking out like a sore thumb in the post-Civil War Wild West (although nobody brings it up). He is approached by the beautiful widower Emma Cullen (Haley Bennett) to help save her town from feudal landowner Bartholomew Bogue (Peter Sarsgaard) and his small army of enforcers, who have just murdered Emma's husband. Either for the bag of gold on offer or just for the sake of doing the right thing, Chisolm agrees to take the job, and begins recruiting his own gang of former acquaintances, lovable rogues and dangerous outlaws.Hollywood finally seems to be catching up with the ethnic diversity so prominent in the U.S., and The Magnificent Seven reflects this wonderfully. As well as casting a black lead relatively unheard of in the genre, Chisolm rounds up Mexican Vasquez (Manuel Garcia- Rulfo), Korean knife-expert Billy Rocks (Byung-hun Lee) and, after befriending him by eating the heart of slain beast, also brings in Native American Red Harvest (Martin Sensmeier). Making up the rest of the group are Josh Faraday (Chris Pratt doing his best impression of Star Lord), a cocky gambler with the gift of the quick draw; Goodnight Robicheaux (Ethan Hawke), an alcoholic former soldier with a shaky hand and shakier nerves; and Jack Horne (Vincent D'Onofrio), the hulking, grey-haired, God-fearing frontiersman who is given the role of comic relief.For most of its 2 hour 13 minute running time, The Magnificent Seven struggles to decide what kind of film it wants to be. On one hand, it's a western in the classic mould, all thigh-slapping and talking' tough. Yet with the many over-the-top set-pieces on show, it also seems to have aspirations to be a shut-down-your-brain blockbuster, even pitting Red Harvest one-on-one against the bad guys' Native American in what is the movie's most ridiculous scene. It also hints at deeper ideas, and touches on themes of race with the lightest of brushes, just enough to make you ponder how good this film really could have been given the cast at the director's disposal. If it's an entertaining slice of action complete with strong performances across the board, then this certainly delivers. However, if you're looking for an absorbing genre piece and one that justifies its own existence, then you may become frustrated with Sargaard's sleepy- eyed scenery chewing. Insert pun on title here.",The Magnificent Seven
48,eddie_baggins,A fun and well made popcorn Western,7,3 October 2016,"It's reasoning to exist may forever remain curiously unnecessary but there's little denying the joy to be had from Antoine Fuqua's remake and throwback to Westerns of old that provides us with a consistently adequate and well-acted re-doing of the classic Steve McQueen starring original from 1960.It feels like a lifetime since the last truly big budgeted and epically tinged Western has hit our cinema screens so in many ways despite it in no way being a classic, The Magnificent Seven is a nice change of pace from the other high profile films of 2016 that have come and gone over the months and with a winning cast all having a blast, you can't help but go along for the ride willingly right through to the predictable and to be expected final gun slinging finale.Led by the stoic and could've done this in his sleep Denzel Washington, Fuqua has assembled an on song cast to enliven proceedings here with everyone's new favourite everyman Chris Pratt giving his Star Lord persona a wild west makeover, Ethan Hawke going all gruff as sharpshooter Goodnight while rising star Haley Bennet providing a female touch (with added cleavage shots in another wise male dominated experience) and Vincent D'Onforio going all method leading one of the year's most proficient acting tropes, that is somewhat let down by yet another sweaty bad guy turn by Peter Sarsgaard who must surely be getting a little tired of his villainous cameos.Despite Sarsgaard's run of the mill villain Bartholomew Bogue and sense of déjà vu for a majority of the films big set ups, once the ""magnificent"" do-gooders band together and the preparation for a bullet infested firefight takes place, Fuqua's film becomes one of the years great popcorn munching events and as is to be expected from a film of this budget and pedigree everything here is staged in a well-oiled manner that's hard to pick apart from either a technical or production point of view.Far from the classic that the original is and relatively easy to forget about, this Magnificent Seven is still a thankfully exciting and fun Western that marks down one of the best genre entries in sometime and a good excuse for a night out at the movies.3 ½ card tricks out of 5",The Magnificent Seven

50,matthewssilverhammer,The Avengers Go West,7,28 September 2016,"This most recent re-telling of the ragtag group of rare-do-wells brought in to help an oppressed town is almost eye-rollingly predictable. Shockingly faithful to the 1960 western of the same name, The Magnificent Seven borrows more than just its predecessor's name and plot. The paper-thin thematics, colorful characters, and emotional qualities are so familiar, it's hardly a game-changing experience. But despite all of that, it's filled with enough light humor and cowboy action to make it an imperfectly shallow good-time. The eponymous seven are refreshingly represented by a diverse cast of personalities and ethnicities, whose differentiations are stronger than their character motivations. Leaders Pratt and Washington give almost lazy performances, with much of their normal charisma lost behind too-cool-for-school masculine posturing, while Sarsgaard's villainous turn is a few clicks away from an empty barrel. However, the supporting cast all shine pretty bright. Hawke, Bennett, and Lee each have their own standout moments, but D'onofrio is the scene-stealer. In one of the few performances of the bunch in which out-of-the-box choices were made, he plays a wild mountain man who essentially serves as The Hulk in this ""Avengers Go West"" tale. However, unlike the Marvel franchise or most other CGI tent-poles, Magnificent Seven hearkens back to a time when practical action, death-defying stunts, and larger-than-life human heroes filled the silver screen. Its deja-vu-like commitment to cowboys on horses, beautifully vacant American scenery, and old-fashioned, small town stand-offs help it fit right alongside the old western marathon your grandfather would binge on Saturday afternoons. Far from groundbreaking, this throwback is still a straightforward, morally clear, and action-packed throwback of fun.",The Magnificent Seven

I believe he is THE coolest cowboy out there. But all the actors are great and I really think that the acting is the best part of this western.

Not the 1960 western of the same name and especially not the 1954 film Seven Samurai of which the 1960 film is a remake. There simply isn't the same weight and gravitas. The fight scenes are certainly shot in a flashy manner, but it simply doesn't feel as epic.It also takes a skilled director to juggle this many characters and have them all shine.

It puts you right there in that classic western feel.Can't remember if I've seen the original, but this remake is definitely a 2016 western, story arch. The hint on gentrification, unfair politics, and the mighty one percent. Concepts that are not new in any age, and go back to the old wild west, but hinted on in a way that we can all relate too far too well, in this day and age. Something I'm noticing in Westerns of the 10sProps to Peter Sarsgaard who played the villain in this picture. It was a nice bit of evil to him that I would have like to have seen more screen time on. Another shout out should go to Haley Bennett whose character of Emma Cullen made it seem more like a Magnificent Eight.And last but not least is the action sequences.

The story is a typical spaghetti western one familiar to any viewer of Sergio Leone's or Clint Eastwood's work.

59,jamesrupert2014,An OK but unnecessary remake,7,27 July 2017,"The original 'Magnificent Seven' (1960) is currently regarded as a classic of the genre (although at the time of release, critics were not so impressed), so why bother making a remake? The producers had a solid cast and should have just make a 'new' movie (cashing in on name recognition seems pointless as most people who value the name just gripe about the perceived inferiority of the remake). The 2016 version is not a bad revenge-oater – the cast and script are fine, the movie has the grittiness that appeals to modern audiences, the body count is high, the heroes' shooting skills preposterous (nothing new in that of course), and the music OK (little can compare to Bernstein's legendary 1960 score). The plausibility of the movie suffers a bit as one bullet or arrow will dispatch a bad guy but good guys seem to be able to stagger toward a dramatic end regardless of how many times they're shot. The real weakness in this film is the chief villain, Peter Sarsgaard's 'Bartholomew Bogue' character (presumably representing the evils of unrestrained capitalism), who is played as a murderous, psychotic nut job. Eli Wallach's ""Calvera"" character in the original was much more interesting and plausible (as westerns go) - you could almost sympathise with him at the end, when he tries to understand why the seven gunfighters whom he saw as being hard men like himself, would come back and defend the farmers who had betrayed them (an interesting plot twist absent in the remake). These kinds of nuances are lacking in the 2016 version – the bad guys are so inhuman and abhorrent that slaughtering them is both justified and desirable (but bloodless, a problem with PG action movies).

This one follows the basic plot line; a small village is being terrorized and needs some professional gunfighters to bail them out. It's directed by Antoine Fuqua-The Equalizer, Shooter & Training Day. Peter plays the bad guy that shows how bad he is in the opening scene; he burns down a church, terrorizes a little boy and kills a man that had the audacity to complain about what he was doing. Haley is the new widow of the brave but foolish man that is now eating dirt. Haley goes in search of someone to stand up to Peter and finds Denzel. Denzel gathers the men he needs, including Chris and Ethan-7 in total-and comes to her rescue. Oh yeah, one of the seven heroes has a personal connection to Peter, which makes things interesting. The music was by James Horner-this was his last movie before his untimely death-and it was OK but they did not use the classic theme music from the original movie until the end credits started to roll. As far as the action goes, it was pretty good. Not boring, it kept your attention from wandering. And not all of the magnificent seven make it out alive. FYI: If you are familiar with the original, there is a character that has traits like the one played by Robert Vaughn. It's rated ""PG-13"" for violence, smoking and language and has a running time of 2 hours & 12 minutes.

The premise of the film sees a group of individuals come together to take down a corrupt businessman from destroying the lives of the people in a small town. Denzel Washington plays the leader of the group and does a great job in the film. He is his usual charismatic character and you are always rooting for him and he is awesome in the action scenes. Chris pratt brings his usual humour to this film and it really works especially his chemistry with Washington. He is also great in the action scenes bringing charm and a believability to his character. Ethan Hawke is really good in this film, you can feel the enjoyment he has in the role and he is a fun addition to the cast and has depth to his character. Vincent donofrio and byung hun lee are also great in this film and really give fun performances that really help this film. The story is OK, it does feel very by the numbers for a western as this film doesn't really deliver much new to western storytelling. But what it does, it does well it gives a decent underdog revenge story that has some good character moments and story moments. The script has some decent humour that really helps flesh some of the characters out and make them easier to root for. The drama also is delivered very well between characters that also helps. The style of the film has some awesome western action scenes in it.

Take a legendary film, Seven Samurai, dumb it way down, crank the action to ten, make each character a unique stereotype and scribble a shallow story. Yet the result is fun when mentally prepared. For those unfamiliar with Seven Samurai, a small town hires a skilled samurai to defend their town. Much the same here as a skilled bounty hunter, Denzel, is hired to save them from a murdering gang threatening to take their land. Much of the movie is the recruitment as Denzel over-easily convinces six more guys to aid him. Will they be able to save the townsfolk and their land? I felt Chris Pratt was miscast. I like him but I never believed his personality type ever existed in a Western era. While the action was fun and relentless at times, it was manic for a Western.

After her husband is killed by Bogue, Emma Cullen (Haley Bennett) decides to take action against Bogue and approaches bounty hunter Chisholm (Denzel Washington). Together, Chisholm and Cullen assemble a crack team of mercenaries in order to help the townspeople take back control of their homes.Fuqua has clearly had fun with this project and despite it now being 2016, he does seemed to have attempted to give the film a slightly old-fashioned feel; the steely-eyed stares,the camera constantly cutting from belt-buckles to gun holsters to faces does sometimes make it feel as though you're watching a western from the 60's. This is intended as a compliment and to me it felt as though Fuqua was trying to pay a bit of homage to the genre rather than making the picture fell gimmicky.Although this is a remake of the 1960 film Fuqua has changed many of the elements from the first film; the characters names are different and the story is also slightly different (in the former film the villagers were terrorised by Mexican bandits whereas in the remake they are terrorised by a ruthless landowner). The different slant on this remake doesn't take away any enjoyment from the picture; there is still some camaraderie between the main players and Fuqua still employs a generally light-hearted approach to the material. I liked the way that Fuqua remembered to include scenes showing the civilians being trained to defend the village (these scenes provided us with many of the film's funniest moments). The film also has plenty of action and is relatively well-paced considering its rather generous running time.I did have a few problems with this film; firstly I felt that the antagonist could have been developed a bit more and arguably the same could be said for our Magnificent Seven. Interestingly, an attempt is made to develop Hawke's character in this film, but it seems to be have been done in a half-assed way which ultimately meant that I could never really get to grips with his character. I personally feel that if you're going to develop a character then do it properly or not at all!!! All in all, this stands as a worthy remake that has enough action and entertainment value for it to be worthy of your time, but for me it falls slightly short in comparison to its 2 predecessors.",The Magnificent Seven

66,kluseba,One of the better remakes supporting the contemporary western revival,7,11 October 2016,"The Magnificent Seven is the remake of a remake that neither has the epic intensity of the original ''Seven Samurai'' movie by Kurosawa Akira from 1954 nor the outstanding acting skills portrayed in John Sturges' ''The Magnificent Seven'' from 1960. Still, this new version offers a fast-paced ride involving great actors, gripping action scenes and fitting settings that bring back the spirit of a cool genre that has gone out of vogue over the past four decades to a new generation.The different characters are introduced in short but fitting ways. They are unique and likable enough to make the audience care about them. Veteran Denzel Washington convinces as cool and clever law enforcer with a mysterious past and plays a strong lead character in his very first western. Chris Pratt convinces as cunning and humorous gambler underlining his status as one of the best young American actors. Vincent d'Onofrio stands out as cranky and quirky trapper and proves once again that he is one of the best choices to play odd and unusual characters. Ethan Hawke does a respectable job as haunted sharpshooter but it would have been interesting to get some more background information about his versatile character. The other actors and actresses are solid but have the problem to portray somewhat stereotypical characters such as the silent Asian killer, the proud Mexican assassin, the courageous Indian practising strange rituals or the brave young widow determined to seek justice and revenge. While the diversity of the cast might attract a larger audience, it feels somewhat forced and definitely unrealistic from a historic point of view.The first hour is dedicated to the introduction of the seven gunslingers, the mistreated villagers and the pitiless villains in an entertaining way. The second hour is almost entirely based upon the showdown between the gunslingers and the villagers on one side and the villain's private army trying to reconquer the village on the other side. The battle scenes are quite diversified and intense involving numerous gun fights, a very destructive Gatling gun, archery shots, explosions with dynamite, knife throwing, numerous traps and some hand-to-hand combat. Despite its length, the final battle never gets redundant. Some of the fights seem to be unrealistically exaggerated in the beginning but end up being more grounded ad realistic towards the end. Despite its generous rating, there is a lot of violence in these scenes and both sides of the belligerents have a heavy price to pay. It only fits the traditional western genre that both heroes and villains aren't invincible and politically correct but actually swearing, smoking, killing, drinking and dying in this movie. Those who were afraid to get a politically correct contemporary plastic product might be relieved that this film actually respects the original movie and its first remake as well as the style of several western classics from the sixties.In the end, there isn't anything wrong with this entertaining movie. Both traditional western aficionados and younger generations should enjoy this fast-paced western with its authentic settings, intriguing characters and furious action scenes. While this revamped version is missing Kurosawa's epic storytelling or the stunning performances by legendary actors such as Eli Wallach, Steve McQueen, Yul Brynner and Charles Bronson in the first remake, this new interpretation comes surprisingly close to the quality of these two movies and is worth to be watched at your local movie theatre.",The Magnificent Seven
67,aharmas,Action Galore,9,25 September 2016,"Years have gone without anything like ""The Magnificent Seven"", an old-fashioned western working with the basic elements of the genre. There's a really bad guy who has terrorized others for many years and is about to face a his worst enemy, a hero who believes evil can be conquered and has made it his life duty to capture those criminals on the run.When the population of a small town is threatened by this individual, a recent widow begs Chisolm (Washington) to help her get rid of the threatening situation. Next, the rest of the gang is recruited, each member with his own special personality and talent. Personalities clash, and we get a taste of the ingenuity and what the end will be like.""Seven"" is more than magnificent on its display of stunt work and state of the art visual and sound effects. It's successful because we're going back to basics in the way the good guys fight creative ways to overcome the much bigger evil forces. Bullets fly, knives hit their marks, and some dynamite is used in effective and resourceful ways. All of it choreographed so that each one of the main players has his stellar moments. Both Washington and Pratt have strong presences and an unrecognizable D'Onofrio charms us wildly.This is a movie that will keep winning its fans because it delivers the way films used to.",The Magnificent Seven
68,peterp-450-298716,Yeehaa ... The Seven notorious cowboys ride again ...,7,20 December 2016,"""If God didn't want them to be sheared, he wouldn't have made them sheep."" Anyone who made an effort to read one of my writings, knows about my opinion on remakes and milestones in film history. I'm not a supporter of digging out hit movies from the past, dusting them off and giving them a new look. In most cases nothing new will be presented. In the worst case the result will fail terribly and the final product is a lamentable bad movie. ""Ghosbusters"" was such a monstrosity in my opinion and confirmed my assertion that certain milestones are untouchable in film history (I'm afraid the remake of ""Jumanji"" will end up in that same alley). However, there are exceptions like the recent film ""The Jungle Book"". Although this is not a remake in the strictest sense of the word, but rather an adaptation of a cartoon.I'm not claiming that this version of ""The magnificent seven"" surpasses the original film from 1960. The original black and white version is and will always remain a monument. Actually, you can compare this movie with the remake of ""Robocop"". Broadly speaking there are similarities, but subtle changes make it a more contemporary version. As with ""Robocop"", you shouldn't compare it too much with the classic version. Because of a few reinterpretations and a flashy new look it's accurate to say that it's more a ""restyling"" and not a ""remake"". What are the similarities? Again there's a community being oppressed and exploited by a power-hungry villain. This time it's not about Mexican farmers whose much needed harvested food is being stolen by a Mexican gang. This time it's an ordinary town where the inhabitants have to dig for gold in a mine and they are subjected to pressure by a fierce, crazy tyrant (Peter Sarsgaard) so they would sell their property for a handful of dollars. And once again those desperate inhabitants rely on seven mercenaries who, apparently without hesitation, volunteer to assist the residents to defend themselves against the oppressors. Of course the seven gunslingers are exceptionally talented shooters and the gang bandits are as stupid as an ass. As a result these ruffians are slaughtered en masse. And also the fact that one of the heroes takes on the role of a coward, just as Robert Vaughn did in the 1960 version, is a striking similarity.The main distinction is made by the seven gunfighters. A jumble of rough men from different cultures. This way it became a politically correct film. An African-American (Denzel Washington), a Mexican (Manuel Garcia-Rulfo), an Indian (Martin Sensmeier) and a Chinese (Byung-Hun Lee) ensured the diversity of origins. In addition, they get the company of a woodsman (Vincent D'Onofrio) whose weight probably transcends his intellect effortlessly. And a womanizing cowboy (Chris Pratt) who manages to hit a target without a problem despite his drinking problem. But overall, this is nothing more than an action-packed western that entertained me immensely. I can't say it was boring. After the introduction of the main characters, one by one joining the select group, and the preparations for the big confrontation, it's time for a comprehensive firefight, using a considerably large amount of dynamite, producing an immense rain of bullets and a Gatling gun as an apotheosis. The ruthless seven are being assisted by the motivated farmers with Emma Cullen (Haley Bennett), a resident who imposed herself the task to look for help, as the leading force.""The magnificent seven"" was an entertaining film. Afterwards I could feel that youthful, boyish desire again. Once again I wished I had grown up in that period as a tough cowboy. Or I'd be such a rebellious, dusty gunslingers who shoots his opponents calmly and coolly during a gunfight. Perhaps the end was a bit overdone and the different characters weren't extensively developed. But as a spectacle it was unsurpassable. If you're looking for untruths or plot holes, you'll probably find them I suppose. But you have to admit that they have remained faithful to the greatest lie used in almost all Westerns. And that's about the shooting qualities of a cowboy. In the real Wild West even the best gunslinger couldn't hit a solid, thick oak. Even if they were standing ten meters from it. The moment you start realizing that, you better stop watching Western movies.More reviews here : http://bit.ly/1KIdQMT",The Magnificent Seven
69,Enchorde,A modern western,7,3 August 2017,"They really make far too few Westerns these days, so a remake of one of the real classic ones is one step forward. A village beset by a en evil rogue landowner, who aim to drive all the villagers away, to enhance his own fortune. The desperate villagers hire some gunslingers to save their village, and of course, everything comes down to a huge fight. A classic Western-story, straight forward and full of action. And this is both the strength and weakness.When you watch a Western you want the gunfights, the action. And this movie is packed with it. There are quite few different fights and stand offs, from the classic duel to the massive shootouts.In addition, the casting is excellent. Each of the seven is a good pick, and you mustn't forget Bennet as Emma or Saarsgard as the bad guy Bogue. They each bring another dimension to their characters, but you only get a hint of it. Unfortunately there is too little time given to exploring them. There are hints of really interesting stories in the past, how these characters came to be and came to know each other. But we get only glimpses of it. Had they managed to work more of that into the story, without losing too much of the pace, this would be another Classic. It would be Magnificent.Unfortunately it is not. It is a highly paced, action packed, very entertaining Western. But it left a little too much hidden.7/10",The Magnificent Seven
70,questl-18592,The perfectly adequate seven,6,26 February 2020,"Of all the modern westerns I've watched lately, this has definitely been the weakest. That sounds really harsh unfortunately, because this isn't bad, it's just good. It's not amazing or great or anything. Just good.Honestly, given the cast, just good kinda reinforces the notion that big ensemble often underwhelm. No one is bad here but it's all a little over the top for my liking. No one seems real. Maybe that's the idea but it just made this feel source generic.Still, it's fun and mindless. Good background fodder if nothing else.",The Magnificent Seven
71,valleyjohn,Good but not a patch on the original,8,29 September 2016,"When I first heard they were remaking The Magnificent Seven my initial thoughts were why ? Then I saw the cast and my next feelings were excitement and anticipation to see if they could get close to the 1960 classic , A film that is one of my all time favourites. The story doesn't stray too far from the original . Instead of Mexican bandits being the enemy . this time it's a mining tycoon and his men. The Seven are a little more multicultural too. We have Denzel Washington playing the Yul Brenner part , Ethan Hawke as the Robert Vaughn character and Chris Pratt playing the Steve McQueen role. There is also a native American Indian , a Mexican and Korean knife thrower. Despite the varied characters on show they all work really well together and you definitely care what happens to them. There is lots of great action as you would expect and none of the violence is gratuitous . My only gripe is that they didn't use the famous Elmer Bernstein soundtrack until the final credits .I think they missed a trick there. So the big question is , is it as good as the original ? The answer is no but it's still a solid two hours of pure entertainment.",The Magnificent Seven
72,TheOneThatYouWanted,meh.,5,7 October 2016,"Considering the caliber of the actors involved with this project. Considering the excellent source material which has been tried and tested at least twice. Considering the budget of the film, I was expecting A LOT more out of this one. Unfortunately, this is a very forgettable film because it is thrown together like a generic made for TV movie. The biggest problem with this picture is the lack of character development. You just don't care about any of the characters expect the character being played by Chris Pratt. For the first time in the history of me watching Western shootout scenes, I wanted the action to be done with because I hardly had anything invested in the characters. I'm going to blame whoever wrote the script and dialogue. Paying a dollar to see this on the big screen should be considered a crime.",The Magnificent Seven
73,jadepietro,Slow-Down at the O.K. Corral,5,25 September 2016,"(RATING: ☆☆½ out of 5 )THIS FILM IS MILDLY RECOMMENDED. IN BRIEF: Except for its climactic showdown, this movie is a slow-down.GRADE: CSYNOPSIS: A wild bunch tries to save a town from an evil land baron.JIM'S REVIEW: Magnificent it's not. Good, well, it has its moments. Like most remakes, the film becomes a weaker imitation of the original source with each subsequent offering. Mr. Fuqua's western, The Magnificent Seven (2016), pales in comparison with Akira Kurosawa's Japanese classic, The Seven Samurai, which begat John Sturges' popular 1960 western version, which brought forth this latest offering. Perhaps it suffers from too much in-breeding. Yes, this newest re-boot kept its title, but that's about all that remains in this violent, politically (in)correct mix of shoot-en-up mayhem. In this most recent version, ethnic diversity is the key in its casting, even if the names have been changed to protect the guilty. Our septet of killers now comes in all colors and shapes. The racially-profiled crew includes: Chisolm (Denzel Washington), an African-American bounty hunter, Josh Faraday (Chris Pratt) the coolest Caucasian dude and gambling' man, Goodnight Robicheaux (Ethan Hawke), a legendary ex-Confederate sharpshooter, Jack Horne (Vincent D'Onofrio), a grizzly bear of a fur trader, Billy Rocks (Byung-hun Lee), a Ninja assassin, Vasquez (Manuel Garcia-Rulfo), a Mexican bandit, and Red Harvest (Martin Senmeier), a Native American warrior...all assembled from our enjoyment. This film has the same basic set-up and well-worn story-line as its predecessors. (Let's not even include The Dirty Dozen, The Wild Bunch, or even The Hateful Eight, other films that are directly inspired and closely resemble its plot.) The leisurely-paced screenplay by Richard Wenk and Nic Pizzolatto follows the now predictable formula, bordering on this side of the cliché. The townsfolk, led by a feminist Emma Cullen (a winning Haley Bennett, looking very Jennifer Lawrence), want revenge and hire a group of low-life gunslingers to protect their town from an evil entrepreneur, Bartholomew Bogue (Peter Sarsgaard) and his gang. In this retelling, there are no Mexican bandits pillaging the town. Instead, substitute a dirty stinkin' corrupt capitalist bully who will stop at nothing to get what he wants. (The hidden agenda is not so obscure from the current political scenario found in today's headlines. Anyway, to sum it all up...they're with her,) Conflict ensues.As I stated before, the film is far from magnificent, every so often reaching a competent level of good rousing entertainment before it hankers down to its non-stop shootout ending. The cast do yeoman-like work in this ill-written roles. Particularly strong are Mr. Washington, Mr. Hawke, and Mr. Pratt. Particularly smarmy is the meaner than a junkyard dog, Mr. Sarsgaard. Particularly hammy is Mr. D'Onofrio, who is not the least bit credible or appealing. His sizable girth is ample proof of his penchant for scenery-chewing.And speaking of scenery, unappealing is the level of realism in the film's set design. The town of Rose Creek is unconvincingly off. Everything looks too clean and pristine for the Old West. Every character is so well groomed and scrubbed. Everone, and I mean everyone, has the best dang hygiene and dental work imaginable. Their teeth shine as brightly as the highly polished pearl handles on their pistols. It's like Dress-up at the O.K. Corral.Perhaps it is unfair to compare directors, but...this re-imagining lacks imagination. Mr. Fuqua does have talent and he stages the climactic fight with a degree of skill, creating some tense moments. But he has yet to achieve the directorial finesse of Sam Peckinpah or Quentin Tarrantino, true masters in this genre. (Their film work are masterclasses in well-staged action and stylish technique, even if they went the route of glorified violence and blood spatter as shock value.) Mr. Fuqua wisely reins in the gore factor, but his film needs better narrative structure, clearly-written characters, and a deeper political message. The Magnificent Seven (2016) is second tier entertainment, well-made but without much depth. It shoots from the hip too often and never take aim as it continually misses its target.Visit my blog at: www.dearmoviegoer.comANY COMMENTS: Please contact me at: jadepietro@rcn.com",The Magnificent Seven
74,rgkarim,Welcome back to the West,9,24 September 2016,"It's been a while since we had a western movie, and even longer since we had a good one. This weekend hopes to break this drought, by releasing the remake to the 1960s classic the Magnificent Seven. Does the Wild West fit into to the modern day expectations, or will the archaic times of the past fall on blind eyes? As always, I'm here to report on the latest films to hit theaters and give you the scoop. LIKES  Great Cast  True Western Film  The action!One important aspect to any Western is who you cast as the gunslingers. In this installment, the casting director gets major props for the team assembled. Denzel Washington is the perfect lead, as his attitude and bravado are choice qualities for someone a rebellion leader. Chris Pratt balances his teams martyr attitudes by providing his comedic delivery and energy helping to relieve the tension of the movie. The rest of the squad play their roles perfectly and brings a unique quality to the team to develop a unique posse. While the cast is a great start, it is only one part to the Western formula. It requires setting, simplistic goals, open frontier, lots of extras in limited clothing, and a villain you most likely will hate. Magnificent Seven brings all these aspects in splendid detail, with a modern day design many want in the 21st century. This movie will pull you back in the days of the frontier adventure you felt in the classic Westerns from riding horses through the desert wastelands to the gun slinging battles the era was famous for, you know before the hero settles into the saloon for a drink. This film is representative of the nostalgic genre Hollywood capitalized on decades ago and is devoid of extraterrestrial twists (Cowboys and Aliens) or weird mechanical spiders (Wild Wild West) to taint the well water. Yet the greatest component for me was the action of this movie. Magnificent Seven delivers the promised Western action, with massive bullet slinging battles unfolding for nearly half of the movie. One will certainly get an adrenaline rush as the two sides let their guns talk in high definition special effects at break neck speeds. Our heroes use their wits and diverse skills to keep the battle dynamic, all while poor extras convulse to imaginary bullets ""hitting"" their bodies. The ending sequence alone kep me on the edge of my seat and provided an emotionally sitmulating climax that we hope for in these movies. Yes, it is the typical, blockbuster popcorn tactics most films are famous for, but it works so well in this film. DISLIKES:  Lackluster Antagonists  Some rapid character development  Unbalanced charactersat timesAs I mentioned, Magnificent Seven certainly has villains representing the genre, but sadly they still didn't shine in this film. The land baron Bogue has all the stereotypical qualities of a baron including an insatiable greed and ruthless mechanisms to obtain his desires, but he still is quite unimpressive in other departments. Yes, I get that's the point of most Western villains, but usually they have a set of lieutenants to enforce their roles. In this film, many of the antagonists were not that impressive and many of their ""victories"" were cheap, conventionally written ploys to maximize their money. In addition, the hyped up fights sometimes are drawn to a hasty, unchoreographed conclusion that left me disappointed. Oh well, at least the uncredited extras were capable of a good shot or two. Another limitation for me was the rushed backstories of most of the characters. Magnificent Seven's cast has some complicated histories, and we get a decent look at the skeletons that dwell in their closets. There could have been more though to it though, not only to develop them more, but give some of the band more screen time. The quick overcoming of their personal fears or the convenient brotherhood formed was a little bit of a stretch for me. Fortunately they had the action to distract you from this limitation and keep the pace moving. Finally, the biggest dislike was the unbalanced use of the seven. I know, the top billed are destined to get the most screen time so directors get their money's worth. Denzel, Pratt, and Hawke lead the cavalry, complete with detailed backstory, impressive set of skills, and a majority of the lines. Our other cavalcade have their moments as well, including meme worthy one liners, impressive moves, and unique costumes to seal their place. Yet there were times where they were severely underutilized, reduced to quite mumblings or a fleeting dive into the the building. This is mainly true for the Warrior (Martin Sensmeier) and the Outlaw (Manuel Garcia-Rulfo) who although have some fitting moments, are off camera for much of the film and almost thought to be dropped out of the film at random times. The VERDICT:If you want a Western, Magnificent Seven is certainly your best shot. This production will immerse you into the world of cowboys and well more cowboys, with engaging characters for you to grip to. However, the action is the selling point of this movie and provides the exciting edge that has been lacking for much of this month. Yes, I would have liked a little more character balance and better villains, but overall I really enjoyed this movie. I certainly recommend this movie for a theater visit to a wide variety of audience members, but be warned this is a darker version of the tale you love. And darkness leads to violence that may be a bit too much for some younger audiences. My scores: Action/Western: 9.0 Movie Overall: 8.0",The Magnificent Seven
75,Kingslaay,Entertaining but somewhat forgettable,7,6 March 2017,"Magnificent seven manages to keep its head above water. There was an interesting plot and fans who were expecting a western shoot out and a lot of violence were not disappointed. The best part of the film is its all star cast. A number of fans would have queued to watch the likes of Denzel Washington, Chris Pratt and Ethan Hawke in blazing glory. The cast manage to carry the film to its enjoyable finish. However this remake was forgettable and at many times predictable. One could easily tell Denzel and a band of interesting outlaws would unite to stop the bad guys. Even Chris Pratt's secret dynamite stick that he used to sacrifice himself in the final scenes was predictable. The plot was safe enough to garner a 7 out of 10 but not in the leagues of getting an 8 or more. In my honest and humble opinion perhaps a twist on this classic would have been better. Everyone knew this was a remake of a classic including many young film watchers. Since the setting of the wild west was always fixed and never going to change perhaps a change in plot and tune would have hit this one out of the park.",The Magnificent Seven
76,vengeance20,Good for a 12 rated Western Film,8,1 October 2016,"This looked like a wannabe version of 2016's The Hateful Eight, which I must say was epic as hell! But I still went to see this & was pleasantly surprised!The film's story & plot is simple. It's executed well & quite entertaining in most parts! This is considering it's a 12 rated film, it was enjoyable & watchable both at the same time!Me personally of course, I would've liked this film to be a bit more like The Hateful Eight in terms of kills & action. But this film seemed to mange well without that even though I myself would appreciate it.I'd give this a 8/10. It was entertaining & fun to watch with some great scenes of action & humour!",The Magnificent Seven
77,bkrauser-81-311064,Brassy and Entertaining Enough,7,25 September 2016,"Magnificent Seven (1960) is on the cusp of being a no-no as far as lightning-in-a-bottle, generational classics are concerned. While not as well beloved as The Searchers (1956) or The Dollars Trilogy (1964-1966), the original Seven's star-studded and agreeable do-it- up glitz was enough to be remembered fondly without people screaming bloody murder like some other remakes made in the recent past. Plus, when it comes down to it, the same basic story has been remade already; the best version of which is a tossup between Seven Samurai (1954) and A Bug's Life (1998) depending on how willing you are to tolerate my ""nineties kid"" biases.Not all is well in the dusty town of Rose Creek. A villainous robber baron by the name of Bart Bogue (Sarsgaard) has taken over and strong-arms the townsfolk to give up their land, or else. Emma Cullen (Bennett), our young self-adjudicated angel of vengeance puts it upon herself to hire a few gunslingers to scare off Bogue's men and restore the town to its rightful owners (no not the Comanche, don't be silly). Seven men answer the call, led by Chisolm (Washington) a bounty hunter with a soft spot for maidens in distress.Just like the original, this shoot'em up western is perched atop the broad shoulders of its all-star cast who all pull their weight and differentiate themselves among the others. Ethan Hawke's sharpshooter is given a taut but emotionally satisfying arc while Denzel Washington pulls off the same shtick he's known for i.e. being in charge and having the skills to back it up. Manuel Garia- Rulfo and Vincent D'Onofrio are naturally suited for this kind of over-the-top rabble-rousing though they remain sorely underwritten. As diversity picks, Byung-hun Lee and Martin Sensmeier make a big splash playing a nebulously East Asian Jet Li impersonator and a stoic Comanche added to the team, just because.Finally there's Chris Pratt's Josh Faraday whose hard-drinking gambler proves problematic. Not because of Pratt himself, the man has enough charisma to start a cult and enough goodwill behind him to be in a Uwe Boll film and not tarnish his star. No, it's because director Antoine Fuqua and writers Richard Wenk and Nic Pizzolatto feel the need to balance, counter and otherwise parity Farday's likable and unlikable traits like they were filling out a spreadsheet. It's as if they didn't want to alienate Starlord fans so they took no risks with the character, turning him into a bizzaro analogue of Brad Dexter's Lucky from the original. Yet the original story arc was one of redemption; a bad man made selfless not a selfless man hiding virtue under smirks, wisecracks and flasks of whiskey.Yet given the near century of golden-age wild west exposure in film, it's easy to see someone like Faraday existing among the rogue gallery of devils with hearts of gold. And with a little background on the era, it's even easy to see a team of strays being cobbled together to resemble something of a rainbow coalition. Yet it's hard to let the film slide on padding over the obvious tension of having, say, a Comanche on a team that includes a man who once made a living scalping Native Americans or having a Mexican bandit join because a warrant officer cuts a poorly detailed deal with him. Lest we even bring up the elephant in the room concerning Denzel?Again, I'm not saying it's impossible for there to be a team of protectors consisting of a Confederate sharpshooter, a Comanche warrior, an Asian assassin, a Mexican bandit, a burly mountain man, a gambler and a black leader. I'm just saying it's impossible for no one to say anything about it. The fact that this is the case feels less like contemporary messaging or outright revisionism and more a movie straining to keep a PG-13 rating. The irony of course is this movie has enough cold-blooded murder to fill a small town graveyard but God forbid our characters sound like real cowboys.The Magnificent Seven is a massively entertaining, easily digestible modern western that does everything it can to make its stars look good to the detriment of making the characters larger than life. It has no compunctions as to what it is and even while being a stickler for period accuracy, I can admire its brassiness.",The Magnificent Seven
78,mhorg2018,Barely watchable unnecessary remake,1,14 February 2017,"First let me say this, even the superior 1960's version pales before the often imitated Seven Samurai. Having said that, where is the story for this? These seven guys (all politically correct as befits our wimp society) have virtually no back story. All this film and we learn next to nothing about any of them. They get together like it's nothing. No qualms, no trouble. Let's just train these cowardly townspeople. And they do so in a week. There's massive bloodshed in this but it's so lifeless I couldn't care at all. I didn't even when the good guys were getting killed. And one of them has a totally ridiculous death that took any reality out of this film. (No spoilers here - watch it and see for yourself.) How come no one ever reloads in this either? It's just shooting and shooting and shooting. At least the Indian character runs out of arrows. Really if you want to see a great western, break out Unforgiven or Open Range. This one may live on as a curiosity, but it's little more than that. Want to see a good remake? True Grit, which is a closer adaptation to the novel and isn't buried in PC crap like this.",The Magnificent Seven
79,Screen_Blitz,Well-acted retelling of the classic spaghetti western of the same name knows what it is and successfully delivers the goods it promises,7,10 September 2017,"The heroes of this shoot-em-up western action vehicle are in deed magnificent, but perhaps that is too strong of a word to describe the film as a whole. The Magnificent Seven, a remake of the 1960 classic of the same name which; itself, happens to be remake of another Japanese classic titled 'Seven Samuri' by Akira Kurosawa, is a lively take on the western genre. Scorching of charisma and elastic appeal of its well-rounded male cast, this delivers exactly what is promises if nothing more. And kudos go to director Antoine Fuqua, veteran of the action genre, on breathing life into the progressively dwindling genre, even if the film is not inspiring. After all, there is plenty to be pleased about watching a cast of A- listers get wired up in a violent shoot-em-up frenzy as they come face-to-face with the evildoers against justice. Although Fuqua never aims for anything grand in depth, his execution bears solid evidence that he knows how to have fun with the genre, as does the cast. Set in 1879, this film follows African-American gunslinger Sam Chisolm (played by Denzel Washington) who is rallies up a group of outlaws consisting of bar gambler Josh Farraday (played by Chris Pratt), Southern gunslinger Goodnight Robicheaux (played by Ethan Hawke), his Asian sidekick Billy Rocks (played by Byung Hun-Lee), Native American explorer Jack Horne (played by Vincent D'Onofrio), Mexican hunter Vasquez (played by Manuel Garcia-Rulfo), and an Indian archer nicknamed Red Harvest (played by Martin Sensmaier). Together, these courageous outlaws prepare for a fight against a league of bandits lead by the ruthless Bartholomew Bogue (played by Peter Sarsguard) who has threatened the poor villagers of the old town of Red Grove including young mistress Emma Cullen (played by Haley Bennett) who watches as her husband is murdered in cold blood.What Antoine Fuqua brings to this loud western vehicle is more about stimulating the adrenaline than challenging viewers with a cerebral- generated story. As an old-fashioned spaghetti western action flick, this movie certainly delivers while not taking itself too seriously. But it does it add anything new that we haven't already seen in the genre? Definitely not. But with a filmmaker like Fuqua capitalizing on snappy action set pieces and occasional bursts of clutch humor and dialogue to the already not-too-serious tone, the movie accomplishes what it sets out to be -- nothing more, nothing less. Reasonably- paced and brutally faithful to the genre, the movie takes wide advantage of its PG-13 rating with an excess of loud gun shootouts, especially in the final sequence when Fuqua unleashes a full throttle of sound and fury as our heroes face up against Peter Sarsguard and his evil minions in a violent shoot-em- up parade. Things only get heated when the antagonist pulls out a gatling gun and showers the old town in a wild orgy of bullets and explosions rippling through the buildings. But what about the cast? Consisting of a racially diverse plethora of well to moderately-known actors, this film makes a fortune feat of allowing these actors to show out their charisma. Denzel Washington, a newcomer to the western genre, is fabulous. Chris Pratt is appealing as usual, nothing too surprising. Ethan Hawk, reuniting with Washington after their first collaboration in Fuqua's 'Training Day' back in 2001, has his moments. Peter Sarsguard gives an ingenious portrayal as the villain with a gritty magnitude. Vincent D'Onofrio, Byung Hun-Lee, Martin Sensmaier, and Manuel Garcia-Rulfo are decent in their roles, but nothing too memorable. After all, none of these actors are particularly going for the gold. But is important is they appear to be having just as much fun as we do while the film last. And shoutout to the late James Horner who composes a fantastic score to suit the western atmosphere. The Magnificent Seven is a solid western remake of its classic source material gifts full display on sweet performances, pulse- pounding action set pieces, and a blissful taste of the western genre. Sure, this movie leaves no landmark nor should it be expected to. But for what it accomplishes, be prepared for have a good time while you watch as the actors leave their guns blazing.",The Magnificent Seven
80,Troy_Campbell,An energetic and highly entertaining Western.,8,29 September 2016,"The Western has long become a rarity on the big screen, replaced over the last few decades as the dominant action genre first by bulging muscles and explosions, then by spandex and superpowers. So this big-budget remake of the 1960 classic comes as a welcome breath of tobacco-filled air, even if it doesn't quite live up to its predecessor. But as a piece of popcorn entertainment, it fires on all cylinders. Not surprisingly with Antoine Fuqua (Training Day, The Equalizer, Shooter) calling the shots, subtlety is pushed aside for frenetic set pieces and belief-defying heroics, especially in the wild climactic showdown that demonstrates minimal CGI does not equal minimal fun. Amongst all the balletic gunplay and macho posturing there's a relatively simple story: town is overrun by a dastardly villain (Peter Sarsgaard oozing creepiness), town employs cowboys-for-hire (guess how many) for protection, town fights with said cowboys leading the way. That the plot requires little more explanation then that highlights the focus of the movie, for better and for worse, however the fact it never feels shallow or superficial can be attributed to the exhilarating action and the ultra-cool cast. And what a fantastic cast it is. Denzel Washington is reliably charismatic as the contemplative leader, Chris Pratt is magnetic as the group's joker, Ethan Hawke is intense as the tormented sniper, Byung-hun Lee is enigmatic as the blade-wielding assassin, Vincent D'Onofrio is intriguing as the philosophical killer and Haley Bennett is fierce as the townswoman who stands her ground. Best of all, the eclectic characters – also including Manuel Garcia-Rulfo as the rowdy Mexican and Martin Sensmeier as the Indian warrior – share a wonderful chemistry that makes them utterly watchable from start to finish.

I strongly recommend that Mr. Fuqua, the director take this film off his resume. It takes away from all his good work. Denzel? What in the world were you thinking as well as Ethan Hawke and all the rest of the cast. First of all, just go see the original and anyone who does will immediately come to their senses with little of no effort and understand without explanation how good a Western can be. You will probably watch it twice as I have seen it maybe 30 times. That is where the word ""magnificent"" belongs and not in this remake in any way. Mass random shootings & killings with might makes right is not suspense or good story-telling. This movie came across as hollow and plastic for script, acting and plot. This is movie is like a video game of some sort where you get to pick a character and then kill as many people as you can. Mindless in presentation, severe lack of character development, egotistical parading of look at me I am in a Western and riding a horse and shooting guns is more of a display of embarrassment that I had for all the people in this movie. Here's an interesting thought. Why didn't all these folks just get together and make a movie any movie? Calling this a remake? I am surprised that critics are not all over this and telling the truth about how bad it is. Methinks the fix is in. All I can say is that if anyone likes this type of Western portrayed here, in this way and style, The Western as we know it is doomed at least for this generation. Shame on everyone in this movie for charging money to go see this. A refund is in order for all plus an apology. Enough said....",The Magnificent Seven
83,drjgardner,The OK 7,6,23 September 2016,"Come on now. If you're going to re-make ""The Magnificent 7"" let's do it magnificently. Where was that great music? Where is the superlative cast that include Yul Brynner, Eli Wallach, Steve McQueen, Charles Bronson, James Coburn, and Vladimir Sokoloff? You might argue that Denzel Washington and Chris Pratt are on a level with Brynner and McQueen, but I wouldn't. Pratt certainly has potential, but he doesn't yet have McQueen's star power. The rest are pale imitations, except perhaps for an unbelievably fat Vincent D'Onofrio who is certainly entertaining.This is a modern re-telling. You might call it the Diversity 7. The producers threw in just about every minority you can think of – Mexican, Asian, Black, Woman. The only thing missing was a ""little"" person .Personally I liked the idea of the woman, played very well by Haley Bennett who has been with Washington before (""The Equalizer"").An action film like this works only when the villain is villainous. Eli Wallach was terrific. Peter Sarsgaard wouldn't scare a fly.Don't get me wrong. I enjoyed it. It's OK, but it's not magnificent.",The Magnificent Seven
84,sharky_55,I seek righteousness. But I'll take revenge.,7,15 January 2017,"With 2016's The Magnificent Seven, director Antoine Fuqua reaches back into the past, shooting the frontier in widescreen CinemaScope compositions, and with colour grading so saturated that it would put the most vivid Technicolor films to shame. The opening confirms the mining town of Rose Creek to be perpetually bathed in golden hour sunlight - cinematographer Mauro Fiore seems afraid to show the full face, so each of the fearful and distrusting townsfolk's visages are dramatically bisected by shadow and light. We see the grandiosity of the mountains overhead, the smoky camps, the frequent blasts of the mining dynamite. And everyone has their faces scrubbed with dirt to make sure we know they are hard, toiling folk. But it's shot in digital, and looks far too crisp and clean for that to be really believable. When the camera cranes up to unveil the entire town under watch of the church bell, smoke stacks from honest businesses and all, it doesn't seem all that bad. Hell, Back to the Future Part III had the same shot and a nearly as dirty wild west. Pratt stands out most of all, and not just because he's one of the designated comic relief roles. When the group first ride into town and confront the bandits, they invoke the Clint Eastwood rule: the side who cares the least (and looks the coolest) is the most powerful. It's not so much a showdown as it is a strut-off, cutting from steely gaze to steely gaze, each stroking their weapon. And Pratt, with that model physique and cheeky grin, seems to be enjoying himself a little too much. The history of the western through this film series is simply put. John Ford popularised the genre, lifting it out of B-movie aspirations and onto the grand stage. A certain Kurosawa fell in love with American cinema as a kid, and absorbed its western myths; he saw the drifter, the masculine morality, and recognised that the samurai could be a decent re-imagining of the prototypical figure. And Hollywood, brilliant as they are, copied him straight back. There have been several 'deaths' of the western since (The Wild Bunch, Unforgiven), and although it's never been truly buried, these days audiences have seen it all. So it is no surprise that several recent westerns have gone the way of post-modern pastiche - they are twisted, ironic, detached, with the violence usually as a point of humour rather than serious climax (Django Unchained, True Grit). Fuqua's version is mostly played straight, but there's one of the seven that fits this mould: D'Onofrio's Jack Horne. The hulking force of nature takes down two men with an axe sticking out of his head before he even speaks, and what comes out is a squeaky, high pitched whimper, and our first impression is to laugh. The character is straight out of a Coen movie; at one point he abandons all pretense and straight up spear tackles a bandit off his horse. He is also religiously inspired and believes that his 'race' of giants are destined to cleanse the earth of Native Americans, never mind that he is on the same side as one. The nature of the character and the breeziness of the film give him a nice heroic death, but hastily sidesteps these tricky questions.An interesting side-plot manifests in Hawke's Goodnight Robicheaux, who has a name as audacious as his reputation for being a Civil War sharpshooter. Robicheaux is a cool customer like any of the seven initially, until the bullets start whizzing about and the trauma of his war exploits is unearthed. In 1879, there was of course no such thing as PTSD, and in film you can't directly acknowledge it, but indirectly it seems to suggest it with his fleeing before the storm. I thought this might have been an opportunity to subvert the western figure - Hawke's never been the action type anyway - but Fuqua simply can't resist the temptation to have him heroically burst back into the fold. It's all very old fashioned, harking back to a time where westerns were plentiful and men were men. After all, would the great American hero John Wayne ever run from a fight? The rest of the crew is assembled in about ten minutes, swiftly plucked from whatever showboating of their skills that they were going through. ""Good, we got a Mexican,"" quips Pratt when they recruit Vasquez. Also rounding out the the gang is a knife-wielding Korean and a Comanche bow-master; they are truly the Avengers of the west. Denzel Washington himself emerges from the hazy heat of the desert, striding into town as the tall, dark stranger, and we see the typical horrified reaction shots from the townsfolk as he rides past. It's a role that Washington has played before and well; capable, multilingual (his ability to traverse socioeconomic boundaries in Training Day), moral, and he even gets the tragic backstory. But he also possesses the charisma and resolve to commandeer the defense, and the pathos to sell this vengeance against Bogue. Nostalgic naysayers might be want to remember that Yul Brynner was as robotic as they come, faring much better as a murderous android in Westworld. His clumsy philosophising is also visible here: the townsfolk win, while the seven lose, in addition to more than half of their gang. The ironic thing is, with today's cinematic demands of action, they've done more damage to Rose Creek than before they arrived.",The Magnificent Seven

That alone, puts it as a 6 points ""good"" (barely) movie. It works. It's fine.But it does lack depth. The characters joins the growing group without much of a motivation/reason. The cultural, social and racial differences of the extremely diverse cast, reduced to a handful of lines here and there, and not even used for jokes/funny situations between the characters. Finally, the story was the most simple and honestly boring type, with extremely defined roles of ""the good guys vs. the bad guys"".I hadn't seen the original, nor the truly original from Kurosawa, so my critic was not influenced by a the hate or love for them.",The Magnificent Seven
87,dglink,A Magnificently Diverse Seven,7,24 December 2017,"Possibly inspired by the successful remakes, or better said, retakes on the classic westerns ""True Grit"" and ""3:10 to Yuma,"" director Antoine Fuqua's ""The Magnificent Seven"" is an appealing take on the 1960 classic, which starred Yul Brynner, Steve McQueen, Charles Bronson, Eli Wallach, Robert Vaughn, and James Coburn. Fuqua's version cannot compete with the John Sturges original in star power; Denzel Washington is the only cast member in the same league with Brynner, McQueen, Bronson, and Coburn. However, the film boasts a few fine supporting players like Peter Sarsgaard as the slimey Bartholomew Bogue, who is out to ruthlessly grab land from under a town of peaceful God-fearing homesteaders; Sarsgaard is only missing a black mustache to twirl as the personification of the Bad Guy. Vincent D'Onofrio is colorful as Jack Horne, whose girth nearly qualifies the film to be ""The Magnificent Seven and a Half,"" and Ethan Hawke is fine as Goodnight Robicheaux, a gambler with issues and a Chinese sidekick. 
Led by an African-American law officer, Fuqua's seven are an almost comically diverse group of strays that reflect today's America far more than the earlier cast. Denzel Washington is Chisholm, who is enlisted by the beleaguered townspeople, headed by a strong-willed widow, Emma Cullen, played by Haley Bennett. Reluctantly accepting the challenge to rid the town of Bogue, Chisholm assembles a motley crew that includes a Comanche Indian with a Mohawk haircut, the Chinese sidekick, an overweight senior citizen, the aforementioned widow, a Mexican, a Confederate veteran, and a hunky white guy played by Chris Pratt. These magnificent seven are about as politically correct as any central casting could conceive.Inspired by Akira Kurosawa's ""Seven Samurai,"" the story is simple, straightforward, and familiar. Penned by Nic Pizzolatto and Richard Wenk, the film arguably lingers too long on the introductory sequences for each character. However, the threads pull together and lead to an effective action-packed climax, which is fun, but as implausible as is the assembly of such a diverse group of gun people on the late-19th-century frontier. The film features a fine score by the late James Horner, but the iconic Elmer Bernstein theme is missed, although heard briefly over the closing credits. With Washington as a solid lead, ""The Magnificent Seven"" is an above-average western remake that just misses the high marks hit by ""True Grit"" and ""3:10 to Yuma,"" but remains entertaining nevertheless.",The Magnificent Seven

89,RforFilm,"It's unique changes, great cast, and an explosive climax make The Magnificent Seven a fun remake of a Western Classic",9,27 September 2016,"Within the dust of the west, contains evidence of fierce battles and rousing gunfights that shaped towns and helped evolved the states to become what they are today. Legends like Billy the Kid, Doc Holiday, Wyatt Earp, and gangs like the Cowboys have inspired several stories that have been enjoyed for decades. People tend to forget that before we launched into space, the western genre was very popular. In this day in age, westerns seem old fashioned and are hard to compete with in the day and age of CGI blockbusters. While I can understand the issues that people would have with them (history of Native Americans, the grittiness, etc), it's material like that that helps us understand our history. One of the most well known westerns is the original The Magnificent Seven from 1960. It was an American remake of Seven Samurai that told about the seven gunmen who helped defend a Mexican village of bullying bandits. While I don't see it as one of the greatest movies, it's a fun action movie that contains one of the most memorable musical themes from the late great Elmer Bernstein. The new The Magnificent Seven figured that with it's famous legacy, it had to make changes. Instead of a Mexican village being terrorized by bandits, we are now in Rose Creek, California where a sociopath industrialist Bartholomew Bouge (played by Peter Sarsgaard) has total control of the nearby mines who also has the Sheriff on his payroll and several agents on his side. During a Sunday Church service, he forces them out, burns the chapel down, and then murders a bunch of farmers that tried to stand up to him. One of the farmers wives, Emma Cullen (played by Haley Bennett) rides to a nearby town for help and comes across bounty hunter Sam Chisolm (played by Denzel Washington).Upon hearing who the industrialist is, Chisolm agrees to come and find other gunslingers. His seven consists of gambler Josh Faraday (played by Chris Pratt), sharpshooter Goodnight Robicheaux (played by Ethan Hawke), Knife-wielding master Billy Rocks (played by Byung-hun Lee), tracker hunter Jack Horne (played by Vincent D'Onofrio), Comanche warrior Red Harvest (played by Martin Sensmeier) and Mexican outlaw Vasquez (played by Manuel Garcia-Rulfo). The seven and Emma return to Rose Creek to help prepare the remaining townsfolk for Bouge's army that's going to arrive. Gun battles, TNT explosions, and everything you'd expect in a Western are all here.The summer had been home to a lot of remakes, so something like The Magnificent Seven you'd think would fall into the period of white noise where it could get lost. Luckily, like the Pete's Dragon remake, this retelling made plenty of changes to make it a different while keeping the same plot of people hired to defend others against bullies. Like before, the building to the big stand off is slow, but I think they make the character's interesting enough that you want to follow them on horseback.A story like this (which has been told countless times since Seven Samurai) requires some good actors as our team of seven. This is also the case as Denzel Washington always does well with the majority of his part, as seems to work well with Chris Pratt who is defiantly at home as this gambler. The rest of the team are enjoyable to watch as they interact with each other. One of the major differences here is that unlike the 1969 original, the team is mixed with several ethnicities. I appreciate how that unlike Ghostbusters which kept emphasizing that women are now leading, this one simply gives us our select gunslingers without question. You simply have to accept them what they are.I'll say that without a doubt, the duel between the town and the villain's army is great. It may not be one of the best action scenes of all time, but they do almost everything they could imagine with their surroundings. If I did have any problems, they'd be that some of the buildup can be a little too slow, like when they pull off that trope where one guy says he's not going to help when you know very well he'll eventually come around. I wish they'd just skip that. I'll give this nine western comics out of ten. The Magnificent Seven is a nice return to a fun western. This is defiantly darker and grittier then the Yul Brynner story, but it's a modern movie, so you have to expect that. Rather then including a lot of modernisms like A Million Ways to Die in the West or a really out there concept like Cowboys & Aliens, this is a simple story that is taken to the right level. This remake can proudly ride into the sunset.",The Magnificent Seven

93,bankofmarquis,Excellent Action-Adventure Shoot 'em Up,9,26 September 2016,"I went into the screening of Antioine Fuqua's remake of the 1960 classic western THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN with the attitude of ""how dare they make a remake of a classic, can't they just leave well enough alone."" I left the screening realizing that I just saw a motion picture that might bring back the Western.For, THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN is one terrific motion picture.Fuqua has all the elements at play here - a good cast (Denzel Washington, Chris Pratt, Ethan Hawke, Vincent D'Onofrio, etc...), an easy to follow plot (7 strangers come together to save a town from the bad guys), tightly directed and shot action sequences with enough humor thrown in to make it a fun 2 hour romp in the movie theater.The first half of this film is all about getting to know the ""7"" as they get together. Fuqua, rightfully, takes his time with this as each one of the ""7"" has their own personality and quirk. This deliberate pacing pays off in the action scenes of the movie. I found myself rooting for these guys and waited for each one to pull out their peculiar skill to help advance things along.The performances of the ""7"" is what pays this off. Start with the always dependable Denzel Washington as the leader of the ""7"", Sam Chisolm. He, mysteriously, takes on the task of defending this town from an army of bad guys and brings steely-eyed determination to his work. He brings an ""everything is going to be all right"" confidence and attitude to his performance and I was able to sit back and enjoy it. He is ably assisted by relative newcomers Byung-hun Lee as Billy Rocks - charming and devastating as the man with the knives, Manual Garcia-Rulfo as Mexican Outlaw Vasquez, tough on the outside, soft on the inside, and Martin Sensmeier as no nonsense ""loner"" Indian sharp shooter (with the bow and arrow) Red Harvest. All these performances/characters are strong, but they take a back seat to extremely strong work put in by 3 film veterans...Ethan Hawk, an actor who I am usually Luke-warm on, re-teams up with his training day director and co-star to bring his best performance (at least for me) as legendary killer Goodnight Robicheaux, the always-interesting Vincent D'Onofrio shows quirkiness, humor and charm to slightly crazy tracker Jack Horne, and good-ol' dependable Chris Pratt reprising his ""charming rogue"" persona as gambler Josh Faraday, except he is not, he brings something else to this character that I haven't seen from Pratt before - a layer of darkness. It was refreshing to see Pratt add to his arsenal and makes me yearn to see him in a straight dramatic role, I think he'd be terrific.Fuqua, then, takes these ""7"" and ratchets up the action in such a way that works very well. He is very good at laying out where everyone is, what their job is and why it is important, so that when the bullets start flying and the bodies start dropping you know what is going on and it is not just a bunch of quick cuts to people shooting for no reason at all.Is it a perfect film? Not quite. Maybe the bulb was burning out in the movie theater I saw this film at, but the first part of the movie seemed to not have enough light to see what was going on. Perhaps this was a choice to show the darkness that our heroes need to come out of, but I'm not that deep and I just wanted to see what is going on. Also, the villain of the piece, Peter Sarsgaard, was a little too non-dimensional for my tastes - especially in comparison to the 3 dimensional, ""real people"" you get with the 7 and there is a fight scene between Red Harvest and a Native American bad guy that was way too short for me (perhaps there is a longer cut of this fight that will come out on the DVD). But these all are quibbles to an otherwise top-notch action adventure that will, most certainly, inspire other westerns and other remakes.I've got a suggestion for you, Mr. Fuqua, how about remaking The Dirty Dozen, next?9 (out of 10) stars and you can take that to the Bank (of Marquis)",The Magnificent Seven

95,dave-mcclain,"""The Magnificent Seven"" is a worthy successor to its 1960 namesake, but not quite what I'd call well, you know.",6,23 September 2016,"Few remakes have such an impressive pedigree as 2016's ""The Magnificent Seven"" (PG-13, 2:12). It's a remake of the 1960 film of the same name, which was a remake of Japan's ""Seven Samurai"" from 1954. The Japanese film was an original work of legendary director Akira Kurosawa, who co-wrote, directed and edited it. Critics consistently rank ""Seven Samurai"" as one of the greatest movies ever made. Just six years after that film, the original ""The Magnificent Seven"" became a classic in its own right, translating the action from feudal Japan to 19th century Mexico. That one starred Hollywood legends like Yul Brynner, Eli Wallach, Steve McQueen, Charles Bronson, Robert Vaughn and James Coburn. The 2016 remake comes from acclaimed director Antoine Fuqua (""Training Day"", ""Brooklyn's Finest"", ""Southpaw"") and stars Denzel Washington, Chris Pratt, Vincent D'Onofrio and Ethan Hawke. It also contains the last film score composed by James Horner (an Oscar-winner for ""Titanic""), who died in a 2015 plane crash.The 21st century version of ""The Magnificent Seven"" maintains the western motif, but moves the action north of the border. The tiny California town of Rose Creek is being terrorized by mining mogul Bartholomew Bogue (Peter Sarsgaard), who is just as likely to offer a pittance to buy out local farmers as he is to simply take their land – and kill anyone who so much as looks at him sideways. One of the townspeople by the name of Emma Cullen (Haley Bennett) offers all of the town's money to a bounty hunter called Sam Chisholm (Washington) to fight Bogue. The money gets Chisholm's attention, but he is also moved by compassion for the victims of Bogue's greed and violence – and has a very personal reason for agreeing to help. For this job, Chisholm gathers six more men: local gambler Josh Faraday (Pratt), skilled tracker Jack Horne (D'Onofrio), feared sharpshooter Goodnight Robicheaux (Hawke), lethal knife-fighter Billy Rocks (Byung-hun Lee), Mexican outlaw Vasquez (Manuel Garcia-Rulfo) and Comanche warrior Red Harvest (Martin Sensmeier). As a group, their skills are magnif VERY impressive.Before the inevitable showdown with Bogue himself, the Seven have a number of obstacles to overcome. First, these very different men have to learn to get along – or, at least, trust each other. Then, they have to get past the mistrust and fear of the locals – who are far from united about how to deal with their situation. There's also the issue of the defense of the town requiring more than seven men (as mag skilled as they might be), so these hired guns set out to train the townsfolk to fight – or, at least, try to. Of course, when Bogue hears about all this, he's going to counter with a small army of his own, which is going to require resourcefulness and strategy on the part of the defenders of Rose Creek.""The Magnificent Seven"" is a worthy successor to its 1960 namesake, but not quite what I'd call well, you know. The ethnically and racially diverse cast (with actors actually matching the backgrounds of their characters) brings an interesting dynamic to the story (and better reflects the diversity of the Old West). Fuqua's direction and the screenplay adaptation by Nic Pizzolatto and Richard Wenk give us plenty of character development (maybe even a little too much) and the performances are all great – especially from the little-known Bennett. The characters and the plot are appropriately compelling, but some of the plot points strain credulity and the story still feels a bit stale. Fuqua tries to amp up the action with a high body count, showing us very little blood, but treating the dispatching of so many people (both bad guys and good guys), with a casualness that some Movie Fans will find disconcerting. This is quality cinematic entertainment, but runs longer and is more violent than necessary. Rather than ""magnificent"", I'd call it ""very good"" and give it a ""B"".",The Magnificent Seven

Sure, it's a fun movie, a big gunfight battle at the end and big name actors strutting in cowboy boots, but there is no real purpose or direction. The movie is popcorn fun to help fill the months between peak Fall Oscar season and the end of summer blockbusters. The Magnificent Seven straddles the line between blockbuster and serious film.The movie is packed full of big actors as most of the seven are recognizable names and even some of the minor roles are faces that are familiar. Rising star Haley Bennett plays Emma Cullen, a widow who recruits a bounty hunter to help her take down a robber baron. Bennett is on the rise with an impressive year starting with Hardcore Henry and also looking forward to Girl on a Train. Denzel Washington plays the bounty hunter Sam Chisolm who agrees to help the town and beings recruitment. His first recruit is a card shark Josh Faraday (Chris Pratt).

But I was surprised to have my expectations reset.Possibly on the basis that Trump has been given the Mexican's a good bashing lately, the villain of the piece in this film is updated from Mexican bandit Calvera to Sacremento based land-snatcher and all round bad-egg Bartholomew Bogue (an expressionless Peter Sarsgaard). After ripping through some of the inhabitants of Rose Creek in a brutal pre-title sequence, widowed sharp-shooter Emma Cullen (Haley Bennett, ""The Equalizer"") heads into the West on a recruiting mission for hired guns. She first recruits the bounty hunter Chisholm (sing ""Chisum, John Chisum"" no, sorry different Western) played by Denzel Washington. Washington matches Yul Brynner's famous black outfit, and unlike Brynner is obviously able to finish off the ensemble naturally! They recruit another six (who'd have thought it?) including wise-guy gambler Faraday (Chris ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" Pratt); famed confederate sniper Goodnight Robicheaux (Ethan Hawke); his nifty knife throwing Asian sidekick (but good for the Far East box office) Billy Rocks (Bjung-hun Lee, from Terminator: Genisys); and religious bear-of-a-man Indian-hunter Jack Horne (Vincent D'Onofrio, ""Jurassic World""). After trying to whip the incompetent townsfolk into shape, and setting some Home-Alone style surprises, the stage is set for a showdown as Bogue whips up an army to re-take ""his"" town.I like classic Westerns, with John Ford's Rio Bravo being a particular favorite. In my view the problem with many modern Westerns is that they try too hard to shock (Tarentino's recent ""Hateful 8"" was a case in point: a promising start ruined by gratuitous over-the-top violence). ""The Magnificent Seven"" doesn't make that mistake, and while the squib-master and blood-bag boy are heavily employed throughout, nothing is too excessive: in fact, my view – and I don't often tend in this direction – is that the censors rather over-egged the UK 12A rating on this one and could have gone with a 12. Director Antoine Fuqua has produced a film that is highly respectful of its heritage: perhaps to the point where many scenes might be deemed to be clichéd. But I personally warmed to that.Denzel Washington was born to be in a Western like this and the emerging Chris Pratt does his star potential no harm by turning in a stellar performance adding both levity – with some whip-sharp lines - and screen presence in the role made famous by Steve McQueen. (Although no one comes close to the screen presence of McQueen. Look up ""real man"" in the dictionary and his picture is there!) Also effective is Ethan Hawke in the nearest thing to the Robert Vaughan character in this film.Where the adapted script by Richard Wenk and Nik Pizzolatto falters somewhat is in the motivations of the characters, which come across as superficial and unconvincing. (Perhaps ""selling"" was a whole lot easier in the Old West?) It is even unclear at the end of the film whether the survivors (and I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but the seven don't all make it!) actually take their payment, or even a ""share of the gold"" that the town is sitting on. It makes for an unsatisfactory closure. The degree of racial harmony present in the film is also difficult to buy into, and the script could have made something more of this.The film soundtrack marks the swan-song of the late James Horner, so tragically killed in a plane crash last year at the age of just 61. As the natural successor to the great John Williams and the late Jerry Goldsmith, Horner's loss was a terrible one. The film is dedicated to him. Although the soundtrack was completed by Simon Franglen, there are flourishes of classic Horner, most notably in the first Rose Creek showdown scene. There is also a treat to the ears over the closing credits which is very welcome.Although the film draws natural comparison with its 5* classic predecessor, this is a good film in its own right – a genuinely pleasant surprise. Perhaps its done well enough that we might get to now see a remake of ""The Return of the Seven"". I hope so... ""the Western is dead... long live the Western""!(Please visit bob-the-movie-man.com for the graphical version of this review. Thanks).",The Magnificent Seven
98,witster18,So Wrong Yet So Right on So Many Levels,7,27 December 2016,"Mild if any spoilers!The Magnificent Seven WILL divide critics and movie-buffs alike, but this modern day take on the old series will endear itself to the popcorn-fun casual viewer.TM7 is directed by Antoine Fuqua of ""Southpaw"" and ""Training Day"" fame, so I went in with some high expectations because the director, the cast, and the trailer.I got exactly what I expected in terms of movie. The film rehashes an early seen from Django(and other classic westerns), and it is full of more clichés than one could possibly imagine.I know right away what the other criticisms will be. The dialogue, which is historically incorrect in so many ways, the costumes(same issue), and the diverse casting decisions. And in the end, I don't give a rats about any of it. Why?The Magnificent Seven is truly magnificent entertainment. It's beautifully shot, the dialog isn't period correct but it isn't bad either, and the revenge quotient and action is enough to satisfy anyone's needs in those departments. Sure, Fuqua takes so many liberties here, but the care in terms of production, the acting, the characters, and the pacing make for one hell of a fun ride. Sure, there will be that large portion of critics and movie buffs that will not allow themselves to get past certain aspects and enjoy the film, perhaps not even credit the film for some stuff that is undeniably fantastic(the look/cinematography). Ask yourself one question: are you capable of enjoying what they call a popcorn flick? A really good one? Because that is what this is. It's a film that I could watch over and over again personally. My wife absolutely LOVED it. I think it's a great date-action flick, and again, for those that like ""revenge quotient"" films, it certainly fits the bill. It won't win many(if any) awards, but the characters, cinematography, and action make-up for many historical inaccuracies and slams to the traditional western genre.I recommend this.Some will hate me and some will love me for it. It's not a win-win ""useful review"" proposition, but I WILL be buying this blu ray. The irony is in as many ways as he spits in the face of traditional westerns, Fuqua elevates, modernizes, and gives homage the genre, even makes it more accessible for a younger generation. It's one of the most entertaining and best looking films I've seen in 2016. How bad can it be? I'd disregard any reviews at the bookends. I don't think there's anyway that one could make much of an argument to rate this a 1 OR a 10.I also don't see anyway, in a year that is lagging a bit in terms of a strong top 25(albeit through 47/89), that this film won't hold a spot next spring. Enjoy the movie. If you're gonna nitpick a million little things and disregard some the fine production values, action, and overall popcorn value, then just don't even watch-it. If you watch amazing shot after amazing shot without saying a word, and then harp about a costume or a word they used that they wouldn't have in that period, then go re-watch a Lars Von Trier or Mallick film and tell us about how we all don't understand it - because smart people OBVIOUSLY can't enjoy a film for just being entertaining, or can they?",The Magnificent Seven
99,davyd-02237,Interesting remake!,7,5 February 2019,"Not in the class as Brynner, McQueen etc, but some interesting variations upon the theme. A Mexican, an Indian, someone who I would describe as of ""Japanese"" type origin. You never really find out what the pay is. The villain is seriously vile. Musically not as good as its predecessor. Save for Denzel the cast is probably not as well known and they are quite a different bunch come together at the request of a woman on behalf of frightened villagers (not Mexican-in this case). The big showdown which has to come is lengthy, so don't take your eyes off the screen. Well worth a watch, maybe two. The original I would suspect you will watch over and over.

100,Hayden-86055,The great but not Magnificent Seven,8,25 October 2020,"Going on to this I had very high hopes, Chris Pratt, Denzel Washington, Ethan Hawke and Haley Bennet are all big stars. Acting wise I can't fault this film, a bit stale in some places and with little chemistry but overall very impressive.Action wise is where it peaks, what fantastic practical effects this had. I was almost surprised when watching the special features on the DVD at how much of the stunts all the actors did, very impressive that's for sure! The gunfights were exciting and shot in such a good way that you understood what was happening too. The sets were very authentic and obviously a lot of effort was gone into making them.The villain was pretty good (although I didn't quite get his motive) but no where near as magnificent as the great Eli Wallach in the original. He was suitably slimy whilst being a formidable gunfighter though.8/10: A remake that's worth a watch, not as good as the original but stands well enough in its own right, Denzel Washington is brilliant and the music was surprisingly epic. An underrated film",The Magnificent Seven
101,Carycomic,One of the better exceptions to the usual Hollywood rule about remakes sucking like a chest wound.,10,25 September 2016,"Northern California, 1879: Sam Chisholm is a deputy Federal marshal who just also happens to be a gun-slinging Negro--as African-Americans were more commonly known in the 19th century--with a mysterious past! Yet, despite that social handicap (or, perhaps, because of it), he is recruited by the recently-widowed Ellen Cullen to help liberate the town of Rose Creek from the tyrannical clutches of Bartholomew Bogue.A ruthless mining company owner, Bogue is determined to drive out all the local homesteaders, along with anyone else not able-bodied enough to work his nearby gold mine for slave wages. And all attempts to organize resistance against him are mercilessly suppressed by a small army of trigger-happy ""detectives""...led by a ruthless Apache ex-cavalry scout.To aid him in this seemingly foredoomed mission, Chisholm recruits a Bible-quoting mountain man; a Comanche brave-in-exile; a tejano pistolero; a knife-throwing Chinese martial artist; a Cajun sniper with a growing case of gun-shyness; and a brash young thrill-seeking cardsharp. Can this septet of oddly-assorted loners unite themselves, as well as the townspeople, before the inevitable retaliation? Well, as someone who has watched the original MAGNIFICENT SEVEN on TV, for forty- six out of the last fifty-seven years, I can truthfully say.... ...you bet your a**!Ride 'em cowboy!!

102,brankovranjkovic,Magnificent 7 – Ride again,9,25 September 2016,"It's a risky move to remake a film that's already been told twice, the last time (in the 60's), a very well reputed western and the version before that (in the 50's) being a truly excellent Japanese samurai epic.So what do we have here – a film based on a familiar plot, with familiar characters and familiar well-known outcome? Looks like a recipe for disaster – WRONG! If you're becoming bored with Marvel superhero films then this offers an alternative anti-hero style film.The cast here are more diverse than in previous versions but I feel they were perfectly chosen for the current time, you gradually get to know and care about each of the characters. The film also has a great mixture of comedy, bright one-liners are thrown into some scenes, sometimes lessening the tension.Looking at the trailer I had great expectations. The film revolves around an assembly of goodhearted criminals and eccentrics, who soon unite over a common cause, specifically the take down of a particularly threatening villain with land grabbing intentions, if he wanted something then he'd just take it! So the film begins. Initially the group's motivation was all about financial reward but ended with being all about pride and honour. It was fascinating to watch the seven anti-heroes slowly banter and bicker their way to becoming a formidable force.The second act takes us through planning and training the townsfolk to help fight the villain, who returns with an army of 100's and also a Gatling gun.The third act provides the most action and atmosphere, while the epic battle finale is a spine tingling climax. How it managed to gain a cert 12A is totally beyond me, you could easily mistake this for a cert 15.Very highly recommended.",The Magnificent Seven
103,qormi,Very original remake,8,7 March 2020,"This adaptation was true to the period. We see unshaven men, which was the norm in 1879. People looked and acted like you would expect from rural Americans of the time. The cast of characters comprising the seven were indeed a group of badass guys nobody would want to mess with. Denzel Washington was a commanding presence as their leader and Chris Pratt provided the charisma. D'Onoforio as the bearlike mountain man with the high pitched voice was unforgettable. Haley Bennett played her role with understated strength. They went up against a psychotic sociopathic mining mogul who did not know the meaning of mercy. The action scenes were marred by cheesy background music that seemed to have been piped in from the 1980s. The editing and direction was choppy and was mostly a distraction. Actors routinely muttered their lines and I gave up trying to decipher them. But the film was gritty, the characters more than one dimensional, and overall a very good western.",The Magnificent Seven
104,msbreviews,Rating: A,9,6 August 2017,"I just checked the percentage on Rotten Tomatoes for this movie and I'm blown away by the huge number of negative and mixed reviews for this film! I had so much fun with this remake, I think Antoine Fuqua directed it brilliantly, the action scenes are amazing and all of the characters are either funny and charming or total badass.There is so much to praise about Fuqua's work: the beautiful wide shots, the awesome shootouts and action sequences, the adequate pacing, the suspense, ... I don't think he missed a single thing, everything is on point! The beginning is shot amazingly, the first act's pacing is so well controlled (especially when you have seven major characters to introduce the audience to and he does it brilliantly, it's always exciting to meet each member of the group) and the ending is breathtaking. Great job, I can't wait to watch more movies from him!The action scenes are delightful. God, they're so good. Extremely well shot, a lot of amazing shootouts, great suspense and, when you have characters that you care about, it gets even better. There are scenes that I'm sure I'm going to watch constantly through these next weeks and it's a film that is highly watchable due to his super funny side.The cast is so captivating. Denzel Washington plays the role he was born to: badass. He carries this film in such an awesome way, I dare you to take your eyes off him while watching this masterpiece. Chris Pratt is the funny guy and who else could have played someone like Josh Faraday? I literally laughed out loud in the first scene he was in and I kept doing that until the very end, even if he did get too ""modern"". Ethan Hawke portrays Goodnight Robicheaux, a character I was really intrigued by due to his past that kept tormenting him. He's the one with more depth to him, but my only issue with this movie is based exactly on that. Depth. And the lack of character's development.As I said before, all of the cast does a great job with the amazing characters that they have. However, some should have definitely been better explored: Goodnight is the main one, he has so much to tell from his past, but I never got to truly understand why he's feeling so scared and traumatized; Jack Horne (portrayed perfectly by Vincent D'Onofrio, one of the most underrated actors currently) and Billy Rocks (Byung-hun Lee) are my favorites when it came to action scenes, but they didn't receive that much attention. Finally, Vasquez (Manuel Garcia-Rulfo) and Red Harvest (Martin Sensmeier) are the odd ones out: a wanted Mexican and a warrior from a Hindu tribe that, besides the beginning where their characters are introduced, they don't show up that often (even if Red Harvest is awesome in the few scenes he's in). Peter Sarsgaard does a slightly over-the-top performance, but it's still a good enough villain for this movie.The Magnificent Seven never tried to be something that it's not, it stayed constantly funny, captivating, thrilling and action-packed with amazing direction, a great cast and badass characters. Definitely, the movie that western needed!MSB Reviews - If you like my reviews, please follow my blog :)",The Magnificent Seven

108,CANpatbuck3664,The Magnificent Seven is Well Cast and Well Filmed but Suffers Slightly From Sticking Too Close to the Formula,7,2 October 2016,"The Magnificent Seven seemed like a movie that would be a big summer release to me. I might think that but instead it got dropped in September. Was it because it's a western? Do they just not sell well regularly? But still with cast members like Denzel Washington, Chris Pratt, and a veteran director like Antoine Fuqua at the helm, it shouldn't have been hard to market this movie. Westerns have made a bit of a comeback with well received movies like Bone Tomahawk and Hell or High Water so between the cast and the cool premise (I haven't seen either of the previous movies), I was pretty stoked. I was able to catch it with a good friend and we left feeling pretty much the same way about the Magnificent Seven. I found this movie to be solid but it can be pretty predictable. I'll elaborate more on those points later.*Minor Spoilers Ahead* The movie starts in the small town of Rose Creek in the year 1891. The town is in a state of crisis, a crooked businessman named Bartholomew Bough (Peter Sarsgaard) is terrorizing the town and forcing the townspeople (mostly farmers and miners) out of their homes. One of the men named Matthew Cullen (Matt Bomer) tries to stand-up to Bough but is gunned down. His wife Emma Cullen (Haley Bennett) gathers whatever funds the town has and tries to find a mercenary with the ability and fearlessness to take on Bough.In a neighbouring town, Sam Chisolm (Denzel Washington) walks into a bar looking for a man named Dan. He quickly figures out that the bartender is the man he's looking for as he's hiding out there using an alias. Denzel is a bounty hunter for the U.S. government even though he prefers to be called a warrant officer. He kills Dan as he reaches for his shotgun under the bar. The bar quickly empties but the only man to stay is Josh Faraday (Chris Pratt). He's a gunslinger and only stays behind to steal all the money that was left on the table during the poker game he was involved in. After Sam explains to the sheriff why he shot the bartender, he runs into Emma and her associate. She offers him the money she has collected to rid the town of their corrupt law enforcement and to face Bough when he returns with his forces. Sam refuses at first but as soon as he learns the name of their enemy, he decides to go recruit his team. He starts with Josh who has already found trouble. Sam strikes a bargain with Josh in which he buys him back his horse in exchange for his help. They ride off separately looking to bring in more men to help take on Bough.The cast is a lot bigger than I mentioned in the summary but I don't want to spoil too much. Other cast members include: Ethan Hawke, Vincent D'Onofrio, Byung-hun Lee, and Manuel Garcia-Rulfo. I'll talk more about the plot later but I'll start with the cast and there are few weak points in this large ensemble. If there's any problem I had it wasn't with their acting but the material itself. Denzel is solid as our protagonist, he does as well as you would expect. I thought Chris Pratt was good, he's laying it on pretty thick at points but it's his job to be charming and funny so he works. I actually though Hayley Bennett was pretty strong, Emma's not the deepest character but Hayley acts with a lot of conviction. I liked a lot of the side characters when it comes to the team, it was nice to see Denzel and Ethan acting together again. I wished Byung-hun Lee and Vincent D'Onofrio were in the movie more and I'm not familiar with Manuel Garcia-Rulfo or Martin Sensmeier but they were also good in their respective parts. I don't want to blame Peter Sarsgaard but even saddled with a weakly written villain, he's overdoing it and he didn't help his character feel any more believable. The other big positive for The Magnificent Seven is that it's a beautifully shot movie. The cinematography is visually pleasing and helps transport you into this world. The locations this movie takes place in are classic western and they feel appropriate for a blockbuster picture. The way the action is shot is more mixed, the scenes themselves are cool but because the movie is meant to be PG-13, there is no blood and there isn't any weight to the violence.So while they assembled a good cast, found a suitable director and made a good looking film, The Magnificent Seven has one glaring issue. The movie is super predictable and I feel like it doesn't have a strong story. They introduce cool characters but some of them get almost no development and a lot of the subplots are so obvious. If you can't figure out what's going to happen with Goodnight Robicheaux (Ethan Hawke's character), you just haven't seen many movies. I called many of the plot turns of this movie. The other problem is the villain that seems to have evil stamped on his forehead and like any western tycoon, he's bad because he's ambitious. If they're sticking to the original movie, I can accept that but I wanted a deeper and better written adversary for Denzel and his crew to fight.I think people who haven't watched many westerns are going to really like this. While I watched this movie, I couldn't find any reason to dislike it outright, there's a lot of good parts here. I'm not a western fanatic but I've seen my fair share and I found chunks of the story lazy and they were used better in other movies. It's still a good movie but it's meant to please the general audience, not the critics or the film buffs.",The Magnificent Seven
109,cdcrb,ho hum,5,26 September 2016,"for those who don't know, this is a reboot of the 1960 cowboy classic, then starring yul Brynner, a big star at the time, and steve McQueen, a TV star, soon to become a super star. probably the first TV performer to cross over to the big time. now we have a super star denzel and another up and coming TV star, chris pratt. unfortunately, we also have a very boring movie. you must know the plot, but if you don't it's basically bad people take over a town and 7 guys of various persuasions get together and save the day. I am not quite sure what denzel was doing, but I think he was asleep, most of the time. chris should get back to fighting dinosaurs asap. Vincent d'nofrio stinks and again. if he hadn't been killed, should get back to the dinosaurs. the two hour plus movie plods along step by step til the end. no surprises, except when the American Indian ""red harvest"" speaks English, he says ""i'm hungry"". seriously. the script is lame and amateurish, matched almost identically with the delivery of those words by the actors. and the veiled threat that the guys were going to ""get"" the woman was offensive. just because the actual words aren't used, I can still get the drift. anyway, it's a sad state all around and I am very sorry to think this, but it almost seemed like another paycheck for mr.

111,davidgee,More a retread than a remake,6,14 October 2016,"Like this summer's TARTZAN, here's another remake that is apt to make some viewers (me, for instance) ask: Why? There's plenty that's good about it, especially the lighting and cinematography, but the screenplay springs no surprises and neither do the performances.The story is the same old same old. Denzel Washington, Chris Pratt, Ethan Hawke and four other gunslingers help the folk of a mining community in California confront the robber baron (Peter Sarsgaard) who wants to drive them out of town. I seem to have missed a vital point: why wouldn't he want the town to supply and support the miners? Anyway, Denzel and Co are recruited to turn the townspeople into an army that can outwit and outgun the evil Bartholomew Bogue (I wanted his name to be pronounced 'bogie' or 'boogey'!). None of the gunmen is given much in the way of a back story: they all appear to be mercenaries, so the movie lacks a moral tone beyond the basic Good (town) versus Evil (mine-owner). The impending battle drives the narrative, which inevitably drags until we get to the shoot-out. This is extremely well done, relying on stunts and acrobatics rather than on CGI, always welcome from my viewpoint. Sarsgaard's Bogue is a lacklustre villain, like Christoph Waltz's recent take on Blofeld, and Denzel W, usually a very charismatic presence, doesn't invest too much in his role. 'Oomph' is conspicuously absent.Not, then, a ground-breaking new Western like UNFORGIVEN. More a retread than a remake.",The Magnificent Seven

I went in with an intention of watching a typical western movie.I enjoyed it. The action scenes were absolutely fantastic and the final battle scenes were really intense and had me sat on the edge of my seat. My issues with this film was that the character development was poor. No backgrounds on any of the 7 people, and throughout the film I'd say you get to know about 3 of them at most. and ultimately that's what let's it down. But the plot and the action scenes for me personally save this film and I recommend watching if you enjoy westerns, but judging by the other reviews I suggest only watching if you haven't seen the original.",The Magnificent Seven
113,PyroSikTh,Interesting Cast that only Scratches the Surface of Character,7,24 September 2016,"Magnificent Seven follows largely the same route as the original Magnificent, keeping the Western setting, but changing up it's cast of defenders. Sam Chisolm is a bounty hunter who gets stares wherever he goes due to the colour of his skin. He's approached to defend a small town from the wrath of a mining mogul called Bogue who controls his own small army. In order to stand a fighting chance, Chisolm assembles a ""bunch of strays"" consisting of the arrogant, womanising gambler Josh Faraday, haunted war veteran Goodnight Robichaeux and his Asian knife-flinging partner Billy Rock, Mexican outlaw Vasquez, mountain-tracker Jack Horne, and lone Native American Red Harvest. These seven men set out to train up the town's farmers and miners into a ragtag army, and set a series of traps to lure and kill Bogue and his men.With such an eclectic cast of interesting characters, I felt Magnificent Seven could've done with a bit more character development (said disappointingly considering the script is from True Detective's Nic Pizzolatto). Beyond their one or two word-descriptions I just gave, we never really learn much more about them. We're led to believe that Jack Horne is a world-class tracker, for instance, but all we really see him do is jump on people and butcher them. Red Harvest comes to the team reasonably late, says a few Comanche words, fires a few arrows, and that's just about it. We get a small glimpse into Chisolm, Bogue, and Goodnight and their histories with one another, but it's only ever something we're told and never really shown. The whole Chisolm/Bogue rivalry doesn't even become particularly apparent until the very end.That said I was surprised that half the team doesn't survive to the end. I won't spoil who, but despite the lacking character development, I felt each one was a massive loss. It was a shame to see anyone on that team bite the bullet, and it made the end quite bittersweet and not even remotely Hollywood-ised. The town was saved, but at what cost? Half the townspeople have left or been gunned down, and the magnificent seven are no more. I was fully up for seeing a sequel or two following these group of men around, but that seems unfeasible now.There wasn't a whole lot to write home about aesthetically, with a lot of fairly standard cinematography and effects (although I'd like to note I didn't notice any CGI at all, for you traditionalist nuts), but the scenery was simply gorgeous. The town sits on a grassy plain with forest on one side and a mountain range on the other, making it feel instantly like a Western despite all the greenery. There are sandier settings as well though, making it all appear more diverse than most desert-set Westerns. I also thought the costuming was really good as well. Of course the riff-raff are in typical beige, dirty rags, complete with rimmed hats and suspenders (or corsets for the women), but Chisolm's all-black look (including his horse) gave him that Man in Black mysterious edge. Bogue's costume looked really cool and villainous as well (why do villains usually get the best clothing?), with his long coat, bullet belt, and lavish waistcoat.Acting was fairly good across the board as well, prompting the most emotional investment in these characters than anything. Denzel Washington does what he does best; the subdued badass with charming smile and good heart, Chris Pratt dials up the arrogance and the charm in equal measure (and you can tell he's been practicing with gun draws), and Ethan Hawke slips into his tortured character like a hand into a glove. The standouts for me though were Vincent D'Onofrio's brutal yet softly spoken Horne, and Byung-Hun Lee and Martin Sensmeier's more ethnic castmembers. Of which I have to give big props to the casting crew for casting actors of the correct ethnic descent, which is something that just doesn't seem to happen in movies for some reason.The Magnificent Seven is certainly a very enjoyable movie. It has it's fair share of surprises and action, but it's focused mainly on building this team and getting them to work together towards a better end. Despite it's lacking development of it's mix of interesting characters, I felt attached to each and every one.

114,MovieHoliks,Not To Be Viewed As A Remake...,7,25 September 2016,"I made it to the local multi-plex to see this over the weekend, which I see has really raked it in at the box office ($35 million opening weekend!) Denzel Washington re-teams with director, Antoine Fuqua (""Training Day"", ""The Equalizer"") for this much anticipated remake of the 1960 classic, which in itself was a remake of the Japanese film, ""The Seven Samarai"". Now it has been quite some time since I saw the original, so I really don't remember a whole lot about it. For me, I saw this as a completely new piece of filmmaking, and it was a lot of fun, with some really good action and passionate performances. Wow; Chris Pratt is on a roll with this movie, last year's ""Jurassic World"" and the previous year's ""Guardians of the Galaxy""! Also featured in this all-star cast are Denzel's ""Training Day"" co-star, Ethan Hawke (this time on the same side LOL), Peter Sarsgaard (playing quite the delicious villain), and Vincent D'Onofrio, looking much like Santa Claus! Again, it has been awhile since I saw the orig. movie, so it seemed I was comparing this more with the Adam Sandler comedy from this past year, ""The Ridiculous Six""! LOL I liked the little ending credits homage to the original movie; nice touch. Definite thumbs up for this one!",The Magnificent Seven
115,ethanbresnett,Great fun,8,26 August 2021,"I think this movie is scored a little harshly because people have a general dislike of remakes and reboots, when in actuality The Magnificent Seven is a solid western and a really fun film.We are given a great cast, with Denzel Washington helming the ensemble in expectedly accomplished fashion. The supporting cast are all pretty good. There's perhaps a little bit of overacting in some of the accents and a fair amount of cliche and stilted dialogue, but for the most part I found the characters and performances enjoyable and engaging.The plot follows the rough outline of the original film, with a group of misfits and outsiders banding together to help a town rid itself of a despotic mining magnate. It's all pretty simple in terms of plot, but it's very effective with solid pacing and some surprisingly good emotional beats.From an action perspective I think this film really shines. It has some of the best gunslinging action I've seen in any western. The action is very 'Hollywood', overamped and frenetic but that makes it very enjoyable and watchable.There's a lot to enjoy about this film. My advice is to go into it with an open mind and forget about the original or drawing any comparisons. This is a fun, good film and well worth a watch.",The Magnificent Seven

117,docm-32304,A Solid Western for Modern Times,8,22 February 2020,"I enjoy the western genre but it is hard to find any good ones that have been made in more recent times (the last one being Silverado). This is a good one. It has all the classic things you'd expect in the genre: great riding, great action sequences, good vs evil, a climactic bang em up finish and a ride off into the sunset. The acting is well done and although I treated this film as a stand alone entertainment, if you feel you have to compare it to the original, I'd say it is better. Yes, the naysayers will go nuts with that, but the original classic is dated...in fact I would go so far as saying that each of the current actors did a much better job than the originals. Denzel Washington's steely eyed stares seethed with a heat that Yul Brynner did not. Personally I always though Yul looked stupid in westerns. As well, I never understood why the heck they cast Horst Buchholz in the original. The comanche they replaced his character with was awesome. Ethan Hawke nailed the role originally played by Robert Vaughan and had a much more imposing, yet disturbed demeanor. As far as the role Charles Bronson played, Vincent D'Onofrio (who I didn't even recognize under that makeup) played his role with great humor and equal if not better presence. The Asian actor who reprises the role played by James Coburn added a very slick martial arts action touch that Coburn was only so so at. All in all, given the time period the film is set in, this is the collection of the most abused and thus embittered people that you would expect to take on a suicide mission.
All that being said, the only thing missing to bring it over the top was that dynamite score from the original which I would have loved to hear throughout the film. After reading the other reviews, I wasn't sure if I'd like this rendition, but both my wife and I thoroughly enjoyed it. Much of the comments from many of the negative reviewers seemed to have more to do with their own issues rather than the actual movie. To them, I say, relax...it's just an entertainment.",The Magnificent Seven
118,stevenrotherforth,Show the genre some love and watch this magnificent movie,9,16 September 2018,"Magnificent 7I never really appreciated the Western movie genre when I was a kid.
I vaguely remember watching the original Magnificent 7 with my dad as a youngster.
I was in to Star Wars, Jaws and Rocky. 
Cowboy movies were for the oldies. Spaceships were for the cool kids.
It was only as I grew older and enjoyed movies such as Tombstone, Unforgiven and Open Range that I truly fell in love with the Western.The remake of Magnificent 7 is another reason to show the genre some love.
Antoine Fuqua's movie is a rip roaring good time.
Everyone involved is equally enjoying the experience as Fuqua has wrangled together a belter of a cast.
Led by the marvellous Denzel Washington and the charismatic Chris Pratt, this retelling of seven men coming together to help a small village is immensely entertaining.
Action is supremely staged and the sound of gunfights are best experienced in surround sound.
But a film with only action is not enough.
The Director probably wished he had more time to develop the movies superb characters but with a runtime of 2hr 12mins this isn't a short movie. Fuqua has had to juggle as much as possible to fit everything into the films runtime.
Magnificent 7 never drags. It has a great pace which keeps the audience invested from start to finish.
This is helped by each of the seven having their own time to shine and because of the excellent interplay between them.
There's no stand outs here. Everyone is fantastic.
Possibly Pratt and Washington edge it but then there's the superb Ethan Hawke and Vincent D'Onofrio. 
This is perhaps why this movie is so good because each of the seven are truly magnificent.
This is a cowboy movie worth watching over and over again.
This is a movie that prompted me to revisit the original and you know what?
That's a belter of a movie too!",The Magnificent Seven
119,p-jonsson,Very good remake of an old classic,10,30 March 2017,"This is indeed a very good remake of an old classic. As always I am a bit worried when they make a remake of old classics that I liked. This remake is well worth watching though. Despite having a few minor gripes I went for 5 out of 5 stars on this one.Most of you are probably familiar with the story of The Magnificent Seven. Gunslinger gets hired to protect a village from the evil industrialist, he picks 6 buddies to help him, trains the villagers, digs in and sits down and waits for the bad guys to arrive. A simple and well suited story for a bit of Western entertainment. I guess I should mention as well that the original Western is actually not the ""real"" original. That honor befalls Shichinin no samurai, or Seven Samurai in English, which is a Samurai movie by Akira Kurosawa and with Toshirô Mifune in the lead role. That is the movie from which the plot originates.Anyway, history lesson is over, back to this movie. The movie starts of by introducing the main characters. The bad industrialist is a nasty piece of thug and quickly demonstrates that, although by no means being a blood splatter movie, it is definitely more cruel than what I remember from the original. Next in line is the movies hero played by Denzel Washington and I have to say that he plays the role very well. I liked him as the calm, fairly silent, but oh so deadly gunslinger from the first frame to the last.The other characters fit quite well into their roles as well. I cannot make up my mind about Jack Horne though. I did like the character but at the same time I felt that he was a wee bit to comical at times. I also liked Goodnight Robicheaux quite a lot but the writer really went a bit over the top as far as I am concerned when he actually left.Of course the entire movie plays out as a build up to the final big fight and it is a big fight, that has to be said. However there are plenty of things happening during this build up. Both things involving chemically propelled slugs flying around and things slightly less noisy.Sam Chisolm has to pick up his buddies of course, each one being an opportunity for some cool movie story telling. Then we have the training of the villagers which, as expected, becomes a wee bit comical at times. Oh, and I almost forget that there is a nice little shootout when Chisolm and his buddies introduces themselves to Bogue's thugs in the village. Said thugs includes the local Sheriff. To no ones surprise I believe. So much for law and order. Time for a new management.So, fast forward to the end and the big fight. It is big, it is well done and it involves plenty of things that go boom. It is plenty of action but it is also the part of the movie where I have the biggest gripe. Okay folks there are going to be a mild spoiler now. With that out of the way, let's go to the Gatling gun. It is always cool to see a Gatling gun let loose. However can we keep it a bit more realistic please? They fire thousands of bullets without reloading (they make a fuss about reloading later in the movie). Also they position the gun out in the open where it would have been relatively easy to shoot the men operating it. An idea that they finally get much later and manage to goof up. The final solution to taking out the gun is dramatic but quite convoluted. This is the part of the movie that made me go a bit what the f...!Apart from that I really enjoyed this movie. A good remake of an old classic.",The Magnificent Seven
120,dcarsonhagy,"The Just ""Kinda Okay"" 7",4,4 January 2017,"""The Magnificent 7"" is Hollywood's latest regurgitation of a masterpiece--all ""dolled"" up to fit present-day Hollywood's vision. It is another attempt to recast (and make politically correct) a movie now considered a ""legend"" by most.Denzel Washington plays the lead. Seems he's a ""good"" bounty hunter who is persuaded by a young lass to help her town become good and god-fearing again by running out the bad guys who have taken over the land to mine for, *gasp*, gold. Hackneyed as all get out, unimaginative, and just plain old boring, this version is a great example of Hollywood's ""paint-by-numbers"" western. And they insulted the genre better than most.Rated PG-13 for violence. If you've never seen the original (either ""Seven Samurai, which the original Magnificent 7 was based on, or ""The Magnificent 7 circa 1960) you may be entertained.

121,EthanBJones_03,Solid western; could very well rejuvenate the genre,8,18 December 2016,"Overall: One of the better westerns in recent years. Well worth a watch and could actually rejuvenate the genre. ​ Good: All the acting was superb especially Chris Pratt and Denzel Washington. All the characters were unique and interesting in there own way. The movie is beautifully shot with a few less than stellar edits. The music was incredible and really drove emotion and emitted the feeling of power. The villain was interesting though the big reveal felt tacked on. The second and third acts (especially the third) were very good. The action is phenomenal and the final shootout is worth the price of admission in itself. I am very happy that main characters die in this as it makes you feel stakes which generally aren't in many movies. I love the way the world looks with dark, gritty, down to earth farms and heroes against the more wealthier and proper villains. The scenery was gorgeous and the buildings looked great. Special effects were pretty decent and looked reasonable.Bad: The first act felt boring and dragged so they could have shut it down by perhaps 10-15 minutes. The characters introductions weren't interesting and I felt they could have made each character's death mean something. Like drive the other bounty hunters to fight on. I would have preferred a very last stand were they all die but then bring the enemy down with them or something like that. That may have been cliché or cheesy but I think it would fit the movie well. There was a few editing issues and it felt like whiplash. Poor choice of actor for villain. Someone who could hold their own and be a proud, stuck up business man, such as Liam Neeson, would have been better and more interesting. The dramatic twist at the end did nothing to amaze and neither did Ethan Hawke's triumphant return which was sickeningly predictable. The plot was pretty simple and not memorable and the ending was just unsatisfactory.Best Part: The sensational shootout in act III was worth the price of admissionMVP: Denzel Washington as Chisolm8/10",The Magnificent Seven
122,James_De_Bello,5/10,5,24 September 2016,"When Bartholomew Bouge (Peter Sarsgaard) threatens to through out all the inhabitants from a small town in the old west because of its rich land, the recently widowed Emma Cullen (Haley Bennett) sets out to enlist men to help them protect the village, that is when Sam Chislom (Denzel Washington) puts together a group of seven renegade gun men to help the villagers defend their land.Having never seen ""The Magnificent Seven"" from 1960 I cannot comment on anything regarding the update this version does and how it lives up to that, yet nor I care to do so or to compare it to its old originator ""The Seven Samurai"". On its own 2016's ""The Magnificent Seven"" stands as a well-packaged action film with sadly zero depth to spare.Nothing can be taken away from the very solid production that is put into place. The sets are as beautiful as we could expect from a western. The cast put into place is impressive and puts a show that is worthy of their talent. Of course Washington shows again how his is a kind of charisma that will be found in one out of a million actors almost literally, he doesn't need to to anything, we as viewers are simply carried away with him and he has always a way of showing that something deeper is going on in his character.The photography as everything is technically impeccable, the sweeping shots are beautiful, it makes the most out of its setting and gives us some great sunset and night sequences and images and even better battles with impressive practical special effects. There also are many, and I mean, many tributes to past classics: there is almost an overuse of the Sergio Leone stare off.All of the above is pretty much world class production, but that is all on the surface level. Once one starts uncovering what is going on below he would unfortunately not find much. The characters are almost all empty shells. After ""Jurassic World"" and then this I feel a little sorry for Chris Pratt, he isn't given material to shine and instead is being typecast and used in these clichéd, empty roles that have no consistency in it of themselves. He is relegated to one liners and cool stares and lives with a character that hasn't anything else going on.Unfortunately, almost none of the other cast members are given much more. Washington and Bennett are the only ones that slightly manage to stick out. The film is completely void of any emotion and filled relentlessly with genre clichés, some of which aren't even treated well and fail even in their most elementary job. There is no depth sensed anywhere and it makes for a very heavy viewing experience that clocking in at 2 hours and twelve minutes proved to overstay a little too much its welcome.The editing is also very jarring and doesn't give any clarity to any of the complex sequences the film has. It is all over the place from the opening scene which is incredibly disorientating right to the final battle sequence, which has no sense of geography, goes on for half an hour and ends up being a montage of people shooting and people falling from horses for the majority of its duration.Fuqua is a director I deeply respect for his proficient and always technically impeccable work, but here that is all I was given which made for a tiring and almost annoying experience.",The Magnificent Seven

125,gavinp9,Good cast deliver a solid Western,7,2 January 2018,"'The Magnificent Seven' is perhaps an unnecessary remake - almost 56 years, to the day - but it's just as good as the original. Still the same simple premise - a Western, where a small town is being overthrown by a villain, so they hire a bunch (well, seven, to be precise!) of drifters to help them fight to save the town. It's still set in the 19th century, but the main differences are that the town's not in Mexico this time, and there's much more focus on the church (not necessarily religion).The leader this time is Chisolm (Washington), a bounty hunter (Yul Brenner's character), with Faraday (Pratt) a wise-cracking gunslinger (Steve McQueen's character), Goodnight (Hawke) a former sharpshooter, Billy (Lee) a knife-master, Vasquez (Garcia-Rulfo) the Mexican, Red Harvest (Sensmeier) the Comanche and Horne (D'Onofrio) - the best character - as the mountain man. Still no real motivation for them to help the town is given, but let's go with it anyway. Sarsgaard is good as Bogue, infusing him with plenty of contempt and no empathy. Bennett is OK, but mostly a token female character.Does what a good Western should - plenty of shoot-outs, sweeping vistas, explosions, horses riding and jumping, staring from under hat brims, and a healthy death toll! Has a few slow points in the first half, but the battle for the final 30min or so is done very well. Doesn't necessarily add to the original, but nor does it do it a disservice.

Great cast ensemble, great story, phenomenal action sequences (although the finale is extremely hard to follow because it's too fast-paced. It was hard to tell who to root for because I couldn't tell the good guys from the bad guys because the cuts were too quick, and it didn't give my brain enough time to register what was happening.) and just an all-around great Western. Although the villain was kind of weak. He didn't give me chills, and I honestly didn't see him as much of a threat. That's more the fault of the writing, not the acting. The acting was fine. Chris Pratt is awesome as always, as are Denzel Washington, and the rest of the cast. The action sequences were great! If an action sequence (or the lead up to it) gets me excited, it's successful by my standards. This more than delivered on that. I was definitely restraining myself from cheering in the theater.

128,ginocox-206-336968,"Tremendous potential sacrificed on the alter of diversity, inclusion and political correctness",6,23 December 2016,"""The Magnificent Seven"" enthusiastically embraces diversity to its own detriment. Diversity works well when it serves dramatic needs and the characters, as in ""Eastern Promises"" and ""Running Scared"" (2006), which featured Russian mobsters instead of the usual Italian/Sicilian crowd, and ""Lone Star,"" a film about diversity with a diverse cast. When motivated by political correctness or marketing goals, the results are often disappointing, as with ""Ghostbusters"" (2016), ""Secret in Their Eyes"" and ""Annie."" It can work well. Helen Mirren was compelling in ""Eye in the Sky,"" in a role written for a male, by playing the character with a masculine mindset. TMS is (or should be) the story of a group of mercenaries who are recruited for a suicide mission. They enlist for selfish reasons but find a nobler purpose that motivates them to extraordinary efforts to prevail. Dramatically and emotionally, the most important elements are the recruitment and the transition, but this presents a quandary for the filmmakers. Depicting seven recruitments and seven emotional maturations risks becoming repetitive. This is where diversity works against the movie. To the extent the characters are similar, we don't need to see seven detailed scenes of recruitment or maturation. But for the characters to be authentically diverse, they must have diverse values and motives, so these scenes must be depicted in greater detail. The movie fails fairly epically in this regard. Chisolm (Washington) has the clearest motive in a personal quest for vengeance; however, it leaves no room for transformation to something nobler. He gives lip service to being persuaded by the offer of everything the townspeople had, but that's not what motivates him. Faraday (Pratt) has a fairly lame motive in repaying a debt. The motives of Horne, Rocks and Harvest aren't at all clear or convincing. TMS also fails at the second transition. Rather than becoming emotionally involved with the townsfolk and adopting or sympathizing with their perspectives and values, the mercenaries attempt to train the townsfolk to acquire combat skills in a martial arts and marksmanship training scene evocative of similar scenes in countless adventure movies from ""From Russia with Love"" to ""Robin Hood, Prince of Thieves"" and parodied in dozens of films, such as the ""A Fistful of Yen"" episode in ""Kentucky Fried Movie."" Many other scenes seem borrowed from other films, such as ""Nevada Smith,"" ""Django Unchained"" and ""The Last Samurai,"" which in some cases included scenes borrowed from other films. Acting is generally good, although some characters seem more like caricatures. Production values are good. But the script lacks depth. In the end, it's an entertaining crowd pleaser that offers unrealistic diversity in lieu of authentic characters. The diversity of the cast works against the production, as the characters are presented as enigmas rather than taking the time to develop each character as three-dimensional.",The Magnificent Seven

130,ayoreinf,So similar and yet so different,8,27 September 2016,"As a rule, I believe one shouldn't compare movies. But if you read my reviews you'll find that it's a rule I don't always follow. A remake of a movie is one obvious exception to this rule, and this one is in fact a double remake. And I did see both of the earlier versions, so here goes:This is definitely a well made movie, great actors, great cinematography, very good pacing, very good action scenes - it's a fun ride. It follows the great tradition of American westerns, and uses the brilliant story of the original Japanese story with the slight variations added by John Sturges and co. when they adapted it to the American/Mexican west. But the most poignant and enduring point that was made by both of the earlier versions is missing in this version, and though one part of it does get referred to, it's also get a twisted version. I speak about the idea that the actual winners are the villagers while their heroes for hire are no more than fleeting characters moving from one place to another leaving very little behind them.Antoine Fuqua's subtle changes from the originals are at precisely this point, and also on the nature of the villain which he changes from a simple criminal to a corrupt capitalist who doesn't want to steal from the villagers but to take it all from them, believing they don't really matter. Now, to understand the reasons all we have to do is look at Fuqua's career. I've seen four of his movies so far and apart from his love for action movies there a few other things one can gleam from them. Fuqua likes his heroes bordering on the superheroes, namely without superpowers but with such amazing skills that do appear like super powers, and they will prove it facing impossible odds and coming out on top. He likes them with some moral ambiguity at their past, but making the right choices when it matters. He likes his villains to believe themselves above the law and doesn't have very high esteem for law enforcement systems, his heroes will enforce justice not the law. All this considered the subtle or not so subtle changes he made make much more sense. Fuqua doesn't believe in fleeting heroes for hire, so he doesn't use the sentence, he believes in justice achieved through vengeance and that's what we get here. It is somewhat questionable from the moral point, but who's going to see movies for moral debates. And regarding the permanent hold of villagers unto their soil and unto the world we live in, well if they win over the one that claimed they were dust, didn't they prove him wrong.",The Magnificent Seven
131,ExpendableMan,"Excellent Western, one of the better remakes of recent years",8,9 October 2016,"You know you've got a proper Western when there's an enormous amount of camera time spent on sweating faces grimacing in the sunlight. And Antoine Fuqua's 'Magnificent Seven' remake is full of them. It's a film that's very much a love letter to the classic era of frontier cinema, full of cigar chomping heroes, boo-hiss villains and tense stand- offs in deserted towns. Heck, the first time Denzel Washington appears is when he walks into a saloon and everyone in there - including the piano player - stops and stares as he enters the room. Then he orders a neat whiskey and guns down the barman. Set a few years after the civil war, Washington is Chisholm, a US Warrant Officer recruited by Haley Bennett's widower to save her town from a dastardly villain (Peter Saarsgard in suitably psychotic, sleepy eyed form). Initially reluctant, he soon caves in and sets about gathering a band of misfits to help him, including Chris Pratt's 19th Century Han Solo, Ethan Hawke's Confederate veteran with PTSD and Martin Sensmeier's tribe-less Native warrior. After the requisite introductory scenes, they shoot their way into the town and twenty- two corpses later, are helping the locals prep for the inevitable backlash. And that's it essentially. There's lots of scenes of ditch digging, rifle training and manly bonding, all culminating in a huge shootout against an army of bad guys. It's a hail of bullets that Peckinpah would be proud of and a spectacular finish to an incredibly bloody movie, with someone getting shot, stabbed, set on fire or filled with arrows every few minutes. It's masses of fun and way more conservative than the diverse cast may initially suggest; this is a film where bad guys get shot. No ifs, no buts, no ""let's try to understand their point of view,"" if you're a villain you'll be lucky to walk away with only an ear being shot off. And speaking of diversity, do you know how much the film suffers for including a Mexican, an Irishman and a Native American in the ensemble? Not in the slightest. All the complaints about political correctness fall away to nothing when a film is this entertaining and besides, the West was a diverse place anyway. Google ""how many cowboys were black"" if you need to but trust us, this film rocks. It's a heroes versus villains adventure romp and the action sequences are terrific. If it reminds a few people that America was founded on immigration then hooray, if not who cares? It's two hours of solid entertainment and a rare example of an exemplary remake.

132,kaptenvideo-89875,A western classic with some added Denzel Washington,7,2 October 2017,"Once upon a time, there was this bloody western titled The Magnificent Seven"", released in 1960 and directed by legendary Sergio Leone, which is still considered one of the best movies western genre, it not of all time. It won't probably hit you that hard, if you tried to watch now for the first time, what with it being almost 60 years old and all. So you might as well settle for this remake. This is one of those remakes nobody asked for, but you know it's gonna be somewhat special if it's led by Denzel Washington, one of the greatest movie stars of our time, a man with not often rivalled charisma and on screen presence. It's about seven gunmen protecting a town from ruthless robber baron, simple as that. The story or screenplay are nothing special nor especially deep, but they don't even have to be, because the cast is cool and most of the time is dedicated to blasting off those guns. The direction is competent, able to use the best of western clichés and build constant suspense; dialogue is adequate; the acting is good enough but there's no point of writing about all that extensively. First and foremost, this is about shooting people, or preparing to do it, for 132 minutes. Although the story is shallow, there is some hidden symbolism which may offer some delight for Jung fans. The seven heroes are played by Byung-hun Lee, Chris Pratt, Denzel Washington, Ethan Hawke, Manuel Garcia-Rulfo, Martin Sensmeier, and Vincent D'Onofrio. The robber baron is Peter Sarsgaard. Also appearing, Luke Grimes, Haley Bennett, et al. Most of the cast plays it straight but some (Hawke, D'Onofrio, Sarsgaard) add a little mental instability to their performances, which brings a welcome variety. For a movie directed by Antoine Fuqua, The Magnificent Seven"" is unusually modest and low-key – if you can call a story of massacre that. It never tries to get glamorous and impress us with visual inventiveness, the latter is mostly reserved for shootouts so we wouldn't have to watch men dying in same way over and over again. Then again, the world looks remarkably simple and unglamorous as the true wild west may hav been, Washington, for example, hasn't looked that ordinary on screen for a long time. So, this is a simple story well told. Fine entertainment for action lovers, or those who want to see classic western redone with modern tools and resources.",The Magnificent Seven
133,jb_campo,Good old-fashioned western of good vs evil,7,18 June 2017,"I really liked The Magnificent Seven remake starring Denzel Washington and Chris Pratt. There's the evil rich guy Bogue who brutally demonstrates how he has no heart to the town of Rose Creek. He's wringing the life out of the town by blasting the gold from their hills and ripping the financial heart from the town for personal gains.A young woman Emma is spurred to action and goes in search of men to help protect what's left of her town. She meets up with Denzel and slowly, the Magnificent Seven team gets formed. It's a suicide mission, but still these guys seem confident. The town joins together. It's the typical Western where Clint would walk in and exact justice for wrongdoing. Except it's got 7 different guys who form this loose alliance. I loved Vincent Donofrio's old bear-like character who seemed indestructible. A native American, an Asian guy with knives, a Mexican guy, it was like a UN of vagabonds who all seemed to be ready to go out doing something good for once.Sure it's a Hollywood ending, but what a great fun ride. I enjoyed The Magnificent Seven's self-deprecating humor, while facing the seriousness of survival of good over evil. I highly recommend The Magnificent Seven. Enjoy.",The Magnificent Seven
134,eshwarmail,Unrealized moments and desperately lacking innovation leaves it underwhelming,6,27 January 2017,"A story that has been retold in various versions and backdrops across the world makes its way back to Hollywood again with Antoine Fuqua at the helm. He brings together the stars from his smash-hit debut 'Training Day' hoping for a box office miracle that has eluded him. Easily one of the best looking westerns you would come across especially going by Fuqua's technical abilities, aesthetics and attention to detail. But sadly that's all there is to it. Bartholomew Bogue (Peter Sarsgaard) is a ruthless business man using intimidation and graft to convert a settlement into a mining yard oblivious to its settler's woes. When he takes a step too far by burning down the local church and killing some innocent civilians who revolted against him, Emma Cullen (Haley Bennett) who is widowed from the incident vows revenge. She recruits a Warrant Officer Sam Chisolm (Denzel Washington) to help her exact revenge who in turn has a bone to pick on Bogue. Knowing Bogue's ego, his love for power and his assets, Chisolm needs an army to stand a chance. Right from the word go, it is driven by a template featuring all the stereotypes of a western world. Its as if he has made a list of such and stuffed them up into this wafer thin script. The way the town looks, characters of inhabitants, introduction to its protagonist, antagonist, period jokes everything you can think of has been done many times before. As the movie progresses, it becomes utterly predictable voiding it of any thrill or suspense throughout. The characters of the magnificent seven are not well etched out making them just caricatures who would react in a pre-programmed manner to a given situation. The background score is passable, the screenplay is so by the book might well has been written by a film student as part of an assignment, editing department could have worked a little harder to chop off some extra lengthy dinner scenes. But the background locales and the cinematography stands out making it a visual treat. To conclude, I felt that there were moments in the movie which were not seized leaving it underwhelming at the end.Coming to performances starting with Peter Sarsgaard, his character as a baddie in the movie can be defined in like just 3 words. Denzel Washington does shows some moves as a gunslinger but I couldn't buy into his western act. Chris Pratt has been giving the exact same performance since his breakout role as Peter Quill and just serves as a comic relief. Ethen Hawke, the returning star from Training Day and a veteran of unconventional roles bows out here to play the silliest character (in a bad way) written in recent times. Only actor who makes something out of this venture is Haley Bennett - especially because of my lack of expectations on her. She definitely had her moments and her plight and grit looks believable in parts. Unrealized moments and desperately lacking innovation leaves it underwhelming.",The Magnificent Seven
135,trublu215,"It had all the ingredients to be great but instead it is merely just ""OK"".",5,9 September 2016,"Antoine Fuqua's The Magnificent Seven is about as brazen as the cowboys it portrays. It is loud, visceral and action packed but lacks the necessary functions for it to be a truly great film. Despite Fuqua's most confident directing and Denzel Washington's excellent performance, the film ends up being as cluttered as the cast would suggest. When it all comes down to it, it is a matter of an overload of star power. While there have been films in the past that have had incredible casts and flourished, this film makes it feel as though the film is only big enough for one star. Chris Pratt is great as an alcoholic and incredibly ballsy gunslinger, Faraday, but he lacks any gusto to really command the screen as does most of the cast outside of Denzel Washington (someone who I can't say enough good things about here). It ends up feeling like these roles could have been played by anyone when it should have felt like these actor's owned these roles so much so that you can't imagine anyone else in it. Unfortunately that isn't the case here. Quite frankly, the only performances worth noting are Washington and Peter Sarsgaard, who gives a devilishly good performance as a sadistic law man. In this respect, the film is very much a disappointment for anyone expecting to see the next great ensemble film of the year. More importantly, those of you who were excited to see the re-teaming of the Training Day squad (Washington, Hawke and Fuqua) will have to wait a bit longer for that because there is barely any chemistry between Ethan Hawke's Goodnight Robicheaux and Washington's Chisolm. The screenplay, written by True Detective's Nic Pizzolatto and action aficionado, Richard Wenk is lackluster to say the least. As I said, the character development with the characters is either not there or so forced and unnatural that it takes you out of it. After the abysmal season 2 of True Detective and this, I think is safe to say that Pizzolatto is turning into the one hit wonder that everyone feared that he would be. However, I will still hold off on officially saying that about him because there are some ideas that were introduced in the film that were really interesting which is why it is all the more frustrating when they are cast aside and never touched upon again. The screenplay is the big problem here. It is well paced but emotionally hollow. It never really reaches anywhere near the heights of the Kurosawa masterpiece or even the 1957 remake that that film spawned. In this case, the script reads and sounds like a bad imitation. Despite this, The Magnificent Seven does boasts some pretty exceptional action set pieces much to Fuqua's credit. The film is explosive but it is highly predictable. Those who are killed don't really resonate with the viewer because quite honestly, we don't care about any of the characters outside of Washington. They are mere footnotes to the larger picture which is a monumental disappointment. Overall, I thought that Antoine Fuqua's The Magnificent Seven boasted a great idea and never truly capitalized on it. The film felt like it really could have been something but we are left holding on to the idea of what could have been.",The Magnificent Seven
136,srdjan_veljkovic,It's hard to see why was this remake made,6,16 December 2016,"On its own, it's an OK modern action western.It looks very nice, general story is well known and fine, actors do a decent job of it, but...Against the Yul Brynner, Steve McQueen et al iconic variant from 1960., it pales in comparison. It has neither the depth, the style, the fun, the charisma, the wisdom... or the _magnificent_ music score. To be completely fair, yes, it looks better, much better even, but, the 1960. one looked fine for its time, so that is no reason to do the remake.But even with accepting that not all things one tries can succeed, as this obviously didn't (except in the looks department), it's hard to see what was tried. Chris Pratt retells (only) one of the McQueens ""I once knew a man in..."" tales, the ""so far, so good"" one, yet, at the end he says ""he's dead now"". Well, of course he is... even if he survived, by some miracle, that has nothing to do with the point of the tale. Other changes to the movie's story are not so bad, but also without point of their own and loose the point that was made in the 1960. one.At the end of it, you'll have the ""they don't make them like they used to"" feeling. If that was the point of the remake, then, kudos, but, I somehow doubt that.",The Magnificent Seven

There are empty one liners. The audience is given no reason to care for any of the characters. See the original Magnificent Seven or Seven Samurai for character building. Even the Anime ""Samurai Seven"" had more character than this one.This movie should have been called ""Seven"". Yeah, there were seven guys. They weren't magnificent. Maybe they were, but we never got to know them.The movie even failed on the action front. At times, it seemed there would be a bad guy to pair with each good guy.

139,higherall7,Ride and Run with the Gang...,8,20 February 2017,"Remember Louis Robinson enthusiastically recommending this film in between innings of playing baseball on the dusty gravel field of Hutchinson Elementary. That was back in 1962 when I was ten years old. Back then, THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN was in the same league as a television show that came on at ten o'clock nights called THE UNTOUCHABLES. Just too violent for kids like me nursed on Mickey Mouse and Captain Kangaroo. So we would avidly listen to the tougher, older, more muscular kids in their teens talk about JASON AND THE ARGONAUTS, THE MYSTERIANS, and finally THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN.Louis was our local version of Steve Reeves, whose cool reserve was filled with such manly grace he saw no need to bully anyone, but at the same time encouraged us to fight our own battles. The most I knew about THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN was when it would make the rounds for the Late Night Movie and I would see the advertisement for it. I could vaguely sense what it was all about, seven men challenging insurmountable odds because they were just that bad ass and most or all of them dying in the end.I was close to right.Ironically, I saw SEVEN SAMURAI on Public Television long before I actually saw THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN in its entirety. I watched it with my girl friend and found it a philosopher's feast rich with characters of all types of shading and degrees of angst. I can recall myself taking notes about the personalities of each of the Seven Samurai because, quite frankly, I knew Akira Kurosawa was taking me to school about the dual nature of Force and Non-Force in human personality.Later, when I was mature enough, I saw THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN. While several levels below Kurosawa's Zen Masterpiece, what it lacked in plot and character development, it more than made up for with breakout roles given to Yul Brynner, Steve McQueen, Robert Vaughan, James Coburn, Charles Bronson and Horst Buchholz, shooting it up to Elmer Bernstein's rousing Coplandesque score. Might as well face it, the Star Power was, well, magnificent, the music almost as full and rich a character as the swirling clouds in THE TEN COMMANDMENTS, and who can be as evil with such 'elan as Eli Wallach's Mexican Bandit Leader? The contrived twist near the end before the climatic shootout never did sit right with me, but the return of Chico to the pastoral duties of peasant life resonated lightly with the moral of the original masterwork.Flash forward to 2016 and we have this remake with Denzel Washington. I will not comment about its Star Power, that is for the present generation to deliberate. You will observe that you have never heard anyone say, 'He's the next Yul Brynner' or 'He'll pick up where Steve McQueen left off', so enough said about that. But while the opening sequence where Washington and Pratt encounter each other made me think back with wistful disappointment about the coolness of Brynner's and McQueen's first encounter, as the film moved on I was surprised to discover that it did indeed have some tricks up its sleeve and was originally developing its own strengths.I gave this film an eight because for all its reliance on the conventions of the Western Horse Opera, I believe the story line is an improvement on the 1960 version of THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN. It is true that all of the characters could have used stronger back stories to relate to their com-padres during breaks from all the devastating killing, but this was also a shortcoming of the 1960 version. It would have taken a deft writer's hand to relate this in written dialogue or visual flashback in between the action, but director Antoine Fuqua made a judgment call to go for the money shot and by and large it pays off here. The scenic display of the mercenaries preparing the farmers for the final showdown with the villain industrialist Bartholomew Bogue and the reticulated pace of strategy involved in this is a brilliant directorial set piece. It makes a lot more sense than Wallach's admonition to the original Seven to go and sin someplace else. Unfortunately, we do not see the farmers then returning to planting something else besides dead bodies and this could lead to this version of THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN being described as a gore fest when it is something more than that.Denzel Washington's Sam Chisum does not remind me of any of the characters in Western Drama I have seen before. He reminds me instead of Mister Richardson, Ernest Huey and Fred Wells and about half a dozen other men who possessed that unassuming sense of manliness that was admired in my community. Strong men who would stop by in the afternoon to hit our rubber coated hard balls and soft balls from fence to fence after their shift was over in the factory or at the Gas Station or the Mechanic's Shop. This is quite an achievement and I could go on and on about how the other characters represent a kind of multicultural logic of diversity that really made America great. And yes, I wish Fugua had done more with Washington's LEFT HAND OF GOD scene in the church, but perhaps with Haley Bennett as Emma Colton he did just what he needed to do.At any rate, we have here a film that is just this side of magnificent, but still a rousing and inspiring shoot-em-up with a back story for the main character that is played as a sort of hole card leading to the jackpot of the end credits.",The Magnificent Seven
140,TheCorniestLemur,Pffffffffffffft,5,8 October 2020,"So for some reason this was my university course's choice for the western genre, and the only reason I can think of for that is that there was a part of the lecture saying that the western is an archetypal genre that will never die out, and this is a modern film, which proves that point I guess?They could have chosen The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly. They could have chosen Stagecoach. If they wanted a modern film they could have chosen The Ballad Of Buster Scruggs, or The Sisters Brothers. They could have even chosen the original Magnificent Seven, which at least had a purpose for existing in a time where Seven Samurai probably wasn't widely available in the West. All of them would be more fitting, most of them I haven't seen yet, and all of them are things I would rather have watched.But instead we've got something that I think is trying to beat The Wretched for inspiring the least amount of things I can say about it.I'm sure everyone knows by now that the original film was basically just an unofficial remake of Seven Samurai, which, like I said, was at least justifiable in 1960, when I can't imagine Japanese films were easy to find in the West, but in 2016 and beyond you can have it at home on your computer in five minutes, and this film does a grand total of nothing to differentiate itself from it.And much like The Wretched, everything about it is fine. The acting, the cinematography, the characters, the writing, the directing, it's all just...fine. In short, there's no reason for it to exist at all, even if the original Magnificent Seven wasn't already basically a remake, it wouldn't justify itself, but when Seven Samurai exists as well, it's a film that only exists to take up space.And make money, of course.

Denzel is just doing his bounty hunter stuff, and takes a job of defending a bunch of villagers from Ye Olde Moustache-Twirling Bad Guy. Chris Pratt is also there and decides to go die with Djan..Denzel because the script. A whole bunch of rather monodimentional characters do the same, including a risibly tokenish Indian. So they go and they act all badass n' stuff, like a Clint Eastwood film, but with a whole bunch of Clints.And then they shoot stuff and most of the bad guys die.Then Denzel is left alive and the bad guy too, and Denzel wins.I know, right?You'd expect that i would heavily criticize this really wooden script, but actually, i thought this film was fairly decent. It's not a matter of acting, because, while the actors all do a good job, the direction doesn't seem to know how to use them.But yet, it's still a well done film; lots of attention has been put into the stunts, the choreography, the sound design, photography, costumes, sets ... Yeah, it's not a great film, but it's amusing. I think you can go watch this and not feel like you've thrown away your money.I would recommend The New Magnificent Seven ... to teenagers, mostly.

142,daniewhite-1,The mouldy story,3,13 August 2021,"A tale now so old that it's growing mould and mildew fails to enliven several boring blokes and their meandering film.Lavish props and costumes are the main plus point alongside Denzel Washington: he generates two stars by himself and the third is for the wardrobe department.If this had been made by an action movie star in the 1980's or 90's muscle men boom it would have been laughable; but twenty years after that style was in its pomp it provides very thin servings: explosions are plentiful, as are guns and gunpowder but there is no spark from the script, the acting quality is varied as some very limited characters drag down competent actors whilst some unremarkable actors fail all by themselves.Direction is poor but the editing somewhat redeems some scenes and sequences.Basically this film has no reason to be and it shows throughout.Denzel Washington is worth a look and Hollywood still has excellent costume designers, makeup artists and lighting specialists but I struggle to laud anything creative.I rate a 3.5/10 for some slight flashes of entertainment and good professional work by the technical crews.",The Magnificent Seven

145,Lewis_Heather787,"OK , a bit boring in places",6,28 September 2016,"Having never seen the original magnificent seven film I went into this without any preconceived notion of the standard this film has to be at, which probably helped. Lets start with the positives of the film, firstly the director Antoine Fuqua who did a fine job with the film, especially some of the camera shots in the film which were very interesting and shows the creative talent he has. Next are the performance which across the board are solid from Denzel Washington to Haley Bennett none of them had a stand out performance but weren't bad either. Another positive is the cinematography which in some places is fantastic in this film, the look and feel of the film really make you think your actually in location watching this happen. The last positive is the action in this film, which brilliantly choreographed and shot. The action is not the same old sort of classic western stuff but some new and refreshing more modern action incorporated which really worked. However now lets move onto the negatives of the film, the beginning of the film when all of the seven are being gathered together is extremely boring and dull. Only until they reached the town did I get interested again in the film, Im roughly estimating that the first 30-45 minutes of the film really lets this film down. I can really understand if this puts people off the film because the beginning does start to drag. The other negative I have is the villain of the film played by Peter Sarsgaard who although portrayed a good performance, had no threat at all and was really kind of pathetic. Especially when he is eventually killed and the end of the film which could have been seen coming a mile away. All in all the film has good performances and good directing for the most part but however due to a very slow start and a bad ending this film is only going to be remembered for its action sadly and not for story and characters.",The Magnificent Seven

147,ctowyi,Not quite the rising sun for the begotten genre but still a good entertainer,7,22 September 2016,"This multi-racial and ethnic cast may seem appropriate in these contemporary times but it is still a pale shadow compared to John Sturges' 1960 remake of Akira Kurosawa's Seven Samurai (1954). Not that it sucked though... it just made me reminisce so fondly the motley crew led by Yul Brynner and Steve McQueen. Dammit... I can hear Elmer Bernstein's iconic theme soaring in my head now. The story is the same - a town is under siege by a corrupt industrialist Bartholomew Bogue (Peter Sarsgaard). The desperate townspeople employ the protection of Bob Chisolm (Denzel Washington) who then rounds up his crew of six - gambler magic-slicker Josh Faraday (Chris Pratt), a sharpshooter has-been Goodnight Robicheaux (Ethan Hawke), and his knife extraordinaire sidekick Billy Rocks (Lee Byung-Hun). Rounding out the rest of the titular seven are a Mexican outlaw named Vasquez (Manuel Garcia-Rulfo), a Native American named Red Harvest (Martin Sensmeier) and a mountain-man called Kingpin... Opps sorry, Jack Horne (Vincent D'Onofrio). Not all of the seven will survive, but the town will be saved from the evil clutches. How I wish I could say this is one rollicking, surprise-laden, potboiling action thriller, but I just can't in all honesty. I think it is because I grew up watching Seven Samurai and The Magnificent Seven (1960), and these movies occupy a cozy room in my heart. I find myself just not magnanimous enough to being fair to Antoine Fuqua's remake. In all fairness, it is indeed a huge summer tentpole movie with the fun quotient dialled up and the action set-pieces revved up to the max. But IMHO the characters feel under-written and the camaraderie feels perfunctory. It is not that I need a backstory for everyone but a clever writer will make you identify with just one cool trait of each character and run with it. If you think back to John Sturges' film and I ring out all the actors' name, you can definitely see and feel that character in your head. When these characters eat lead, a lump forms in your throat. But I didn't feel any lumps here. I don't know... I think it is a tall order for me to displace the classic seven and align with everyone in this new seven. But I must say having Denzel Washington and Chris Pratt onboard is just awesome.Fuqua excels in the action set-pieces, especially in the drawn-out final shootout. Every tenet of the genre can be seen here and a gleeful smile crept up on my face as one shot will floor a bad guy and yet another one drops down from the roof. My heart will whimsically shout out a yeah when yet another faceless slimeball gets flung down from his horse. That said, this new seven just couldn't touch the legacy of its more illustrious predecessors, let alone displace them. Even the music score by the late James Horner barely registered more than a blip in my consciousness. This, I am afraid, is hardly the Rising Sun for the begotten Western genre. No doubt, it is quite an entertainer though. Just don't expect anything more than that and you will be fine.",The Magnificent Seven
148,happy_hangman,If it ain't broke...don't fix it!,3,17 October 2016,"Y'know how sometimes the remake of a film can, if not actually improve upon the original - though, arguably, 'Scarface' does just that - take a different approach to the story of characters which is equally engaging, or sufficiently different to make the revamp justified...but not SO different that all it has is a titular connection to the original? Scorsese's morally skewed 'Cape Fear', for example.Well, 'The Magnificent Seven' ISN'T one of those films. Not blindingly awful - Denzel is engaging as ever, and Chris Pratt plays Chris Pratt like no-one else can - just...pointless. It suffers by clearly having been designed by a committee. ""Hmmm"", some twelve-year-old studio exec has thought. ""Westerns aren't ethnically diverse...so lets have a black star...but never actually register for more than a fleeting moment that he's a black man in prejudice-ridden 1870s America. A Native American, too...but let's not dwell on the irony that he's helping the townsfolk protect the land they stole from HIS people. Oh, and there were a lot of Mexicans in the original....but they're a political hot-potato, right now 'cos of Trump...so ONE will do, even although he doesn't appear to have any distinctive character traits, other than BEING a Mexican (a violent, rapacious one, at that...The Donald would be SO happy!). Oh, and we're clearly missing the Asian market...so how about an oriental knife-flashing Ninja type. THAT's not a stereotype, at all!!'Now some of this would be excusable if half these characters had a back-story. Ethan Hawke has a potentially interesting riff on Robert Vaughan's jittery death-rattled mercenary, and Vincent D'Onofrio's quirky Jack Horne hints at an intriguing tragic history, but neither is particularly developed. hat said, they are still MORE fleshed out than any other characters, save for Denzel Washington's Chisolm, onto whom a wholly unnecessary revenge sub-plot is half-heartedly grafted.All of the original seven are, to some extent, either idealists or characters in need of redemption. They are all Western archetypes - but the reason archetypes WORK is that they are universal. THESE seven are just...clichés.All you NEED to know about Yul Brynner's principled gun-for-hire, Chris, in his bond with Steve McQueen's drifter, Vin Tanner, is summed-up in the wonderful Riding Shotgun On A Hearse: willing to bring Hell down on themselves and everyone else to bury a dead Indian, scorned by the prejudiced 'civilized' townies. They do what's RIGHT, according to morality rather than law or social convention. The link between Washington and Pratt is a formulaic bar-room shoot-out. Dull. A wasted opportunity - but typical of this cliché-ridden dross.Oddly, the plot of the original film is entirely dropped, in favour of an artless re-hash of the key elements of 'High Plains Drifter' (break out the red paint an' the dynamite, kids!), and although the bland score hints at cues from Bernstein's gloriously rousing soundtrack, they wait until the end credits before a rather limp arrangement of the iconic theme kicks in. That's a BIG tune, boys and girls...and you didn't earn it.Crap. Watch the original, instead. More fun. More emotional connection. Just...better",The Magnificent Seven

Unless you are a huge fan of westerns, you have no business watching this.First of all this movie could have been wrapped up in 1.5 hours instead of dragging it on. The acting was fine but the script was a disaster filled with clichés and FORCED humor (you wouldn't know its a joke if the characters were forcing themselves to laugh). From start till end, its one magnificent disaster. The movie will leave you not knowing anything about the characters, not even their names...There isn't much else to say it is just IMDb wont let me post this unless I have 10 lines of text.",The Magnificent Seven
150,abouhelier-r,The Remake of a Remake in The West,9,5 October 2016,"Seven gunmen in the old west gradually come together to help a poor village against savage thieves.The Magnificent Seven is directed by Antoine Fuqua and stars Denzel Washington, Chris Pratt, Vincent D'Onofrio; Ethan Hawke and a tonne of other badasses. It's the remake of a remake of a remake even though it's kind of a retelling, that is something we've seen before. The basic story lines are fairly timeless like every great story is. There are even a tonnes of other movies especially Westerns that have a very similar feel as this one. Best example, Clint Eastwood has been in movies with the same plot quite a few times. Denzel Washington is teaming up with Fuqua for the third time. Here he plays, essentially, the part of Yul Brynner in John Sturges' movie and Takashi Shimura in the sublime 7th Samurai by Kurosawa - which is no problem when your name is Denzel Washington and you have the experience authority and charisma. He owns the film. This man is a complete legend and it was amazing to see him reunited with Ethan Hawke on screen again. Hawke's character being also very interesting, as he has conflicted feelings, he feels the need to help these people but he also has a past with Washington's character and starts to feel unsure about himself. Add Chris Pratt and his eternal charming asshole and you get a bunch of likable and entertaining characters. Even Vincent D'Onofrio is surprisingly (for me) good in this film.I love Antoine Fuqua as a director, I find him very versatile and effective, going from Training Day to Shooter, to two of my favourite movies of the past two years: The Equalizer and Southpaw. He really can do any genre and proves that again this time by making a very fun Western. In fact, this film is extremely well shot. With Leone-style horses galloping across widescreen plains in clouds of dust. But don't be fooled, this film hurts with guns, knives, arrows, cannons, dynamite and machine guns. Finally, this film is also a Western with political intent. The gang includes an Irishman, a Mexican, a Native American and a Korean as Fuqua, both addresses Hollywood's diversity issue and sends Donald Trump a message that America was built upon the immigrant spirit. Overall, The Magnificent Seven is a straight up popcorn entertainment, don't go to this movie expecting anything else. It was also fun to see a standard Western again, with duels stand-off. This movie is a remake that actually delivers.",The Magnificent Seven
151,j_forbesy,Magnificent 7,6,4 October 2016,"Magnificent 7 was a movie I knew very little about til the trailer hit. I haven't seen the original so my expectations for this movie was set completely from what I saw in the trailer. I loved this trailer. The tone it set gave you a rush of adrenaline and got me so excited for this movie. However, once I walked in, it didn't continue.There is one word to summaries this movie for me, disappointing. This movie was built up so much in my head that when I got there, it was just a let down. While there were some positives that I really did enjoy about the film, I think that the overall story and writing of the film let it down dramatically.The main problem I had with Magnificent 7 was the final act. First of all, it was just too long. There got to a point that you think it is over but they find a way to revamp it and continue it one even further. While the action looked amazing, which I will touch on late, I just found that I was getting bored with the constant and what felt like pointless fighting. The second problem I had with it was the believability. While in a film you commonly expect that the hero with be able to handle themselves against a small group of thugs, but this took it out of hand. The fact that there were 7 of them all individually taking multiple groups of villains, and they manage to land every hit yet not got hit once until late in the final act. Which takes me to the final problem I had with the last act, the deaths weren't at all earned in my opinion. There's a point during the film that you work out that not all of the 7 will survive this, and I think as the film makers, they knew this too. But instead of earning the deaths, they decided to kill of 3 of the 4 known actors and the 1 character that everyone seemed to love. For me it was just bad writing and they could of made us care about their deaths so much more than they did.Something else I really didn't like in the Magnificent 7 was the formation of the team and character developments. In both departments it was extremely poor. There is next to no back story for many of the characters and they get no further interesting story for the rest of the film. This part of the reason these deaths weren't earned. Yes it's ballsy to kill off the highest paid actors but it doesn't make it right. Character development and a stupid D'Onofrio accent really took me out of the film and made me view the 7 as more of a comedy group rather than a group of bandits. Magnificent 7 seemed to of taken the Marvel route and had one of the worst villains I have ever seen. He was pointless. Spoiler alert but all he does is make an intimidating speech because his goons are pointing guns at people, kills one guy, then stands back from the town yelling orders til all his troops have been killed, at which point he turns into the weakest wimp of all time. I'm not sure how much of this is to be blamed on the directing or writing, but the actor they cast was simply not up to scratch. They needed an actor that has a presence and can deliver a line in a way that gives intimidation. Instead we got a bumbling guy who we had to believe was one of the most feared people in the country.As I mentioned before, a big positive in this film was the action. Even through the last act on a whole was a major let down, it still was a great spectacle to watch a big western fight. My favourite action sequence though was the first time they team up together in their first fight. I thought that it had the perfect balance of team work mixed in with action. Each character except one got to display their skills and this fight really pumps you up for what the final act can be. Unfortunately that adds to the downfall of the final act being so disappointing for me.6/10",The Magnificent Seven
152,jace_the_film_guy,What Was the Motivation?,7,16 July 2021,"While watching The Magnificent Seven I kept asking myself, ""Why are these seven men doing this? What is their ""why"" behind the fight?"" The real motivator was not gold, silver or glory and it wasn't until the end of the film that their altruism truly shows (outside of Chisolm's revenge). What made the group truly magnificent was their willingness to die for something that they could have walked away from.From a production standpoint, I still felt that the band got together with too little coercion and I wanted more depth when it came to character development outside of Chisolm and Goodnight. An underdog story with a predictable ending, the strong cast and consistent tone elevate this film to a pretty good feature.",The Magnificent Seven
153,kris-gray,Stop comparing it to the 1960 version,8,5 February 2019,"My mother took me to see the 1960 Yul Brynner version when I was 8 years old and I loved it, I have also loved it the many times I've seen it since. So I was keen to see this, remake? hmm ok the story is basically the same but it has a lot of changes that I don't need to list here. If you have seen the original and who hasn't then forget it, this is fab shoot 'em up western with as many PC characters as they could cram in to one film, I mean a black gunslinger in the 1860's? unlikely but I can ignore it.Realistic? don't be silly Hollywood doesn't do realistic they do escapism and this is a very good example of it. Ignore the bad reviews, it's a fun ride.",The Magnificent Seven
154,SpoilerAlertReviews,Reminded me of how much fun Westerns can be.,10,27 September 2016,"So, Antoine Fuqua reboots John Sturges' classic 1960 western of the same name, which is, in itself a remake of Akira Kurosawa's epic 1954 Seven Samurai film that quite possibly spawned many variations of antiheroics across the genres, like Battle Beyond The Stars. I'm a big fan of misfit bands of rambles like Ocean's Eleven, The Dirty Dozen and even the Avengers, that share the same camaraderie, especially the banter between Faraday and Vasquez who both provide great comedy and admiration for unlikely friendships that are formed from the alliance. It reminds me of my own batch of close friends and how we ridicule each other. Some of the story has be chiselled, extended and finely tuned to what I find as an improvement. Even with the lack of the fool, who had such a central part of both original plots, but in his absence, a more diverse cast is employed allowing amazing creative opportunities with both action and storyline. Each character now has a more uniqueness and legendary mythology about them than before. There's a good amalgamation of characters while keeping the core values and traits there; and if you're a fan of the original, there's plenty of elements and lines that play homage to the 1960 classic. It's great to see Fuqua replicating the classic western style, like the distance shots, the panning action and the hazy heated introduction. The tension build up before gun fights are amazing, echoing westerns of old. It also means that whilst keeping true to the core of the story, it's still unpredictable and fresh for fans of the classic. Fuqua reunites with Denzel Washington for the third time, Washington clearly taking Yul Brynner's part as the all-black-cladded warrant officer (polite title for bounty hunter) and even mimics the holstering of his gun. He takes the role of leader quite naturally and gives the film that Washington dramatic touch, meaning smart, fearless bad-ass. Chris Pratt takes Steve McQueen's role as Josh Faraday and as expected a sarcastic, cocky, double-wielding six-shooter who's just as fast with his mouth than with his guns and pack of cards. I'm pretty sure they actually let him blow something up because he looks like he's really enjoying himself, though there's a darker side to his character this time round, he's not always the joker. Haley Bennet is fast become a favourite of mine with already being the beautiful Estelle from Hardcore Henry and looking great in the soon-to-be-released The Girl On The Train. She looks totally different and I don't think I would have recognised her at all if not knowing her name, but she does a grand performances as the determined, widow, seeking righteousness and revenge. Ethan Hawke maybe over plays Robert Vaughn's original cowardly soldier, suffering from PTSD, but it's a strong performance from him nonetheless. Terminator's latest T-1000, Byung-hun Lee brings a new depth of character to James Coburn's knife-slinger and actually suits the film better, copying the duelling scene from the original. Manuel Garcia-Rulfo and Martin Sensmeier make up the rest of the gang as the greasy Mexican, Vasquez and the young Comanche warrior, But it's Vincent D'Onofrio's bear-sized Davy Crocket type character that steals the show with his immense, brutal strength yet a giant gentle soul. And Peter Sarsgaard is brilliant as the slimy tyrant who's takes advantage of power in numbers. There's a good balance between the characters though lacking some background on most, only having the script hint at their history. It's actually quite nice to notice that the true ethnicity of each character matches their actor. This is final score of the late James Horner which he composed before his death after falling in love with the script during Southpaw. Horner's long time colleague, Simon Franglen finishes and conducts the music which has hints of Braveheart, Legends of the Fall and even Titanic but the western theme is quite predominate, especially during the end credits. I'm a fan of Fuqua's work, right from his Training Day and though having a couple of near misses with Shooter, Tears of The Sun and Olympus Has Fallen, I have enjoyed them all but more so his recent films like The Equaliser and Southpaw, King Arthur wasn't a bad film either. But I think this one is my favourite of his and now one of the year. I haven't felt this much inspired or touched by self-sacrificing heroics since The Last Samurai. The action sequences are superbly crafted, captured and edited, being quite creative without going over-the-top. The gunfights are slick, fast and impressive all the way to the final showdown with dynamite affect. The locations are completely on point and the landscape scenery is beautifully shot. In fact, I'm finding it very hard to fault this film for what it is. It's reminded me how much fun can be had with westerns while keeping that heroic code of honour, friendship and sacrifice. It's like Marvel made a western. Seen the film twice now and I'm sure I'll go see it again before it comes off the big screen. Definitely for classic western fans, especially having showing so much respect to the original. Running Time: 10 The Cast: 10 Performance: 9 Direction: 10 Story: 10 Script: 8 Creativity: 10 Soundtrack: 8 Job Description: 10 The Extra Bonus Point: 10 for reminding me how much fun can be had with westerns, inspiring me and playing so much respect to the original material. 95% 10/10",The Magnificent Seven
155,comps-784-38265,Mediocre 7 an exercise in 2d 'Western' caricatures,6,27 September 2016,"Yet another remake to remake more money. I liked the look of the trailer and cast looked good, so went to see it with high expectations. It is not a bad film by any means, but it is certainly well below par compared to the Yul Brenner classic. The remake has so many clichés and plot holes it spoils what otherwise could have been a worthy successor.It actually came across as more of a montage of scenes from classic Clint Eastwood westerns : e.g. People living in valley being bullied out by nasty mining baron (Pale Rider) Nasty mining baron has quasi 'deputies' as muscle (Pale Rider) Chisolm (Densel Washington) is looking for revenge on renegade soldiers during/after civil war, who raped/killed his family. (Outlaw Josey Wales) Chisum was hung and had noose scar on neck but survived (Hang em high)Open fire with gatling gun for a massacre (Outlaw Josey wales)Two of the baddie 'deputies go in shack and one staggers out before dropping dead (Pale Rider)They seemed to have borrowed music from AVatar?What went wrong:- The magnificent 7 have no unifying reason, let alone cause to help the farmers. E.g a Commanche comes across them and suddenly is one of the magnificent 7. Denzel plays it as the 'enforcer' in a black stetson, emotionless, soulless,Most of 'the seven' characters are pretty 2 dimensional anyway. Only Chris Pratt and Ethan Hawke stood out for me (but you had no real understanding of why Goodnight was like he was) Peter Sarsgaard was believable as the baddie. However, ruthlessly murdering in cold blood so many farmers (incl children) at the start (without fear of interference from the law) Raised the question why didn't he just shoot the remainder? Let alone offer twenty dollars for their land. Another plot hole!Farmers are led by woman (Haley Bennett) whos husband was murdered by the baron. She is somehow the sole leader of the farmers, always seems to be showing cleavage and is totally unbelievable. It is 1879 and none of the 'farmers' in the wild west can shoot a firearm accurately. Not one. All the 7 seem to have amazing shooting powers with a 6 gun, so much so often it becomes almost ludicrous. Conversely the baddies are almost as bad as the farmers at shooting. The baddies all charge in and obediently meet there demise in conveniently placed TNT explosions or being shot. Nobody seems really to be wounded (man or horse) no horse poo. This film is not terrible by any means. The final battle is exciting However, I felt little empathy for any of the characters, they could have been largely cardboard.I came away feeling i'd seen this all before, except done much much better, in other films. The Magnificent 7 (2016) is therefore a mediocre 6.5/10 and can be added to the long long list of other mediocre remakes.",The Magnificent Seven
156,rutzelb,It Was Okay for a sort of remake of the 1960 Classic,7,28 December 2016,"Emma Cullen (Haley Bennett) hires 7-Gunslingers to rid her town of Bartholomew Bogue (Peter Sarsgaard), who owns the gold mine and who wants the people there to sell their land to him at very low prices. Chisolm (Denzel Washington) is an authorized lawman who hires: Josh Faraday (Chris Pratt), Goodnight Robicheaux (Ethan Hawke), Jack Horne (Vincent D'Onofrio), Billy Rocks (Byung-hun Lee), Vasquez (Manuel Garcia-Rulfo), and Red Harvest (Martin Sensmeier) to help out. I do not remember much of the 1960 Classic except I do remember most of the biggest stars who starred in it, but I think it was a Mexican town was the one that needed gunmen help. There was no Emma Cullen character. One thing I do remember is that these 7-gunman had different names than the 7-gunmen of the 1960 version. Anyway, there seemed to be differences, and If you don't like that, go back and watch the 1960 version. All I know is that both are Westerns and I love Westerns. Ah, I can almost smell the leather. Some will ask why so many Hollywood remakes. Fair question, but how many today would go back and watch the original? See? Now you know. And, of course, CGI helps a lot with remakes, but I don't think CGI was too much of a factor in this one. (You forgetting about the Gatling Gun?)The gunfight at the end when the whole town participated did go on for too long, but the choreography was so good we didn't mind too much. We do see horses run from the battles and that is something we don't often see with these gun fights. The only time I noticed the Magnificent Seven music theme was at the end when the survivors rode off into the sunset. (I didn't see a sunset)Notables: Matt Bomer as Matthew Cullen, Emma's husband; Cam Gigandet as McCann one of Bogue's henchmen. Overall not bad for a sort of remake. The cinematography and overall production were very good. However I did expect better comedic banter, and to be honest, there was very little of it. The big stars did not stand out as much as we would have liked as there were more gun fights/explosions than dialogues. (So no Oscars, right?) (7/10)Violence: Yes.

Those who take Sarsgaard's deal are given the short end of the stick; those who refuse the deal will wish they had taken the deal. But a handful take an alternative route: hire their own gunmen to fight Sarsgaard and his henchmen.The townspeople end up with seven hired men: a peace officer extremely fast with a pistol; a sneaky gambler who likes to use magic to get the upper hand on his enemies; a notorious killer; a sharpshooter; an Asian who is fast with guns and knives; a legendary tracker; and a Native American deadly with a longbow. Seven against a hundred. But the seven have an edge...they have time to fortify the town and set up their defenses; and they have dozens of civilians at their disposal to train and help in the upcoming fight. The good guys are confident of their chances to win; unfortunately, Sarsgaard has his own surprise for the seven and the rest of the townsfolk.My most memorable, movie moment of ""The Magnificent Seven"" is the scene when Sargaard brings out a Gatling Gun (an early machine-gun) to bring hell to those who dared oppose him. This scene gives a major wow factor, and it also gives its biggest shenanigan. Why did Sarsgaard wait until his men were getting their butts kicked to bring out his special weapon? Also, at the range the Gatling Gun was used for in this movie, I wonder how effective the bullets would have been once they reach the town.The Western movie, as far as I know, is an art form originally created in America. As long as entertaining movies such as ""The Magnificent Seven"" keep getting made every few years, this American art form will never die.Mannysmemorablemoviemoments",The Magnificent Seven
160,caseynicholson,A Terrific Western By Today's Standards,8,6 October 2016,"I recently took a friend's advice and went to see the 2016 version of ""The Magnificent Seven"". I have never seen the original film and so I really can't compare this movie to its predecessor. That said, though, I found this movie to be well made and a lot of fun.The film follows somewhat of a standard western movie formula: There's a bad guy threatening a town with a land contract racketeering scheme, bad guy kills a few people, people want revenge, along comes Denzel Washington who plays a bounty hunter type of character, and he rounds up a posse to defeat the bad guy.That said, as trite as that formula may sound, the fact is that it's one that works and works well, especially in this well made movie that is quite attentive to detail. The cast, script, and directing all come together into a wonderfully produced film.My one area of criticism--and this is purely a personal preference--is that overall the film had a bit of a clean type of feeling to it, almost as though it were produced by a Disney studio. The music contributes to that quite a bit, with the score more of a John Wayne vibe than a Clint Eastwood type of feel. I personally prefer westerns made in the latter standard, with a more gritty and dark mood. This film perhaps doesn't deserve to be marked down simply for not having been made in that mold, but again, for me it just made it less enjoyable.All that said, I'm going with 8/10 stars. It's a great movie, but falls just short of being in the top tier of a 9 or 10 star rating.",The Magnificent Seven

Since I'm really not a big fan of Westerns or the fact that I have never seen the original ""The Magnificent Seven"" to compare this one to, that probably wouldn't make me a great candidate to rate this film. I'm just going off of the acting and the action that was portrayed in this film. After ""Training Day"" Denzel Washington and Ethan Hawke came together again to put their talents on display for this film. Denzel Washington did a ""magnificent"" job, as usual, in playing the part of Chisolm.

162,danielharden,So far so good,7,1 October 2016,"The Western genre has lay mainly dormant for some years until Tarrantino put his spin on the genre with films like Django Unchained and even Kill Bill vol 2. Now another fairly well known director, Antoine Fuqua, takes the reins of not only a classic genre, but a classic film as he remakes The Magnificent Seven. Staring a regular of Fuquas films, Denzel Washington and that guy from Parks and rec who is kind of a big deal now (to marvel and Jurassic park fans i'd like to make clear that that's a joke or at least a sad attempt). The Magnificent Seven takes you back to the old days of the old west and is pretty decent remake.This film is a straight up classic western. The winging of saloon doors, the close up shots of cowboy boots, the dead silence extreme close ups of eyes before a showdown. All the conventions are there. To me this worked as we haven't seen a classical western for some time now and so this worked in Fuqua's favour, as his direction comes across as nostalgic rather than repetitive.Another grate moment is the battle sequence. Once the action starts it goes on for a while before it reaches, in my opinion, its fantastically executed conclusion. This is not a bad thing as the battle is griping and entertaining for every second and Fuqua maintains the flow and excitement wonderfully throughout the lengthy sequence. The stunts pulled and so on are, dare I say it, MAGNIFICENT.Now the issue I have is that we really didn't get to know the Seven. We of course get introduced to each one but aside from their contribution to the group (Bounty Hunter for Denzel for example) and their ability to fight we don't really know anything about them. Some characters like Vasquez and Red Harvest you see very little of in the film, the film mainly focuses on Chisolm, Faraday and Goodnight. Speaking of Goodnight (Ethan Hawke), there is an effort made however with him, but I didn't particularly understand what was going on in the late night chats with Chisolm. The film also lacks, to me at least, in team bonding. Yes I know they share meals together as we see some bonding but I just felt a little more was needed and to be focused on more than being a rather quick scene here and there.Overall, The Magnificent Seven is a well acted and directed classic western whose script could have used more detail in the characters introduction. I would like to point out that Peter Saarsgaard voice was quite humorous throughout, always sounding as if he's waiting for puberty to pass. So all in all, out of 10 I rate this film a magnificent 7",The Magnificent Seven

Back than I thought it was just another flick that tries to capitalize on the success of the original. Nowadays due to the whole ""woke"" culture, by comparison, it seems as almost a masterpiece.Denzel plays his usual self. Main calm hero, that saves the day, but Pratt (back then) upstages him on every turn.Hawke and the other provide decent entourage to the main heroes and in general it's a simple story, where the good guys beat the bad guys. And it works, no matter what reviews you might read here.Obviously it's not a movie for history and at best it's just a nice modern adaptation of a western, but still there is something simple and nice about it, so I'd recommend it for all ages who are interested in Wild West.Noticed something funny, the cleavage of Haley Benett started out from almost absolutely exposed, to non existent at all as the movie progressed.

I mean that in a positive way, as they have saluted the way of living, the way of striving and the way of fighting back in the 19th century. I have read that Magnificent 7 is a new combined version of ""Shichinin no samurai"" and ""Magnificent 7 1960"" (Swedish: 7 vågade livet). Well, the only thing I can say about that with the knowledge I have right now is that Magnificent 7 2016 is well worth the watch. The dialogue that runs through the entire motion picture is almost perfectly executed; professional, sometimes sophisticated, more than sometimes humorous and always drawn back to the wild towns in the wild western....and... as usual, Vincent D'Onofrio; everybody's name is Jack.....Over to the movie as a product: - The production : Maybe the make up artists, the director and the producer wanted this to be more subtle than it should have been, as the dust and the gun powder takes over hand, when blood should have run down the gritty streets of Rose Creek. - The actors : A handful of dollars.. I mean actors. Good actors, each and every one carry a more than good character deliverance. Entertaining to see Vincent D'Onofrio team up with such as Ethan Hawke and Denzel Washington, as Mr. D'Onofrio digs deep to get that peculiar man of God and western out of him... ""did you see that bear wearing human clothes?"" The glorious and... yes, magnificent Haley Bennett as Emma Cullen just gives the film more to enjoy; she is treated in a most precious way to bring forward an adorable and amazing woman. Peter Sarsgaard creates a great villain with a tired and experienced past. - Entertainment : Do you like westerns? Then you will probably like Magnificent 7. And on the other hand.... watch the movie even so. - Age : 15, definitely. Murder, violence, language.7,2 out of 10. (The final rate is based most on my own entertainment of the movie. Short elucidation of the rating: 8 Excellent movie and a solid production 7 Well made movie. Proper entertainment.)",The Magnificent Seven
168,DeuceWild_77,The decadent seven...,3,5 February 2019,"Antoine Fuqua is a fan of westerns and epic films from the Golden Age of Hollywood, he cited on interviews about his favorite movies that he watched with his Granny when he was a child such as the all time classics, ""Shane"" and ""The Searchers"".Then, he directed two ""The Magnificent Seven"" remakes, desguised as original films: ""Tears of the Sun"" and ""King Arthur"", both sharing several plot elements from the original Kurosawa classic and the Sturges' western adaptation.
The direct remake from the Yul Brynner's ""passion project"" started early on in the 90's with lots of actors attached to it, from Sylvester Stallone to Bruce Willis, Brad Pitt and Tom Cruise and even Kevin Costner, but it wasn't greenlighted until about 2010 / 2012, when Fuqua took the project for filming this story for the third time in his resume.Let me say that i like ""Tears of the Sun"", probably the last breath of the good ole Bruce Willis before he went into crappy projects and sleepwalking performances and ""King Arthur"", even if not historical accurate, it's a great adventure film, shot in the good old style of filmmaking with a perfectly selected cast.Now, this remake is not only the worst of the trio, but also a disgrace to the Kurosawa classic and Sturges' inspired take on the story.
The screenplay looks like it was written by teenagers, fans of 'shoot 'em up', there's no sense of plot, there's no morals, no codes of honour, no reasons for their change of hearts, it's just 7 random guys that love to shoot and decided to die in that village. because the plot asked to do so, plus the dialogue is terribly scripted and sounds phony in the most part.The cinematography is dull and looks like a DTV film; the art and costume design looks like a 'costume party"" in 2016 that tries too much to be the Old West, but some of the action scenes are well staged and shot (i give them that...) and the stuntwork, especially the death scenes (like Ethan Hawke's demise in the bellow tower) are among the best things about this abortion of a film.Then, it comes the cast... probably the cast director was sleeping on service or doing the routine ""let's create diversity like a Benetton poster"" for even the Eskimo people to not complain, decision supported a full throttle by the director Fuqua.Denzel Washington plays Sam Chisolm in a role originated by Toshiro Mifune and then Yul Brynner as Chris Larabee Adams, the leader of the 7.
Well, Denzel looks ridiculous in a western, and even more if his character was poorly developed and his lines are cringeworthy, and even if Mr. Denzel have in his possession 2 Oscars already and (i don't even remember how much...) nominations, he just can't 'catwalk' or be as cool or as imposing as the late great, Mr. Brynner.Then, that 'Bozo, the clown', Chris Pratt, who owns a great debt to some 'Godfather' in Hollywood, was cast in the 'King of Cool' Steve McQueen's role, when he was just playing the western version of his irritating Peter Quill / Star-Lord character, he's not worthy to fill the McQueen's boots, even if he sold his soul to the devil in search for talent...Ethan Hawke, reunited with Denzel after Fuqua's ""Training Day"", looks as much as a cajun as Sean Connery looks like an Egyptian in ""Highlander"" (but at least with Connery it worked), this kind of role as a gunfighter ""Angel of Death"" or so is totally out of his range, he did not acts or even looks the part... His character here is a mix of Brad Dexter (the greedy) and Robert Vaughn (the coward) from the Sturges' film.Vincent D'Onofrio, in the Charles Bronson role (Ok, i give you a minute to laugh hard...), the Robert De Niro of lesser films, overacts and hams up so badly that almost turned the movie into the ""Blazing Saddles"" spoof territory.The rest of the 7 is full of unknowns giving stereotyped / bland performances, except for Manuel Garcia-Rulfo, who delivered the best performance from the cast as the 'bandito"" Vasquez, he incorporated some of the legendary Eli Wallach's witty remarks to his performance (because his character have no counterpart in the Brynner's 7) and he kind of stole the movie everytime he was on screen even with limited screentime for a 6th billed actor.Peter Sarsgaard looks and acts like a 'cry baby' straight from Adam Driver's performance in the new ""Star Wars"" films, his menacing valour is below zero, the same for his entire performance.In short, watch instead the Kurosawa original film; the fabulous John Sturges' remake and the three low-budget sequels: 2nd still with Brynner, 3rd with George Kennedy and 4th with Lee Van Cleef, and even the short lived TV Show starring Michael Biehn, but skip this one...",The Magnificent Seven
169,themovieparadise,"Not a Perfect Film, But a Damn Entertaining One",8,28 September 2016,"What stands out about this movie is obviously the action. It's what you go to see this film for. And it doesn't disappoint. Antoine Fuqua knows how to direct action sequences. He doesn't fall back on shaky cam or rapid editing or any of that modern action movie bullsh*t. He keeps the camera steady and gives us wide shots, because he knows that's what people want to see. And that style of filming really works well for a Western. Everyone in this movie is pretty much a badass, and Fuqua knows we aren't going to see this movie for a deep plot or rich characters. We want to see sh*t blow up and action stars do cool things. And he delivers in spades! But while the third act finale fight was really good, I liked the shorter, smaller fight that happens in the second act better. It was just more concise and to the point, and ultimately better done. But even though the finale fight didn't live up to that second act fight, it was still great to see on screen...",The Magnificent Seven
170,fillerruth,"It is not as good as ""Training Day"" or ""Southpaw""....Strictly a marginal OK movie",4,16 September 2016,"This movie is one of the most anticipated movies of this year and finally, will release in the theater. Director Antoine Fuqua has already made some good movies and some of his movies are very good. I like his direction and the way he executes the suspense of a story, that was good and enjoyable. His ""Training Day"" is a crime drama film and ""Southpaw"" is a sports drama movie, these two movies are really good and that's why I was very curious about this release. This is a western movie and there are lots of action sequences obviously present in this movie. Antoine Fuqua frequently casts his common choice Dengel Washington. But in this movie Dengel Washington maybe not acted up to the mark. The movie is full of punching dialogues and overloaded with gunplay action. This is a western movie and it is normal to use lots of gunplay sequence but may be overloaded use of this is not good. There are lots of questions arise in this movie and lots of subplots and illogical breakdown of the story. The suspense and the thrill which the director executed are good but the unnecessary questions maybe not digestible for the audiences.Performance-wise Dengel Washington is OK and his performance is nothing to shout about. Ethan Hawke is also OK but Chris Pratt has done a wonderful job as ""Josh Faraday"". His dialogue delivery was good and only his acting makes some shines in this movie and the only enjoyable screen presence for this movie. Summer is already going but if you want to experience some hot- headed action-packed movie, this is for you. The advice is, don't expect more.",The Magnificent Seven
171,wycherleyp-960-470658,"""so far so good""",9,3 October 2016,"Antoine fuqua is a director that others in Hollywood need to pay attention to, 2014 he gave us the brilliant remake of The Equaliser and now in 2016 he took on his biggest and bravest role with the classic western ""the magnificent seven""Antoine has yet again been a success with a truly amazing remake with Oscar award winning performances from Denzil Washington and Hayley Bennett. The story of 7 mismatched gun slingers who band together to help save a town from the coruption that is bleeding it dry, With superb supporting acting from Chris Pratt, Ethan Hawke, Vincent D'Onofrio and Byung-hun Lee the magnificent severn is a masterpiece and its that good the 1960s original magnificent seven take their hat's of this remake.With the perfect bad guy in Peter Sarsgaard this is one of the best film releases of 2016.",The Magnificent Seven
172,Rawal_Afzal,A very enjoyable film!,8,28 September 2016,"Firstly, I haven't watched the original film from 1960, the one this is a remake of; so I can't compare them and hence not in a position to judge the better of the two. However, that might have been a blessing in disguise for me as that only enabled me to fully enjoy this one without any pre-conceived ideas. So unlike many others, I didn't go into the theatre to lambaste this one, although I fully believe that the original one must have been a very good film of course.Coming to the film, I had a great, great time to be very honest here. I think this film is a getting a very harsh treatment. It had a nice build-up, nice piece of planning for the battle, and then, the battle itself is a piece of gold. Highly thrilling and fully entertaining!I am very reluctant when it comes to actually going to the cinema to watch films that don't have very positive reviews to boast of, but for this one I went despite that, because I was sure that it will at least have some action, which you bet it did!Also, Chris Pratt is my second reason for sticking my neck out to decide that I am going for this one. Prior to this, I had only seen one film of him but I really admired this guy's acting, his style and the presence that he had. He really graces the screen with his expressions alone. His death scene was an icing on the cake, one of the best scenes of the film. Denzel Washington and the rest were pretty good as well.So, in short, I don't one bit regret my decision to go for this one. A really enjoyable ride that my brothers-in-law liked as much as I did.",The Magnificent Seven
173,pal05052003,A bounty hunter recruits 6 of the deadliest men in the West to protect innocent villagers and settle a personal vendetta.,8,24 September 2016,"When Denzel Washington plays an action hero, you can be sure you won't be disappointed. Despite his age, Washington continues to command the screen, has now become a new action hero. He plays a righteous bounty hunter who sets out to help a group of villagers out of sympathy. Though we can always expect Denzel to be likable and badass, he still manages to bring something different in all the characters he plays. This is what makes him different from regular action stars; who usually play one character with different names and pitted in different situations. Denzel's performance is matched by a stellar supporting cast such as Vincent D'Onofrio, Ethan Hawke, and Peter Skasgaard. D'Onofrio plays an eccentric bible talking tracker. His funny accent does not distract but serves to make his character more interesting. Hawke playing the haunted shooter who is afraid to kill brings complexity to the role. Playing vulnerable heroes is Hawke's expertise and he effortlessly portrays a hero who is troubled by his deadly skills. A welcome supporting role comes from Chris Pratt, who manages to provide comical relief while delivering one of the most heroic scenes in the end. Compare to the original, this one has more ethnic diversity, and steers towards political correctness. A black man leads the rescue of a village full of white people. A damsel in distress who has a deadly aim, etc. Though the images are crisper, Fuqua manages to portray the grime and grit of the Wild West. The shooting scene at the end is longer, and more exciting than the original. Also, the tone is more serious than the original. But I guess you can blame Christopher Nolan for making movies more serious, or blame the current situation for making things more grim. Despite these shortcomings, it was a really enjoyable movie. The end credits also used the original theme song, which is always welcome. Compared to the original, Washington can match Yul Brynner's charm and charisma. However, I still prefer Brynner slightly over Washington. The goes for Sasgaard, whose portrayal is brilliant but is not as menacing as the legendary Eli Wallach. In short, the original is superior to this version in many ways, but in the whole, this movie is a worthy successor to the original, and has made me believe that people can make good Westerns again.",The Magnificent Seven
174,robert-259-28954,Pure Hollywood Garbage.,1,26 December 2016,"This remake of the 60's classic is enough to make any serious movie fan vomit in his cowboy boots. It fails on every possible level, bastardizing every cliché in the business just to generate business. Unlike the fabulous score of the original, even the music sucks (evidently an unimaginative regurgitation of bits and pieces of everything James Horner had ever heard), none of the actors could actually ACT, and the storyline was a total desecration of the original— lacking the story, heart, and soul of perhaps the single greatest Western action/adventure film in history. The only reason I'm giving this turkey a ""1"" however, is the a accurate use of character types in the movie, wisely choosing to use talent that actually looked the part... dirty. But I'd rather take the Hollywood movie stars of the past over the bored, uninvolved actors riding roughshod through this cinematic misadventure, especially the brain dead producers who actually believe that mindless revenge and violence will ever make up for a decent script, turning good filmmaking solely into a creation for corporate profit.",The Magnificent Seven
175,he88,A Bit Over Done,7,27 October 2021,"I wanted to see this for some time since I own the original Seven Samurai and had seen the Yul Brenner version not that long ago for at least the third time. I found myself tempted to tap out about the time the seven got together. Some of the lines was just corny. The direction the film was taking seemed over simplistic in some ways and to try too hard to be flashy in other ways. I watched it on Paramount where I recorded it, but the fight scenes kept getting interrupted with commercials so that took some from them.There's also the fact that in the 1800's after the Civil war a group that's multi racial and led by a black man has barely no internal racism issues, but no external either. The towns people are cool with whatever he plans to do. I really don't think so. Still...It does work here.",The Magnificent Seven

I did not see people leaving the theater many times, but was not surprised to see them do it during this film, ridiculous remake of a great movie, no soul, no real acting, i give the 2 points to the villain, the only one who gave half heart to his job",The Magnificent Seven

178,Brevin_Campbell,A fun dumb action western,6,27 September 2016,"The Magnificent Seven adds nothing new or different to the western genre except for something that is purely campy fun. The film uses every western shootout cliché in the book and plays it up. This is a movie that knows what it is and what it wants to do. Something that the director, Antoine Fuqua, has been very good at doing lately in all of his films. In comparison to other action directors like Micheal Bay, Zack Snyder, Roland Emmirich or Chad Stahelski we can see Antoine knows how to give us characters we can attach to in order to make the fun cliché action sequences work and make a overall fun and enjoyable movie. All the performances are great. Denzel Washington gives a almost scary good performance as Chisolm as he becomes the character and gets drawn into the role. Vincent also proves that he is amazing as he portrays a over the top and angry character on the search for redemption. Byung Hun Lee's performance also gripped me with his characterization as well. This whole film is put together well and accomplishes what it needs to.",The Magnificent Seven
179,nzswanny,The Magnificent Seven rightfully gets seven.,7,30 September 2016,"I haven't seen the original, and I hadn't seen the trailer for this movie, so I walked into this film with zero expectations. I also had not read any reviews, or had a check on the tomato meter. So, when I walked out of the cinema, I had my own, completely fresh opinion...and I gotta say, it was fun, and definitely watchable. But it suffered from a lot of something I would like to call, Western Cliché.However, if you ignore the Western Clichés in the movie, and ignore the rushed moments that tried to be emotional, and instead watch the movie just for the action, you will enjoy this film, because this movie has good action sequences, and the frequent humour and fast paced story. The movie definitely needed to slow down though.Overall, I rate this a 6.9/10. If this film had no action, it would be a 5.7/10.",The Magnificent Seven

This could possibly be the worst Western I have ever seen and there have been some bad ones. Did they even watch it before releasing it? It was just so dumb.There were some positives I suppose. Scenery and stunts but that was about it.I will say though that if you are looking for a B movie to make fun of then this should fit the bill.

OK, this was a well made movie, some really good actors, but it seemed almost ""soulless"", no real punch; it was predictable and needlessly violent. The viewer is one step ahead of the plot. There are too many silly aspects in the movie, for example the trench defence, and way too many long distance shots fired by revolvers. I think that they just tried too hard to make a good movie, and ended up with a mediocre film. Good, but not great.",The Magnificent Seven
182,texshelters,"If you like clichés, the Magnificent Seven is for you.",4,27 September 2016,"Magnificent Seven: Serviceable, not magnificentIf you like clichés, the Magnificent Seven (Mag7) is for you. It has all kinds of clichés: the visuals, the dialogue, the plot, and the characters served up few surprises and broke no new ground. The acting on the whole is much better than the original Western version of Mag7, but the dialogue is as hackneyed as ever. The last line in the film, moreover, is cringe-worthy. Let's give Director Antoine Fuqua some points for taking on a difficult remake. And let's take those points away, and more, for being a purveyor of everything that is wrong about Westerns: villains who can't shoot, stupid villains, heroes that are lucky villains can't shoot while running in the open, unquestioned misogyny, a brave Native America who has yet to pick up a gun to shoot by 1876, a much superior weapon to a bow and arrow at that point, an overwrought soundtrack reminiscent of the worst of John Williams bombastic Star Wars scores, people ""taking the high ground"", shooting from a church steeple, and so on. Fuqua clearly wasn't trying to do anything original. If he was, he would have told his own tale and written his own script or adopted a book that hasn't been a film yet. What he does get right is casting Denzel Washington, who I am convinced could act in any genre and come out looking good. I have a horror film in the can waiting for him. So instead of dwelling on the downsides of the genre, let's rate the actors: Denzel Washington as Chisolm: He's charismatic and does the most with a little. Chris Pratt as Josh Faraday: He's mediocre and his role is poorly written. Ethan Hawke as Goodnight Robicheaux: Hawke is wasted here, and I don't mean his character is drunk most of the time. I mean he has too little to do. He would have been better cast as the villain in this film. Vincent D'Onofrio as Jack Horne: I hate this character; D'Onofrio does nothing to endear himself here. Byung-hun Lee as Billy Rocks: He's charismatic and soon, I hope, to be a big star. However, here he is wooden and constrained by lack of character development in the script. Manuel Garcia-Rulfo as Vasquez: Bring out the stereotypes. His character was embarrassing. Martin Sensmeier as Red Harvest: The camera loves this guy. No wonder, he's a model. Can he act? We don't know; Fuqua didn't give him anything to do but shoot a bow and look good. Haley Bennett as Emma Cullen: terrible role and acting. She couldn't hold her own. Emily Blunt or another actress might have been better, but perhaps not with the script as it was. Peter Sarsgaard as Bartholomew Bogue: the main villain, this role is terrible and Sarsgarrd doesn't make it better. He's wooden and whiny, in fact. Hawke, Oldman, Brolin, hell, Emily Blunt would have been better in this terrible role. Rating: Matinée It's not the worst film of the year, and if you like Westerns, go see it. Moreover, the scenery and shots ARE magnificent, especially the tracking shots. But if you like film, watch Seven Samurai. And if you must see a Western, watch any number of classics from John Ford or Sergio Leone. Peace, Tex Shelters",The Magnificent Seven
183,quiqueperezsoler,"A spectacle with little substance. Overshadowed by the original. ""Missed shot"" at an amazing team-up of such great cast",7,16 April 2020,"Maybe it's because of the straight forward plot and forced quirky characterizations that this movie finds a way to not lend itself more room for development. To ground the world, the setting, the stakes and, mostly, the characters. Missing heart-to-heart moments and scenarios that showcase the reactions and personalities of the characters. We have seen western movies before and we can understand those themes and tropes, but what makes the greatest western movies stand out from the overly saturated genre are subverting our expectations of those conventionalities.Although following a formulaic structure, the westerns that seem to stand out from the rest critically (this coming from a 24 year-old who has barely scratched the surface of the genre and concludes this from analysing the most critically acclaimed titles) have either an engaging and unconventional plot or an endearing and well-realised cast. Aside from good practical effects, cinematography and soundtrack.In every western, when there are no duels, showdowns or action scenes, there're heart-to-heart moments where we see characters getting to know each other better, romances flourish and fears discussed that strengthen the ties between them. And especially when there's such an amazing cast of very different characters those moments are highly needed and have to be devoted to that in order for the audience to care for whatever happens to them in the story.The movie treats the audience with a spectacle of gunfire and staredowns and we relish them as they are good ol' western formulaic tropes that we never stop enjoying. But it seems like the movie is holding back on developing its characters and somewhat its plot. We have but almost one line of backstory for each and there's not enough going on in the movie to see them react to different scenarios and situations to find out their personalities.Not to mention the female lead, who's very underutilised. She initates the plan to take back the town and gathers the men to do so. And that would have been enough for her involvement in the story given the archetypes of western female characters but the movie goes out of its way to give her a feisty personality and a reason to fight but doesn't do almost anything with it. She is sidelined most of the times and when we get a character developing moment the scene cuts too soon to switch back to the plot.The huge cast of renowned actors prevented the deeper development of those characters but unforutantely the movie doesn't treat us with much of a complex or eventful story to stop us from wondering why weren't those moments there. And when the time comes to see these characters mourn a death, have a team-up badass moment or joke with each other it's good for the ride and the espectacle but it leaves no bigger mark.Nevertheless the movie has many good things going on for it, the entire third act is brilliantly executed, it's loud and exciting. It brings a sense of finality to the story like Avengers' Endgame did, only in this one we felt for those goodbye moments, jokes and team-up fights because we knew a lot about the characters and we have seen them grow and interact with each other through time and that's what I think this movie needed. It needed a trilogy or a prequel to set up the showdown. In this movie we see a grandiose battle, each of them fighting for their own reason but most of the time we don't know the reason. So their demise is not as impactful as it should.There are so many slow showdowns and duels that the end duel doesn't feel earned or that impactful not to mention the underdeveloped generic motivationless villain. I haven't seen the original 1960s movie but I've seen enough westerns to know from the premise of the movie the sort of beats and themes it must have followed and there are all there but they are just not maxed out.IN CONCLUSION, the movie is fun and exciting, is a parade of explosions, gun fights and good witty dialogue with very little depth to it and a script based solely in the interactions and superficial goals of each character in the story. It's fun to watch and doesn't make you think about it much, it's just plain fun.",The Magnificent Seven
184,Oberrated,Greatly entertaining and fun,8,26 September 2016,"No clever quips here. No dramatic intro drawing out my opinion. 'The Magnificent Seven' was everything I was expecting it to be. It was a wild ride from start to finish. It had that classic western feel to it while still being presented in crystal clear quality and having modern day effects... In the day and age of remakes and sequels, this was one done well. It was a strong and fresh take on the classic story and everyone felt natural while being witnessed on screen. Everyone was a strong co-star and no one felt like a ""supporting"" actor or actress, in my opinion. To me, Vincent D'Onofrio absolutely stole the show. Each time he opened his mouth he had me laughing in my seat and he was such a strong presence on screen, absolutely loved him. It was especially fun to watch him play his role of Jack Horne coming from my last viewing of him being Kingpin in the Marvel TV series 'Daredevil'. Aside from Vincent, as I said before; everyone was a star in this film. I would name everyone but I would be drawing this review out too much for my taste... For any form of a negative critique, I would only say that I was not a fan of Peter Sarsgaard's character, although I am not saying he did a bad job, I just did not like his character's demeanor. Which, in turn, could simply just mean he did a great job at portraying Bartholomew. So in sense, no negative critiques!I highly recommend 'The Magnificent Seven'. It is a great modern- feeling film despite being a western, while also dealing a great respect to the original. It is good entertainment for any film lover.

It had nothing in common with the original other than the title and they were both supposedly westerns. The 2016 Seven was just plain dumb. A lot of what made it dumb was the over-the-top bloodshed. Then there was the clear attempt at politically correct inclusiveness concerning those 7. The movie started out with Denzel Washington walking into a saloon and every new gunslinger that came onto the screen during those early scenes who was not one of the evil bad guys was obviously going to be a member of the Seven. And every new gunslinger was of a different demographic. I wonder if they considered having a gun-wielding person in a motorized wheelchair. It would not have taken the craziness of the movie that much further into the absurd.Then they ended the movie with some moving, heart-rendering music as they showed the graves of those of the Seven who did not survive the carnage, as though the film were some real-life portrayal of actual heroes.

I have watched last four of the Fuqua's film in cinemas which says a lot and each time he has delivered a very good movie. The Magnificent Seven is no different with respect to that. What makes The Magnificent Seven standout is its intensity and crisp screenplay. The Magnificent Seven is a remake of 1960's classic of the same name. I haven't watched the original, so I cannot compare the two. Making a movie with the theme of the Wild West is not easy. There have been so many movies of the same type and it is very difficult to avoid the clichés. But The Magnificent Seven has no time for all that. It is a super-fast flick although it runs for 120 minutes. The story is a simple justice-revenge saga against an evil landlord plotted by oppressed villagers with the help of seven gunmen who are one of their kinds. While the first 50 minutes or so is how Denzel Washington recruits and brings them together, and the remaining movie is packed with action and how the team bonds together. Movies like this need to be very good at technical departments and The Magnificent Seven excels in cinematography and background score. It definitely has a Wild West feel to it but also not too much to irritate you. Action scenes are well shot, but the need for PG 13 rating makes it lacks a bit of that extra punch. There are so many blink and a miss good action sequences so you better not look at your phone screen during this movie. I would only like to be critical about how the movie doesn't have much time for the bonding and interaction of 'the seven'.Antoine Fuqua is one of the directors who love to cast their favourite actors again and again. Denzel Washington yet again delivers a commendable lead performance in a Fuqua movie. He is one of my favourite actors and he never disappoints. Well by watching the trailers we all knew what Chris Pratt would bring to the movie and this talented actor is a treat to watch. Vincent D'Onofrio has quite a unique character. Ethan Hawke has been given an apt role for his age. Manuel Garcia-Rulfo and Martin Sensmeier are less famous of the lot and they don' disappoint. Byung Hun Lee for me is the show stealer who makes his action speak louder than words. Peter Saarsgard as the antagonist could have been much more more menacing. Chloe Bennet, Matt Bomer and Luke Grimes play the stereotypical supporting roles. The Magnificent Seven is yet another piece of great cinema making by Antoine Fuqua. Don't miss it if you are an action fan or a Denzel Washington fan or a Wild West movie fan or simply saying, a movie fan.",The Magnificent Seven
188,KATO-SUBZERO,"Magnificent 7, Magnificent Denzel. Great remake",9,27 September 2016,"27 September 2016 I saw it tonight and it was really good. I did notice that director, Anton Fuqua gave the female leading role to unknown actress Haley Bennett, who appeared in a much smaller role with Denzel in ""The Equalizer"" as a Russian hooker, who gets killed by Russian bad guy, brilliantly portrayed by actor Morton Csokas as Teddy. Also actor Ethan Hawke from ""Training Day"" is also in this movie. Peter Skarsgard was okay, but again Morton Csokas would have done a better job.Good action, good direction and what I also really liked is the new cast with a more Interracially mixed cast of a Korean, Mexican, and the lead African American. For the Hispanic role, I think Spanish actor, Antonio Banderas would have been better and looked better in the role. I give this a 9 on the scale.",The Magnificent Seven

I believe there was a black bounty hunter and lawman in post Civil War times,I do not have his name, so Chisholm is not so incongruous. I think everybody knows that pistols were not accurate beyond thirty paces, but every shot by the heroes hits a mark even with moving targets! As has been said if you have Gatling gun (prone to jamming BTW)capable of shredding the town from a safe distance why not use it, and save a lot of lives in the bad guy ranks? Also why did the very long frontal charge keep going while they were being blown up? They are not the Light Brigade after all. Then the 'bad Indian' takes time to shoot the Mountain Man full of arrows, unnecessarily, and nobody takes a shot a him while he is thus occupied.

190,martinrey-15593,Very Well Remade,8,5 June 2020,"It's a big call to remake a classic western like the 1960 The Magnificent Seven but director Antoine Fuqua has succeeded nicely.
Its characters maybe not as close to the original cast but they do a good job.
In it's own right its one of the best westerns in the last few years and as good as remake as 2010's True Grit.
Great sets, nice acting and a nicely paced plot.
Theres plenty of action mixed in, maybe as a criticism a little too much in the later stages of the movie.

191,NDbportmanfan,Doesn't Seem to Deviate too Far from the Original Magnificent 7,7,10 February 2017,"I don't have a problem with studios remaking classic movies as long as they can put a cool new spin on them. What this film tried to do didn't leave me on the edge of my seat as the differences primarily dealt with the characters rather than the story. It was nice to see more of the seven getting more screen time. The 60's version had about three of the seven receiving significant roles while this film did a decent job of adding depth to the cast. I would say five of the seven had a decent amount of lines. One of the major hits this movie takes before releasing to theaters is having Denzel replace Yul Brynner. I am not saying Denzel is a bad actor by any means; he was just given the impossible task of matching Yul's presence. While I watched the 60's version there was just that constant intensity. I just get that feeling in the remake, well a little from Vincent's character but that was about it. (Vincent played an awesome character and turned out to be the highlight of the movie).The pacing of the movie was good, nothing seemed rushed in the slightest. The dialogue was okay, nothing was all that quotable. As far as action scenes go it was rather middle of the road, nothing blew my mind, but I also was not left scratching my head saying really (okay maybe once but that is a spoiler).This was not a bad film and the current rating of a 7.0 is spot on the mark. The movie is a decent remake with many familiar scenes to the original. Whether you liked it or hated it you should still give the 60's version a try.",The Magnificent Seven
192,amiranda-39274,MAGnificent 7: what could have been,3,26 August 2017,"I love the original magnificent 7 1960 its what made me love cowboys as a little kid, i even watched the original seven samurai it was based on, despite the magnificent 7 being a remake of the seven samurai, it still had its own story that felt awe inspiring & different, that made it a classic. Magnificent 7 2016 is nothing like it, its not even a shot for shot remake, they tried to recreate a new story but failed. i loved the idea of multiple ethnic characters, i don't think denzel made much difference, but a native American and Japanese sword fighter being apart of the team, that sounded amazing. i was actually hoping they were going to somehow fuse the 2 movies together, like samurai and cowboys and Indians! even having a girl apart of the team sounded cool. but they made everything awkward, instead of the story being about a bunch of anti-heroes/ misfits who are only helping because of money but learning how to be real heroes at the end, there was no character development whatsoever, each of the 7 just joined without hesitation, also when they introduced the 7 in the original they made each one of them recognizable and interesting, the 2016 7 were awkward introductions and did not convince me at all that they were right for the job. the girl could have been more interesting, if she was the outlaw i would have been impressed, her husbands death was also cliché. And the villain, i hated this guy he was boring and pathetic, even his joker speech at the beginning was boring,i was thinking how cool it would have been if the leader was like an ex samurai, just to be a shout out to 7 samurai. And i don't have a problem with a bunch of nicely dressed, white bandits, but the original had Mexican bandits, in fact a Mexican village, in that one the people had no choice to leave and that's why they seemed more desperate, in this one half the town left, there was no reason for anyone to stay. Denzels almost nonexistent revenge was boring, even the always cool Chris Pratt,had a final scene more cringy than his GoG dance battle. This had potential, i blame the writers for no originality and editors for awkward transitions,this movie is still watchable, but is still a bad remake, i hope Denzel and Chris Pratt can work together again,though.",The Magnificent Seven
193,rioplaydrum,Lacks just about everything,3,24 September 2016,"Yes, Denzel makes for one very cool bad-ass with his shiny Colt .45 strapped to his hip with the butt forward, but that's about it.There is almost nothing in this picture that is a surprise or unpredictable. Dialog between actors is awkward and stilted (and sometimes completely unintelligible). Very little background on any of the characters is presented and offers no development what-so-ever.Take ""Red Harvest"", the crack Indian archer outcast. We practically beg to know more about him, but all we get is his announcement, ""The elders have said I'm on a different path"", and boom, he's in the club. Please. The movie is over two hours long, and that's all we get?There is a few laughs and a decent stunt here and there, but all that could have been accomplished in a much shorter run time and on a fraction of the ridiculous $95 million dollar budget.More plot holes than you can count, and a final gun battle that is so technically improbable it will ruin what little suspension of dis-belief you had left. Example? The Gatling gun that fires hundreds of rounds on a single clip and magically zeros in on strategic targets... from a quarter mile away!Also present is a fair amount of politically correct 'hate whitey' propaganda. When Red Harvest isn't pegging bad guys with his bow and arrows he frequently complains about 'white man's food', and all the white heroes are the only ones who get killed.I wasn't amused.This movie is a perfect example of why I rarely venture out to see a first run picture for the same amount of money I could have spent on a half tank of gasoline.Maybe your kids will enjoy it, but you will not.For real, don't bother.",The Magnificent Seven
194,warthogjump,"Not bad, with room for improvement",7,3 October 2016,"I won't provide an extensive review of the film as there seems to be many here already. I will just give my opinion of why I feel this movie fell short of greatness.The biggest flaw would be not enough character development. And I say 'not enough' instead of 'lack of' because there was some development with characters. Many interesting traits of each character were introduced, but not continued with.The action was good; but, could have been better. It felt too Hollywoodized instead of realistic - coming from the director of Training Day and the Equalizer, I was expecting the action to be more along those lines - but it wasn't.The movie was long, but it didn't utilize its time wisely. For a movie this long, there should have been more character development, and also better cinematography.Overall, there was a lot of lost potential. Fuqua is a great director, no doubt about it, and it does show throughout Magnificent Seven, but I think he oversimplified this particular work, didn't put as much effort as previous times, and simply missed the mark.Having said that, it is an overall good film and an enjoyable watch, just don't expect something so amazing.6.8/10",The Magnificent Seven
195,thegulls1,"Revivalist Western - more action, less dramatic appeal than the original",7,30 December 2016,"More extended shoot-em-ups, and extended battle scenes. A little light on character development. Edgier villains.Speaking of character development, it can be achieved by several means, and once we explore that, we can see the superiority of the 1960 version: 1> by how a person acts.. 2> or reacts 3> by what a person says .. 4> or what others say about him 5> by how others react to him.Shakespeare wrote the book on this, I am told.So, in the original, we see different motivations for each of the mercenaries - and the Mexicans who hire them grow a little bit, too (Remember: ""There's a man for us -- look at the scars on his face!"" ""The man for us is the one who gave him those scars""). This is all established before the group leaves for the village. But, we learn later that Chico was a humble farmer before this expedition -- he opts to stay, with the pretty young farming girl who has grown fond of him.In this film, the characters arrive as cardboard cutouts - I'm not saying always bad cutouts - Denzel does a lot with his role, as always. But I don't think he's given the rich script that Yul Brynner had. Script and actors were just superior in the original, probably because they stuck to the themes in the earlier Japanese film.But I didn't mind this one - I'd give it a 7! I'd like to see more revivalist westerns. Hollywood has a lot of tools to work with in cinematography. In my opinion, the last great modern western was Silverado (1985) - by coincidence, I thought the bad guy in that one, Brian Dennehy, would have been perfect for the crazy fat guy role played by Vincent D'Onofrio (sadly, Brian is almost 80 now - how time flies!).",The Magnificent Seven
196,shadowfax73,PC characters that it's hard to care about,4,27 March 2017,"From the trailers this looked like it would be an excellent remake of John Sturges's version. It looks the part, the actors are fine but the story kind of sucks. The build up to the climax is just OK - Chris Pratt's character tries hard to be a man of humor but undermines what should be growing tension in the movie as the suicidal battle approaches. Ethan Hawke's character is way too angst driven. Robert Vaughan played the character as outwardly cool and confident but was battling demons inside. only near the end of the movie do you realize just how frightened he has become at the loss of his skills. The new movie has two-dimensional characters, other than Denzil W's part. The build-up is bland and nearly every recruit is brought onboard via some humorous dialogue or actions. The final battle is so over the top that it becomes one big bore. The worst thing in the whole movie for me is when Chris Pratt's character deliberately commits suicide so he can take out the gatling gun - and it's done in a way that is even more unbelievable than the attack on the town. Why did he and one or two others not ride out the back of the town, round behind the trees which were left and right of the gatling gun, come up from behind and shoot the sh@t out of the a-holes? Chris Pratt's death is a complete joke and is the nail in the coffin of a movie that tries to be an honorable tribute to the original but ends up being a mess.",The Magnificent Seven

198,BillSims28,"Five-Word Review: Wonderfully Over-the-top; Entertaining, Solid Fun",6,2 October 2016,"With a crew boasting 'Training Day' trio Antoine Fuqua, Denzel Washington and Ethan Hawke, in addition to Chris Pratt and Vincent D'Onofrio, 'The Magnificent Seven' should be a real riot. Luckily, it is. Though the story - an unsavoury bunch terrorise a peaceful town, and in step the heroes - epitomises standard Western formula, this modern take on the stale recipe, in addition to the gleeful flaunting of clichés and excellent cast chemistry makes for a fun time.Pratt, Washington, and Byung-Hun-Lee are excellent, and Peter Sarsgaard is as dastardly as they come as a Very Villainous Villain. The script whizzes by for the most part, and although in places the film feels overlong and stretched out, it's mostly a riotous ride. The standout scenes are of course the action scenes, with the modern approach to the Western style of violence really working, especially when the filmmakers give in to the ridiculousness of it all - at one point near the end a character comes roaring into battle on a galloping horse, leaping over a huge fire in slow motion wielding two guns, for example. The other Western clichés are also excellently flaunted: an outsider entering a saloon to disapproval; an ominous ride into town on a horse; the tension-riddled Mexican standoffs; the dastardly black-clothing-wearing villain; the hard-bitten woman; the roguish Mexican character. It's clearly been made by people who appreciate Westerns, and the whole thing feels part homage, part reboot of a genre which has suffered heavily in recent years with the over-modernised 'Cowboys and Aliens' and 'The Lone Ranger'. For that reason, it's very good. On the other hand, the plain ludicrousness can only go so far and at times the film feels generic and bland instead of irreverent and tongue-in-cheek. Then there are some choices which just feel bizarre, such as the off-putting squeak of Vincent D'Onofrio's character, some silly action clichés (variable amounts of ammo, main character invulnerability), and anticlimaxes. Nevertheless, overall it's a perfectly fun film and if you're looking for something to do it's a great thing to see, even if it won't stay long in the memory. 64/100.",The Magnificent Seven
199,slayerjmk95,"An Unneeded Remake, But Well-Deserved Return",9,2 October 2016,"The Magnificent Seven is both a remake of the 1960 film, and of the Japanese classic which the first Magnificent Seven is based on, Seven Samurai. In this film, warrant officer Sam Chisolm is ""recruited by Emma Cullen after her town is attacked and terrorized by Bartholomew Bogue and his men, who plans to fully take the town and use the townsfolk for mining. Chisolm in turn recruits six more fighters to help defend the town and its people.This is a timeless story that, while didn't need to be retold or remade, is well-deserved and welcomed by how truly phenomenal the entire cast is, and of the true grit (no pun intended there) through which the friendship between these random strangers flourishes, as they come to answer a higher calling that goes beyond gold. I would talk about specific cast members, but everyone was just perfect. Denzel is signature Denzel at his finest, Chris Pratt brings a real balance to being both hysterical and heroic, Ethan Hawke is tragic and heart-breaking, as is D'Onfrio. Byung-hun Lee is brilliant as Billy Rocks, Garcia-Rulfo a scene-stealer and Sensmeier a vision as Red Harvest. Even Sarsgaard's Bogue was a memorable villain, for being the right amount of coward as much as tyrannical monster. The direction from Fuqua was solid, and he too was at his A-game, and I would say this is one of his best films yet (behind Training Day and Equalizer, but tied with Southpaw). While there was nothing new with the story, the writing was still absolutely brilliant, especially coming from True Detective scribe Nic Pizzolatto, as well as Richard Wenk. One thing I personally loved most about this movie though wasn't just the cast or the fantastic production, but the music. You can hear James Horner's touch in a few of the more adventurous ques, and in an action sequence, and on top of that bringing the original Magnificent Seven theme back from Elmer Bernstein.The Magnificent Seven is a fun, brilliant and well-made remake that does the original story justice, and while it doesn't do anything new or fresh with the story, the re-telling with realism, brutality and raw emotion through the outstanding cast makes the lack of innovation unnecessary. No, it's not perfect, and not everyone will like it, but it is still a truly impressive feat considering most remakes are unnecessary and fall flat, even if they try to do something new or innovative (though some remakes are successful, just not most). I would put this alongside the remake of 3:10 to Yuma, which is arguably an instant classic, and truly powerful.

(I am forever grateful I didn't have to see Haley Bennet's character unrealistically fall for one of the 7) The only flaw, if you will, is that it doesn't have any iconic scenes that will stick to one's memory foerver. It's very good, but clearly no masterpiece. Even the soundtrack was nice while watching, but forgettable. And the showdown between the hero and the villain was almost a letdown.

My parents told me about this one and I just had to go see it being a fan of westerns like John Wayne and many more. So while my fiancée was at her bridal shower I went of to a movie and it was this one.And when I did see it it was amazing, everything was well done and the action was none stop. I was literally on the edge of my seat it was that tense and fun the cast did a great job and the characters had meaning to the story, each one offered his or her own skills and talents and fighting styles. There was also a lot of cultural diversity between the characters. Here is a list of awesome characters that are very diverse.*CHARACTER SPOILERS BELOW*Sam Chisolm/Denzel Washington: The leader of the seven, he is an African American with a mysterious past that is connected to the villain. A gunslinger he assembles the team. He is brave, but also very compassionate he is also very calm and kept, but when he leaps into action he is amazing. He is also a lawman. Josh Faraday/Chris Pratt: A second in command, the second member of the team. He is a gambler and major drinker, he is also the clown of the team and cracks jokes here and there making the audience laugh, but you can see he has a good heart too. Josh can be cocky and reminds me of a Han Solo type of character.Goodnight Robicheaux/Ethan Hawke: The third member of the team. A Civil War Confederate sharpshooter veteran, is claimed to have been one of General Robert E. Lees best sharpshooters. Is good friends with Chisolm and has a past connection with him, he is kind, polite, and a gentlemen. Has a anxiety with war. Billy Rocks/Byung-Hun Lee: The Fourth Member of the team. An East Asian assassin who is a partner and friend to Goodnight he is an excellent fighter with knives and is very quick and agile. Billy has a quiet personality but is very open and friendly he is also a quick thinker too.Manuel Garcia-Rulfo/Vasquez: The Fifth member of the team. A Mexican outlaw hunted by Chisolm but sides with him to help the seven. He is also very cocky and proud. Jack Horne/Vincent D'Onofrio: The Sixth Member of the team. A mountain man who hunts Indians and is very religious. Has a very high pitch voice but his personality is all over the place. He can be kind and wise, but very rough and tough when it comes of fighting. Martin Sensmeier/Red Harvest: The Seventh and Final member of the team. A Comanche warrior and Native American I consider him my favorite. He is very serious and doesn't talk much but when it comes to action he is the coolest of the team. He is a regular awesome character.Haley Bennett/Emma Cullen: The woman who hires on the seven. She is brave and good with a gun. She is a simple woman but has fire of a personality.Peter Sarsgaard/Bartholomew Bogue: The villain of the story, a greedy land owner who will stop at nothing to get what he wants and what he thinks he ""deserves"". He is uptight but can also be a coward. All in all the Magnificent Seven was Magnificent, with not doing much westerns today the film industry hit big on this one. It would be cool if they did a sequel in my opinion. One of the best westerns I have seen in my day.",The Magnificent Seven

The casting and acting was great - Denzel does a great job as the leader of this rag tag group of guys.

208,Pramitheus,Remake of a remake done good,8,8 December 2016,"I was fairly concerned with a remake of a remake but the name Antoine Fuqua gave hope. His movies like Training Day, Shooter, Tears of the Sun and Southpaw are some of my favourite movies. Not all time favourite, but the type of favourite where you can just sit and watch it for the nth time and still enjoy. This adds to that list. It's such a well-made movie and such minor improvements made to the original remake that there are very few complaints.STORY – The story is kept the same. A small village is terrorized by a baron and the villagers are divided on whether to cave-in or revolt. So some of them ask out for help to a gunslinger after witnessing his feat of heroism. This hero embarks on a journey to rope in some of the finest assassins to help this village and help get them their village back. Simple story set in a Western-themed time. So far, so good. The premise was acceptable when in it came out in 1960, but in 2016 the expectations are bound to increase. Still, I am going to give them props to keep the story the same as the original. I had watched the original 1960 remake a fair time ago but I do remember that there was a point where one of the characters Chico, infiltrate the bandits to know about their plans and that adds a layer to the bandit gang. That they are so naive that they don't even know who their band members are, plus it shows that they are actually running low on supplies. Here though, there is no such moment except Red Harvest going to check out and coming back and reporting and the villain Bogue, is shown to be one dimensional with no such compelling background and is a villain for the sake of being a villain.DIRECTION(and dialogue) – I understand this is a remake but I think a few changes should have been made which would have made the movie a bit more relevant. I don't know that whether it was for the sake of promoting multiple races or the demand of the script but when the directors have sought to do it, I think they should have put some more substance into that angle. Here's why. In 2016 everybody appreciates character development and moments which build up an ensemble team. Here the writers didn't explore that part. They just copied and pasted the process of their bonding. There wasn't any definitive moment where the whole group could fall apart because they were from different backgrounds. I mean, I can assume people then were less simpler but human nature isn't that simple. Maybe I am overthinking, but a few more altercations showcasing the different mindsets of the variety of characters would have elevated the movie. The dialogue was top- notch. It didn't have any amount of cheesiness to it like Western movies usually have and it was fun. Other than that, the action scenes were amazing. No doubt about it.CINEMATOGRAPHY – The film was mainly comprised of outdoor shots. My favourite shot was before the actual fight when Chisolm is sitting on his horse in the field looking at the village. It was beautiful. The original remake had a lot of outdoor shots of them riding from place to place but it was done so many times that it became very boring. Here, somehow it looked awesome. I mean, making horse-riding look cool in 2016 isn't easy. You have to give credit for that. I can say that because I recently saw a movie Mirzya, in which horse- riding was an integral part but boy, did they make it boring. So yes, horse-riding when done right looks pretty amazing.ACTING – How can you expect this cast to do bad acting? It's impossible. Denzel Washington, awesome. Denzel Washington just plays these grey characters with a heart of gold with ease. Now, when you have Denzel Washington shooting and horse-riding you better thank the movie gods for making this happen. Chris Pratt, again, awesome. He is the perfect guy to star in action-adventure movies. He isn't plastic like usually action-adventure stars turn out to be. He is like a modern day Harrison Ford. Good to see Andy Dwyer travelling in space, chasing dinosaurs and now gun-slinging. He strikes the perfect balance between humour and action. Ethan Hawke, awesome. I hope he gets more movies. He does what he does best and he does it with dedication. Here he did the PTSD affected Goodnight very well. Vincent D'Onofrio, awesome. He was like a gentle giant. I liked the voice change that he did. I think it was his own improvisation and it fitted well. Byung Hun Lee mainly played off Ethan Hawke and it was good. Matt Sensmeier didn't have much scope but he did his part well. It didn't feel like a caricature. OK, Haley Benett is extremely beautiful. Had to say it. Her character never lost the fact that she has suffered immense loss. Props to the writing department for that too for not striking an unnecessary romance out of nowhere. She was strong, compassionate and humane without being too weepy. My major gripe, like I said before was Peter Saarsgard. I don't know if it was the writing or the acting but Bogue didn't really stand out for me.FINAL VERDICT – I didn't like that last CGI burial scene. I mean, why don't just shoot that scene? It looked really out of place. OK! This is a very good remake. Watch it if you haven't watched it already. Certainly not any benchmark for remakes but this is the optimum level which should be maintained to make a remake. Or else, just don't. Certainly a benchmark for Western style movies and any action movie.P.S.– I really didn't expect Matt Bomer to die so early in the movie.",The Magnificent Seven
209,randreww,Tumble weed,2,8 November 2018,"Yet another remake has come & gone; unlike the original. This is a classic example of how they just don't know how to make films any more. Heck! They don't even know how to write new material, hence why they just keep purloining better works! But this is a real stinker! Yes, it is politically correct. And in typical millennial fashion, everything is shot the same as Netflix TV shows.With generic nondescript stock music; bereft of melody, motif & inimitable orchestra hierarchy; where low subs & sampled feral percussion pound away like The Dark Knight. And the strobe editing compensates for a complete lack of understanding what makes a scene feel real, tense, & historically imaginative.Life was slow back then. But the director thought that constantly strafing dolly shots looked more ""cool"" & contempo. You had gun fights where there were long pauses in shoot-outs where people had to reload. But the director thought it best to have all the shots evenly spaced (1 every half a second) so it sounds more ""cool"" & action-packed in the cinema. There was less dialog, more stares & long pauses, but the director thought that long preachy self-righteous eulogies with that droning sub-score was more modern. There was little in the way of hygiene back yonder before warm running water became of age. But instead of ugly, haggard, toothless, sebaceous men with red necks & dirt; we have all perfectly trimmed, immaculate, close shaven, white teeth 'models' - & a fat man.The fact that today's action is a trite bore-fest with interlaced CGI- premeditation reveals that this media has grown dull & predictable. And somewhat worthless, beyond a family smashing their barely conscious capitalist brains out for the evening.Stanley Kubrick once opined that he cared less for what happened, in favour of how it happened.The original still feels timeless, accurate, real, & powerful. Like many westerns back then; They demonstrated how to master one's techniques & therefore be liberated from them. You hardly notice any of the director tropes & daft shaky camera work because there IS none. It is shot with the intention of having no intention. ""The Art of fighting, without fighting"" as Bruce Lee said.If the film makers can't understand this, they are wasting everybody's time.

210,MichaelNontonMulu,2016 Remake of 1960 Remake of 1954 Original!,7,25 September 2016,"This movie was good in term of action. There was the classic gunfight between fewer people against larger army, the one on one duel, and also the use of explosives. As it also involved Indians, there were also the use of arrows in these fights plus the cool knives throwing. As for the supposed dramatic moments, there were some of them here and there and some minor humor as well. However, there was not a lot of touching moments in this movie. No hard thought twist either, although the story did give a little surprise in the end.The first 1 hour during the introduction of the Magnificent Seven, I felt the pace was a little bit slow. In fact, I personally think it should have been a little bit faster. This resulted to the gun fights scenes were limited to only once in the middle and another in the big finale. Luckily, the big showdown in the last 40 minutes were totally cool. I loved how that finale was made, as it was great and satisfying. The characters of the 7 persons were actually good. I think this was due to the fact that most of them were portrayed by quite senior & well known actors. The director Antoine Fuqua was also quite famous in directing some good movies such as Oscar winning movie Training Day, the cool action movie The Equalizer and many others.The special effects were quite decent, while the sound effect was pretty good. But to me, the time spent on introduction was too long and the time spent with the town people too little. It did not create the feeling why the seven of them would be so attached and willing to sacrifice for the lives of those people. I did not have the chance to watch the original 1960 version as well as the 1954 version of Seven Samurai by Akira Kurosawa, but if I read the story line, those put the emphasis on the relationship of the seven good guys with the people they would help. I think that was the reason why that one made a great classic, but I do no think this one would be. Anyway, if you are a fan of western cowboy genre, then you can definitely watch this one. There was not a lot of such movies nowadays so the options are pretty limited. If you are not a fan of such genre, you can still enjoy this one as the story was quite universal of good guys helping the oppressed smaller people against a large army of bad guys. The only difference is the background is during the Wild West period. The famous stars playing in this movie could also be a good attraction for people to see, as I believe Denzel Washington, Chris Pratt, Ethan Hawke, Lee Byung Hun all have their own fanbase.For my complete review, please have a look in michaelnontonmulu.blogspot.co.id",The Magnificent Seven

212,ReelLifeReviews,A very worthy western,7,12 February 2017,"7/10 appropriately enough. Action packed would probably be an understatement. The entire third act was a gunfight, no exaggeration. Chris Pratt played Chris Pratt as usual but I still can't hate him. I would have liked to get more backstory on the different people, but with there being 7 of them, that just wouldn't be doable. Vincent D'onofrio's character was wholly unique. I'm curious if that's how the character was written up or if it was something he chose to bring to the role. This is also the best I've seen Ethan Hawk in a while. For too long he's played the same cookie cutter characters, but this gave him a chance to do something a bit different.

214,leosmith-11166,Best western made in recent years that isn't Tarantino,9,30 September 2016,"A 2016 remake of the classic 1960 western that is considered one of the best of it's genre. The concept really doesn't sound that promising. But, it is. Antonio Fuqua's ripping film about seven men bound together with a sense of heroism is a rewarding experience, and a fresh breath for remakes. The use of practical effects, mixed with a star studded cast and a awesome score, add up to the greatest Western made in the last few years,which wasn't directed by Tarantino.Only admiration can be felt for Fuqua, who takes cinematic risks in an unrisky film industry. The risks I'm talking of are the use of a multicultural cast, with, in a rare event within Hollywood, places the native Indianan as a protagonist. The action sequences are shot with extreme care, and the any use of cinematography is carefully planned, to maximize the emotions felt by the audience, whilst using iconic and gripping imagery to draw the viewer in the west. The bold use of violence of blood is a relief for a PG-13 film, and Fuqua deliberately capitalizes on the effect blood can have on the audience. But the one thing that sticks out of this film the most is in the exploration of human sacrifice and fear. It isn't as though the original didn't have this, indeed it did. But this remake allows a modern audience to also feel the these emotions and understand these values and messages in a dynamic 21st century film. One might question that everything represented in this is also represented in the original. The two films do have a lot in common in the area of messages and values. But Fuqua's take allows a more individual sense of sacrifice. He explores deeper what Sturges only briefly touches on in the original. And whilst the original ""Seven"" is a much more superior and original film, the remake allows the audience of this generation to be entertained and taught, thus justifying the existence of the film.In a Hollywood where the Western died decades ago, ""The Magnificent Seven"" holds up and outshines any action flick that Hollywood can produce. Whilst still using the original ""Seven Samurai"" story as a backbone, it adds a new formula, and proves that one plot idea can entertain any generation. Fuqua's new spin stylized western is defiantly worth your magnificent money and time.",The Magnificent Seven
215,bbv-69237,Not magnificent - but OK,6,8 October 2016,"Unfortunately, in most movies these days movie Directors are too much focused on action scenes and humour, and not enough about character and plot - great movies have it balanced. The original US movie was far superior with characters and plot - it was not just an 'action film'. The Japanese original was an action film, with little else in between the sword fights. This version is more like the original Japanese action film, updated with modern effects and politically correct additions (particularly a strong female role). IMO this takes away the 'soul' of the old movie - men facing certain death, but not for money, and not really for a good cause, but for personal redemption.I guess because I saw the first one (USA) when it first came out and it was such a classic, that I am so disappointed. Movie makers should never remake a classic unless they truly understand and can repeat what made the original a classic. But making money these days is unfortunately the number one reason, and movie makers are under pressure to 'deliver' audience related 'touch points', like action sequences and laughter etc. Having said that, it is not a dud and worth seeing (on DVD/Stream with popcorn) - particularly if you were not around to see the original version when it first came out. I hope they never try to remake 'Gone with the Wind'.",The Magnificent Seven

217,Teyss,"Western caricature, a far cry from the original",2,28 September 2016,"The movie is a remake of John Sturges' The Magnificent Seven (1960), itself a Western adaptation of Kurosawa's masterpiece, Shichinin no samurai (1954). Despite a few flaws, the 1960 version was balanced and entertaining: cast, dialogues and music, notably, have now become legend. In comparison the latest version delivers almost nothing. If anything, it proves that quality is not about plot (which is roughly similar for the two Westerns), but about style.The three films have the same structure in three parts. On each of these, the movie fails.1. CONTEXT AND RECRUITMENT OF THE SEVEN MERCENARIESThe context is over the top. The villains are horrendous, overstaffed for such a small village and ready to kill at any rate. By the way, Bogue, if you can murder ""half a dozen"" villagers for no reason, why do you even bother offering them to buy their land? Just start shooting to make them go away.The recruitment is so incredible it becomes funny: reasons for joining the band remain completely obscure, if not absurd. Sure, I'll join this suicide mission just because you have my horse (Faraday). Of course I'll join because it will get just one single bounty hunter off my back, out of the dozens chasing me (Vasquez). No, I won't join you, I am going away... well, after all why not, even though I don't know why I changed my mind (Horne). Hey, let's share deer liver for breakfast and I'll go along with you (Red Harvest).2. VILLAGE LIFE AND TRAINING OF THE VILLAGERSVillage life, where? Villagers, who? We barely see any of this, we don't know how they live, what they think, how they feel. They are reduced to a simple background for the action. The character we understand most is Emma Cullen, which says something. In the previous movies, the villagers debated about options, asked advice to the wise elder, hid the women, betrayed the mercenaries. We saw them discussing, working, celebrating, building defences, training.Here we only see a few minutes of the villagers' training. At first it is a disaster, but afterwards... but afterwards nothing, we don't see how they progress, technically and psychologically, to be able to confront the villains.3. SHOWDOWNS WITH THE VILLAINS AND CONCLUSIONIn the previous movies, there was a build-up of the action, with limited confrontations that eventually lead to the final climatic showdown. Here there is a first fight as the mercenaries enter the village, and then we wait, and wait... until the final showdown that lasts forever. Loads of explosions, of shooting, of deaths, more deaths. It is impossible to keep track of the body count, however it seems much more than the original villain bunch. In terms of strategy, Bogue, since you have such a terrific machine gun, why do you use it AFTER most of your men have been massacred, not BEFORE? We will never know. Also, why do you even bother coming to this fight, endangering your life? Surely not because Chisolm would have called you a coward, since you don't remember who he is anyhow.The movie ends in utter ridicule, with Chisolm trying to make Bogue pray with him. And when the three remaining mercenaries leave, letting the villagers sort out the mess, the latter repeat ""thank you"" as a mantra, even though most of their men died and their village is completely ravaged. Was that better than moving away? On a moral and symbolic ground it could have been, but then it would have required the movie to have moral and symbolic insight, instead of just inflated action.CONCLUSIONThis is where it doubly fails.First, it is a standard no-brainer action movie, while the two previous films (especially ""Seven Samourai"") were talking about values, honour, courage, purpose and dangers of fighting, characters, friendship, solidarity. Their ending was meaningful: villagers (life) win, mercenaries (death) lose. Dialogues were to the point; here, they are reduced and plain: just compare for instance the Quotes section of the three films on IMDb. There is only one scene when the main characters could have a real conversation: the dinner in the saloon. At that point we hope the movie will lift off the ground where it is stuck... unfortunately, dialogues remain dull. Earlier, it makes two weak attempts to add substance, to no avail: Bogue's opening speech on capitalism and the ethnic diversity of the mercenaries.Second, it does not even succeed in being an efficient action movie: it is full of stereotypes, lengths, overblown scenes and inconsistencies. To some extent it tries to imitate Sergio Leone's style (or Clint Eastwood's inspired by Leone): outfits, close shots, macabre tone, incongruities. However it is a far cry from this Western master because it lacks essential elements: pacing, measure, second-degree humour and class. A typical example of superficial form without purpose. I am not a huge fan of Tarantino (another possible reference), but at least he would have provided rhythm and coolness to the same story.The only quality that emerges is the solid acting. A special mention to Denzel Washington as usual, to Ethan Hawke as a past legend now drowning in despair and fear, to Haley Bennett as a sensitive yet strong woman. Actually everybody is performing so well that it makes the movie enjoyable at times.If you haven't seen Sturges' and Kurosawa's films, you are lucky, you will appreciate them considerably after that one.",The Magnificent Seven

Oh, but the original is a violent cowboy movie remake of the Seven Samurai, so we need some depth, right? We need lots of ethnic diversity though, cause that makes so much sense, right? Were there really any black bounty hunters with mad skills in the Old West? No, not at all, so this feels like Blazing Saddles (which is a parody re-make of The Magnificent Seven, btw) with violence. Some actors are really trying to be serious. Some are just goofing around (Pratt). Let's insert a Katniss look-alike character for the girls. The previews hinted of an awesome soundtrack. Where is House in New Orleans? Nowhere, the soundtrack is flat and awful. Just when we think this is a comedy drama, they burn down a church (!). Then we have genuinely terrified young children screaming for their daddy in a basement... that one kid looks like he will be scarred for life and it was very unpleasant to watch. We have a 'good Indian vs bad Indian' epic fight scene set up... and the bad Indian dies in ten seconds. We have the now annoying 'Gatling God Gun' show up, at the end, like did they forget they had it???

The western genre is no stranger to these types of ensemble films and the original Magnificent Seven is one of the biggest and best examples of the genre. This version of the Akira Kurosawa inspired film mixes action, drama and no small amount of comedy together to make a very enjoyable film. Denzel Washington brings the intensity and Chris Pratt comes loaded up with charm and wit. The supporting cast including Ethan Hawke, Haley Bennett and Vincent D'Onofiro, who's character is a standout, really do well in rounding out the cast. The movie does a good job of keeping all the action clear yet intense making the viewer feel as if they are standing in the middle of the fights. The movie does have a little bit of a struggle with tone in that there are an equal amount of funny moments to dramatic ones to where by the end of the movie I was having a little trouble finding emotional resonance. However, that may also be due to the fact that there are an awful lot of characters here and getting a feel for all of them while maintaining the tone is a tough trick. That aside, I think the movie was pretty enjoyable on the whole and would definitely recommend it especially to the western fan. The Magnificent Seven gets a 3.5...out of 5.",The Magnificent Seven

Also it didn't seem like the writers spent too much time on the storyline.To be fair there are some bits of good acting along the way, but mostly we get a shoot em up movie with a few good names on the cast to attract viewers.So it's not really a bad movie if you like mindless shootouts and high body counts, it's just one of those movies you pretty much forget once you've seen it.",The Magnificent Seven

Only three of the seven were at the level of all the seven.The evil 'industrialist' was barely evil enough. Every part of this movie is scaled way up.

Now other than that though...it was a pretty good movie. Chris Pratt provided some good comedic relief. I felt like Denzel was a little under-utilized considering his great acting skills.

It gets 3 points for just BEING a Western, 1 more for great photography, 1 for sets and costumes, 1 for the guns & gun play, and 1 more for cast/acting (and that's a stretch). Deductions – 1 for just BEING a remake of a remake, 1 deduction for plot/screenplay preposterous enough to make the original actually look plausible, and 1 deduction for using precisely the same trading post/cabin set used in another remake, ""True Grit (2010)"" . . . aw c'mon, that was distracting for any Western aficionado, e.g., I kept waiting for Rooster Cogburn to kick the Indian kids off the porch! :-)This movie reminded me of the 1950s serial Westerns, then modernized to the absolute extreme of ludicrous, over-the-top, CGI'd, special effected, shoot-em-up, you can only die three times movies. Gimme a break. Real Western movies take nearly insignificant moments and turn them into legend, Will Munny did it when he walked into that Wyoming bar on a dreary rainy night, Augustus McCray did it when he decided to chase some buffalo. But this movie ends with a shooting war so immense it would be in every history book if factual, so full of shooting deaths that the real Johnson County Range War (1892) depicted in ""Heaven's Gate"" (1980) looks like a mere street scuffle. Gimme a break.Denzel Washington is a fine actor and he brings his A-game (as he always does) to his first Western, but despite a Doc Holliday-like performance by the always brooding Ethan Hawke the remaining marvelous 5 bring little to the ubiquitous poker table, not even the take-any-goofy-role Vincent D'Onofrio. The rest of the cast, including the one obligatory female, are totally and completely forgettable, most particularly the little, trumped up weasel of a bad guy, Peter Sarsgaard . . . his character – seemingly commanding an army of 100s – would not scare anything larger than a Pomeranian.

225,tyingling7766,The Magnificent Seven Review,9,22 January 2017,"Oh man, The Magnificent Seven. How good was this movie? I am going to try to do it justice in this review. I don't think I can though.First off, just let me say that I haven't seen the original remake since I was about ten, and I haven't seen the original since I was about twelve. So, this movie was more or less a freshness for me. That may have helped in me giving this movie an honest rating as I was not judging it off the ones from over fifty years ago. Having said that, let me just get what I didn't like out of the way.It's not really anything with the movie really, but it has to do with the casting choices. Well, one in particular. Don't get me wrong, I think that Vincent D'Onofrio is a great actor, but I didn't like him the role of Jack Horn. I don't know what it was, but there was just something I couldn't stand about him in the movie. It could have been the way he was talking, I don't know. There was just something.Having said that, everyone else was perfect. Fuqua made the right choice working with Hawke and Washington again. Apparently, Fuqua was more than a little hesitant on casting Pratt until Pratt started singing and then Fuqua knew who Pratt should play. And for once, in a western movie, the nationalities of the characters were played by the right nationalities.The story is something that everyone should know. A town is in danger and they hire one guy to help who turns around and hires six more. Then they go up against an army of villains, lead smartly by Peter Sarsgaard. Seriously, I don't know what else to tell you about the story. If you don't know it from the originals, then chances are you don't want to watch this movie. But you should.One thing I am going to talk about here that I hardly talk about is the music. This was the last movie James Horner did music for before his untimely death. As usual with him, he is probably going to get an Oscar for what he has done. Sadly, this will be the last film that has his music. He even added elements from the score of the 1960 movie. The man was a genesis when it came to writing music for the movies.Now, if you don't see why you should watch this movie, I don't know what else to tell you.

Yeah, I had some high hopes he would be great.He was better than great.The whole cast was great, actually.On a side note, how many others wandered into the theater with the same mindset? That Chris Pratt would kick butt as an actor and a character, and the others would still be impressive but not the center of attention?Anyways, the whole film is shot very well, and the characters add a lot more, well, character to your typical wild west movie.

It means nothing to me, they could have burned and finished the movie in an outhouse as far as I'm concerned. The thing that got me laugh though was the all powerful ""gatling"" which obviously could destroy a whole village. I mean come on, if the bad guys had brought a couple of cannons......... With a ""gatling"" from that time and from that distance,,,,,,, keep your head down and you'll be fine. It's not a WMD.

229,draciron,Interesting take on a classic.,6,15 October 2017,"This version does a good job with the action and develops some of the characters pretty well. There are a few interesting twists, but some of them detract rather than add to the movie. Several of the best elements that made the original Magnificent Seven stand out were left out of this movie. I think Yul Brenner's character & acting worked better than Denzelle Washington's. Pratt & McQueen's characters a dead draw, both added a great deal to the movie. Lee is an interesting replacement for Coburn. Both brought some character to the movies. Lee however got far less screen time. Hawke is a major upgrade in both character & acting over Vaughn's role. This is one of the few places the newer version really outshines the original. Dropping the Chico character (Bucholz) I feel took some of the charm out of the movie and killed the core message of the movie. Instead of redemption the movie becomes simple revenge. Losing Bronson's character (O'Reilly) also degraded the plot of the original as well as the flow of the movie. Sensemeir's character was interesting but couldn't make up for the loss of the other two. Horne's (D'Ofornoro) character was also interesting, and provided my favorite line of the movie (the bear comment), but didn't really replace the connection people made with the two lost characters. Grime's Teddy Q character was a positive addition, though it couldn't really make up for the losses. Bennet's character was an interesting addition and underlined the change from redemption to revenge. She played the role well, though the script was a mixed bag with her character. The action was better done in the remake, the villain however less believable even though he was well played. The script just made him a 50s type bad guy, very 2 dimensional. The plot also fails in realism. Too much of an attempt to rehash already overworked anti-corporate themes. Made parts of the movie into a tired cliché. The villain in the original was believable and you could empathize with him some. Wallach did a good job with the role. This is a movie worth watching but it really fails to add to a classic and probably should not have been named the Magnificent Seven as it does not hold up to the greatness of the original. Given a different name I'd probably upped the movie a star despite it's obvious theft of ideas from the Magnificent Seven. It cannot really be called the same movie as it only shares a few ideas with the original plot. Seven warriors protect a town, beyond that there is little in common with the original. It is closer to the movie that inspired the Magnificent Seven (Seven Samarai) but again missed the core ideas of that movie as well. This becomes cheapened by the base motivations of the movie. A soulless imitation that never understood what made those two movies great much less continued the classic tale that enthralled audiences over the years.",The Magnificent Seven

231,horizonbts-206-628336,Missed Opportunity,6,28 September 2016,"First of all I can tell you that I was excited when last year I learned of the remake and the cast to be involved. Yes I have watched the original and own it on DVD as yes I am a fan of the genre. For me the original and this version there are a ton of differences, still I will put a positive spin on it as I didn't dislike the movie, but just thought there was a chance given the cast and the budget that this movie could have been great!! I understand that there is a time limit, but felt like the characters weren't given their just dues in development. I felt like the first part of the movie was boring and somewhat lackluster when it was introducing us to each member of the Magnificent Seven. The story was set-up in the beginning as to why the seven were needed, but again didn't really give us much to go on. Peter Sarsgaard as the villain Bartholomew Bogue was well cast and one we hated, but again he could have been developed even more into one of the best villains of all time-another lost opportunity for me. So many times in the movie it lost out to the original. Still with all that said, when the fight and the action does come, it is Magnificent and entertaining in the sense that the original couldn't match due to the technology of today! I thought the tricks and surprises to cut down the enemies was brilliant, the teaching of the townspeople how to fight was humorous too. In the end the story gave a little more light to the characters, but still think it could have given us so much more! All in all for those of you that haven't seen the original you will enjoy the action of this one, and Denzel Washington lives up to the billing, and does seem to enjoy his character. Bottom line for a few bucks its worth the ride.",The Magnificent Seven
232,kangarooconnor,Atrocious.,2,12 June 2020,"First off, I get saying that ""well it's not the original so it sucks"" is an annoying trope, but it's true. The original, Akira Kurisowa's ""Seven Samurai,"" which is an amazing masterpiece of a movie. Was turned into a great modernized western, called the Magnificent Seven. However, this new reboot, was awful. Truly awful.
(I will compare this to Seven Samurai, for accuracy to the original.)
They removed the element of ""heroism"" by having payment. Seven samurai had hero's that were doing the job because they were selfless and honorable. The characters in this were just doing it for money and revenge and or they had nothing better to do.
The amazing depth of the scary villain is removed altogether, with some caricature bad guy businessman. The villains in seven samurai were just products of the world. They weren't humanized because they didn't need to be, they were a force of nature not a complex suffering bad guy. The new one, although explored a little bit more, is just bad. He feels to cartoonishly mean and villainy.
The main seven were barely explored, even the ones that were, were boring. In the original, each samurai had a reason to do what they were doing. In this, half of them just kinda come for giggles.
And to be honest, I wasn't against the race changes. I thought that the change in race actually could have benefited the characters due to it being set in the U.S. post civil war. However, they weren't explored enough and instead it just came off as PC pandering.
Worst of all is the main character. Denzel Washington is playing a poor man's Django. Rough riding the west, killing evil white men and giving justice where need be. Too bad his character is greedy and vengeful. The original character (Kambei) was removed from the equation. He had no personal stake in the village, nor the bad guy. He was simply a selfless man, doing it because it was right. Denzel's character was in it for two reasons, money and revenge. This makes the idea of selfless heroism, the core concept, seem thrown out and wasted. Had they not done this and instead followed original suit, the character would have been seen a magnificent and just. Instead he's just angry.The movie was an awful, PC, hollow, cash grabbing, remake from a hollow company. Don't watch, go and Watch ""Seven Samurai"" or ""The Magnificent Seven (1960).""",The Magnificent Seven
233,Tarx309,A Western remake with lots to like,8,25 September 2016,"The Magnificent Seven is directed by Antoine Fugua and stars Denzel Washington, Chris Pratt, Ethan Hawk and many others. It is a movie that I had a lot of anticipation for going in, and I am happy to say that I was not disappointed. When making a remake, many directors struggle to find the right line between staying true to the original, while still trying to be it's own thing. This is something director Antoine Fugua excels at - his movie is neither too similar to the original nor too different. Fugua honours the 1960 original movie by adapting the same basic storyline, but along the way he adds some refreshingly new aspects to the story, which distinguish it from the original, and make it memorable in its own right. He changes the characterisation of many of the characters (in particular Vincent D'Onofrio's character, who I guarantee is like nothing you have ever seen before), edits the plot slightly (this time the Seven are hired by a woman seeking revenge for the death of her husband), and also mixes up the ethnicities of the characters (the original was simply seven Americans saving feeble Mexicans from other Americans, whereas this time we have a much more diverse Seven, along with the feeble Mexican aspect being scrapped). Yet at the same time this movie greatly feels like the original, whether that is because it is setup in the same period, with the same story, or perhaps it is because of the little aspects and references, like how they play the original soundtrack during the credits. But whatever it is, it works.In terms of characters and pace, this movie works very well. The issue I had with the original was that I found the pace to be too slow. This movie fixes that problem well. The pace is somewhat quicker while still not being too quick, and the movie never really gets boring. Even though the bulk of the action is focused in the final act, there is still enough to entertain the viewer throughout the movie. The run time is 2 hours and 12 minutes, which the movie makes use of very well. There is good character development that goes on throughout, from the very start right to the very end, although it has to be said that it would have been nice to know more of the back stories of some of the characters (in particular Ethan Hawke's, whose back story is hinted at but the movie simply leaves it there), as by the end we've only gotten a clear idea of the past of Denzel Washington's character. Still, the characters are likable and each different in their own way. The cast is not just diverse by its ethnicity, but also by the tone and characterisation of each character. The standouts in my eyes were Chris Pratt (who is playing the exact type of Chriss Pratt-y character you would expect him to play) and Ethan Hawke, who gave what was probably the best performance of the whole bunch, and at the same time offered an intriguing character that stuck out in a good way.However the best part of the movie is the final act. The action is brilliant (if pretty violent for a 12+/PG-13 movie), and there are also some surprisingly poignant and effective scenes in the last act that fit very well into the story. The villain, even if he does not appear much, is also quite memorable - he fits the story well and is an ample villain to be pitched against the Seven. His final scene is especially memorable, and is the cherry-on-top to a great ending, for a great movie.",The Magnificent Seven
234,svorva,Why Make a Remake?,6,14 October 2016,"Why make a remake? 56 years ago, director John Sturges, writer William Roberts, and a collection of other producers answered a similar question. Henceforth, their response will be remembered as the Original Magnificent Seven. ""Original"" is a bit of misnomer. See, 62 years ago Kurosawa gave us a little film Seven Samurai. This 3 ½ hour epic told the tale of seven aimless samurai, unified to protect peasants for room and board. The modern action sequence and the ""assemble the team"" plot were born from this film. Seven Samurai is 100% classic, instantly recognized as a landmark film. So were the creators of Magnificent Seven irreverently audacious? I don't believe so. They understood if you cannot do it better do it different. Magnificent Seven literally and figuratively took the samurai out of the Seven Samurai. It is an adaptation. The swap is seamless. Modernity threatening an antiquated way of life still works as motivation for gunfighters. Crucially, like in Samurai, everyone one of the seven is a legend. Thus the casting: Charles Bronson, Yul Brynner, Horst Bucholz, James Coburn, Brad Dexter, Steve McQueen, Robert Vaughn, and villain Eli Wallach. If you cannot recognize six of those names immediately, you simply have no relationship with that era. These actors with a new set of western tropes made the movie worth making. Even the director was disciplined. Magnificent Seven runs an hour and a half less than Samurai. Sturges recognized that a carbon copy would not necessary garner the original's eminence.Cut to present day. Year 2016, the western genre has been dead for decades, the boys that grew up with them are old men. Why make a remake? Unfortunately, Magnificent 7 does not offer an adequate answer.Magnificent 7 is less a reimagining, more an update. There are a host of creative decisions that seem just a consequence of the times. Bartholomew Bouge, a robber baron, is turning the valley into a mine. He is played without restrain as an embodiment of unchecked greed. As a warning, he orders his enforcers to slay some townsfolk, including Emma Cullen's husband. Avenging angel Cullen (Bennett) becomes the representative of the townsfolks sent to gather the seven. Chisolm (Washington) works as tactical and imposing leader, but other characters suffer. Faraday (Pratt) is the second. He is the most developed of the remaining seven, but Faraday is depicted like modern day hero. Pratt has played this character before, a trickster, fast talking, and unsuccessful ladies' man. He is amusing, but his modern parlance and actions just feel out of place in a western. Ethan Hawke as Goodnight does establish a legacy and vulnerabilities. Further exploration just tires out. I felt the film teased he might drop from the seven. This would leave a spot for Cullen to play the novice role. This potential twist never materializes, a fantasy born out of optimism. Rather, the conflict resolves in the most mundane way. Jack Horne (Vincent D'Onofrio) is the only character who left me yearning for more. The soft spoken mountain man is reverent, but a legend for slaying 100s. A character hearkening back to films like Jeramiah Johnson. Horne's loneliness is the only understandable motivation other than Chisolm's. The remaining trio is. depressing.So the modernized villain makes sense. There was no way in the 21st century we were going to watch a group of white dudes slaughtering Mexicans. Diversity among the Seven? Well the gender variation did not pan out, but great! This might give us new characters, new stories. Regrettably, we get a trio that have no substance beyond stereotypes. James Coburn threw knives, which was pretty cool. Hey! I know who else throws knives, Asian people. Bam! One down, six to go. Insane (or should I say loco) criminal, Mexican. Full war paint and eating raw deer hearts, I remember John Wayne shooting up such persons. What could be more 21st century than the token minority?The neophyte that unifies the Seven is left out of this iteration. Yes, plot changes can be a positive evolution, but this is not a fair exchange. Gone is the drama, the reason for anything. Instead we get a battle, big and beautiful. Seven heroes against hundreds of nameless. A classic climax, but if you don't internalize the heroes it's just the implausibly lucky slaughtering the remarkably unfortunate. Every death among the previous 14 hurt. Magnificent 7 has glorious vistas and carnage. Worth the price of a ticket as a shoot'em up, but unworthy of the name.",The Magnificent Seven
235,petemcphee2,Shouldn't have bothered...,5,7 December 2020,"The original had a great ensemble cast, great action, outstanding musical score and delivered.
This remake was much anticipated yet failed to deliver.
The direction is piss poor. Its got absolutely no feel of the West and everything feels like a cheap sound stage.
John Huston this is not.
Then there is the lack of characterisation.
I just wasn't invested in anyone.
Yul Brynners Chris had a real feel to him, his motley crew were diverse bunch of mercenaries, criminals, fear driven gunslinger, bad, good, greedy, young and hot headed.
This lot by comparison were 2 dimensional.
I honestly felt cheated by the fact they chose one fight scene.
In the original the group are betrayed after winning the first battle.
The entire theme is the fact the 7 became magnificent by returning to do battle, when the townsfolk had bottled it.
They chose to fight the lost cause.
Something that is a recurring theme in many a great Western.
This is not a great Western.
It feels cheap, badly directed and badly edited.
Very dissapointing.",The Magnificent Seven
236,FinneganBear,Entertaining but....,7,31 January 2019,"The 1960 ""Magnificent Seven"" with Yul Brynner, Steve McQueen, Charles Bronson, James Coburn, Robert Vaughn, Horst Buchholz and Brad Dexter is a magnificent movie. Maybe the best western of all time and fairly true to ""The Seven Samurai"" on which it is based. The 2016 version starring Denzel Washington, Chris Pratt and Ethan Hawke is entertaining enough that if it wasn't a remake of a far superior movie, would stand on its own as a fun film. This version is sort of a fun, fantasy western that never makes the viewer feel he could be watching something that could actually have happened. It takes pains to be politically correct so the 7 are a mix of black, white, Hispanic, Asian and Indian while the bad guys, instead of being the Mexican bandits of the 1960 film, are of course, white villains. The 1960 version with 7 gunfighters being hired to protect a Mexican village from perpetually plundering bandits seemed a far more likely scenario.But the 2016 version is not without merit. Far from it. It's fun. Denzel Washington is riveting as always. His character is loosely based on Yul Brynner's leader of the original (not counting the Samurai) 7. Chris Pratt, in one of his first starring roles, is magnetic. He deftly handles the role played by Steve McQueen in 1960. Subtleties reveal Pratt's character's name is Josh, which was the name of McQueen's character in a 1950s TV series ""Wanted Dead or Alive."" And in one scene, Pratt uses a sawed off Winchester, the trademark weapon of McQueen's ""Josh"" in ""Wanted Dead or Alive."" Hawke, who I always find a very gifted actor who unfortunately went to the Matthew Modine School of Absolutely No Charisma, is very good and finally charismatic in a combination of the 1960 roles of Vaughn and Dexter. Byung-Hun Lee has the Coburn role as the killer-of-all-trades. There is no correlation of the roles originally played by Bronson or Bucholz. But Vincent D'Onofrio, who is always amazing, plays a grizzled tracker who joins the group, Manuel Garcia-Rulfo is outstanding as a Hispanic gunfighter enlisted in the cause and finally Martin Sensmeier portrays an Indian suspiciously recruited apparently to fulfill this United Nations version of the Seven. In the original, Eli Wallach was convincing as the bandit leader. Sadly, Peter Sarsgaard, usually a very convincing actor, seems to be somewhere else in all of his scenes as the current villain leader, so his demise is far less rewarding than that of Wallach in the original.In all, any comparison between the 2016 and 1960 versions will greatly disappoint those hoping for a quality remake. Several lines of dialogue are lifted directly from the original, which is a way of paying homage. But otherwise, this is a different movie with a similar idea. But as long as you accept this version as a somewhat light-hearted and fun movie on its own instead of comparing it to the superior original, it can be quite entertaining.",The Magnificent Seven
237,cochrandarin,Ignore the whiners!!...this movie is great!,9,19 February 2020,"My Lord in Heaven at the comparisons! The original was ok, it was not the greatest movie ever. This movie is not the greatest movie ever, but gees...SO WHAT!!
It was a good movie and a good western. The action was great. The acting wasn't bad. It's a little over the top in some places. Everyone keeps referencing the Gatlin-Gun scene, but what the heck was you expecting in an action movie? If movie producers tried to make every action movie completely realistic, we'd have NO action movies worth a flip at all!
And then there's the whining about the political correct stuff...huh? I guess it's completely out of the realm of possibility that a black guy can be the lead man in a western? Does it somehow defy the laws of Physics that an oriental guy can be in a western movie and kill a bad guy with a knife instead of a gun?
Gees, people...get over yourselves and leave your little pacifier-sucking feelings out in the yard and watch the dang movie!
So, in short, ignore all the whining.....watch this movie. It's a good movie. It will not be the greatest movie of all time, but how many movies are? The cast is great and do a good job, especially Pratt and Washington. Haley Bennett is a great actress and is more than just good-looking eye candy in this movie. She plays a pretty good tortured soul, who just wants to save her town as well as avenge her husband who is shot down in cold blood.
The action and shooting and explosions are frequent and non-stop for the last hour, but again, it's an action movie and western, so that is ok.

The remake of The Magnificent Seven is not a bad film but it is not very good and follows every cliché imaginable, to the point where you know exactly what is going to happen before it happens.The score is very average, with the main theme only coming in at the end titles. The cinematography isn't great and the amount of tracking shots with horseman becomes a joke. The acting is OK but nobody really stands out.

239,chriskylie,Attempted Western revival delivers action over substance,6,16 August 2020,"A valiant attempt at reviving the Western, that is well produced easy to watch cinema. The pace rattled along and the required gunslinging action was suitably tense, exciting and at times shocking (the film's opening sequence unequivocally setting a credible not comic tone). For me what Magnificent 7 lacked was much to make it magnificent. Character backstory was light with fairly thin context to motivate our heroes and drive the plot. I suspect this is simply a symptom of the genre, but in 2017 the average filmgoer expects a bit more than enigmatic saviours who both metaphorically and literally ride off into the sunset. Fuqua does balance some of the script's inadequacies with a superb cast with Washington and Pratt in particular naturally deepening their roles with their trademark gravitas and charisma. Enjoyable but I won't be jumping back in the saddle for another Western anytime soon.",The Magnificent Seven
240,julesfdelorme,Why?,2,12 March 2017,"I've lived in L.A.. Never for very long. Almost always longer than I would have liked. Somewhere along the line someone there got the bright idea to import palm trees, I guess so that it would seem more tropical. That's the mentality in Hollywood. When in doubt imitate. When really in doubt remake. Apparently in the last few decades Hollywood has really been in doubt. Maybe it's because television is getting better and better and shows like Game of Thrones and The Walking Dead have as good, often better production value and much better writing. Or maybe it's because the movie theatres have just made it too expensive to go to the movies nowadays. Whatever the reason, it seems Hollywood is as addicted to remakes as Warren Beatty is to looking at cue cards. There's a story that Sean Penn, when asked to sign on for a remake of Casablanca, said ""I don't think they got it wrong the first time."". As obnoxious as he can sometimes be, the rest of Hollywood could learn a lesson from Penn. Why anyone would think it was a good idea to do a remake of The Magnificent Seven is beyond me. Why I'd ever bother watching it is even more beyond me. I'm a big fan of Denzel Washington and the wonderful character actors Vincent D'Onofrio and Peter Sarsgaard. Chris Pratt is charming and funny. Usually. But we're talking about replacing Yul Brynner, Steve McQueen, Charles Bronson, Robert Ulrich and Eli Wallach, who never met a role he couldn't make unforgettable. Yes, you could argue that the original was a remake of the Akira Kurosawa film The Seven Samurai, but Kurosawa said himself that he was making a samurai western with that film, and the original Magnificent Seven was just, well, cool. The remake is far too muddled and tries too hard to be important and deep. The beauty of the western at its very best is that you can strip away all the complexity of modern life and have a kind of tabula rasa on which to paint your canvas. Less is always more when it comes to westerns. That's not to say that Westerns can't have undertones of complexity. Movies like The Searchers, Shane or Unforgiven have shown us that. But the great western film makers understand that complexity should be a spice that is never overused or overpowering. I know, I'm mixing metaphors all over the place. But my point is that this movie, like so many modern Hollywood movies is heavy handed and clumsy and so quickly becomes boring and at times just silly. Where the original never leaves you wondering why any of these men would choose to put their lives on the line for a village they've never even been to, this remake actually gives Denzel Washington's character a reason, revenge against the villain. Which just makes him an asshole for putting all those lives on the line just so he can get this guy back. They even stick him with the name Chisum, and another character with the name, Goodnight, two very famous Texas cattlemen with trails named after them, because somebody needs to show us how cute and clever they are. And that's the story of this remake. That's the story of virtually all modern Hollywood remakes. Somebody is always trying to impose themselves on the remake, and on us, and only insecure assholes need to impose how clever they are on the world. I should know. I'm the most insecure asshole there is. Just ask my friends. Don't bother watching this remake. It's too long and it's just stupid. Watch the original. Even if you've already seen it watch it again, because it has Steve McQueen in it. What more reason do you need. Watch The Seven Samurai too. It, like most Kurosawa films, is superb. Lets just hope Hollywood doesn't get any ideas about remaking that...",The Magnificent Seven

By 2019, curiosity got the better of me and I watched the new version - and I was right: it is nowhere near as good. What I discovered is that the 2016 movie is not a remake but a re-imagining. The characters are different - different names, different backgrounds, different outcomes - and the differences are not to my liking.
The emphasis is on over-the-top action at the expense of character development, which was one of the highlights of the 1960 movie. Then, at the height of the action, with bodies spilling all over the place, two characters will have a 3-minute conversation in complete calm while the carnage goes on around them.
To be fair, I may have given this movie a higher rating had I not been such a fan of the 1960 movie. My rating reflects my inevitable comparison with the 1960 movie - and in this regard the 2016 movie is found sadly wanting.
The most puzzling question is: With 2 highly successful predecessors - The Seven Samurai (1954) and The Magnificent Seven (1960) - why did they bother making such an inferior product?",The Magnificent Seven
245,kevin_newdirections,A reminder to Donald Trump that America was once founded upon immigrant spirit,8,2 October 2016,"A cowboy pub falling silent upon the entrance of a stranger, dueling gunslingers amid the tune of plucked banjo strings, and horses galloping across desolate deserts and mountains – there is a certain sense of gratification brought by Western films. One of the few Westerns this year is Antoine Fuqua's The Magnificent Seven, a remake of John Sturges' film of the same name, which in turn is a remake of Akira Kurosawa's Seven Samurai. The plot and formula is as vintage as it gets: it hearkens back to the dark history of western colonialism where pillaging, stealing and killing is at its peak. Corrupt industrialist Bartholomew Bogue (Peter Sarsgaard) along with his immigrant crew lays siege to the mining town of Rose Creek, and slaughters any local who attempt to stand up against him. ""I seek righteousness but I'll take revenge,"" a vindictive Emma Cullen (Haley Bennett) asks for the help of warrant officer Sam Chisolm (Denzel Washington) and together, they assemble a ragtag band of outlaws and transform their folks of farmers into fighters. Seven should not receive any complaints from the ""racial diversity council"" (if there's such a thing) as minorities here are well-represented reminding Donald Trump that America was once founded upon immigrant spirit. Chisolm as the Seven's leader is a man of color and the rest is a rainbow coalition: pyromaniac/""world's greatest lover"" Josh Faraday (Chris Pratt), sharpshooter cleverly named as Goodnight Robicheaux (Ethan Hawke), grisly tracker Jack Horne (Vincent D'Onofrio), knife-wielding Korean Billy Rocks (Byung-hun Lee), Mexican outlaw Vasquez (Manuel Garcia-Rulfo), and a Comanche warrior who calls himself Red Harvest (Martin Sensmeier). In favor of the big action sequences, the film does a grocery-shopping style of recruitment that character motivations are not properly fleshed out. Most characters get the shorter end of the stick when it comes to development that they remained to be an archetype all throughout: The Guy Who's Good at Knives, The Guy Who's Good at Bow and Arrow, The Mexican Guy, The Bear Who Wears Human Clothes, and so on. The film never really went deep on the psyche of these men – why did they decide to risk their lives over some random town, along with others which they may or may not get along with? The sense of brotherhood does not sell much as well in the rare scenes where they get to talk as a team. Hence, when the film needs to create a sense of loss in the end, there's little impression left.Much of the character development went to Pratt's character and the actor who employs card tricks at one point, has a contemporary brand of humor to belong in the Western genre. This is basically Star Lord wearing a vest and a revolver. Still, he remains to be the most likable character in the film (though not as close as his role in The Guardians of the Galaxy). In his third collaboration with Fuqua after Training Day and The Equalizer, Washington donning an all-black suit and a bolero hat while sitting on his midnight steed has a commanding screen presence more fitting for this genre. His performance occasionally veers to dull nobility but when his twist is revealed, the character is given a new depth.Fuqua does not need the trick of quick cuts and shaky cams (see every Jason Bourne movie made), to showcase firepower in broad daylight. Farraday remarks at one point, ""I've always wanted to blow something up."" This is perhaps Fuqua's directive vision in Seven – it is lock-and-loaded with impressive artillery to ratchet up on the exhibitionist and unceremonious kills done in an uncanny precision. This should make Rambo curl up in a corner. When it comes to its explosive finale, the irony befalls – the noble seven fights for the town's ownership but with all the bombing, stabbing, bow-and-arrow- ing and bullet-spraying done, half of it is reduced to flaming wood chips, there's practically nothing left. This over-extended gunfight can numb the senses and occasionally lose one's geographic bearings, but it is still extremely entertaining.Expect no glorious road to redemption here like in Django Unchained, clichés are also abound, but Fuqua knows how to stage his crowd-pleasing action scenes, The film is highly aware on what it aspires to be – a wild western ride. By the end of the film, a voice-over declares the following sentiment with such grandeur and pride: ""They were magnificent."" Yeah, no. Frankly, this film does not live up to its name but entertaining, fun, or modest would be the more faithful representation to it.",The Magnificent Seven

Chris pratt fell flat for me sometimes, because he was being very star lord-ish, which is great in guardians of the galaxy, but not as great in this movie. all in all the acting was very solid! 8/10Story: there wasn't much to it and thats probably why critics are not loving this movie, but this movie is about having fun and stuff your face with popcorn! it was functional enough. 6/10Fights/stunts/action: some of these action pieces were actually amazing. there is a scene where the magnificent 7 face 23 ""villains"" and that was done soooo goddamn great and the end fight scene was actually worth the buildup! 9/10Cinematography: like I said in the fights-section; fights were shot so incredibly well. You have some creative shots with the sunrise etc.. Beautiful movie to look at! 8/10all in all, very enjoyable movie with an okay story, but great acting and action.

250,sukanya-samy,Average 6 is more like it,6,28 October 2016,"The Magnificent Seven. Its a classic western, similar to the 1960 movie of the same name, which was in turn a cleverly twisted version of Akira Kurosawa's Seven Samurai. The usual good vs. the bad, the team of dare- devils which fights on behalf of the weak against the bully. So was 2 hours and 15 minutes to tell the story worth it? Read on.First reviewed on broth of blogsPlot and ScriptThere is no twist in the plot, nothing too innovative. The seven which includes law officers, bandits, gamblers and tribesmen is a random bunch and how they, at the behest of a strong-willed woman come to save the village. Some strategy and help of the village gets them ready for the attack from the bad guy and good prevails over evil. Sounds familiar?Characterization and Acting (C&A)Denzel Washington as Chisolm does a good job as the strategist, the leader of the pack. But I never understood the hype around him or his acting so he was the usual to me. Obviously it is his movie and maybe Chris Pratt, who is the jester of the group. He is funny and I had a few chuckles seeing him in this one, he has charisma in the face of the impossible. Ethan Hawke I thought could have been developed more, they did show his character arc as that of a failing hero but it wasn't enough. The other four couldn't be developed at all because of which I wasn't rooting for the team, the seven. It was like a bunch of people that you don't care for. They did show why Chisolm wanted to kill Bogue, the bad guy but why did the others join when they knew they might not come out alive?But the biggest failure was of the antagonist – Peter Sarsgaard, who plays Bogue, just didn't seem evil enough. His screen presence was only in the beginning where he lashes out as the bad guy but that didn't make me squirm or wish him dead. He was a portrayed to be a brutal businessman who could kill, but so what? I wish his arc was developed further.Sounds and Effects (S&E)The music was good, James Horner gave a solid background but will it remain with me like Braveheart, Titanic or even Avatar would? I doubt it.Cinematography and Visuals (C&V)I really liked the look of the movie, some of the long shots were stunning. There is something about the years without automobiles that makes one wish for such a period now.Direction and Overall (D &O)Magnificent Seven is Antoine Fuqua's attempt at a western, and I appreciate his passion but the story arc just didn't justify another version of the classic. The acting was good, the direction was too, it looked good but there was just too much happening and nothing wanting me to go back to it again and again.So here are my scores:Plot and Script (P&S)- 1Characterization and Acting (C&A) – 1Sounds and Effects (S&E) – 1Cinematography and Visuals (C&V) – 1.5Direction and Overall (D &O) – 1.5Overall Score – 6 out of 10If you are really looking forward to this movie, my guess is that you will come out disappointed but if you have no expectations whatsoever, go watch it once.First reviewed on broth of blogs on wordpress",The Magnificent Seven

257,jeff-90,completely misses the point,4,24 September 2017,"The original is an all-time classic for good reasons. Not only does it have a cast full of film icons, but it follows a can't miss plot line taken from The Seven Samurai and brings genuine emotion and meaning to the proceedings. The hired gunfighters each have their reasons and there is an underlying sadness to go along with the concepts of pride and honor and heroism and desperation.This remake has zero subtleties, gives the characters no motivation and makes the villain comically evil. There isn't an honest note to be found and it turns into nothing but a vengeance shoot 'em up.It is an insult to film buffs that this movie is even using the same name. Think of all the great human moments in the original. Comforting the dying Harry by telling him that there really was loads of gold. Robert Vaughn's character talking about living in a a corner of a storeroom. Or this exchangeBoy: We're ashamed to live here. Our fathers are cowards. O'Reilly: Don't you ever say that again about your fathers, because they are not cowards. You think I am brave because I carry a gun; well, your fathers are much braver because they carry responsibility, for you, your brothers, your sisters, and your mothers. And this responsibility is like a big rock that weighs a ton. It bends and it twists them until finally it buries them under the ground. And there's nobody says they have to do this. They do it because they love you, and because they want to. I have never had this kind of courage. Running a farm, working like a mule every day with no guarantee anything will ever come of it. This is bravery. That's why I never even started anything like that... that's why I never will.

The writing was as lousy as the directing in my opinion. The dialogue looked amateur compared to what was delivered in something like ""Tombstone"". Poor Vincent D'Onofrio was using some ridiculous voice that he could hardly deliver the lines in, and *spoiler alert* his death was over dramatic and CHEESY!!! Good guys and bad guys dropping like flies from bullets, but Chris Pratt rides in o ten(?) men firing at him, sustains at least six bullets before falling... he has just enough strength to muster trying to light a smoke, and light some dynamite with a casual trouble free grin -- CHEESY! And then to top it all off, let's add in a few native Americans in nice clean clothes that look straight off the shelf from the local trading post - navy blue felt was it? What, did they run out of money on wardrobe? The lines, the Indian war cries, and the native vs native fight was insulting in my opinion.So, what did Hollywood accomplish with this?

Mostly I think it's fascinating how this is basically Marvel's Avengers in the wild west. The archetypes they both share are:Chisolm = Captain America
Goodnight = Tony Stark
Jack Horne = The Hulk
Billy = Black Widow
Vasquez = Thor
Red Harvest = Hawkeye
Faraday (surprise, surprise) = Star-LordOnly two things bother me about this movie.1. Why didn't Chisolm seek revenge on Bogue sooner? His entire family was killed and he's not a young guy. It's a plothole brought on by the screenwriters, cos they wanted to make it more personal for Chisolm. However, I don't remember this angle from the original and it becomes problematic in the end.2. In the beginning, when Bogue is talking about capitalism. This didn't sit right with me. I don't think that capitalism was talked about as an ideology in the old west.

There's a big, bad guy (& gang) who threatens to steal the resources of a small, good guy (this time lady) and their town. There's the part where the hero rounds up troops and supplies, makes a plan of attack and of course the climax presents a grizzly fight to the death, complete with shootouts, stranglings, dynamite, tomahawks and bows and arrows.Which brings me to...issues of racial stigma / fetishism are not solved in this one.

266,Fiurilli,Run of the mill western flick,5,1 October 2016,"'The Magnificent Seven' is the latest product created by Hollywood's ""remake machine"". Hollywood has been cranking this machine a lot lately and it is unclear when the handle will completely fall off. It has gotten close before with movies like 'Ben Hur', 'Point Break' and many others. The amount of remakes being made does not seem to decrease and there are still a lot in the pipeline. Remakes are not necessarily bad though for there are quite a lot that are much better than their predecessor. 'The Magnificent Seven' however is fighting an uphill battle since the original released in 1960 is considered by many a western classic. At its core this movie is a run of the mill western flick. It has us follow a man going by the name of Sam Chisolm who is a bounty hunter employed by the government. Chisolm is quickly confronted by a damsel in distress who is on a quest for revenge since almost half her village was murdered by an evil man called Bartholomew Bogue. Chisolm rounds up a group of six other men to battle Bogue and together they form the titular magnificent seven. Characters with an evil nature are almost always present in western movies, usually they still have an underlying sense of goodness which makes them feel human. This sense of inner goodness is non- apparent in Bogue who is presented as a mustache twirling villain. Most of the characters that form the magnificent seven are also very two-dimensional. For instance the so called ""outlaw"" Vasquez only seems to exist to set up some stereotypically racist one-liners. Roughly the same holds for almost every other character and overall there are only three that are given any sense of backstory. This is mostly done via the many conversations that are present throughout the movie. One problem with this though is that it does not feel natural and most times it seems like it was forced into otherwise normal conversations. What also feels forced are the handful of jokes that are spread throughout the movie. This film did not need all of those jokes and if it really wanted to add in some comedic relief it should have done so in a much more clever way rather than simply inserting them into certain conversations. It is for these very reasons that the dialogue never seems to flow in a natural way and it can even be perceived as boring at times. The writers of this movie have not done a very good job which is sad considering the fact that characters and dialogue are almost always the most important aspect of a movie set in the old west.As stated before the movies main bad guy is not particularly well done, however Peter Sarsgaard, the actor starring as Bartholomew Bogue, at the very least put in his best effort by presenting Bogue in a very slimy fashion. Behind the magnificent seven also are some very well-rounded actors. This movie features none other than Denzel Washington, Chris Pratt, Ethan Hawke and Vincent D'Onofrio among others which is nothing short of a stellar cast. In spite of their flat characters and bland dialogue almost every actor did do a very decent job in portraying their on screen persona. The entire cast seemed to have had a lot of fun in playing an old school gunslinger which helped create some much needed chemistry between the magnificent seven and overall it was quite enjoyable to see them all together on the big screen. Typically most western style movies contain a few environmental shots to set up the countryside as a character itself. The movies director Antoine Fuqua tries to do the same and as a result there are some very beautiful shots present in this film. One problem however is that instead of leaving one wanting more they're cut short before they could have been fully appreciated. Another part where Fuqua fails to deliver is in the framing of the many conversations present in the first half of the movie. The camera is always focused on the person that is talking making it almost impossible to see other characters react to what is happening. Something that is also not very well executed are the many action sequences scattered throughout. The magnificent seven never miss any of their shots unless the plot requires them to and after almost every kill the gunslingers feel the need to spin their gun around before holstering it. Furthermore the many enemies thrown at the main characters seemed to have had the same weapon training as a Stormtrooper and miss almost every shot they take. The action sequences themselves are also very rough around the edges, the movie cuts to a new shot almost every second and because of this it is very hard to get an understanding of what is happening at any given time. As a result the grand finale, spanning almost a quarter of the movies runtime, becomes tiresome to watch and overstays its welcome by a long shot.In the end 'The Magnificent Seven' is a movie that is incredibly bloated. It attempts to set up an overarching story, present quite a lot of characters while being forced to leave enough time for a grand finale. By trying to focus on too many aspects all at once it fails to execute a single aspect to perfection. It is for these very reasons that 'The Magnificent Seven' gets a not so magnificent five out of ten.",The Magnificent Seven

268,Tokyo55,Worst remake of a great film since The In Laws!,1,23 September 2016,"Had this been a new western, rather than a remake of an awesome remake of a classic, I'd give it a 3.I loved the original remake & thought the new trailer was great, so admittedly went in with high expectations, especially with Denzel Washington playing the legendary Yul Brenner.The beginning is horrible and the first hour is plain bad. The first action scene as seen in the trailer, is such a letdown, with no rhyme, reason or continuity. They throw in some corny bones of the original remake, including a few verbatim lines.Denzel was okay, but far from his best work. Vincent D'Onofrio is mildly amusing, very entertaining & quite likable as Jack Horne. Byung-hun Lee rocks as Billy Rocks and I would liked to have seen & heard more of/from him. Martin Sensmeier as Red Harvest was awesome but an important fight scene with him near the end, fell short & flat. The best actor/character in the film is Haley Bennett as the heroine, Emma Cullen! Funny thing is, the very best part of the film is her narration at the very end. I think it was the only time I smiled during the boringly long film which could have been done just as poorly in 90 minutes.Someone in the discussion boards talks about the painful PC diversity, and I would normally agree, but in this case, it actually worked and made a terrible film, a little more interesting. The commenter quips that only a little person was missing, but there actually is one and chose him to mock on several occasions. I guess little people aren't high on the SJW's list of victim class.I had to see it but would much rather have seen The Hateful Eight again instead and even went back and gave that movie an extra star. The Magnificent Seven needed the Tarantino touch and some blood. For all the killing, I don't remember seeing a drop, though maybe I just blinked through them. Then again, They can get a pass because there wasn't much blood used in old time westerns and they probably saved millions on spectacular special effects, or the lack thereof.This movie is SO bad, that I did something I never do at the movies, got up & went to the bathroom to be comfortable in my boredom, without even asking my friend what I missed, because I didn't care. I didn't really bond with the characters, except my concern for the horses, imagining as I always do in movies, the suffering these poor creatures went through during times of war & battle.This expensive movie will make money on the back of the original remake, and I'm sure they paid a fortune for the right to butcher it. I'd really like to know exactly what they did pay for the rights.I recommend you wait until it's on cable and have 2+ hours to waste.",The Magnificent Seven
269,gloriahur,Unoriginal but enjoyable for the most part,7,8 February 2017,"Overall, this movie doesn't have the most original story or characters, but it's great for pure entertainment, without thinking too deeply, but just to enjoy the gratifying action and vengeance against the evil. The ending is easily predictable- the story really doesn't have much and isn't at all realistic. There's no kind of suspense in the plot, but the thrill is in the action itself, which is shown throughout most parts of the movie. It was also interesting to see people from different origins use different ways to fight together, which was not shown often in the original western movies of similar background.The message that the movie gives, if any, is also quite stale. However, if you watch the movie without expecting such things, as I did, you would probably find the movie watchable. It certainly illustrates the ambiance in those areas at that time very well, and is pretty visually pleasing. The simplicity of the setting and the plot actually makes the grandeur of being righteous during that century stand out. The image and the effects also help to create that ambiance.",The Magnificent Seven

271,Vondaz,Not really Magnificent - more like Ordinary,6,25 October 2016,"OK so they've remade the Magnificent 7. Did they bring anything different to the table? The only thing they did differently was to change the ethnicity of the movie - from the heroes, to the townspeople, to the baddies. Did this make any difference? Not really. So the leader of the heroes is black - so what? Nobody treated him any differently, no- one abused him racially, everyone accepted him as if it was totally normal to see a black man as a deputised Marshall and also leading a group of mostly white men - am I being ignorant or was racism not rife in this time period? So the heroes included a Mexican, a man from from China and a native American. So what? Didi it make any difference? Again no, there's no obvious racism - other than a small example of a fellow hero referring to the native American as savage - which he immediately drops as soon as he discovers this guy can speak English!! So the townspeople and baddies are no longer Mexican. Did it make the baddies any more menacing? No! Peter Sarsgaard is just not menacing, no matter how much he tries to snarl and grimace. He wasn't menacing in Flightplan and nor is he here. Everything else is as you have already seen before - and I mean EVERYTHING, even a rerun of the knife/gun duel (instead with a hair pin). What was missing? Bar one instance where a local woman hands a hero a blanket, there's absolutely no emotional tie-in to the townspeople. Whereas before we could see why the heroes would sacrifice their lives to save these people, now there's no reason other than an apparent disregard for their own lives. All in all, it was an efficient movie, well acted, directed and shot. But it might as well be called ""7 men protect a town"", because it brought none of the magnificence of the previous version.",The Magnificent Seven
272,LessThanPaddy,"Loyalties aside, it isn't bad!",7,20 February 2017,"Okay, so I went into this film not expecting very much. Firstly because I had heard only mixed-bad reviews, nothing spectacular. Secondly, because admittedly it did look a bit cheesy. Thirdly, because I am of course a big fan of the original and doubt it could ever be topped, but it was for that very reason why I insisted on watching it, because I love the old version so much! My main criticism is of the antagonist, yes he's a different kind of villain to Calvera in the original, but I'm fine with that... if only he were in any way intimidating. He acts like a nervous waiter on his first day of the job, much less a cold land grabbing psychopath. His meek tone doesn't help I suppose... On the other hand, the 7 themselves are a good bunch of characters. Most of them are very different from their original characters, but that's okay! I already separated the two long before I saw the film. Pratt in particular is a great addition, and Denzel of course never fails to impress. The visuals are pretty good too, and the action isn't the same mundane stuff you get in uninteresting action films nowadays. Yes, there were a few twists we all saw coming but it doesn't bother me, it was largely executed well. Nothing will ever top the original for me in this regard, but that's not to say this one is dreadful. I quite enjoyed it, which I wasn't expecting at all. I just wish they'd have used the original soundtrack more, it's far too electrifying to be left out.",The Magnificent Seven
273,ColonelFaulkner,It's all about smiles and cries,7,24 September 2016,"I love westerns and hey, hey, I'm a fan of Aontoine Fuqua, I like Denzel Washington and I don't mind Ethan Hawke one bit; I'm also a fan of the original, which I've seen a bunch of times, but I didn't mind this being remade one bit.From my intro, I was looking forward to this and went in with high hopes, certainly the trailer looked mighty impressive. I gotta say, I enjoyed it, though it didn't quite reach the heights I was hoping for.In an age where big screen, big budget westerns are a rarity, I'm not gonna complain. Some of this really impressed me and some of it didn't, but I do have to say that films from fifty years ago + have a tendency to have a good story, cast and performances, but the action and effects just don't or can't reach or have the intensity or grittiness that you can get today; and in that regard this was much more impressive.It's a pretty unambiguous film, the bad guys in black hats, the villain, an out and out sinister type with no redeeming qualities at all. The seven cast and characters stood out, but we don't learn or know or need to know to much about them, the bad guy is just too bad and has to go.Some of the big shootout was a little cluttered and not done so well; and just when I was thinking wouldn't it be cool to have the original theme in the closing credits..I wasn't disappointed. Some nice touches by Mr Fuqua. This wasn't a great film..but it is a cool film. Definitely worth checking out for entertainment value. Probably the most fun I've had at the cinema for a while.",The Magnificent Seven
274,BNester,Politically correct remake,6,11 October 2016,"This is a remake of an earlier Magnificent Seven, which was itself a westernized remake of the Japanese film The Seven Samurai. Each remake is inferior to its predecessor. The genre was well parodied in The Three Amigos (1986).The film opens with the bad guy, Bart Bogue, terrorizing a peaceful western town because he wants the land for gold mining. Just to show you what a rogue is Bogue, he guns down several innocents and sets the church on fire. The pretty widow of one of his victims approaches a bounty hunter and hires him to protect the town.The bounty hunter, played by Denzel Washington, assembles a gang of hard cases who all have uncanny skills in killing people. Because this is a modern remake, the gang of mercenaries has to be politically correct, ticking off all the right categories of minorities: there's an Indian, a Chinaman, a Mexican, all taking orders from a black man (this is supposed to be just after the Civil War!), with the widow thrown in for feminists.The gang have one week to prepare defenses and train the hapless townspeople before Bogue and his army of Bogueymen fall upon them like the wolf on the fold.The predictable mayhem ensues, during which the viewer is left to ponder questions like: why are there no representatives of other fashionable minorities - where is the homosexual, the handicapped, the Good Muslim? Why is Baddie Bogue just a greedy gold miner when he could have been the agent of a giant corporation dedicated to Global Warming? (Maybe they're saving this for the next remake.) Why is the music so insipid and nondescript, when they could have used the stirring soundtrack from the previous version? (Maybe they couldn't afford the royalties.) When is X going to kill Y (no spoilers here!) and end this melee? Luckily, I saw a version with subtitles, so was able to understand the dialogue, which I could not hear properly. I don't know if this was owning to bad sound recording, or poor projection facilities in the cinema.Despite its predictability, the movie is competently made, and holds your attention. If you haven't seen the previous versions, it's worth a look.",The Magnificent Seven
275,cazmor,Almost Magnificent,6,30 September 2016,"A remake of a remake. . . I like many am a fan of the first remake, John Sturges 1960 classic, and as its modern counterpart it also was a star packed line-up. Going into this film it is hard not to directly compare, but then with the title and premise how could one not, and as a fan of overall westerns I was only to eager.The cast certainly promised a lot, but as is often the case in having so much talent sardine'd in not all are given the screen time to shine.Denzel did a fine job of his leading role as Sam Chisolm, and I enjoyed Pratt's lively portrayal of Farraday as a drunken gambler, and although I am fans of Hawke and D'Onofrio, they like Byhuing and Peter Sarsguard had Cameo appearances at best, though Sarsgauard did a wonderful job of the villain, cold and sadistic. The filmography was excellent, shot in what I consider the essence of westerns, as much about the surroundings as the people, still wide scenery shots, slow wide pans, and many through frame shots, truly a fine job.But all of this could not detract from a film that slightly exceeded its grasp, even with excellent action scenes, adequately restrained, something was off, as well timed as the screenplay was, there is little to no character development, we are left with the characters almost as we meet them, casual introductions.If I had never seen the original Magnificent Seven? Is this for the current generation? Does it stand on it's own? Unfortunately no, the Seven Samurai and the 1960's Magnificent Seven have more than stood the test of time, Antoine Faqua made a valiant effort here, just not a magnificent one.",The Magnificent Seven
276,aj1218,A 6 if you didn't see the original a 4 if you did,5,24 September 2016,"The third American remake of Akira Kurosawa's Seven Samurai. It has a great deal of the same issues but they are exacerbated in this third iteration. This movie of the three has weakest storytelling but some of the best action, but it doesn't feel like a western. And it isn't quite an action movie instead it is this kind of middle ground that just makes the movie feel lost and out of place. And that is one of the over arching issues with this movie, it doesn't know what it wants to be.*LIGHT SPOILERS BELOW*Everyone besides Denzel Washington has no motivation. The big bad guy an evil corporate industrialist (who honestly gains nothing by destroying the town...he has the mine rights already and would greatly benefit from having a town nearby) decides to destroy the town, murder half the inhabitants and set the church on fire in the first 5 min...just so you know he is evil. Chris Pratt's character Faraday is motivated to get his horse back and an obscure promise of some payout. But he realizes early on that he has his horse back and the payout isn't that much, so he kind of stays and dies for no reason. Ethen Hawke's ""Goodnight"" and Byung-hun Lee's ""Billie"" show up because Denzel asked nicely (again no talk of a payout). And this repeats itself with the rest of the characters, (except for the good Comanche Indian Denzel ate a raw deer liver so they became be-sties). And it gets worse because all the magnificent seven are the same stereotypes you have seen in Hollywood since the 70's. Mountain Man into Jesus, Noble Indian Savage, Mexican Bandit, Confederate Soldier with PTSD, Gambling Cowboy, token woman that can shoot, Asain samurai with a pistol, and the only real character Denzel Washington as Chisolm. The action in this movie is however fast paced and over the top...Think of a western ""SHOOT EM UP"" and you have it. They do not use the traditional idea of western movies that build up the tension over the course of a movie. It is suddenly, Chris Pratt kills 8 bad guys in 15 seconds. Billie (the samurai gunslinger) runs in the open and stabs 4 cowboys with knives (despite having two pistols), and Mountain Man tackles a horse (despite having a pistol, rifle, tomahawk, knife etc). It is cool to watch but will have you at moments go WTF.If you think about the story you will have a bad time. If you want realistic western action you will have a bad time. If you want a mediocre action movie that takes place in a western town, this could be worth a shot but only if you watch during a matinée. It doesn't hold a candle to the original (1960). But it does have better action than the 1998 one...but the story is worse. So it is basically on the same level as the made to TV movie.",The Magnificent Seven

Were they in Malibu the whole time?This is so uniformly drab that I can only guess that nobody was really trying here and you can't hang it on the actors as they can only work with what they've been given and it's for everyone else to pull the whole thing together into something taut and worth watching and for producers to kick butt if they've enough experience to be able to tell if everyone else is even turning up to do a job every day while they're paying the bills.I see no evidence of anyone being involved in this movie except the actors.A terrible waste.,The Magnificent Seven

280,HollywoodGlee,"A fun, action-filled, end-of-summer blockbuster. Technically a remake of a remake!",8,7 October 2016,"Viewed by Larry Gleeson during the Venice Film Festival.Director Antoine Fuqua (Training Day, The Equalizer) presented his latest work, The Magnificent Seven, as the Closing Night Film for the 73rd Venice International Film Festival.In 1960, Director John Sturges made the original Magnificent Seven, starring Yul Brynner and Steve McQueen, as an American Western. Sturges based his work on legendary Japanese director, Akira Kurosawa's classic Seven Samurai. So in addition to being an end-of-summer blockbuster, Fuqua's Magnificent Seven is a remake of a remake. Like Seven Samurai a good portion of Fuqua's work takes place indoors and is evidenced by low-key lighting, heavy shadows and blackness.This was Fuqua's first attempt at a western although he claims to having had an affinity for them having watched many during his formative years. So when Metro Goldwyn Mayer approached him about making a western, Fuqua jumped at the opportunity. However, he wanted to make this his film with a theme to resonate with today's audience. He didn't have to look far to find a strong actor to lead up his core group of seven. Fuqua proposed Denzel Washington for the film's lead, bounty hunter Chisolm, having worked with Washington on Training Day and The Equalizer. Washington won an Oscar for Best Actor for his Training Day role and his on-screen partner, Ethan Hawke, received a Best Actor in a Supporting Role nomination. Like Fuqua Washington had never done a western and looking back at the success the two have had together quickly came on board. Chris Pratt was identified to play gambler Josh Faraday, Chisolm's sidekick and first to join the seven. Pratt, too, leaped at the opportunity to play a cowboy.Soon Fuqua had an idea for his version of The Magnificent Seven as he and Washington performed research into the Old West. They discovered a wide-range of nationalities including Russians, Mexicans, and Irish. Fuqua wanted his seven to reflect this so he collaborated with screenwriters Nic Pizzolatto and Richard Wenk to create an authentic cast of characters utilizing a diverse group of young actors in addition to Washington and Pratt: Ethan Hawke plays Goodnight Robicheaux; Vincent D'Onofrio plays Jack Horne, Native-American Martin Sensmeier plays Red Harvest; Mexican-American actor Manuel Garcia-Rulfo plays Vasquez; and South Korean headliner Byung-hun Lee plays Billy Rocks.The film is set in the town of Rose Creek where a ruthless industrialist, Batholomew Bogue, played convincingly by Peter Saarsgaard, is attempting to roust the entire town with threats, murder and mayhem for his own personal gain. The desperate town folk are at wits end when a woman, Emma Cullen, played by a tough Haley Bennett, reaches out and convinces the seven hired guns to protect and defend them from Bogue's army of mercenaries. The men come together and find within themselves not only the will to fight and win but also the moral fortitude to do something because it is right.Interestingly, like Kurasawa, Fuqua employs a number of camera techniques to highlight his film's narrative. Many of his Hollywood closeups are shot just below the chin emphasizing the actors' strong jawlines. Mauro Fiore is credited as the Cinematographer. In addition, impressive, expansive panning landscape shots are used to introduce the film with a non-diagetic score started by the iconic film score composer James Horner. Horner had over 75 projects to his name, along with two Academy Awards, and worked with Hollywood heavyweights like James Cameron, Oliver Stone, George Lucas, Ron Howard and Steven Spielberg. Horner did not live to see the completed product before his untimely death in June of 2015. However, he did manage to complete seven themes based on the film's script and his conversations with Fuqua. Composer Simon Franglen finished the film's impressive score in a manner and style of James Horner as a tribute to Horner.Throughout The Magnificent Seven Antoine Fuqua attempts to comment on today's society and what he sees as overt acts of tyranny as he keeps with the Kurosawa thematic element of programming a film with societal mirrors and a political undercurrent,. And while Kurosawa used the unemployed samurai to form his seven, Fuqua finds a group of fringe characters with diverse backgrounds and nationalities. Still, both film's characters do what is right and help those in need in spite of their own self-interest. My hat goes off to Director Fuqua for a valiant and noble effort. The Magnificent Seven is a fun film, well done with plenty of action and color, and is made in a similar vein as a world cinema masterpiece. Highly recommended.",The Magnificent Seven

But after lunch I took a look at what was playing and decided that this film sounded promising.It didn't take long for me to recognize that this was a film worth paying for; it's so rare for me to do that, since I have no personal interest in doing my share to support modestly-talented millionaires in their lavish lifestyles (which is what most of Hollyweird it is to me). But this is one film that I will be adding to my collection, as I know I'll be enjoying it several times in the future.I've always been a ""cheer for the good guys, get upset at the bad guys"" kind of person, and to see what the townsfolk go through at the bad guys' expense quickly got me motivated to see justice done. The seven that they eventually hire served it up in a hurry. The first gun battle alone was worth the price of admission, and the intensity doesn't let up throughout the film.

The random gathering of unbelievably quick and accurate gunmen, a knife expert and an archer; the reluctant hero (Hawke) who you know is going to reappear to help save the day once his conscience gets the best of him...just tired old overdone characters reciting tired old overdone lines. I'm glad I didn't pay to see this in the theater, but I feel I even wasted the $5.99 on iTunes. There was nothing original about this film. It was boring and predictable...townspeople rise up against maniacal oppressor, maniacal oppressor comes back for revenge and is killed. The only character with any depth is Hawke's...the others are so hum-drum and overdone it was almost comical. The story has plenty of issues as well. Toward the end when the 'bad guys' come back to enact revenge on the town, their main weapon is a wagon-mounted gatling gun. So they fire what seems like a thousand rounds into the town's buildings and persons and then pause to change magazines. This pause is at least five to ten minutes long, yet no one on the friendly side uses this time gap to their advantage to attack. Instead Pratt's character decides to take on the gatling gun solo. Meanwhile Hawke's character is reputed to be some sort of hero Rebel sniper spends his time picking off riders chasing Pratt's character. Why didn't the sniper simply take out guys behind the gatling gun? No depth...just run of the mill ridiculous and unbelievable.",The Magnificent Seven

287,murrayspeer,Enjoyable; Good Cast; Falls Short on Theme,8,5 November 2019,"Antoine Fuqua wanted to make a western, which is fine. He wanted to make the kind of western he enjoyed as a child, which is fine. And he wanted to re-adapt The Seven Samurai into a new western, which is fine.The problem is that the cinematic world has moved on since the 1970s and the issues that westerns need to engage are different now. If he wanted to make a great, enduring, important western, he'd need to understand the themes that more recent great westerns have engaged with that made them great: movies like Unforgiven, 3:10 to Yuma, Appaloosa, The Hateful Eight, The Revenant, The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford, and Django Unchained.With the cast and budget he had, Fuqua had a chance to put this film in league with those classics. As it is, though, without that depth of theme (or at least of relevant, contemporary theme) this movie will instead be remembered alongside Tombstone, The Mask of Zorro, and Quigley Down Under as fun, action-filled stories that don't actually contribute very much to the ongoing deconstruction of heroism, violence, family, liberty, and race that the aforementioned films have furthered so well.The cast deserve great kudos, including Denzel Washington, Chris Pratt, Ethan Hawke, Peter Sarsgaard, and the ever-underrated Vincent D'Onofrio. It's unfortunate that the film doesn't do more with the diversity of its cast. There are female, Asian, Latino, and First Nations characters who aren't given any real depth at all. It even has the slightest hint of a male-male love relationship that could have been a powerful motivator for the two characters in question, who instead are given very little motivation for anything. Unfortunately, the non-black minority characters in the story are relegated to the background the way black characters once were.The performances, cinematography, and action sequences make this worth seeing, but it's not anywhere near as good or as important as it could have been. 8/10",The Magnificent Seven

289,erkucz00,An Excellent Homage to the Western Genre,10,23 September 2016,"This remake of a remake tells the time honored tale of a few brave men rising up to defend the weak and oppressed, and again shows us the conflict we've seen many times before, in which, the skilled few stand u to the oppressive many.The Magnificent 7 establishes its setting in perfect fashion, thrusting us into a heated town meeting. Then suddenly, the villain enters, his menacing footsteps thump and creak on the wood floor, disagreement ensues, and suddenly, a shot splits the air. Such a startling sound, that you never really get used to, despite the amount of lead that flies here. The Western atmosphere is perfectly recreated and though it is that much more real, due to improved technology, it feels familiar in a way. Strains, variations, and melodic teases of Elmer Bernstein's famous score riddle the film and keep the mood adventurous.The obvious dominant component of the film, its action scenes are epic, and gripping. There are of course plenty of scenes that any western worth its salt is simply required to feature. Several Mexican standoffs, so delightfully stereotypical, as well as quite a few things that are new, or have not been seen for a while. A duel between two Comanches, a fighting force seeking shelter from the mighty Gatling gun, and a cowboy lighting dynamite with a cigarette as he lays dying all come to mind. I could go on for much longer about how ridiculously cool this movie's action sequences are, but I'll let you see for yourself. Finally, the plot, though anything but unfamiliar is a moving and epic tale about unity, loyalty, and grit. One of my favorite scenes in the movie features Jack Horne, the tracker, played by Vincent D'onofrio, (who like the rest of this all star cast is just downright amazing in a role that fits like a glove) shot by an enemy arrow. He falters, but stares at the enemy and rises. He takes a step forward, and is stopped again, a second shaft protruding from his chest. He continues his advance toward the enemy until he can no longer, dying with his dignity intact. The Magnificent Seven is a film that is so clichéd that it begins to feel original. And That is definitely a compliment. Not that there is anything wrong with modern westerns that try something new, like Django, or No Country For Old Men, but It is certainly a joy to watch a movie that owns these tropes for what they are, tosses some satisfying character development into the mix, and makes something out of it that is, for lack of a better adjective, positively ""Magnificient"".",The Magnificent Seven

Like my title say....""Entertaining but Stupid."" It's like the movie Director try's to make it so edgy and hip hop for a movie set in the 1800's. It just doesn't work, and the acting kind of sucked.Of course in today's movie world you have to have minorities in a film. Back in the ""real"" wild west it was about 90% whites, so of course they have to have a black guy as the leader, an Asian and native American in the 7's little gang. The bad guys also have an Indian and guess what? The two Indians have a knife throw down at the end(guess who wins?) Not much substance or character development in this film and zero love romance.

291,jpatrick-68632,It goes OK!,7,29 September 2016,"Remakes. The execrable Ben-Hur remake has made us suspicious. But we were excited and prepared to suspend reality at senior discount rates to take a chance on the Magnificent Seven. OK. The bald white guy in the original is replaced by black guy with hair called Sam Chisolm but he's still as cool as that part of the bed you save for emergencies on hot summer nights. The White Widow of Rose Creek likes the cut of Sam's jib and asks him to save her town from the sort of greedy landgrab that seems to have been commonplace in 1870's America and lived on in 20th century South America. Think Pale Rider. Think LaHood. Think a tanned Clint before he talked to chairs. Sam takes little convincing, the White Widow having lost her ability to do up bodice-buttons. Seems reasonable. He puts together a team that includes a marksman war hero, a wisecracking cardshark, an oriental gentleman with deadly hairclips, a mountain man, and a Mexican. But this is only six and the producers suddenly realised that the Magnificent Six doesn't quite have the ring to it so they introduce a Commanche called Red Harvest because you can never have too much ethnic diversity. Also LaHood whose real name is Bart Bogue and who looks nothing like Eli Wallach has an Indian too and he is a really bad bastard and as any cook'll tell you things need to be balanced. And Sam can show his empathy by eating raw liver. They arrive in town and clean up Bogues' murderous crew quick smart, after giving them the sort of friendly warning that says 'there can only be one outcome'. The warning is not heeded. So there's a fight. With guns. There are arrows and knives too and an axe from memory but mostly guns. There's lots of snappy one liners and they do an individual body count at the end and it shows that they (the Magnificent Seven) have killed 12,217,365. The war hero who holds down the Robert Vaughn role has a big zero next to his name. Iffy. But there is a survivor and he takes off lickety split to let the Boguester know that all is not well in Rose Creek. It is fair to say he is not best pleased and lets the bearer of the tidings know in terms that give lie to the metaphor. His face sets to stone and he orders chief-baddie-assistant to scoop the shallow end of the gene-pool for the sort of heavily armed lunatics who, in a different time, would consider voting for a special needs oompah-loompah a good idea. In the meantime Sam and his happy band of vigilantes are preparing for what will be the western equivalent of the mother of all battles. WMD's, it should be noted, are also absent in Rose Creek and it's surrounds. All that's left now is to guess which of the Magnificents will survive the bloodbath and whether comeupperances will be delivered with sufficient malice. To name survivors would be giving it away. Suffice to say we were a bit startled. Hottest member of the Magnifiques? According to my wife, Red Harvest wins hands down to the extent that I am writing this stripped to the waist with red face paint on. There may be a niche market for fatmen thussly presented but I'm damn sure that I would not want to meet anyone who lives in this dark place. So no photo. Was it any good? It goes OK!

However, if you are into action/comedies that are entertaining and fun, you will love this movie.I personally love these kinds of movies. Guardians of the Galaxy is my favorite Marvel movie, and Suicide Squad is my favorite DC movie (both in terms of action/comedy NOT STORY). This movie is also very similar to the Expendables (it's a gang of misfits; some young, some old) but they are heroes and they have fun.The movie is structured similarly to movies like The Avengers & Suicide Squad, in the aspect that the first 45-60 minutes is about putting the team together, but once the action starts, it doesn't end till the credits roll.All in all, the movie is great.

Well for me it worked. I just had a lot of fun with it.I have to say that I haven't seen the original movies that this is a remake of so I didn't have that to compare it to, therefore if I compare it to something, I compare it to other movies I have seen.Because the movie has a lot of things I have already seen in other movies (I won't say what because that may be considered spoiling the movie). Therefore the story isn't what makes this movie and if you're looking for a great story, the movie might not be for you.What the movie does have first of all is a great cast that delivers. Denzel Washington gives the best performance of the movie by far but also Chris Pratt shows that Guardians wasn't a fluke, Hawke, D'Onofrio and just the entire cast works very well together for this nice team of 7 misfits that has to save the town.Also the action is great, it's very true to the old westerns. There are some very tense stand-offs and when the shooting starts, the action is fantastically shot, directed and just well executed.And the movie has a good sense of humor, there are good comedic moments that give good levity to the movie.Because the movie actually is pretty towards an R-rated movie, it has some harsh and brutal things happening that might not be for kids. It's one of the most mature PG-13 movies I have seen.All in all, the Magnificent Seven is a fun time in the theater, probably not as good as the original but better than most remakes these days (looking at you Ghostbusters) and I give it an 8.5/10",The Magnificent Seven

Another 33 where kill during the 1 st street fight and 2 at the bar. At the beginning, there was a total of 165 sheriffs or affiliated outlaws to control a town of about 31 souls.

I am however, a fan of the two main stars, Denzel Washington and Chris Pratt, as well as the director, Antoine Fuqua. Much like his last collaboration with Denzel, ""The Equalizer"", this film focuses more on the action and the strength of its actors instead of fully developed characters or an original story line. With that being said, you should go into this movie knowing that it's not trying to win any awards or change the face of cinema. It's a good, old fashioned shoot 'em up action flick with quick-draw cowboys, wild horses, sharp-shooters, native Americans (good and bad), one-liners, drinkers, smokers, an evil overlord, and a knife- wielding Asian thrown in for good measure. Where the film lacks in its back-story of the seven heroes for hire, it makes up for in it's well-placed humor (thanks to Chris Pratt mainly) and it's crowd-pleasing action scenes (there were several moments of applause during the final battle scenes at the screening I attended).

Indeed, there are many cliche touches that you usually find in other western films, but this film is still interesting for me personally, and I seem to ignore that cliche because I really enjoy this film, I really like it.This is a kind of film that is fast pace, especially in gathering the seven members. Character recognition and background are made as simple and concise as possible. However, entering the 2nd act or the last 45 minutes, I really felt an exciting journey from this story. All of the characters are very like-able and cool, with their own characteristics and personalities. Really interesting casting, making Denzel (a senior actor who is always cool in his role) as the leader, with a reunion with his charming hawk, and a successful pratt with his comedic-center, as well as the rest of the cast who are also stunning. Of course you can't expect more screentime balance and character depth, this is a risk with lots of good cast. The action scenes are very well-crafted and neat, and very jarring.

304,rotex29,Great? No. Entertaining? Hell Yes!,6,17 January 2017,"As Hollywood tends to do, it once again attempts to regurgitate another remake of a successful old classic, hoping for a box office victory . Sadly, sometimes success cannot be transcended over 57 years no matter how many special effects are used, whatever adjustments are made to the original story, and in this particular movie, whomever they use to prop up the leading roles of the 7 gunslinger killers banding together to save the town from a villainous, greedy and violent mining magnate. Again, Hollywood not wanting to leave out one single potential ticket buyer, has remade this new version with actors representing a politically correct stew of race, creed, sexual proclivities, gender equality and disassociating emotional behaviours and in hopes of enticing a broader audience. Where the 1960's version of the ""Magnificent 7"" heroes were primarily white, heterosexual, mentally astute and focused on the task at hand, we now are presented with an African American, a Latino, A Native American, an Asian, and three Caucasians who each has their psychological and physiological balls and chains; Chris Pratt with an overabundance of testosterone boastfully referring to himself as the ""world's greatest lover"", Vincent D'Onofrio, a violent, religious zealot killing in the name of God, and Ethan Hawke, playing a confederate sharpshooter hearing voices, his past haunting him into night sweats. All that aside, we are given the a more violent version of the original, an obvious by product of our protagonists' individual agendas (which we are not privy to, at least for 6 of the characters, and not until the end). Unfortunately, the movie cannot stand on its story, alone. Its a recognizable rehash of good versus evil, god versus the devil. There is only one place to go and that is where we expect to. The Magnificent 7 will trump the antagonists, send them to Hell, and in the end, vengeance will prevail. Lets not forget that although we have a weak and predictable story-line, a terrible script, we have some damn good actors in this movie. Peter Sarsgaard plays Bartholomew Bogue, the vile and inexplicably violent mine owner, who we can grow to despise quickly. His impish cowardly behaviour sets us up to hate him, and root for the visiting team. Chris Pratt throws his easy-going loose- lipped quips into the mix, and we can buy his shtick. Denzel Washington, although getting long in the tooth, is nothing short of great, although he has little good stuff to spew from a weak script. And finally Ethan Hawke, who can pull together a great character in ""Goodnight"" Robicheaux a troubled, civil war sharpshooter, sporting greasy hair, facial scar and a gold tooth. In spite of his demons we root for him, no matter how bad he was in his past life. But lets get back to the jist of the movie. Was it great? No. Was it good? On some fronts. Was it watchable. Definitely. Is it Academy Award worthy? No. So lets put aside the lousy dialogue, the predictable story, and the poor quality character development and lets just be mindlessly entertained with a woofer blowing, bang bang soundtrack for two hours and twelve minutes.

I think 56 years is long enough of a gap to justify a remake, so I'll give them a pass on this one (although you could argue that 1980's Battle Beyond the Stars was another Seven Samurai remake). So what was it like?Each character was steadily added to the team, they had a bonding/preparing the town montage, the bad guys showed up, they shot each other a lot, characters were killed, the film ended. Pretty much what I was expecting, and that's fine.Personally, I love Westerns (The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly is one of my favourite films ever), so for me this formula really worked. Is it going to win any awards?

The protagonists are shallow as can be, just seven people with boring, stereotypical background stories that shoot and fight soooooo much better than the bad guys.How original!If you are in the mood for a superficial shootout and just want to see a lot of smoking guns and blood then yes, this can be entertaining.

Action scenes where also done very well, sure some of it was off the top or cliché (characters keep walking even after getting shot 40 times) but it was still great to watch.If you just want 2 hours of jokes, action, and a Western theme that you don't see very often anymore, this is that sort of movie.

There's barely any story outside the premises of the film and no character development or even a character setup on why each of the 7 men join the crew in the first place. There is no motivation given for anything the characters do and in the short scenes where the characters interact with one another is shallow. Because the movie failed to spend any time on developing the character, the audience was not invested emotionally in any of them when they died. I would've gave them one more star if the action sequences were done well but that wasn't done well either as the camera work is very chaotic moving from one scene to another instead of creating a sense of fluidity.

The storyline is forgettable, and not entirely intriguing. That gets boring when the movie is 2 hours and 15 minutes. The movie does create a strong atmosphere though, and the fight scenes are amazing. It's highly entertaining, highly forgettable, and well shot/choreographed.

Being a fan of westerns in particular, I will jump at the chance to see a western in the cinema.I really don't think this was a bad movie by any stretch of the imagination. It upholds some originality rather than just blindly following the original script and attempts a more modern and socially aware approach. This approach I do not necessarily agree with as it comes across far too forced at times, like they were attempting to recognise as many different races or even 'minorities' as possible.It was cheesy at times, there is no doubt about this, but classically westerns were styled this way, being melodramatic at times and maybe one too many standoffs with intense close ups of characters staring at each other. In a way I like this though. I thought it paid almost tribute to the classic westerns of the 1950s and 60s. The famous lighting another mans cigar' scene was a pretty neat addition, and instantly reminded me of 'The Good, The Bad & The Ugly'.The build up was worth it too was an awesome showdown and shootout, lots of well delivered performances and cleverly directed fight scenes.

Then she cross path with Chisolm (Denzel Washington) just after Chisolm executed a state wanted man for murder and rape, and so Emma ask for Chisolm's help. Chisolm accept the job for one reason – that he always takes high price, but never before someone ask for his service with everything they got. Then Chisolm recruits another six persons, first he recruited Faraday (Chris Pratt), a gambler drinker handsome big mouth but with excellent skills of card magic, then a sharp shooter with stress post traumatic disorder Goodnight Robicheaux a.k.a Angel of Death (Ethan Hawke),also a former Confederation along with his sidekick Billy Rocks (Byung Hun Lee), a very fast Chinese gunman, but faster and deadlier with blades (Byung Hun Lee actually a Korean actor),then Chisolm recruited a Mexican outlaw Vasques (Manuel Garcia Rulfo). After then they together recruited an ex Indian hunter, the legendary John Horne (Vincent D' Onofrio), and an Indian Comanche warrior with his noble principals, Red Harvest (Martin Sensmeir). Chisolm didn't waste much time, he and his 6 compatriots killed 22 Bouge's best gunmen and sent the town sheriff to inform Bouge, gather the town's citizens to choose, stay and fight to death or leave. These 7 men only have 3 days to prepare the city before Bogue and his hundreds of army to rush them all. This is the 2nd remake of Akiro Kurosawa's ""Seven Samurai"" after John Sturges ""The Seven Magnificent"" (1960). If 1960's version is more focus to the 7 gunmen with the citizens, Fuqua's version is upgraded into a whole new level, all thanks to Pazollato and Wenk's screenplay that create the citizen's despair, but Chisolm and his men manage to turn the citizen's fear of Bouge into the fear of lost everything they ever dream for, lost for they pride. Pazolatto and Wenk also manage to put some humor in some parts.The screenplay smartly deliver us the story of a group of men that some of them with background that give them enough emotional reason to kill each other, e.g John Horne (ex Indian Hunter), Red Harvest (Indian Comanche), Faraday (his grandfather killed by Mexican gang), Vasquez (his grandfather was a member of Mexican gang that ambush Faraday's grandfather's town), but they bound together with one purpose, a noble purpose.Why?Cauze for another 5 men (beside Chisolm and Red Harvest) each of them have they own past to reconcile with, wanna make piece to their own soul before the next battle that could be their last one by take the impossible job. But off course the the last tiny element of surprise from Chisolm about his personal agenda, he has his very own personal reason why he finally take this job, that left me a question : Maybe this one flaw on this Mag7? Why? Because, why Chisolm rejected the offering from Emma, and declared that he himself is not for sale.but then he take the job when he found Emma will pay him – even all at once- with everything she got. Or maybe is just Chisolm eager to know how far would this widow go to seek righteousness or even revenge?If she would go a long the way, then Chisolm had a good reason to recruit the men he need.This Mag7 only give as much as a glance of each person's historical background, through their dialogues. Except for Robicheaux, this character get a little more exposed and curiosity what the hell happen to him after North and South war that make him hate himself so much after all act that he has committed during North and South war, that make him a very flimsy man. Denzel is really perform great his character cool bad ass, while Pratt represent enthusiasm and the spirit of this movie. Ethan Hawke (this is the 2nd time he team up with both Denzel and Fuqua) gave audiences skepticism about what will happen to this team. The rest of the cast, even didn't get portion as much as Denzel (off course, he is the man) or Ethan Hawke and Pratt – especially Martin Sensmier get the smallest portion – but they're all represent an assembled excellent marksmen (some of them have horrible dirty little secrets) to march as one into a battle for one descent good noble cause. Haley Bennet performances represent as young widow search for the last hope and an attitude to face all odds at all cost for he dignity since her husband gunned down in cold blood by Bouge (Saargards appearance really gives the impression as the sick man). I also give credit to the cinematography that shots all gunfight scenes so perfectly, how Mauro Fiore took the angle to describe the brutality of Bouge's gold mine from distance.Fuqua's Mag7 is not one of classical western movie, but It's superbly doneand magnificently delivered to us, magically entertaining from beginning till end. Even though this movie might don't have what all critics wants to be as classical but still will be remembered as one of the most entertaining,enjoyable western..

323,Iron-Bat-Prime,"The Magnificent Seven ""So Far, So Good""",6,1 October 2016,"Rating: 7.7, Good Movie* Who would of thought that director Antoine Fuqua would make a remake of a remake in such a stylish western fashion. The new Magnificent Seven is just as good as the original, even if it takes the threats little less seriously, and focuses on the action and characters. It is clear to say that Denzel and the team put both fun and passion into this movie, even if it feels a little awkward in areas.* Characters: Each member of the Seven shot us a BANG of a performance. Denzel's role as Chisholm was executed well and wielded a shiny resemblance of Yul Brynner. Chris Pratt of course steals the show as usual with his hilarious and sly performance. And what a treat it was to see Ethan Hawke and Byung-hun Lee return to the big screen with such stellar performances. Vincent D'Onofrio's character was another triumph, he truly plays the crazy, emotional roles with such talent. The Mexican and Red Harvest may have lacked a character development, but they were hilarious to watch, whether in a saloon or battlefield the Seven themselves are Magnificent. Even the rest of the cast gave great performances. Hayley Bennett was brilliant and Peter Sarsgaard played a cunning villain, about damn time am a right!? Man Green Lantern was awful.* Plot & Design: This isn't something we haven't seen before, we have a our tyrant ruling his village, the villages seek heroes and as usual the heroes kick ass. But Fuqua does take the next step to establish an emotional connection with the audience and characters that go down in gun fire. The movies pace is up and down all over when their not shooting up the place, and numerous awkward scenes are scattered throughout it. I must say I was a little disappointed they didn't play 'The House Of The Rising Sun' like they did in the trailer, because that was what got us all pumped for it! But Fuqua again compensates this with some great cinematography and execution.* At the end of the day, this movie didn't break any new ground,its no Django Unchained nor Hateful Eight (Well Done Tarantino), but it does still live up to the Western genre with style. This movie was never trying to be serious, and after watching these Magnificent Seven, I'm sure you'll realise that.Thank You for reading this review, and please check out my other Reviews and List here at IMDb: Iron-Bat-Prime!",The Magnificent Seven
324,anaahnu,An ordinary action movie -- but thanks for the attempt,8,6 October 2016,"A fed, traveling in search of criminals (pistols and sombrero included, mustache as well). A Captain Boomerang from Suicide Squad (Mexican, for some reason). A young woman, very beautiful - and yes, the absence of fan service's taken for granted. A Redskin, who plays no part in the plot (they just need him to shoot arrows from the roof). And some others, such as a brave handsome cardsharp, some retired cowboy in pensioner's age (naturally, they're all retired cowboys here!) A Chinese and a fox hunter. Nay, that's not the Magnificent Seven we're used to (counting the widow and her friend - not even a Seven, there are more). But you get amends, if that word suits here: the movie's full of blood and deaths, not the Hollywood style, y'know. In fact, little who survives. Also, there is a man called Bogue in the plot (or is it a 'Bog'?) You can call him 'the Bog that consumes all people' (though nothing can resist a brave woman!) And nice, neat mountain landscapes. And all that Wild West stuff. There's no spirit of the old movies, but... who wants it? The director earned a good mark just because he attempted to make a Western movie. Now. In the era of Warcraft and Peter Jackson.Don't be deceived: this is a movie for one-time watching. You watch, you forget it. But it serves its purpose: it can make one a good holiday.",The Magnificent Seven
325,stilloopless1,Magnificent live up to its name,10,2 October 2016,"I'm a fan of the good old fashioned westerns, including the original source material of this film, Akira Kurosawa's 1954 masterpiece Seven Samurai as well as the John Sturges' 1960 The Magnificent Seven remake starring Yul Brynner, Steve McQueen and company. So, all things being equal, Antoine Fuqua has some big shoes to fill with this 2016 remake.And fill them, Fuqua did. The Magnificent Seven is more The Equalizer than Training Day (thankfully), and the word magnificent sums things up nicely. Honestly, if the movie had only been as long as the opening sequence and ended, I would have said, ""money well spent"" and left happy. It was that good. The remaining 2 hours are the icing on the proverbial (death by chocolate) cake and just as indulgent to the movie goer.Like its 1960s counterpart, the all star cast of Denzel Wahington, Ethan Hawke, Vincent D'Onofrio, and Chris Pratt bring all their combined and considerable talents to bear and deliver stellar performances. While lesser known (to me anyway) Byung-hun Lee, Manuel Garcia-Rulfo, Martin Sensmeier, and Haley Bennett rise to the challenge and hold their own against the ""big boys."" Peter Sarsgaard puts the bad and @$$ in bad@$$. One of the best, unrepentant, villains and complete s.o.b.s to come out the chute in ages. You fear and loathe this mother from the get and want him to get his in the worse way possible.Squee!The cinematography is outstanding. I saw this in IMAX and talk about feeling like you're in the movie. The vistas are stunning, the dust and sweat is almost palatable. The grit and harshness of the frontier leaps off the screen. You don't just watch this movie, you experience every thunder of horse hooves and spray of bullets. Speaking of bullets, the sound mixing add another rich layer of texture to this film. Every gun shot is like a canon blast and had me jumping and dodging in my seat.The Magnificent Seven is action packed, dramatic, tense and intense, introspective with touches of well placed/timed heart and humor. This is a modern day throw back to John Ford westerns and the like at their best.Gather up your posse, saddle up and mosey on down to the theater for this one. This film is time and money well spent.",The Magnificent Seven
326,gja822,Weak and disappointing,5,17 September 2017,"I had some expectations on this film. I saw Fuqua to be good once, it features some of my favourite actors like Ethan Hawke or sometimes good Chris Pratt. But... No, this film is no good.It lacks action, it has no character's development, it has no logic in its evolution. Even likable characters or reasonably well-made jokes are absent. Or drama. Anything is bleak! Even picturesque landscapes looked false on that senseless dramatic background. Just once for the whole film I could have some senses for characters and this was only because of music (nothing special also apart from one or two episodes).",The Magnificent Seven
327,ryebailey2002,Great Modern Remake of an Old Classic,9,13 June 2017,"This remake of the original movie, has the right mix of familiar faces, on-screen chemistry, humor, gun fights and action. Intriguing character connections makes me wish there would be a spin off series diving into the character's individual stories more in depth. Bogue, the villain, is despised from the opening of the movie and one only hopes there will be some type of ""reckoning."" A great mix of the classic battle of good versus evil, the tycoon vs the commoner, the lengths that greed and corruption will take a person, and those good men who are willing to fight for those less fortunate. This version is even better than the original. The cast gels, the scenery is stunning, and the Seven are all experts in their craft---the killing of bad guys. A great western!""I seek righteousness, as should we all. But in this case I'll take revenge.""",The Magnificent Seven

329,Enthusiastic_Viewer,Beautiful band of misfits,7,16 February 2017,"After finally taking the time to watch the film, I was overall pleased with it. I've never seen the original but i enjoyed this one enough to find it and watch it. There were a few reasons I enjoyed it, starting with the fact that it was your typical western movie but it wasn't typical at the same time. It was your typical western story of a business man taking over a village for gold or oil whatever it may be and here comes ""the new sheriff in town"" if you will, to save the day. Now what sets this one apart from the others I've seen, is the level of comedy brought to it. Cue this combination of seven misfits/outlaws that Denzel manages to scrounge together. Although they had everything in the world against them, the writer didn't make the movie too serious. Funny jokes and stories, and sometimes you just look at the character and can't help but smirk. Even with all the comedy, in the end you still get that sense of satisfaction you're looking for all the while, upset about the ones who died. Another reason I enjoyed this movie was the actors/ actresses cast in their respectful roles. I feel as if everyone played their part exceptionally well. Glad Denzel finally got to star in a western. I've said this before and I've never been let down, I've never seen a movie that Mr Washington plays in the i don't like. They may not be great films, but they are all 6 stars or better. I though every cast member just fit the character they were playing. All in all, I enjoyed this movie, and i would highly recommend anyone to watch this movie even if you don't enjoy westerns. Now if you do enjoy classic westerns you may not enjoy this one because it doesn't necessarily fit the mold of your typical western...",The Magnificent Seven
330,mspradeesh786,The sleeper,3,16 December 2016,"Well...To start with ..I am a fan of westerns!! After watching Django and Yuma...This is the last thing to happen to western genre movies. The only flaw in this movie is that they choose Denzel Washington in an inappropriate role.It was better to put an aging Clint Eastwood to essay the role of Denzel. Just one character spoiled the whole effort. With such support production, they should have chosen the right actor for the lead role.Denzel sucks as a cowboy!!!! The lips-the body language ain't have the soul of a cowboy while all others gave a riveting performance. When they were making a remake movie which have had a cult of kind-I wonder the producers could not find an apt actor to play the role of Denzel!!! And above all....Some actors age with grace...for the least at least Denzel should have had a second thought about acting in such movies knowing that Western ain't his forte. I would say they made this movie for Denzel Washington while the whole concept should have been....The Magnificent six!!!",The Magnificent Seven
331,OrigKRN,Ehhh good but not great...,7,9 October 2016,"The movie was pretty good overall. It was a great western movie, with a great cast. The story itself was very simple, but interesting and it kept you on edge.Action and characters were portrayed well. Each actor did a excellent job. The scenery was pretty accurate. It made you believe you were actually in a western town. Besides this though, there wasn't really anything more. Now there were many downsides to this movie. The movie was fast paced, which kept you going. Which was good, the problem was it felt like the movie was cramped in. They should've made the movie longer. It felt like everything was rushed. The director should've focus more on the details. It didn't really show more specific parts that could've made the movie better. Everything was happening too quick. Movie should've slowed down and taken some time to really show what the scene was about. Instead it zoomed passed it. In the end, the movie wasn't great but not bad. Thus earning a 7 star rating.",The Magnificent Seven

High intensity of violence & bang-bang makes your eyeballs glued to the screen & pumps your blood twice faster.

333,JMCReelReviews,A cliché-laden nod to the genre.,6,8 January 2017,"Antoine Fuqua teams directs this re-telling of The Magnificent Seven which sees Denzel Washington take on Yul Brynner's iconic man-in-black character, who gathers together a rag-tag group in order to help the residents of a small town fight back against those determined to drive them off their land. Fuqua begins his version with a sense of drama and violence. Indeed, no sooner does the film begin that we are rattled by a series of explosions which serve as the foundations for the violence and action that is to come. We soon meet the villain of the piece, superbly played by Sarsgaard who somehow manages to convey a restrained yet maniacal, unhinged menace. He outlines (or rather reaffirms) his intentions to the townsfolk with great intimidation, leading to a gunfight which results in the townsfolk searching for help. It's a captivating start and rolls along at pace. However, at over two hours long, this pace was unfortunately unsustainable. It's a slow middle section whilst we are introduced to each of the group. Some have more screen time than others, yet this does not necessarily correspond with the amount of character development they each receive. It's a frustrating and inconsistent period as we slowly meet each member one by one, all of whom proving difficult to relate to or care much about.The final third sees the gang setting about making their mark in the town and ruffling lots of feathers, leading to an epic onslaught from Sarsgaard's hired guns during an absolutely relentless sequence of events, superbly constructed by Fuqua who never lets up on the action or violence. It's undoubtedly the reward of the piece, so much so that it makes the first two thirds almost forgettable. However, what follows is a rather flat closing which sadly serves as a reminder of the various flaws of the picture.The biggest of these is that this is little more than a Western cliché. We have the close-ups of the eyes made iconic by Clint Eastwood, a saloon full of people stopping to turn and look at the stranger at the swinging doors. We have the inept Sheriff, a Comanche vs Comanche fight and even people riding off into the sunset. Indeed, one would be forgiven in thinking that Fuqua had a checklist of characters formed as a result of watching too many Westerns. Aside from the aforementioned we also have Chris Pratt's Faraday as a card-sharp, Hawke's Robicheaux as the war veteran and Vincent D'Onofrio's Jack Horne as a mountain-man.Clichés and stereotypes aside, there are plenty of solid performances here. Hawke and Pratt certainly stood out but Hayley Bennett deserves an awful lot of praise, too. Her role is a pivotal one and in such a male dominated film, it's extremely refreshing to see such a strong female character hold her own amongst them and of course to see a young actress do the same amongst some of Hollywood's heavyweights. A fantastic score helped add to the frantic action and also lift the slower elements of the film. The performances and chemistry amongst the main cast added a healthy dose of humour, and the action was fantastic. Whilst there is certainly plenty here to be enjoyed, it loses its way with an overlong running time, poor characterisation, inconsistent pacing and a cliché-laden nod to the genre.For the full review, and further movie reviews, please visit: https://www.facebook.com/JMCReelReviews/",The Magnificent Seven
334,Partnerfrankreich,A much more than adequate reboot,8,2 November 2021,"I saw the film with a lot of trepidation beforehand - ""Oh, for heaven's sake, a remake of the classic 19060 film for the ""woke"" generation, with a corrupt white businessman as the villain and a sampling of every oppressed minority group as the heroes; who needs that?""Guess what? I was dead wrong.Yes, of course, the film DOES play on the ""woke generation's"" sensibilities, with the heroes including a black man, a Chinese-American, a Native American, a Mexican and a woman who by her own statement has ""more balls"" than the men in the town, and a white male villain who is the epitome of ""bad guy"" capitalism.But the villain is grounded in actual history (the land wars, much as did ""Shane"" in its day. More importantly, the film does a damn good job as a standalone Western, with some excellent action scenes that make you cheer for the heroes, and an introductory scene that really does make you hate the villain and long for his defeat -- in other words, it's a classic ""good guys against bad guys"" story that is the heart of any good Western.I give it eight out of ten, and deduct the two points only because, as good as it is, it doesn't quite stand up either to the original 1960's film (pretty hard to top Yul Brynner and Steve McQueen) or the film that inspired both of them, Seven Samurai.",The Magnificent Seven
335,walter2-407-597390,Much better than I expected,9,26 September 2016,"I loved the original, and I couldn't picture how this cast was going to equal the performances of Yul Brenner, Steve McQueen, Eli Wallach, Charles Bronson and the rest.Happily for my ticket price, the movie is similar but different, so there was no tired copy or rehash of the first movie, but something new and interesting with its own great moments and acting. In fact, this is FAR better than the earlier remake attempts like ""return of the magnificent seven"" and the ""magnificent seven ride!"", and so forth, which are truly mediocre.I liked this new cast, and everyone was at the top of their game, so I never felt for a moment that this didn't have everyone's full attention, and that they were determined to make the very best movie possible. For real interest, a good villain is required, and Sarsgaard really delivers a great performance, you are really going to hate him. I liked Washington and especially Pratt's performances, but nobody in this movie was poorly cast or badly acted. the music isn't quite as strong as the original, but I did note they used the original score to close the movie credits, which was a nice touch.Antoine Fuqua is a terrific director (I loved Replacement Killers), and he delivered a great story and performances from everyone. It can't have been easy trying to ""re-make"" this classic movie, and he really delivered, for which I am most grateful, as a bad version would have been deeply disappointing and irritating.Really worth the ticket price, so go to it as a fresh story, and you will be impressed.",The Magnificent Seven
336,jamesart-439-537740,"Middle of the road adaption, with modern action sequencing.",6,1 August 2017,"This remake of The Magnificent Seven is bogged down by some weird vibe I had trouble putting my finger on. Overall it should have been great,but left me underwhelmed.I thought that maybe my memories of the original had been brightened by youth and time, so I went back and re-watched it.And while watching the original it hit me. The characters in this remake are simply poorly defined and with little depth. Hell, even their appearance was similar, with this modern trend of half whiskers/stubble, tending to help blend the characters as well.In the original every character was brightly defined and very individual.With this new one I found I ended up not really caring about them at all. The one with potential was Ethan Hawkes character, but they whipped past his death as if it were nothing.In the end I think it really comes down to knowing the art of good story telling.The original did it extremely well and told us a grand tale of interesting folks. This new one did it less well and told us about some things some guys did.",The Magnificent Seven

I have watched The Seven Samurai and the original Magnificent Seven and I must say, this made quite a justice. Who said Chris Pratt could only play Star Lord when he is made for the west. 2nd half literally steals the show. I completely here disagree with the critics giving this a lower rating. Complete entertainment, complete swagger. Denzel Washington just nailed it but, it was Chris Pratt, and Vincent D' Onofrio who stole the show. Antonie Fuqua gave a perfect tribute to the likes of Akira Kurosawa, John Ford, and John Sturges. Believe me, this one's really good.

340,wulfthar,Remarkably unremarkable remake made like a old John Wayne western,3,24 September 2016,"The Era of remakes in Hollywood never ends: this time it was the turn of the Magnificent Seven. Not that is a bad thing per se, actually the classic movie of the 60s was a remake of Kurosawa's the Seven Samurais, but this time the result is very different. From a technical point of view the cinematography is indeed good, but it looks like the ""reimagination"" of the Wild West that was in auge in Hollywood in the 40s and 50s, before the Spaghetti Western and the consequential revisionist westerns of the 70s: the costumes are nothing like the fashion of the XIXth century,we have scarfs, open shirts and waistcoats like at the time of John Ford...that is a big step backward for the genre IMO. Besides that the story at the beginning follows the original but the directors decided to add more or less all the Old West stereotypes taken from other movies, in particular the revenge theme of Once upon a time in the West, the situation of the village recalls more closely High plans drifter than the original(s)...besides the population actively helping the seven. Instead of a band of Mexican masnadieros we have a filthy rich psychopath that remembers a little Gary Oldman's character in Leon or Satan in Constantine, in short too cartoonish to be interesting. The battle takes inspiration from the Wild Bunch plus dynamite and a Gatling gun that has a range of a 12 pounder gun that makes it a parody for what should be. Regarding the cast they all try to do their best with the little material given but Denzel Washington is far from his prime (the 90s) and Ethan Hawke looks like a man in his 60s. In conclusion the new Magnificent Seven is a big disappointment that brings back the Western to the 50s, recent movies like Appaloosa or the remake of 3:10 to Yuma were much better and more entertaining.",The Magnificent Seven
341,lom83,A decent modern Western watch,8,10 February 2019,"I found this film tense and gripping, with slick gun fight scenes that were well choreographed. There's nice cinematography with some good aerial shots of the landscape.The background music was judged well - it wasn't too loud or overbearing, nor was it lacking.I thought it was an engrossing and atmospheric watch for the most part. However, there was the ocassional cliched accent which I didn't like too much but otherwise, its a good tense watch. Some of the plot details were perhaps slightly simplistic but that aside I very much enjoyed it. Would I recommend it? yes I would - its not perfect but its pretty decent. Also, I haven't seen the original film, so I can't comment on it in terms of it being a remake.",The Magnificent Seven

There are no unsurprising surprises, the characters are all pretty much stock-in-trade, the outcome not unpredictable and the baddie does have a 'magic wand, make my monster grow' moment. So don't go and see it if you seek novelty. On the other hand if you want to see a slew of actors at the top of their game playing gnarly old stagers who are hard as feck, shooting bad guys, you can't go far wrong. Good movie.As an addendum I went to see it a second time, and I enjoyed it even more. The thing was, I wasn't sat through the film waiting for Elmer Bernstein's theme to kick in, so had more time to enjoy the humour which actually dominates the first half of the film, and the absolutely sumptuous filming of people's faces, I have never seen a film like it for taking such interesting visages and highlighting them in such fascinating detail.",The Magnificent Seven

344,alfiemachin,Action Packed but Poorly Plotted,6,6 October 2016,"The Good: The magnificent seven included visually stunning camera shots, which are especially noticeable in the opening and ending and generally throughout the film. I believe they did a good job on recreating the bad ass western feel by having intense and fast action and various standoffs here and there,The setting was portrayed very well in most scenes with open fields for travels on horse and isolated towns with the classic bar on a corner of the center of a settlement,However a few long shots made me notice how many buildings were suspiciously freshly painted and could've been made a little more worn down for a better realistic feel.The acting and character creations were formed very well. The main villain is seen as a rich coward who is pure evil and has no care but for himself, which is something that isn't commonly used in recent films but fits this movie incredibly well.All 7 of the main characters possessed unique looks and talents involving their combat style and the film made a good job of covering each character with enough detail so that they weren't an outsider that viewers wouldn't take much notice to. Chisolm played by Denzel Washington and Josh Faraday played by Chris Pratt were the most important part of this group which is made very clear. But each character had memorable and smartly pulled scenes which made fantastic entrances towards their backgrounds.The Bad: The idea of modernizing a classic western means this film has a very predictable and overused plot. There is a large amount of scenes in which you know what will happen next or later on in the film which can potentially spoil it for you if you are especially into a strong story-line. There are very little plot twists and all in all is very basic story. Although the native American was a completely awesome fighter and pulled off various bad ass scenes of fighting. I was hoping to see a bigger background behind him involving what he had been through before he encounter the group.Another addition that should've been made was creating a bigger amount of chemistry and relation between the group. There was very little scenes in which the they were all sat together and bonding and those type of scenes are needed in order to build the characters and create bigger emotions and relationships between the viewers and characters in the movie. Summary: This film is definitely good if you're into action packed movies but not suitable if you're looking for a new and original concept to the western genre.",The Magnificent Seven

Wow, i almost wet my pants by excitement, especially since i have a weak spot for Western aswell.But just watching the opening scene feels gave my doubts, it just felt cringe and sloppy. And something that had been done way to many times before.The movie introduces the characters without giving them any real backtstory, and even thou i love the thought of a band of renegades coming together to fight a impossible villain. You just dont get the band of renegade feeling like say Braveheart.The gang just comes together way to easy, willing to risk their lifes without any real motivation except that maybe all of them are lost, thou Denzel does not do that much to prove that he is a inspirational leader that people follow to the end of the world like say Mel Gibson in Braveheart as another example.So the first hour of the movie just feels scripted, no real dialogue or character development. Its first when their lifes are on the line that they actually start to have deeper conversations.No real dynamic between any of the actors, and that is with two actors who actually did Training Day together. I mean just hearing ""my man"" onetime would have done it for me
The kind of roles that makes Denzel in his essence is when he gets to play this ruthless conflicted man who is kind of forced to act as a saviour, like for example: Man on Fire or Equalizer, or just ruthless like in Training day or American Gangster. And unfortunately he is made up to be a soft kitten in this movie, just give him something new to work on, make him the Villain atleast to spice it up a bit!I am constantly in between if this movie is a Comedy or more adventure drama, the main characters mostly act silly in their each manners: Pratt is a drunk, Donofrio speaks with a strange voice in his intro, Hawke is way to toned down and lost.Not much feels new and none of the characters really feels interesting.And so the whole story goes, its all been done before, and better aswell.",The Magnificent Seven

Today, this town is fighting the 'evil corporate guy.' He's a mine owner who walks slow and has an Army of mean white males. Normally, small towns are thrilled to have a corporate guy who brings jobs. Keep the movie at plain old bandits. Don't trying to give a message like a Liberal Democratic Senator.

351,holybagpipes-6-153560,Not Magnificent,4,2 October 2016,"This didn't even come close to the westerns of the 1950's to the 1970's. John Wayne is probably rolling in his grave. Nor did it come close to the remakes like 3:10 to Yuma or Tombstone. Nor does it come close to Free State of Jones released this year too.Another comment says ""Diversity 7"" and that's dead on. This rendition is just too unrealistic for the American period of 1880's that it doesn't make it enjoyable for a die hard western fan. It's an action film set in western time, not a western film with action.Even the accent and delivery of lines from Chisum had too many similarities to Bart's delivery in Mel Brook's Blazing Saddles. I was waiting for the line, ""'cuse me while I whip this out."" Even the town's name is similar to Mel Brook's Rock Ridge. The unrealistic bringing together of Doc (Doc Holiday), Billy the Kid, Chisum, and others took away any sense of reality. The use of weapons for that time period is unrealistic too.John Wayne's Chisum was actually a pretty accurate movie to the history of the Lincoln County War. But this movie isn't about it at all. The Magnificent Seven is actually a Samurai movie from Japan that was remade into a western. This doesn't even come close to those two classics.

353,andyrew670,It's good... enough.,7,12 October 2016,"I'm not a huge fan of Antoine Fuqua, but he has his moments. This is one of those movies of his that's just fun, and very well-made, but just sort of everything I've come to expect. From the way he shoots, to his character development, it all can feel sorta choppy to me. Do not get me wrong though, the movie is still very fun.I don't want this review to be based purely from a narrative perspective, because at the end of the day, this is a remake of a remake we are dealing with here, so we know it's more about the $. So I will give it it's credit where it's due, it's action can be BREATHTAKING at times. In fact, I'm going to make an early prediction that it's gonna be nominated for a fair share of ""technical"" Oscars, maybe even win for sound design. I thought that the actors, too did very well with their parts, especially Ethan Hawke, who shined for me PERSONALLY. It's popcorn fun, with little depth, but that's what I thought it would be when I went into it, so at least I wasn't expecting anything more.

357,sleeplessdave_2000,Not Magnificent But Certainly Not Bad,7,26 September 2016,"Hollywood has gone so remake crazy that it is literally eating its own tail at this point. There may be multiple versions of every movie ever made in a decade, but of all the ridiculous, stupid, and offensive attempts to present a new take on a classic film, The Magnificent Seven is not an offender. The original film with Yul Bruyner is now 56 years old, the Western genre is much better at remakes/reinventions than most (True Grit, for example), and this isn't an attempt to update or override the classic. The 1960 film is, itself, a reinterpretation of Akira Kurosawa's The Seven Samurai, so unlike most remakes, this story has already lent itself to reinterpretation. It's a Magnificent Seven for a new generation, and while it's not quite magnificent, it is enjoyable.With the town of Rose Creek under the deadly control of industrialist Bartholomew Bogue (Peter Sarsgaard), the desperate townspeople employ protection from seven outlaws, bounty hunters, gamblers and hired guns – Sam Chisolm (Denzel Washington), Josh Farraday (Chris Pratt), Goodnight Robicheaux (Ethan Hawke), Jack Horne (Vincent D'Onofrio), Billy Rocks (Byung-Hun Lee), Vasquez (Manuel Garcia-Rulfo), and Red Harvest (Martin Sensmeier). As they prepare the town for the violent showdown that they know is coming, these seven mercenaries find themselves fighting for more than money (summary from IMDb).How much does The Magnificent Seven of Denzel Washington and Chris Pratt resemble that of Yul Bruyner and Steve McQueen? Very little. There are plenty of nods to the film, but the character names are different, the town's predicament is different, and our band of seven is decidedly more multicultural than the 1960 version (not a criticism). Our 2016 band of seven is comprised of a Mexican outlaw, an African- American ""duly-sworn warrant officer"", a rogue Comanche, an Asian knife wielder, an Irishman, a ex-Confederate sniper with PTSD, and Vincent D'Onofrio who is just crazy (Pratt describes him as ""a bear wearing human clothes""). You can roll your eyes at the diversity, but it's a strong ensemble of actors with extremely memorable characters, and I care a lot more about the quality of the acting and the character than I do the historical logistics of group assemblage. The woman who goes to bring help (Haley Bennett) also plays a much stronger role in both the story and the fighting than in the 1960 film.There's real camaraderie among the Seven, and the actors are all clearly enjoying playing their roles to the hilt. Denzel can often just play himself in films, but he creates a fully fleshed out character in Sam Chisolm. A lot of people were concerned from the trailers that Chris Pratt was going to turn this into a comedy. Look, Pratt can act (Moneyball, Zero Dark Thirty, performing acrobatics to try to cover Jurassic World's whopping plot holes). He's certainly funny in the film, but it's part of his character's personality, and most of the Seven enjoy cracking wise. Ethan Hawke turns in the best performance I've seen from him in a long time, but there's not a weak link in our group of motley crusaders.Peter Sarsgaard definitely gives you a villain to hate from the film's opening scene in the mining baron Barton Bogue. He's got some great monologues and Sarsgaard plays him with a sort of laconic, self- assured power cum evil that makes you want him dead as badly as the town and the Seven (some of which have personal scores with Bogue). So we have a great cast, great performances, a pretty strong script, and a lovely score from the late James Horner (his final, tragically). So why isn't this a better movie than it should be? The director: Antoine Fuqua.Actors and directors often form working partnerships, but I wish Washington wasn't so tied to Fuqua. Perhaps it's because he directed Denzel to his long-overdue Best Actor Oscar for Training Day, but Fuqua is an average director at best with a penchant for making films that are overlong (sometimes agonizingly overlong in cases). A better director would have tightened the film, because even though he does direct a magnificently choreographed war between the town and Bogue's forces at the end that feels like old-school Western brought into the 21st Century, the film still leaves you squirming in your seat at 133 minutes. Additionally, much of the punch of the film's ending (no spoilers) is derailed by an overly precious coda that delays a wonderful credits sequence in which Elmer Bernstein's classic theme is used in full-force for the first time. Horner wove bits of it through the score, but never goes flat-out until the credits (much like Michael Giacchino treated his 2011's Star Trek score). It's Horner's best score since A Beautiful Mind in 2001, and makes his death in a plane crash last year all the more melancholy.Despite being an imperfect updating of the classic, The Magnificent Seven is still very much worth seeing, especially for fans of the Western genre. It lacks strong direction, but ultimately the performances overcome the flaws, and the final battle is one for the ages.",The Magnificent Seven
358,flintridge0503,Better Than the Original? Thats a Big NO,3,28 September 2016,"Hollywood, you do not take a classic film and do a lackluster job and make it worst. You try to transcend. It's lazy Hollywood all over again. The script makes no attempt to develop any of the characters and what we get is a piece of hollow action flick with no substance to it. Hollywood thinks we are all sheep and simply throw away our hard earned money to them. They insult our intelligence over and over again with remakes of great classics promising to be better than the original. Once in a blue moon they succeed but not this time! Don't waste your money. Wait for it to go on DVD or watch it free if you can. Better yet, watch the classic Magnificent 7 with Yul Brynner and you will see how much better that one is to the remake.

361,stickman007,Where is John Woo when you need him?,3,24 September 2016,"Saw this last night and did not have to spend money on a ticket. If you want to see this movie I strongly suggest you try the same. Please help strike a blow against the gratuitous spending coming out of Hollywood.I'll avoid all the talk about this flick being a sequel to this or that or what genre it actually tries to represent because, to me anyway, this movie is all about spending 100 million dollars to cram every cliché you ever saw into an action/drama/comedy/morality play/western film, & then name it after another(kinda boring but considered classic)western film and advertise it mercilessly until it becomes the next ""must see"" event.First off, the script is pretty much ALL wisecracks with special attention to diversity, (nothing TOO racist tho). Chris Pratt excels at this btw. Denzel himself is either bored or trying to channel Tony Anthony. We also get the slob, the noble warrior, the ninja, etc etc. You know the drill by now. The townsfolk are the familiar lickspittles, except for the aggrieved heroine, natch. The villain is laughably awful. Fugua had a chance here with Sarsgaard as Bogue, but turns him into a screaming slobbering joke. I'm surprised he didn't ride into town in a BMW with a Rolex on his wrist & yakking on his cell. He's certainly got enough product in his hair to audition for a runway model. Is this what Fugua thinks epitomizes the evil 1 per cent? I had to wince every time Bogue appeared on screen and couldn't help thinking of Gabriele Ferzetti and his wonderful performance in ONCE UPON A TIME IN THE WEST as Morton,the conflicted railroad baron. This M7 is so corny.The shootouts are well filmed tho, (hey, 100 million $$$) but after the first 20 or 30 killings Fugua musta got bored and decides to throw in gatling guns and dynamite. No tanks this time apparently. Then a few more hundred stuntmen die while Fugua ponders his next effort, EXPENDABLES 4.Bottom line... 3 stars for set design, correct period bangers and non wire fu stunts. So then. If you are a movie fan who can't wait for TRANSFORMERS #12 where I think they destroy every city on earth & then crack the world in half you will probably like THE MAGNIFICENT 7.

362,pablospersonal,The Magnificent......first half,7,23 September 2016,"Westerns are a funny genre. Very hit and miss! The 50's and 60's were littered with them, most are forgettable. Some stay in the mind and wind up in your DVD collection. John Sturges Magnificent Seven is one of those that ended up in the DVD collection. Brynner, McQueen, Bronson, Wallach, Coburn, Vaughn, Buchholz and Dexter brought to life a western movie that would be etched into the 'Classic' movie category in HMV. Story about a small town being pestered by a bad guy, then saved by 7 lovable rogues strikes a certain chord, that warms the cockles. This version had the exact same story - no surprise there. Denzel Washington, heads the stellar cast as Sam Chisolm. A bounty hunter with a heart. Chris Pratt has an excellent turn as Josh Farraday, Gambler and gunslinger with some cheeky and charming wit. Ethan Hawke plays his character, Goodnight Robicheaux, with fervor and heart. The support in Vincent D'onforio, Byung-hun lee, Manuel Garcia-Ruflo, Martin Sensmeier and Hayley Bennett is fabulous. There didn't seem to be much to complain about. In fact when the movie started, it felt like we were set up for an absolute epic remake - that for once would bring justice to the original. The story ran smooth, character introduction and development was great. The dialogue was smooth and charming. I sat, firmly planted in the Seat, not caring that cramp had infected my entire right leg. The movie had a jovial quality and enough atmosphere to keep you staring at the screen. It didn't take itself too seriously, but was serious enough for you to be serious - about the film. The plot seemed to flow well and there weren't any parts that seemed to drag and make you wish you had gone to see Bridget Jones instead. You would be happy you were sat there!Then, it happened, it cracked under its own pressure. Like the Birthday cake your sister wants you to make from ice cream wafers and lead. The second half of the movie starts to fall apart, it really takes your eye from the game. And this is the real shame about it. The end battle between the townsfolk and Peter Saragaard's posse is over run. The flow stops and frankly is a bit dull. You want something to happen. You are watching some action but you kind of want it to end and quickly. Character deaths seem a bit pointless and not very heart wrenching. You start to feel a bit annoyed, like someone has run over your foot with a milk float. Not painful but you feel it burn. Then it ends and it really is poor. I was relieved and disheartened by the pointless monologue leading to the final credits - mushy nonsense that didn't need to be there. I am going to stop for a moment and just mention Peter Saragaard's performance. Pants! Pants with itching powder in them. He is miscast in this movie, he overacts movement and dialogue. He is about as menacing as the guy at McDonalds whom you argue with because your Big Mac has a cocktail stick in the middle. He is the low point of this movie. This movie would have been far better had someone older and earthier played the bad guy. Someone, who you know would tear your eyelids off and replace them with fear. This wasn't the case. His scenes were tedious to view. Apart from that, the film was good. Ha, sounds like I hate it. I did enjoy parts of the movie and to be honest worth a watch. Just be prepared to be a bit frustrated. The most frustrating element of this film is the knowledge that you know this could have been epic. It was set up to be epic and almost succeeded. But it fell flat. Don't watch the original and then watch this. Watch this, then revisit the original. That way you will feel better. A shame really because it had such huge promise. The 7 are great and they are worth watching the movie if for nothing else.",The Magnificent Seven

Anyone who is a fan of Westerns knows just how many good westerns are out there compared to ""all"" westerns out there in the world. So finding a good one - mark it - keep it - love it! So this movie is a must for any ""Western"" fans out there. I would suggest watching the old one first - because after all this is a remake! And a remake of a movie which, when it was made, followed a different formula to today's westerns. So please do not expect to see 'an Oscar winning drama which delves deeply into the mind of a desperate man during desperate times' - because this isn't that type of western. It's a spaghetti western, where the good guys fight the bad guys, and there is no gray area! Which brings me to my second point - not exactly rehashed! And it's great! The differences are welcomed - especially in the characters of the Magnificent Seven. The Story fundamentals are the same, as is the plot, but the everything else is not what you expect. Which is refreshing! There is plenty of action & enough one-liners! So I would put this on par with ""Quick and the Dead"".

Although Denzel is very good, his character is too much of a superhero to be taken seriously. As for the rest of the ""Seven"", it's only D'onornio who shines through with any acting honors, as everyone else is miscast. As for the movie plot itself, it simply steals ideas and characters from several other films i.e., Hawkes' mimics Dennis Quaid's ""Doc Holliday"" character, and the rest of the cast appears to be based upon the sturdy western, ""The Professionals"", right down to the bow and arrow expert. In short, there is nothing new or creative here, just more of the over the top, unbelievable special effects, such as the Seven never missing a shot against the baddies. In the original, you cared about the Seven, all of them, and were hoping against hope none of them would die. In this pale remake, their characters are so undefined you just don't care.

366,Wavester,Not sure what movie the nay sayers saw on here..,8,21 February 2018,"I am seeing a lot of negative reviews for this film on here and I must say I am puzzled. This was a high action remake that in many ways was better then the original. Let me say first that the orig. M7 eluded me for a long time and I finally got to see it from beginning to end uninterrupted just last year and found it enjoyable, but I was left with a lot of questions after watching it and in some ways the plot didn't make sense. So with the orig., in a nutshell:1. Bad guys bother villagers.
2. Villagers fed up get good guys to help.
3. Good guys teach villagers to defend themselves.
4. Good guys and villagers fight off first wave of bad guys.
5. Villagers don't want good guys anymore.
6. Bad guys return, and in uncharacteristic manner, let good guys go
 to town limits and give them their weapons back.
7. And here is the most puzzling - Good guys return, even though the villagers don't want them anymore, and even though their lives were spared by the bad guys, kill all the bad guys and get 4 out of 7 of themselves killed...for what?And this is the plot everyone is defending on here with the nostalgia look at the old M7 when reviewing the new M7? Pulease.Those making the claim that the orig. was SO much better, might need to see the original again. Good Movie yes (besides what I pointed out above) but it too WAY too long and the pace was just too slow. This new movie has a steady pace and easy to follow.This movie was a refreshing look @ M7, which had me hoping that they make a remake of the ""Return of the M7"" but seeing the money it made that probably wont happen.Solid action western you need to see. Something tells me you will enjoy it more if you didn't see the original (esp. if it has been a long time since you've seen it) without all the nostalgia :-)",The Magnificent Seven

I enjoy Denzel as a strong African American presence in the wild west.

My 15 year old daughter, who enjoys what most 15 year old girls like, watched this from start to finish and liked it (probably Chris Pratt). I'm not big on remakes but this one is pretty alright. There are people that complain that the movie is predictable and I say to them, it's a remake. So take it for what it's worth.This is an excellent remake of a really great movie with great actors. It follows along the original with a better pace and some character differences. I like the idea more than the original because it's not seven white guys. They mixed it up with a native, Mexican, some white guys, and Denzel (of course) that are all tough guys with a skill for killing tougher guys. So in a nut shell, a town is in danger from some bad guys. The town gets some of their own bad guys to help out. Number one being Sam (Denzel) a kind of ""bounty hunter"" that starts pulling together a posse. None of them are really doing it for money but they all have their reasons. All of them lethal.The cast is great. The film lays out the characters quickly, the action kicks off instantly, and the pace continues. If you enjoy westerns with good bad guys and better bad asses then you will enjoy this film. No attempt to change the story and wow you. The wow is how well the director and new cast did justice to a great movie with an equal quality cast of its time.

In the whole history of Western Genre, which had dived in to the pages of film history starting from 1930's, I have not seen a character like Chris Pratt. OK, when you consider the factor of modern day audience, maybe they had to make Chris Pratt perform this role. This movie would not make it to anywhere with the conventional features of the Western Genre today. Chris Pratt was needed in that manner, you need the funny guy if you want your movie to be watched and make money. That is a way of looking at it from the creators point of view. (!!!Spoiler!!!) Maybe that is why, we also witnessed a bizarre ending. Modern day applications. Because in the Western Genre, there has to be a reason, characters do not risk their lives for money, that happens in the Gangster Genre, and believe me Chris Pratt would play a very good mafia role, so good that, people would have make his pictures their wallpapers in his mafia costume. But that is not the case in this movie neither in this genre. The topic is, this movie is not exactly Western. The most important thing, revenge is in the movie, yes, but you can not feel it when there is a funny guy and a fat guy making weird stuff to make people laugh. More than half of the characters do not belong to the movie. They do not want to take revenge. There are only two people who wants to take revenge, Denzel Washington with a spectacular performance. He could have perform easily in the best Western movies in the history of the genre. He clearly has an aim, he wants revenge. You can see that. Also, Emma, obviously wants to take revenge and she fits in to the story as a woman which is a bit unusual. ( Please do not take this comment wrong, but in the history of the genre, women do not exactly play a big role, I am not trying to make a sexist comment) I guess this is one of the good sides of the modern day Western. Overall, despite the big flows on the story, it is worth seeing.",The Magnificent Seven
382,windgeisel,"Not magnificent, but entertaining",8,5 October 2016,"They are riding again. The Magnificent Seven are reborn in a cloud of dust and smoke. This movie is good old Western mixed with a scent of modern Action.The roles are written so well for the whole cast, you can't imagine other actors. Especially Washington, Pratt and Hawke just nailed it. But also the rest of the multi-cultural 'bunch' does a great job.This is one of the interesting changes you may recognize during the movie. The original from 1960 wasn't manned that colorful. Although historical this is totally correct. A crew like that, back in these years would definitely look like a big cultural mix. Personal I think this is a good change for a Hollywood-movie. I only missed a good score. There where many moments i thought, this could use some more of the original Bernstein-score, ore maybe some old school Ennio Morricone.But it's unnecessary comparing this movie and the original, or even the original of the original, ""Seven Samurai"" from 1954. A similar plot of cause, but that's it.In the end it's a pretty entertaining movie, with a great cast. It's dirty, gritty, brutal... but also hilarious and touching. Of all those reboots and remakes of this year, this movie kinda shines through. For me this is a big surprise and I'm really looking forward to watch this movie again.Peace and so long",The Magnificent Seven

There was however one leprechaun in the movie but he was unfortunately not one of the 7 dwarfs.

384,scottlindquist,Welcome Back to the Old West,8,23 September 2016,"The Magnificent Seven is an excellent movie for what it is trying to be - an old school western. The modern western began, largely, with Unforgiven (1992). Prior to Unforgiven, there had not been a successful western at the box office for several years. But, with that film, Clint Eastwood, created a very dark, very dramatic western that was more of a character study than an action film. For this re-imagination of the genre, the film was rewarded with 4 Oscars, including Best Picture and Best Director. What has come since then is, predictably, a number of attempts to recapture that style with dramatic, character driven westerns - Open Range, 3:10 to Yuma, and the True Grit remake come to mind. This movie, on the other hand, is anything but a character study.With The Magnificent Seven remake, director Antoine Fuqua, clearly decides to keep with the style of the original 1960 film, which was itself a remake of the Kurosawa classic, The Seven Samurai. After an incredibly tense opening, the remaining first third of the film is a slow buildup (perhaps a little too slow for some viewers), as the director introduces the main characters. However, once the full, namesake team is in place, and arrives to the town they have been hired to defend, the film is a tense, action thrill ride for the remainder. For those who are fans of old style, shoot-em up westerns, or simply a fan of action movies with nasty villains and clever one- liners, this film will not disappoint. The final 20+ minutes are a tense, edge of your seat, non-stop shoot out.",The Magnificent Seven

John Sturges created the english story ""The MAgnificent Seven"" with Yule Brenner in the lead role, and maintained the legendary status of the original in a new country language and genre.
The basic story has been taken up in multiple genre's with varying degrees of success.Although there are several quite capable performers involved in this production, it becomes the 'Lifetime Channel' version of its glorious predecessors; relying on the reputation of the original Elmer Bernstein score to sell the feeling of the original western, regardless of what else we see and hear.Elememts of the rewritten story are just plain silly. Seminoles in Texas is just the first obvious sillyness. The dialog is mostly meaningless banter attempting to endear the characters to the vuewer without any real subtlety.Watchable if you ignore the attempt to claim the glory of its predecessors, and don't mind the bland character of the production and direction.",The Magnificent Seven

No character development which in turn gives no reasons why these men would act the way they do. This mainly because there's virtually no interaction with the people they are supposed to protect. In the end just some random all be it entertaining shoot-outs. Crazy also how politically (and don't get me wrong, you can even argue historical) correct the diversity of the cast is, but the townsfolk are again all white, even the slaves working in the mines?

388,drostjosh,It did not quite live up to its name.,6,28 September 2016,"Magnificent 7 follows the story of a town that is being taken over by a greedy gang boss which fights back by hiring Denzel Washington and his crew of dead shots. The crew had a whole range of characters from the stoic Asian, the goofy drunk, the jolly fat guy and the stoic native American.The strengths of this film come in the scenery and the action. It was shot in the plains, near the mountains and it was beautiful. There are many shots of people riding horses through beautiful backdrops. The action was also well done with physical effects and well directed fights and shooting. The crew did a great job acting their parts, especially Denzel Washington and the redhead.The weakness was that when it got done I felt bored. I didn't really care that much for any of the characters and the movie did not seem fun. It felt like the movie could not decide if it wanted to be fun and lighthearted or serious and emotional and tried to take a middle ground. Group chemistry was also missing. There were hints at points, but at no point did the group feel like a team. All in all it was a decent movie. I do not regret seeing it, but I do not need to see it again.

389,wilkinsonalan-19160,Maybe it was easier to appear magnificent in the nineteenth century.,5,26 September 2016,"No doubt there were some immediate challenges for somebody making this movie. The original was sublime and managed to muster a cadre of actors who were individually unique and complementary. This movie was a brave attempt, but would have needed to be incredible to stand up to the stature of the original.We know the story or something thereabouts. We pretty much know what is going to happen. Therefore, the script needed to be something that could 'stand on its own two legs' whilst the characterisations needed to be extraordinary to hold our interest. The movie ended up being pale beside its predecessor. It felt like a movie that could have been made in the 1960s. We needed something to sizzle, but it just didn't.Possibly, this is a salutary lesson in illustrating that we should leave the great movies alone and invest in something new - and make great, new movies?",The Magnificent Seven

I'm upset that I invested the time watching it, having pulled the DVD out about halfway through.People expecting a script anywhere near the sharpness and wit of the original movie will be sadly disappointed (nothing at like ""When it comes to getting his head blown off, he's downright bigoted!"").It has the digitised feel of a modern movie. Any of you used to the quality of a laserdisc on a decent player will know what I mean.To me, it occupies the same status as the Timothy Dalton Bond movies - they have some merit in their own right, but should not be compared to the originals.It's a shame the actors don't get a say in the editing!",The Magnificent Seven

It's not a great 1960's western, the good news: it's not a bad 2017 western. It's a modernized western with some great character portrayal's.

Some miscasts and lacked scores.,7,23 September 2016,"Honestly, I was very afraid that Hollywood would ruin the classic by just embellishing it with A-List actors and try to make a quick buck from the name.I did not for a second believe they would be able to portray the heart of the original into a remake, I thought they were going to turn it into an ""action flick"" kind of like how they ruined Ben Hur. But I went with an open mind and I have to say, I was blown away. The best thing about this film that set it apart from the other westerns was the pacing. It did NOT drag on, every scene had a purpose and added something to the overall story line. In a lot of westerns you'll have some drawn out scenes that could easily have been edited out of the movie, but it seems like the directors ENHANCED the original product instead of trying to change it. This is what a good remake should do, focus on the previous movie's flaws and make it better, and they did it brilliantly. Extra kudos to Chris Pratt that did a wonderful job as comedy relief, he felt very natural in this role and I do believe he should be nominated for best supporting actor. I did not think Denzel Washington was the best character to play Chisolm, he did not excel in this type of role, but it does not take away from the film. I did expect some more remarkable scores throughout the film, they should have gotten Enio Morricone to do at least one of the scores, although they did utilize the original score in some parts which was very welcoming.",The Magnificent Seven

I did not see the original before so i went into the new one with nothing to expect. After i watched the new one i then found the original on demand so i then watched it. The old one just lacks the impact of the new one. I get it though, it was made in the 60s and the technology back then the stunt work was still very new and it was great for its time but nothing like the shootout done in the new one. The bad guy in the new one is WAY more ruthless and this makes you want to even more see the good guys prevail a few of the lines from Chris Pratt i could of done without but he won me at the end with the one eye jacks loved it.Found it a little hard to believe Chisolm made it threw so clean and was caught off guard with the church scene Ill watch it again for sure",The Magnificent Seven

401,anderspilley,Have a good time with it?,7,3 October 2016,"The Magneficent 7, directed by Antoine FuquaLets get started... First of all this film is defiantly not as bad as people are saying. Rating this film 5 or below is very harsh in my books. Yes, there is not a lot of character development. But substitute that with great action and a fast paced narrative, then you've still got a film that holds together. First things first, do not take this film seriously. People complaining ""ahh that would of never happened"" or ""ahhh he's so over the top"". Just have fun with the characters and action set pieces. I thought the characters were quite good actually. Denzel did a fine job, and Chris Pratt wow! I just love this guy more and more. People say he was too modern for that time, maybe he was. But that still does not take away the enjoyment I had with his gambling character 'Faraday'. So Denzel and Chris were stand out for me. I thought Hawke done a good job as 'Goodnight' and his backstory was quite mysterious and intriguing as well, I just would of liked to explore that more, to really connect with his character. The remaining 4 of the 7 were shall I say 'fine'. They really did not have much development and I couldn't of really cared less for them. But they made the 7 and we go on..The Villain.. Was okay. A very stereotypical bad guy, just think of all the clichés and he's probably got them. Saarsgard was menacing to an extent, we defiantly don't see enough of him to think ""Ooooo this guy is bad ass"" Having said that, the opening scene was pretty exciting. But after that we don't see him enough. The plot is pretty simple. 'This big bad man is terrorizing all the poor village people, and we need 7 men to fight back' Don't expect any major twists or things like that. The Camera work, sound, and mise en scene were amazing. Especially the sound, wow it felt like you was getting shot at. Hats off to Antoine for all of that. Overall, don't go into this film with high expectations. Just have fun with it because I certainly did. The action was great, the music was great and Denzel was great. Yes, its generic and simple. But if it's done well, whats not to like? If you like action movies and westerns you should defiantly give it a watch, if you're just a movie goer, id still say give it a watch.

The cast are tremendous actors, but IMO Vincent D'Onofrio was the star of the show...fantastic acting on his part. Of course, Denzel Washington was a good main character, however, unbelievable given that historically, the west was populated largely by people of Caucasion and Mexican descent. I feel that the casting of mostly minorities was another pathetic attempt at re-writing history with a broad, multi-colored and politically correct brush that is all too common today. This movie largely lacked character development and I wished there was more substance to the film. What can I say? Like many other movies released in the last 10 years, it had plenty of action and fast-moving scenes, but fell short of becoming something memorable. In the end, the script reminded me of the classic A- Team episode, except this team sports cowboy hats and six- shooters.",The Magnificent Seven

I think the diverse and talented cast (and crew) is the best thing this has going for it and why I'm giving it any stars at all. Also, I'm sure the time, effort, work, and money that went into making this was tremendous.Sadly, I think that talent and film time was not used very well. There is next to zero character development or anything else that draws you into the plight of the protagonists. Sure, we're all against a homicidal maniac raiding a defenseless town in the old west. Justice must prevail! The villain is a truly despicable cur, but even his role as the principal antagonist is lost in the gunsmoke. Why is he doing this exactly? Oh, because he's a greedy scumbag. Got it.The background of ""the seven"" is equally vague. You wonder (because the film says nothing absolute) whether some of them are also brutal villains who are only doing right for the wrong reasons. They're not very likeable or understandable. You don't care if they perish or not. It's okay to have heroes with character flaws and even rogue heroes can appeal to an audience when their personal struggles are brought into the plot. However, this film doesn't touch on that much, and that's a shame. I'm sure the actors had developed character backgrounds leading to their performances, but the film doesn't capture that very well.The old west is a part of American history. Sure, it's filled with legends and exaggerations. I like that. They make great movies. However, I feel that they've totally thrown all historical accuracy through the barroom window here. They don't even have the right number of stars on the flag. The characters are speaking in modern lingo. The costumes, etc... So, no educational value here either. (big surprise)So, what you're left with is 2 hours of (mostly) humorless brutality and violence in which the heroes attempt to save the town (which seems to get totally wrecked in the process anyway).I think we'd have been better off if the film hadn't taken itself so seriously, had more humor, less (pointless or otherwise) violence, and/or a lot more character development and background. As it is, I feel like I'm watching a fps video game where there ought to be a ticker in the lower left hand corner for the body count with some cut-scenes thrown in. My opinion is (of course) subjective. Maybe others got more out of it than that.I don't often have the time to post a movie review, but I felt compelled to cast my vote here in favor of making fewer movies like this one.

Since the movie was on 1879, a it is hard to there no was governance in USA in the time when Lincoln was president. The movie was also missing romantic scenes.

So when I saw the fist names for the casting of the 2016 remake, I was excited! Think about it; Denzel Washington, ruthless in Equalizer; Ethan Hawke, Torn soul in Good Kill; Vincent D'Onofrio, Machiavellian in Dare Devil and ...that's all. What do you mean Chris Pratt? Oh! You mean that guy who Hollywood is trying to force feed us. Nah not memorable, even when he plays ""talk to the hand"" with raptors. One of the problem, there is no osmosis between the protagonist. Just consider in the 1960 movie the first meet between Yul Brynner and Steve McQueen, it is a very short scene at the beginning of the movie, you immediately feel the two connect, two pros respecting each other. Nothing to compare in the 2016 movie, When Denzel Washington cross path with Pratt, the scene is so long, like if they were trying to explain why a white guy had to work with a black guy, the relation with the two is a boss/employee relation as Washington's character own Pratt's character's horse hence the second had no choice then to follow the first one. But Why did they had to do that in the 2016 script? They suppose to be mercenaries,it is in the title, they do it for money and only find honor in death. This is the whole story behind Kurosawa's and Sturges's movie. But here those guys are already the nice guys from the beginning, then who cares about their stories, they won't and we won't learn anything from their journey. The others mercenaries are interesting too but we know little about them; Hawke who have lost his balls,but why? Lee Byung-hun who is following him like a dog, but why? D'Onofrio looking for redemption, but why again? and the two whom nobody remember what they did in the movie but they had to be seven so let put some extra for figuration in the casting. Too much exposure on 2 characters and barely enough light on the rest of the cast. This is frustrating Too bad, they miss an opportunity to use great actors at their pick potential. the movie is a stall dish, no spice, no surprise we already know who die and who won't in the first quarter.",The Magnificent Seven

The Magnificent Seven 2016 certainly provided excellent entertainment!Loved it! The plot was there:dormant heroes to be awoken and to bring about havoc!!!
I found everything finely orchestrated and one by one of the participants of the odyssey did get their own reason for being there:they were doing nothing and there was money and action involved...Now,Denzel was just being Denzel.Reliable.Perfect.Ethan Hawk borrowed Val Kilmer's excelent Doc Holliday from Tombstone!!!Imediately recognised...but it fit ok.The Asian guy was in every gesture minimal and coherent...and fast! Vincent D'onofrio!!! Love the actor in every act and he also borrowed from Maury Chaykin,the adorable nuts in For A Less Ordinary Life,1996...Fantastic performance then by the deceased actor and by D'Onofrio...The Mexican,maybe had little exposure,and then Chris Pratt-so charismatic!!!! and we have the red skin boy.All westerns had to have indians,cowboys,saloons,and...a thug.Now we have to recognize the impressively splendid performance of Peter Sarsgaard,the thug.I hadn't seen him for some time and I found him a little bit too thin and now I know he loves to run,but it suited very well to the role.We had a man looking always mad,and under the influence lets say,opium or laudanum,much used those days...and he uttered his sayings in modulating his voice...Bravo Peter Sarsgaard! But hey,he is not the most evil criminal in movies at all!!!but I liked his performance!!!
I have never seen Mr.Kurosawa's Seven Samurais,from whch this one is inspired,but I have to confess that back in the 60's,his favorite actor was Toshiro Mifune and I was afraid of that one! Westerns were great back then and I wonder if The Duke wouldn't fit in the Denzel's/Brynner's role...of course he would!

I went into the movie with the thought: this is gonna suck, but it will be mildly entertaining. That is to say, I did not set the bar high for Antoine Forqe's 'The Magnificent Seven.'

There was a lot of hype around this movie and I was excited, but also a bit nervous it wouldn't live up to all the hype. However, in my opinion, it exceeded my expectations. The writing, acting, pacing, cinematography, and look all contributed to what I found to be a very well done western movie. The simplicity of the plot didn't over complicate anything and allowed for all the previously mentioned elements to work really well together. I stayed on the edge of my seat and was drawn into the movie. It looked and felt like an authentic western movie. The gun fights felt powerful and the buildup to the end fight was great.

424,billsekerak,Crap with a Capitol C,1,6 October 2016,"By twisting the plot of the original film ,which itself was a Westernized version of Kurasowas Seven Samuria ,they ruined the movie.The idiots took a great morality play and turned it into nothing more than a politically correct statement. This is not entertainment , it's left wing propaganda.By changing the bad guy from a bandit leader preying on a helpless village into an evil businessman/ developer/ polluter trying to take advantage of a helpless middle class town they've hit on every liberal agenda except climate change and gun control.By including diversity with a cast that represents every race except the aboriginal Japanese Anui they even got that commandment in.I really don't mind that so much, in fact I love most of Denzel's work, but it was enough to make it the last straw.What's so disappointing is that the cast IS great but the fundamental changes ruined the film completely.What moron decided to make this about the evils of Capitalism I can only speculate that perhaps the producer was Michael Moore or that high priest of the environmental movement Leonardo Dicaprio or both ?",The Magnificent Seven

Chris Pratt and the others did an awesome job, and was a worthy modern take on the 1960s classic.I can't really say which version of M7 I liked better, but if you haven't seen this one, I highly recommend!!There is a great mixture of action, drama, suspense, and comedy when you least suspect it. The acting is superb from every person in this movie, from the big stars like Denzel, Pratt, Bomer, down to the no- name actors that fill out the cast. Directing and cinematography get an A as well!

426,kelel49,"In my opinion, it's MAGNIFICENT!",8,27 June 2019,"I'm no stranger to movies. Especially older movies. I love the original so much. And truthfully, when it comes to remakes, I honestly hate them. I usually find them completely pointless. Red Dawn, Clash of the Titans, Karate Kid, all classic movies with terrible remakes in my opinion. But not this movie! I was completely engaged from beginning to end! Though it had the same general storyline, the characters were all different and I felt like that was a smart move. They certainly did not refuse to give shoutouts to the original which was great!
First off the casting was spot on! All seven of the heroes were likable in their own way! Denzel Washington never disappoints. He was able to embrace his badass leader role, make it his own, while channeling a little of the late Yul Brynner. Chris Pratt gave us a touch of the late Steve McQueen, while also making the character his own with his typical comic relief. Ethan Hawke is always great and his reunion with Denzel since their Training Day film gave me a big smile! Vincent D'Onofrio gave another unique performance, Byung -Hun Lee brought in his storm shadow character to the old west which, to me, wasn't cheesy at all, it was very entertaining! Manuel Garcia Rulfo and Martin Sensmeier gave us the Mexican and Native Indigenous roles we don't see enough of in movies! I loved the diversity touch.
The villains were very good and hatable as they should be! There wasn't a love story we needed to worry about, just a lot of good action and a very simple story line!
Sometimes we need that! My only complaint was that it could have been longer! I would have loved to been given more back stories for each of the heroes. But for what it had to offer, I'd definitely say this movie was worth seeing! If you want entertainment, good gun battles, and a fun cast, this movie is for you! This movie isn't an Oscar nominee in any way but it's most definitely a good time and a fun ride from start to finish!",The Magnificent Seven

All the elements were in place, the good guys versus the bad and boy were the good guys ""good."" Based on the packed move theater and their cheers and laughter it was a hit with the general public.

In addition, the idea is that the revenge will receive extra points on moral accounts since the revengers represents all the American ethnicities plus a woman. For every dead villain we are supposed to salute. It becomes lots of it, because the villains are many. Not even Rambo could have killed more bad guys.This re-make is unusually bad.

432,mikael-popa,Too Much Politics,6,30 September 2016,"Antoine Fuqua is a good director but this time he seems more concerned about being politically correct. One African-American, one Mexican, one Asian and one Native American out of 7 ""Magnificent"". A lady in the main positive role. I would not have been surprised to see a whale in need to be saved. But I did see an embarrassing speech in the middle of the movie, blaming capitalism and religion for lost of real democracy. The movie is OK. Not as good as the 1960's original, far from Seven Samurai. Ironically, the movie is good mainly because of Denzel Washington who has been cast by Fuqua in order to express the Wild West ""diversity"". But Denzel is a great actor, he would have been a great actor with an orange or pink skin too. I can't say how much I regret cinematography being under siege of diversity, multiculturalism and other similar progressive movements. It should be a form of art. It is no longer. I've read user comments and some of them know nothing about Seven Samurai or 1960s Magnificent Seven, yet they are eager to discuss about racism, whitewash, diversity, feminism and everything except the movie itself.",The Magnificent Seven
433,kyleweis20,I love Westerns,10,9 December 2016,"Yet another remakebut the trailers for this one were at least encouraging, especially with Denzel Washington playing the lead.I have vague memories of seeing the original The Magnificent Seven, (which is in itself a re-imagining of Seven Samurai), and I seem to remember liking it. I think 56 years is long enough of a gap to justify a remake, so I'll give them a pass on this one (although you could argue that 1980's Battle Beyond the Stars was another Seven Samurai remake). So what was it like? Each character was steadily added to the team, they had a bonding/preparing the town montage, the bad guys showed up, they shot each other a lot, characters were killed, the film ended. Pretty much what I was expecting, and that's fine.Personally, I love Westerns (The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly is one of my favourite films ever), so for me this formula really worked. Is it going to win any awards? Probably not, but the performances were good (although it might be hard to argue that Chris Pratt was acting anything other than himself, which again, is fine), it looked good, and most importantly, I was entertained.",The Magnificent Seven

436,fliporican,Good Old Fashion Western,10,9 October 2016,Now I know today people become too critical about a film and watch the film looking for more than something simple. I am a great fan of those old spaghetti westerns and other westerns from the 50's and on; and I really loved this remake of a classic. I went to watch the movie just expecting some good vs. bad gun-fighting and western style shootout...and that was what I got. The selection of characters that make-up the 7 were a great choice by mixing up the group racial to somewhat comfort to the modern audience. Critics need to just go and watch a movie and enjoy it and stop being too analytical. What i liked the most was that each character was distinctly different and well played by the actors and I hope there are plans to bring them back in a sequel as their chemistry works.,The Magnificent Seven
437,pazfour,The Adequate Seven,6,6 October 2016,"The Magnificent 7In a genre marked by great westerns, I found The Magnificent 7 to be mediocre. I did my best to watch the movie with a fresh look unencumbered by the original. At times I even imagined the movie to have another title.For lovers of the original, you will find much that pays homage to it. Pay attention to the dialog and you will be rewarded.Many of the characters are the same or combined. There is the gambler, the coward, the artful master of guns and knives, the jokester, the fugitive, and the silent one. All very well done. There is of course the over the top wielding of guns, the pistol with endless ammunition, the Henry Repeating Rifle with no recoil, and a Gatling Gun that is accurate beyond 400 yards.What I found lacking was the ethos of each character. In the original, each one had their own motivation for joining. O'Reilly was broke, Britt was between cattle drives, Harry was looking for riches, and Lee was in hiding. However, as the film developed, each found some redemption within themselves that came from protecting the village. The rewards of their action went beyond $20 and a plate of beans and tortillas. In the new film the characters join up and defend the town, without experiencing any real reflection and growth from their actions. When facing what seemed to be certain death, the newer characters seemed content to only die amongst men like themselves, their service to the town all but forgotten. The movie lacked the higher calling the original had.While I was glad the makers refrained from using the theme by Elmer Bernstein till the closing credits, I was disappointed in the obvious lack of a stirring score. Westerns should be grand vistas accompanied by sweeping music. This film lacked both. The beauty of the settings often got lost as just background. Even use of sunrises and sunsets seemed flavorless. As difficult as this is for me to admit, I felt Denzel Washington was miscast. No doubt one of the finest actors we have today, I found his role as Sam Chisholm, the strong and silent leader to be ill fitting. His portrayal lacked the galvanizing passion needed to corral a group of men and lead a small town. I have always found Washington to better suited for roles of emotional intelligence. Here he was is was too cold and detached. I would have preferred his character from The Book of Eli.",The Magnificent Seven

The cast was terrible! Denzel was a poor choice for the leader of the pack, his acting was mediocre at best. No depth to the character at all. Chris Pratt really added nothing to the movie at all, except being a smart ass sidekick. All in All it was really poorly done,and I am soooo happy I only paid a buck to see this piece of garbage.

OK it's tosh but utterly brilliant tosh. The body count is extreme but there is no 21st century violence. The female lead is attractive but there is no 21st century token sex. It has clichés galore and even uses some of the same one liners from the Yul Bryner version but it doesn't matter because whatever it does it does very well, with just a little tongue in cheek and with a lot of gunfighter expertise.

I have to be honest, I know he is an amazing actor, but i didn't know how that was going to turn out but he played it rather well. This movie is full of action. My favorite line in this movie is when he was asked about how many men he had, his response was 2 the assumption was the girl and her partner who hired him for a job. but it was him and the person asking the question. This is funny but serious at the same time. You should definitely check out this movie. I would rate it an excellent movie. In addition, the scenes that took place in Arizona are priceless.

Even people who strongly favor multiculturalism (as I do) would be amused or offended at how childishly this idea is conveyed, through a cast that, although great actors, cannot save this horribly bland and typically-bombastic wanna-be-blockbuster movie: an African American leader, a Native American outcast, an Asian prodigy, a Mexican bandit, and three white guys one of which is a Confederate sharp-shooting legend, AND a woman leading the town's resistance.

445,augustvanderwerf,"Easy to nitpick about, but a fun film, and an overall enjoyable experience",7,17 March 2017,"The Magnificent Seven is one of those movies that is fun enough to get you to excuse its clichés. The film doesn't live up to its name, but that doesn't mean its not good. If there's anything magnificent about it, it's the performances of Denzel Washington and Chris Pratt, but Byung-Hun Lee is also fun as a knife-wielding badass, and it is cool to see Washington and Ethan Hawke reunited on screen under their Training Day director, who, along with DP Mauro Fiore, makes every gunshot count. While I liked how straightforward the script was, it didn't have many lines for some of its characters, which was the movie's biggest problem. One would think that a film called The Magnificent Seven would fully develop all Seven of its characters, but I couldn't appreciate Vincent D'Onofrio, Martin Sensmeier, or Manuel Garcia-Rulfo as much as I wanted to. The film sure takes its time getting to its climax, but when it gets there, it GETS THERE. Despite a tendency to remind us of the long running time, and some almost emotionless scenes involving the sidelined characters, the climax alone is worth the price of admission. Although some of its characters lack sufficient depth, The Magnificent Seven is still a fun movie with great performances, and is one of the more violent PG-13 movies in recent years.

452,n-46015,Magnificent 7? Truly a 7/7!,8,3 June 2019,"If you like guns, outlaws, and old westerns, Magnificent 7 is the movie for you!? This action packed film tells the story of seven talented men saving the town of Rose Creek from greedy Bartholomew Bogue. The seven men are forced to seek aid from fellow farmers and townspeople of Rose Creek to fend off the army Bogue creates. This film has audience members on the edge of their seats from brilliant acting, costumes, and shots.The director of the film is Antoine Fuqua. He has directed other films such as The Equaliser series and Training day. One can really tell that Antoine's favorite type of film is action. In fact, Antoine's film Training day won an Academy Award.One of the big overturns of Magnificent 7 is the immense amount of brilliant actors. I honestly don't know how Antoine scored to have Denzel Washington, Chris Pratt and Ethan Hawke all into one film. Although these actors are very well known and talented at their jobs, Magnificent 7 took their minor actors very seriously. Each minor character in the film is spot on with the old western accents and look. It truly puts the film over the edge.The costumes in the film are all authentic as well. This helps the audience to feel one with the film and put themselves in the character's shoes. Some people don't know the importance of costumes in film especially when it is placed in the 1800s. If the costumes were not authentic, this would distract the audience from the actual plot of the film. This reminds me of another film placed in the past who had very good costumes, Saving Private Ryan. This film, directed by the famous Steven Spielberg is placed in the time period of World War Two. Every soldier in that film had the wool green jackets and hard helmets just like a real soldier entering battle in the 1940s. This is exactly like Magicant 7. The actors were wearing cowboy hats, vests, and packing colts six shooters just like in the old west.The shots in Magnificent 7 are another thing to talk about. The final battle of the film was just about one fourth of the entire film and the shots were amazing. The low and high angle shots give a sense of power to the intense Mexican standoffs. One particular scene with amazing shots is the opening scene when Bogue is initially taking over Rose Creek. He storms into the chapel where the whole town is nervously waiting. The way the shots plays with close up shots gives the audience the true emotions of the townspeople.One thing that could be improved upon in the film is the overarching message. It was difficult for me to even distinguish it. The message fell along the lines of being courageous and standing up for yourself but put in context of the film it involved doing this while killing other people. This seemed contradictory and didn't make sense.In the end though, the actors, costumes and shots definitely outweighed the poor message of the film. The constant ups and downs of the action does not have you falling asleep while you watch it. I would highly recommend Magnificent 7 as it is definitely worth while watching.",The Magnificent Seven

It serves as a reasonable way to interest new viewers to look up those original movies. For that I thank them.However, this movie would have been entertaining and worth watching if it wasn't for the ridiculous Gatling gun.A magic gun in the final battle that: - only hits the enemy - can hit the ground at impossible angles based on the distance. - can hit parts of the town that aren't facing the gun. - can hit a bell tower on higher ground yet can't be hit by the two snipers in the tower.Additionally, the personal body guard of our villain would wonder into to the town during the reloading break of the magic gun. This immensely stupid act was done just so they can have an Indian on Indian melee battle.

Supposedly set in 1879, sadly you would have no idea what the average woman wore anywhere near that time by watching this movie. It is inconceivable that Haley Bennet's portrayal of a farmer's wife would be walking around exposing her décolletage. And don't get me started about the saloon girls! As a living historian in a remote Arizona town founded in the 1860s, I am routinely appalled at the ""shady ladies"" prancing around with their corsets exposed. A little (and I do mean little) research proves these styles incorrect.

469,ChetlovesMer,If you look for holes; you'll find them. But its really entertaining!,9,28 September 2016,"First off, I've seen both the original ""Seven Samurai"" and the Yule Brenner, Charles Bronson, Steve McQueen version about a hundred times; I love both of those movies. I thought this version was great. Is it the greatest movie of all time? Of course not. Is it a reflection of how movies are done today? Of course it is? There are unquestionably some holes in the story. People point to the Gatling Gun scene as totally over the top. And, Yes. It is over the top. The Gatling Gun, however, was a huge leap forward in firearm technology and if the movie makers were prone to a little exaggeration, I'm okay with that. My guess is any late 1800's cowboy who came up against a Gatling Gun and survived would probably also heavily exaggerate the story when telling it. The other issue I keep hearing is that some of the seven join up for almost no reason. They just ""join up"". Okay, again, true. But I challenge you to watch the 1960's version again. If you are truly honest with that film at least 3 members of that seven join up because they have ""nothing better to do"". I actually think the idea of a bounty hunter rounding up guys who have a bounty on them kinda makes sense. Both the town and the team are way more culturally diverse than ever would have happened in the late 1800's. But did you really think Hollywood could make a movie in which all the bad guys are Mexicans and all the heroes are white guys like in the 1960's version? (Okay Charles Bronson's character was HALF-Mexican.) This version is very entertaining. It's a fun escape. It's an action movie which isn't another damned superhero movie. The female lead is phenomenal. Denzel is Denzel-ishly great. Chris Pratt is both entertaining and a solid second-in-command. The other characters fill in the blanks nicely. The strangely culturally diverse town participates in their own salvation. The action scenes are well done, if not completely realistic. It's a re-imagined version that pays tribute in many places to both the original and the 1960's remake. Go see the movie and have fun like I did. And if you are one of those people that needs complete realism. Then sit at home and think about how boring complete realism would be.",The Magnificent Seven

479,iraguisan,"""We're simple farmers, decent hard-working people""",1,20 July 2019,"One of the main questions raised by the making of a western today is how to bring forward yesterday's value systems into our times. Fuqua's update of the 1960 Magnificent Seven replaces the confused ethnic politics of John Sturges's film with an unimpeachable anti-racist message: where the post-war version made the plot hinge on a betrayal by unreliable Mexican peasants who are nevertheless rescued by self-sacrificing WASPs (a tacked-on theme with no parallel in the Kurosawa original), the new model takes pains to introduce a heroic black cowboy as 1) the target of ignorant prejudice, and 2) a better gunslinger than anybody else. This virtue-signaling may sadly still be useful today, but the point has already been made with more imagination, from Blazing Saddles (Mel Brookes, 1974) to Posse (Mario van Peebles, 1993). An Asian-American, a Hispanic and a Native American are addeed to the mix, and a Woman is also allowed to join the band (although she's put back in her place once the battle is over), so the bases are pretty well covered... On the other hand, our heroes also include a Confederate (great pals with the black team-leader!), while the bad guys also have an Indian (named ""Denali"", how's that for a Trump-worthy ethnic put-down?), so ideologically speaking we're in pretty messed-up territory.This 21st-century variation on the theme does its best to please liberals by making the villain a union-busting capitalist, and conservatives by making him a godless blasphemer. The murders and sacrilege he instigates for no discernible reason before the credits clearly establish him as a bad guy, but the socio-economic gibberish that is thrown at us seems intended mainly to give some faint shadow of meaning to the festival of random violence to come. The core message is pure traditional Western: real men are better killers, and do cool things like spin their pistols or eject spent cartridges with a pensive squint. Frequent appearances of the cross remind us whose side God is on, however, so we can enjoy the mayhem with a clear conscience.",The Magnificent Seven

This was a good old fashioned western where the bad guy was truly evil and the good guys were real stand up guys. I don't remember enjoying a western so much since 2003's Open Range.Denzel just gets better and better as an actor. Is there any role that he would not excel in? I am also becoming a fan of Chris Pratt. This is the 3rd film of his I have seen, that I thought he was very good in (the others being Guardians of the Galaxy and Jurassic World).

481,qweexdraw57,The Malignant Seven,4,18 March 2017,"If you're a baby boomer odds are you cut your teeth on the western.

Stars like John Wayne, Randy Scott, Joel McCrea, Jimmy Stewart, Hank Fonda, Roy Rogers, Gene Autry, Audy Murphy, James Arness, Chuck Connors, Ward Bond, Glenn Ford, Kirk Douglas, Burt Lancaster, Gary Cooper, Gregory Peck, Richard Widmark and many others, personified the cowboy, gunslinger, marshall, sheriff and bad man. But sadly, the late 60's ended the American romance with the western, save for a few gems here and there. And no director or actor has risen to the level of a ""Tombstone"" or ""Unforgiven"", since the early 90's. The movie generation of today want CG and graphic violence and sex. The traditional western was never over the top. Occasionally the lines were blurred, but there really was a simple message of good versus evil.

482,simada46,The Magnificent Seven reminds us all why we love Westerns.,9,30 September 2016,"The Magnificent Seven, a remake of the classic American Western of 1960, itself an interpretation of the Japanese film Seven Samurai, may not climb to receive the adjective of ""magnificent"" in many beholders' eyes, but I for one appreciate the film entirely. Of course, no good Western or film in general is without its flaws, and certainly this film has its share. But I say with certainty that the latest film to come out of the great director Antoine Fuqua's sleeve is a ""magnificent"" draw that illuminates why the Western, a genre truly created out of the Romantic era of thought, has drawn America's attention and inspired so many, and kept on chugging. While the genre has declined in popularity, the outstanding cast in The Magnificent Seven is one indication of why this genre is seen as important to the history of film. Not only was the lineup cast so well and did its job of bringing attention to the film, but the performances were wonderful and rich with that kind of subtle Western humor and individuality. The film is occasionally, funny, but the humor is included well enough that we do not and should not expect a joke at every turn or shot. Also, each character approached the conflict in their own way, some hesitant, some desperate, some afraid, and it is certain that no side is aware of the full outcome of the resolution. And truly, the film is a story completely devoted to a portrayal of different characters. Yes, the film is heavy on action, but the conflict is straightforward. It is not muddied by petty issues, which allows times and places for character development in all of them. While in these respects the film truly does wonderfully, I am not so sure why many people expected some kind of game-changing film. It is a remake, a relatively formulaic film like the original. And yet, while a remake, it also certainly has its flare of diversity only recently seen, especially in Westerns and other action-genre films. That is where the true value of the film shines. It is an indication that not only is the Western alive and well, but it is becoming more inclusive for actors of all ethnicities and races. That speaks as much to audiences as it does to actors, perhaps even more so. And it is important to see that. It shows that the genre is maturing in some respect. The visual, audio and other camera/editing technicalities have been established and mastered throughout the course of 20th into 21st century filmmaking, and some are still being invented, but the acting and level of talent and inclusion certainly has been raised. I am simply very happy to see some appropriate involvement from all parties. It is respectful as it is exciting, and really that is a driving force behind why this film is great. Another factor is that each of the characters are remarkably mortal. As of recently, the Western hero, heroes and heroines, have become true human beings, and that is great to see. We have lessened our grasp on the outright bullet-dodging, Hand-of-God fiction, but still hold on to the fun characters that define the genre. The humorous wordplay and the lip-biting dialogue, the roaring action and coordination, the characters' mortality, the cinematography, the sound effects, the soundtrack (which by the way all the respect goes to James Horner (his last soundtrack) and Simon Franglen), the cast, the direction, and the material all have come together to form a lovely, entertaining film.",The Magnificent Seven

And the bad guy? Calvera was a real character, a leader, Bartholomew Bogue is nothing more than a butcher with money enough to paying gunmen. In addition, the original films raise the issue of confronting two completely different ways of life, the peasants, who live off the land and with the land and bandits and gunmen, living free of ties but also without roots and without hope.

485,jpuderk-07043,A solid action yarn trying to be a Western,7,26 September 2016,"The movie works on many levels. It follows the basic story set forth in both ""Seven Samurai"" and ""The Magnificent Seven"". Much like ""Seven Samurai"" was Toshiro Mifune's movie, and ""Magnificent Seven"" was Yul Brynner's, this was Denzel's. The plot is pretty straight forward. Corrupt miner with lots of money wants to buy out a small Texas town's land rights so he can mine the land for gold. As he begins to exert his will on the town, one of the town's residents stands up to him, and when his friend intervenes, there's violence and both the men (and several other townsfolk) end up dead. The man's widow decides to go hire some guns to put an end to the man's greedy plot. She meets Denzel in a town not far (About 3 days ride) from Rose Creek (the contested town) and offers him the job. At first, Denzel declines, insisting he has more pressing matters to attend to, such as collecting the bounty on a Mexican outlaw. However, she eventually convinces him to take the job, and he goes about recruiting some extra help. The resulting band of 6 men set out for Rose Creek, but are being tracked by a Comanche, who is spotted by Vincent D'Onofrio's character, and is asked by Denzel to join the group. Now 7, they ride to the aid of Rose Creek. The story is as old as time, a small band of mercenaries with nothing to fight for find themselves drawn into defending the little town from the wrath of the main baddie, capably played by Peter Sarsgaard. We learn a little bit about each of the characters, then the big showdown comes. Antoine Fuqua does a nice job with the action pieces, and they move pretty briskly without being too hard to follow. I don't want to spoil anything so I won't go any further. The actors are all pretty good, if not great, but this is Denzel's movie, and he carries it very well.

The plot, worn and tired from its countless rehashing, is typical Hollywood, modern-western fare. Add to that its blatant incredibility and you have a movie so far-fetched it makes Star Wars look like a documentary.First, it was odd to hear the use of a psychological term which only came into existence in the 1980s, i.e. one of them mentions that the group is ""bonding.""It's not enough to buy into the fantasy that black cowboys (dressed all in black) roamed the west looking for whites to kill, but one must also believe they were ace gunslinger bounty hunters, paid rather than hung. There is lots of action, but nothing believable. There seems to be a penchant in Hollywood for black cowboy heroes these days. Could it be that Hollywood believes in authenticity? Nah... just good marketing.Ah, to be young and ignorant enough to suspend disbelief. But, one cannot unlearn things once known.

Initially I thought it would be a Django, True Grit, hateful 8 mixture. However I was wrong. This is fine in most cases. Not in this one however. The acting in this movie is of course with such a cast not the problem. However the things they say no matter how good of an actor you are really add up to nothing. The story line is so predictable it becomes almost funny, but stops halfway as this was not the intention. The whole movie I spent more time trying to like it than anything else. It was like looking at a Fiat Multipla for two hours and trying to convince myself it does not look that bad. If you have ever seen a Multipla you would understand that no matter how long you look you will not fool yourself. Conclusion: If you are at home and have nothing better to watch then maybe just maybe you should watch some tell-sell for two hours.

490,strunt_samma,Good remake *spoiler*,7,28 December 2016,"*spoilers ahead* Good movie, with all the sentiment of previous incarnations (including three amigos). I just wrote this review because of the vast overstatement of the Gatling gun in the movie. Its made out to be a sniper-mini-gun since they fire it from approx 500m with 0,2dm spacing, through buildings I might add, which, using only the standard mag and no sights is if nothing less than ridiculous. Since it payed such a significant role in the movie it bugged me to an incredible degree but I recognize the fact that it might have been needed as a ""twist"". Chris Pratt did an excellent role in this movie, I've seemed to underestimated his acting skills. If you're not bugged by the same stuff I do you might give it a higher score on this movie and if such do enjoy.",The Magnificent Seven
491,bluekroc,Can't go less than 1,1,3 April 2018,"I never leave reviews, but I'm leaving this one with the wish that I could somehow send it back to my past self to try and save the two hours that was just wasted on this completely vacuous movie. 
Nothing happened. 
We got from A to B sure, but it was entirely banal. How do we spend two hours with this film and develop zero relationship with any of the characters? Any at all? That's includes main characters, villain, villagers that need saving, village, setting, none of it, we care about none of it because nothing meaningful or well-developed occurs by way of plot, dialogue, character development, or directing. This was so pointless. To say that the characters are cliched actually gives the writing and the direction way too much credit, a good cliche can be fun. These characters were too thin and poorly constructed to even fully become cliches. Seriously how was two hours so poorly spent? 
Some have said Denzel was the only good thing here and to be frank he wasn't, it's just always nice to see Denzel. He wasn't bad, none the actors were bad, there was just so little substance to the script, that none of them could be good. 
I didn't even have high hopes for this thing, yet still felt my time got truly wasted by whichever numbskulls wrote, financed and directed this film. Seriously if you want at all to enjoy good characters, and good plot, even a tiny bit, then go watch something else.

492,klomas98,Nothing like the Original so don't expect that.,3,23 September 2016,"Denzel and Pratt were weak at best. Vincent D'Onofrio was the only actor who put skills into his portrayal. The story is predictable in every scene. Just another bad acting Hollywood train wreck. It really is pointless. If they had spent more time developing the 7 and showed some feeling... they could have made a 6 /10 movie. It is so predictable that you can guess which window people are going to get thrown out of before it happens. Haley Bennett was a weak, crying, and timid wife at the beginning... by the end of the movie she was killing people all over the place... not realistic. They spent $90.000.00 on this crap??????? I usually enjoy Denzel.... but he who wont win any hardware at the Oscars. The role was there, just not the acting. As the credits role they play the original theme song...

The ""real"" Magnificent Seven is a movie classic. Denzel Washington is an excellent actor; and, Ethan Hawke is pretty dog-gone good, too. If you're expecting the remake of a movie classic with several of today's finest actors is going to be a great entertainment adventure ... you're going to be very, very disappointed. I did and I was! The special effects and Haley Bennett's low cut wardrobe carried the bulk of the entertainment cache for this film. The story line lacks rhyme or reason. In the 1960 version the bad guys were using the peaceful little village as a rest stop and to steal food from the villagers ... while evil and wrong this, at least, makes sense. In this movie the antics of the bad guy lack any understanding or logic.",The Magnificent Seven

The world is starving for good westerns. It's obvious that the people with money in Hollywood aren't willing to risk a poor return in the era of the Superhero Blockbuster that we've been in since 2008-ish. How do you make a remake, respectful to the original, without being a carbon copy? This is how.This is a popcorn movie. Plain and simple. Anyone born before 1970 is almost guaranteed not to like it. Anyone who knows the name Akira Kurosawa is almost guaranteed not to like it. If you refer to movies as ""films""....100% guaranteed to not like it.In short love, hate or whatever this movies based on its strengths or flaws. The Gatling gun is ridiculous but most of the other complaints are unwarranted. These are from people that are going to complain about anything.",The Magnificent Seven

It was nice to see a western again after such a long time. I could not remember the last time I watched a western. It's been too long.It had nice action scenes, some decent acting from Denzel Washington (and gang) and an overall coherent plot.Negatives: no romance, no sexy female lead, the town folks seemed really one-dimensional (generally losers, except for the non-sexy female lead), no really memorable scene unlike Unforgiven (where the whore was raped), for example.",The Magnificent Seven

As with most westerns, the scenery generally always does this type of movie justice, lack of a better term. Here, it is remarkable.There are a lot of strong performances, pretty much from everyone. But, I strongly believe Vincent D'Onofrio as Jack Horne deserves the Oscar for best supporting actor, although it should be for lead actor. Also, Chris Pratt as Josh Faraday, at times, reminded me of a young Clint Eastwood.One last thing, this western is a must see on the wide screen, especially in IMAX. Don't wait till DVD or NETFLIX. Renting it would be a waste of money.",The Magnificent Seven
498,tonybear_dotcom,Exactly what I expected,9,25 September 2016,"My expectations: action, smart dialogue, interesting characters. That's exactly what I got! The Magnificent Seven was a great popcorn churner of a movie! And, a box office winner! The Magnificent Seven made an estimated $35 million in its opening weekend, coming in at number one.Three things made the first generation of The Magnificent Seven a classic: the casting, the genre, and the way the story was told. Now, the production values of the original seem trite. And, it was sequel-ed to death. The 1998-2000 TV version was forgettable. The 2016 movie production could have gone a little more 'big-ticket' on the casting, but it stays true to the genre. The story is different- enough so it's not shackled to the original. The Denzel Washington/Antoine Fuqua version is perfect for today's movie goer. Action-packed. Fast- moving story lines. Clever dialogue. Just enough character development to give the basis for the tension between the individuals. This helps us appreciate how they grew to respect each other.If you are bound by the traditional, White-centric history of the Wild West fed to us forever, the casting might seem too ""politically correct."" In reality, the west was much more diverse than we've been led to believe. This movie has many refreshing, plausible nods to that variety. There are just enough Hollywood stereotypes in The Magnificent Seven to make the setting familiar to fans of westerns, without making the movie dependent upon stereotypes. I appreciated how the dialogue avoided getting bogged-down in racial slurs, and how the action stopped short of being gruesome.The connection between Denzel's and Ethan Hawke's characters could have been explored a lot more. How did a former Confederate soldier and a former slave become such close friends? What was at the root of the soldier's state of mind? Maybe that will come later, in the director's cut.The acting in The Magnificent Seven may be passed-over for the mainstream awards. However, an Image Award for Denzel is a lock! If you just sit back and enjoy a great shoot-em-up, at the end of the movie you will be satisfied! This is one worth watching again, and even owning -- especially if you have a Denzel collection like mine!",The Magnificent Seven
499,akoutsouridis,The Remake of a remake,7,25 September 2016,"First of all: I'm a huge fan of ""Seven Samurai"". Likewise I wasn't all that impressed by 1960's ""The Magnificent Seven"", which of course was based upon Akira Kurosawas masterpiece. Yet, the cast was enjoyable even though the story has not really been altered and did not live up to the original.Now 56 years later comes another remake with Denzel Washington and Chris Pratt as leading actors. Was this second remake necessary? No, it definitely wasn't, but it was still fun to watch. Denzel delivered a decent but not outstanding performance as did the rest of the cast. This is one these kinds of remakes which doesn't really try anything new or spectacular and I'm glad they didn't. The cast itself is already very colorful and rich. We have a black lieutenant/northerner (Denzel Washington), a cowboy head hunter (Chris Pratt), a former sniper/Southerner (Ethan Hawke), a religious ""bear in human costume"" (Vincent D'Onofrio), a Mexican criminal (Manuel Garcia-Rulfo), an Asian wild card (Byung-hun Lee) and a banished Comanche (Martin Sensmeier). A very diverse cast which fits more into our modern world than into a western movie. I highly doubt that all these ethnical groups would have ever worked together for a greater purpose during the 19th century, but regardless everyone did a good job at delivering their role. The villain (Peter Sarsgaard) seemed pretty shallow and didn't really feel all that intimidating, aside from having an army of mercenaries at his disposal (who for some strange reason seem to value fighting for Bogue more than a mercenary should, how much did he pay them?).Anyways the story is pretty self-explanatory: A band of seven misfits is hired by simple farmers to help them protect their village which is terrorized by an army of merciless mercenaries.Nothing more to say to this movie actually. It wasn't really all that memorable, not even the music score or the effects (god bless the lack of cgi). And the story was also not altered from the original, which is good but makes this movie somehow obsolete. I did enjoy some humorous and witty dialogue between the seven, but that didn't really leave an impression.Would I recommend this movie? Only if you're a fan of western movies and haven't seen the 1960's version. Otherwise you don't really HAVE to see it. It's enjoyable but not memorable.SPOILERS AHEAD: While Faraday's death scene was a little unexpected I thought it felt somewhat off, editing-wise. There was the explosion of the gatlin gun and we didn't even see a corpse like we saw of Goodnight, Billy and John at the end and for some reason until I saw the four crosses at the last movie shot I thought that Faraday might even be alive(I thought he maybe used a bullet proof vest or some sort). His death felt really underwhelming and that's not a good sign.",The Magnificent Seven

The story was great. I was entertained the whole time. It is very action packed and after seeing so many of these types of movies the story lines can get stale. The acting and filmography kept this entertaining and kept me involved in the story from begging to end. I liked it so much I watched the original as soon as I got home.

The story is strong as well as the action scenes. No spoiler here just go and enjoy this to the fullest. I never expected to be this well entertained. Do not wait to buy the not yet available video, this is a definite popcorn and soda night. Well defined roles in the movie show the talent of the writers, director and creator of this art form, the cinematographers were dead on the mark of capturing the action. every element of life is represented here and the ending is is as good as the beginning!

If you are the type of person who likes to go to the cinema and pay to see a Sunday teatime movie, this movie is for you. If you're not, you might as well wait until it appears on your TV screen for free. A decent enough movie for TV on a rainy day. If you go and pay to see this film, you might feel that you've been robbed by the Jesse James gang!

If I look this movie as just a movie (without consider it as a remake of something else), Magnificent Seven is a good cowboy movie.I love Denzel's acting in this movie. His character is so strong. Ethan Hawke has the right face and attitude to become Goodnight. Great casts!Chris Pratt is superb too. He brings the cheerful ambiance into this movie. His lines and jokes fit him well.Well, one character that's not built right is Red Harvest. He lack of background story, make his character felt blunt, no attachment with the others or with audiences.But overall, this is a very good movie. It brings me smile, and excitement.

504,janneparri,Everything I expected,7,1 October 2016,"The Magnificent Seven offered exactly what we expected. The remake of 1960 appeared movie together with Denzel Washington is a safe choice Westerns. Nothing too light, and nothing too serious.I haven't seen the earlier versions of the movie, and perhaps rightly so. Classic remakes are always putting pressures and prejudices. Now I got to experience the entertaining action movie, which followed a familiar pattern for westerns. Seven kinds of western hero end up together and take on to defend the innocent little town from a rich barony. There is a bloody battle ahead of them and all of them won't see another day. Denzel was perhaps the reason I agreed to watch this movie. His performance was convincing and created the base for the film. Chris Pratt's character Josh Faraday was witty and a bit of the bibulous character. He brought an appropriate amount of humor in to the movie. Other well-known actors were Ethan Hawke and Vincent D'Onofrio. They did their part.The atmosphere in the movie was beyond good and it wasn't just about revenge. Different people joined forces and fought together in favor of the weaker. From time to time the tension was loaded very in a traditional for the westerns. A great number of shots and explosions then triggered the tension. Weapons swished and men fell in an appropriate unrealistic pace.Despite the great actors and good atmosphere, the film did not exceed expectations. It reached them and stayed on the line. Again, this is a lot, and I feel it's enough for many of those movie moments. It does not have to be the best, but I wish all movies were at least so good.",The Magnificent Seven

Wish they would have use Denzel's name as Chris, that's the name in all the Mag 7 movies, why change now??

506,luckyirishfightclub,Seven Samurai,1,18 October 2016,"No spoilers.This is another questionable remake of the two unforgettable movie inspirations: the Seven Samurai and the first Mag7. The director attempted a political maneuver with his personal bias. The movie targets the southern US people as an enemy during a time of police shootings (involving patrol officers of multiple races), hate crimes by true southern lunatics, and anti-immigrant sentiment (mostly Hispanic) rhetoric. I live on a family farm lasting five generations. My great grandfather was murdered by a mentally ill black man. Don't think I haven't heard racist speech. But, I joined a predominantly African American cathedral to break the bond. The movie reviews reflected the plot really did not work. I believe the expected gross dollars will be reached. So, congratulations! In my opinion, a good plot was forsaken because of director bias and the desperate fight to get a diverse directorial staff on stage at awards night. The movie's undertones have the potential side effect to further divide our troubled nation. In a month, our nation will be polarized by the craziest election since Roosevelt split his own party. Either direction we go will provoke a great divide. Both sides are buying AR15's at record numbers. Let's use our creative talents and art to unify ourselves.

It is a classic example of how NOT to do a remake.Sadly, the acting was second rate, the editing was amateurish and the continuity was stilted.What the producers ended up with was a cross between 'The Good, The Bad and The Ugly' and 'Blazing Saddles'.

It's like pretending catholic Germans were the people killed in the Nazi concentration camps and not Jews. A Mexican and an Indian fighting for the defenseless, peaceful people who were been thrown out of their valley is so cynical, that I don't really know if they do it as an insult or they really think that could have happened, as well as the Indian thug robbing land from the rightful owners- who arrived only a few years before and didn't buy the land from the Mexicans or the Indians, of course that goes unmentioned.

Plus 10 for Elmer and minus 10 to whomever did not use the theme until the credits were running. Did some college kid make this decision. While the actors did a credible job, none of their characters were developed. Somehow a Comanche in the old west was just as stupid as a black man leading this group.

Overall, the acting left much to be desired (although a lot of that was due to a poor script), and the speech/vocab was way too modern for the post-civil war era.I'm sure some could say similar things about the 1960 classic, but the legendary coolness of Yul Brynner, Steve McQueen, Charles Bronson, and James Coburn MORE than make up for it.",The Magnificent Seven

I think that's important to point out as we had somewhat different thoughts about the flick.The movie was enjoyable as my rating states. However I must say that it's hard to point out anything good about it. The plot is straight up one of the worst revenge stories and full of ridiculous clichés. There's no character development nor are there really any interesting or unique characters. All the common western clichés are used and there's really nothing unexpected about the plot.Yet I somehow managed enjoy this film. The action is good and humor is opportune. It just feels like a good western. The plot is crap, but then again the original one wasn't a masterpiece of storytelling either.

But that's about it. The whole story can be said in 5 minutes. During the movie you see repeated failed attempts to build the characters - and add a human flavor to the film - all failed. I didn't identify with any of the seven, I didn't like any. They all shot, spit, made stupid racial jokes and were archetypical.If you want a stupid action movie to watch when making a dinner - go for it.

You would have a drifter traveling from town to town battling his demands within and trying to find his meaning in the world. After some time he comes to a town desperately in need of a hero who will set them free from some land hungry barron stealing and killing to get whatever he desires. After seeing the injustice being done to innocent people the soon to be hero has compassion and takes it upon him self to stand up for those unable to do so for themselves. In the process of taking on the impossible and succeeding with all odds against him the hero finds a piece of himself and learns to who he is and his purpose in life.",The Magnificent Seven
524,stanleyhoffmann,The original is a classic this one is terrible,1,2 April 2017,"When you compare this to the original, you wonder why they even tried... They would have been better off doing something original themselves. This effort lack in every category even with the script already written for it.I would say without any hesitation skip this poorly executed movie and watch the original instead, you will thank me for it later!",The Magnificent Seven

526,noirsilk,Brotherhood as it should be,7,25 September 2016,"Spoiler alert! They hit upon every people type race, creed, color & 7 are the Magnificent 7. I would like to give a shout to the Casting Directors. It was the Westerns I grew up with from Bat Masterson, Rifleman, i.e. Old School. I loved the flow of the movie I loved how they came up with a plan, the way they all had different personalities and just 1 goal, to help, a damsel who sure as hell was not in distress! I loved the scenery so like the Westerns I 1'st saw only in B&W. The Actors were perfect they held onto their characters. Fun thing is now I know where Mel Brooks got his idea for the Paygate in Blazing Saddles another Best Western in my book movie. Anyway I loved the movie all the way to the end. Yeap going to add to my video library.",The Magnificent Seven
527,papapatpatterson,The first part showed great promise; the last part was a disappointment,2,22 September 2017,"I wanted to watch this movie as soon as I heard it was going to be released in the theaters. Very disappointing. First, the good: Denzel Washington is very appropriately scary and compelling. He makes the 'do it because it needs doing' set-up ALMOST work. His character is allowed a little bit of depth, in that he knows who the guys are that he wants, and gets them. Chris Platt has the best role because he has the best lines, and carries it off so very, very well. His actions during the bar scene, in shutting down the bad guys who would interfere with Denzel, give his character depth, which is furthered by his card tricks, two GREAT scenes talking about his guns, and the leprechaun scene is just brilliant. If ONLY the last part of the film had been as good as the first part! I say it again: Platt has great lines: ""You will be murdered by the world's greatest lover."" Vincent D'Onofrio doesn't have as many good lines as Washington and Platt, but he still manages to play a wonderful character. Even in his death scene, I pulled for the guy, because he was such a diamond in the rough. I don't know the actor who played Billy Rocks, but he had some good scenes to work with. His care for Ethan Hawke's character showed as being a real thing, and the scene where he was trying to teach the townsmen how to knife fight was excellent, both in his fighting ability and his frustration. The not-good: nobody else had ANYTHING to work with. Ethan Hawke's character perhaps had a LITTLE, but not enough for him to do anything with. He intimidates a drunken cowboy with his reputation, has a decent scene while getting a shave, hints at nightmares, and that's it. I didn't care if he came back for the fight or not. The other characters had zip to work with, although the actors playing Red Harvest and Vasquez did what they could, there just wasn't anything there. The BAD, awful, horrid: Leading off with a political rant about capitalism? In a WESTERN? Are you CRAZY? Who does that? Bad, bad move, because it is so artificial and contrived; takes you right out of the mood. And the bad guy has no justification whatsoever for wanting to take the town over.Second, and perhaps even worse than lead-off scene, because it is done to a hero, and not a villain: Haley Bennett, playing widowed Emma Cullen, shows up to recruit Denzel Washington, DAYS after her beloved husband is shot, with her DRESS pulled off of her shoulders! That would NEVER have happened, it is fraudulent, needless exploitation of her sexuality, and it doesn't even contribute to the development of the plot! If you look at the costumes worn by the other women in the film, you will see that only the hookers are wearing revealing clothing; the other FARMERS' WIVES and company are dressed in period appropriate clothing. True, it is only in the scene where she meets Denzel that she has her shoulders exposed, but it's a BIG violation. It actually made me wonder whether she had immediately turned to prostitution, or was trying a Honey Trap on Denzel, but if so, that wasn't revealed in the rest of the story line. It was a BAD decision, and I hope to find that someone else raises it as an issue. Third, Denzel Washington's character had a STRONG backstory tie in with the villain, Brogue, and that is never even HINTED at until the very end; at that point, it's wasted. There is no hint of his motivation for taking the contract earlier, and thus no suspense. Either give us a clue that something's going on (along the lines of ""she would be your sister's age,"" but tied into the plot) or leave it out. It's just pasted on the end with chewed pink bubble gum, and has less flavor. Conclusion: Someone else mentioned that the final shoot-out took twenty minutes. That really was excessive; cut it down to five minutes, and give the other fifteen to character development, and the film becomes a valid 'Magnificent 7'. I do have great fondness for the previous works; I actually own a copy of 'The Seven Samurai' on DVD. However, I don't think that the comparison with the originals were the ONLY reasons I downrated the movie.",The Magnificent Seven

It made my tasting buds very happy.",The Magnificent Seven
529,saintjorge,A somewhat decent western riddled in cliches.,6,12 January 2019,"I can see where this would have been a great movie back in 1976. Literally every scene is like a bit of a parody of an old Clint Eastwood western. It tries very hard to be a new classic but ultimately falls way short. I was never really attached to any of the characters and honestly I wasn't sure if it was supposed to be a comedy the first 30 minutes of the film. With all those negatives out of the way, I can say that if you have nothing better to do and you can watch it for free on Amazon or Netflix, it's worth the money. The action and set peices are good enough to keep you entertained, just don't expect greatness. Also, I have to say that with the caliber of actors that they got, I'm pretty disappointed overall. Sorry if I sound too negative, I'm just being honest.",The Magnificent Seven
530,leeroy-78564,Shockingly bad.,1,4 February 2019,"As a Denzil Washington fan, I was desparately disappointed in this movie. In the original, we had compassion and identification with all the characters, and missed them as they disappeared.. Whereas in this...???? I just didn't care about any of them. Remakes should be better. Unfortunately, the original M7 cannot be improved upon.",The Magnificent Seven
531,theheathskent,Not a patch on the original,3,6 February 2019,"If you have seen the original then don't bother with this. The characters are weak, the storyline is weaker. Even the music lacks the power of the original. If you haven't seen the original then watch it and see what you missed..",The Magnificent Seven
